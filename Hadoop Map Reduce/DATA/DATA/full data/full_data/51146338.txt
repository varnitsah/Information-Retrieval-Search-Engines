chapter i   nonnezoshe  john wetherill one of the famous wetherill brothers and trader at kayenta arizona is the man who discovered nonnezoshe which is probably the most beautiful and wonderful natural phenomenon in the world wetherill owes the credit to his wife who through her influence with the indians finally after years succeeded in getting the secret of the great bridge  after three trips to marsh pass and kayenta with my old guide al doyle of flagstaff i finally succeeded in getting wetherill to take me in to nonnezoshe this was in the spring of 1913 and my party was the second one not scientific to make the trip later this same year wetherill took in the roosevelt party and after that the kolb brothers it is a safe thing to say that this trip is one of the most beautiful in the west it is a hard one and not for everybody there is no guide except wetherill who knows how to get there and after doyle and i came out we admitted that we would not care to try to return over our back trail we doubted if we could find the way this is the only place i have ever visited which i am not sure i could find again alone  my trip to nonnezoshe gave me the opportunity to see also monument valley and the mysterious and labyrinthine canyon segi with its great prehistoric cliffdwellings  the desert beyond kayenta spread out impressively bare red flats and plains of sage leading to the rugged vividlycolored and windsculptured sandstone heights typical of the painted desert of arizona laguna creek at that season became flooded after every thunderstorm and it was a treacherous redmired quicksand where i convinced myself we would have stuck forever had it not been for wetherills navajos  we rode all day for the most part closed in by ridges and bluffs so that no extended view was possible it was hot too and the sand blew and the dust rose travel in northern arizona is never easy and this grew harder and steeper there was one long slope of heavy sand that i made sure would prove too much for wetherills pack mules but they surmounted it apparently less breathless than i was toward sunset a storm gathered ahead of us to the north with a promise of cooling and sultry air  at length we turned into a long canyon with straight rugged red walls and a sandy floor with quite a perceptible ascent it appeared endless far ahead i could see the black stormclouds and by and bye began to hear the rumble of thunder darkness had overtaken us by the time we had reached the head of this canyon and my first sight of monument valley came with a dazzling flash of lightning it revealed a vast valley a strange world of colossal shafts and buttes of rock magnificently sculptored standing isolated and aloof dark weird lonely when the sheet lightning flared across the sky showing the monuments silhouetted black against that strange horizon the effect was marvelously beautiful i watched until the storm died away  illustration z g after two months in the wilds  dawn with the desert sunrise changed monument valley bereft it of its night gloom and weird shadow and showed it in another aspect of beauty it was hard for me to realize that those monuments were not the works of man the great valley must once have been a plateau of red rock from which the softer strata had eroded leaving the gentle leaguelong slopes marked here and there by upstanding pillars and columns of singular shape and beauty i rode down the sweetscented sageslopes under the shadow of the lofty mittens and around and across the valley and back again to the height of land and when i had completed the ride a story had woven itself into my mind and the spot where i stood was to be the place where lin slone taught lucy bostil to ride the great stallion wildfire  illustration there was something beyond the whitepeaked ranges  two days ride took us across country to the segi with this wonderful canyon i was familiar that is as familiar as several visits could make a man with such a bewildering place in fact i had named it deception pass the segi had innumerable branches all more or less the same size and sometimes it was difficult to tell the main canyon from one of its tributaries the walls were rugged and crumbling of a red or yellow hue upward of a thousand feet in height and indented by sprucesided notches  there were a number of ruined cliffdwellings the most accessible of which was keet seel i could imagine no more picturesque spot a huge windworn cavern with a vast slanted stained wall held upon a projecting ledge or shelf the long line of cliffdwellings these silent little stone houses with their vacant black eyelike windows had strange power to make me ponder and then dream  next day upon resuming our journey it pleased me to try to find the trail to betatakin the most noted and surely the most wonderful and beautiful ruin in all the west in many places there was no trail at all and i encountered difficulties but in the end without much loss of time i entered the narrow rugged entrance of the canyon i had named surprise valley sight of the great dark cave thrilled me as i thought it might have thrilled bess and venters who had lived for me their imagined lives of loneliness here in this wild spot with the sight of those lofty walls and the scent of the dry sweet sage there rushed over me a strange feeling that riders of the purple sage was true my dream people of romance had really lived there once upon a time i climbed high upon the huge stones and along the smooth red walls where pay larkin once had glided with swift sure steps and i entered the musty cliffdwellings and called out to hear the weird and sonorous echoes and i wandered through the thickets and upon the grassy spruceshaded benches never for a moment free of the story i had conceived there something of awe and sadness abided with me i could not enter into the merry pranks and investigations of my party surprise valley seemed a part of my past my dreams my very self i left it haunted by its loneliness and silence and beauty by the story it had given me  that night we camped at bubbling spring which once had been a geyser of considerable power wetherill told a story of an old navajo who had lived there for a long time according to the indian tale the old chief resided there without complaining of this geyser that was wont to inundate his fields but one season the unreliable waterspout made great and persistent endeavor to drown him and his people and horses whereupon the old navajo took his gun and shot repeatedly at the geyser and thundered aloud his anger to the great spirit the geyser ebbed away and from that day never burst forth again  illustration weird and wonderful monuments in monument valley  illustration sunset on the desert  illustration cave of the cliff dwellers  somewhere under the great bulge of navajo mountain i calculated that we were coming to the edge of the plateau the white bobbing packhorses disappeared and then our extra mustangs it is no unusual thing for a man to use three mounts on this trip then two of our indians disappeared but wetherill waited for us and so did nas ta bega the piute who first took wetherill down into nonnezoshe boco as i came up i thought we had indeed reached the end of the world  its down in there said wetherill with a laugh  nas ta bega made a slow sweeping gesture there is always something so significant and impressive about an indian when he points anywhere it is as if he says there way beyond over the ranges is a place i know and it is far the fact was that i looked at the piutes dark inscrutable face before i looked out into the void  my gaze then seemed impelled and held by things afar a vast yellow and purple corrugated world of distance apparently now on a level with my eyes i was drawn by the beauty and grandeur of that scene and then i was transfixed almost by fear by the realization that i dared to venture down into this wild and upflung fastness i kept looking afar sweeping the threequarter circle of horizon till my judgment of distance was confounded and my sense of proportion dwarfed one moment and magnified the next  wetherill was pointing and explaining but i had not grasped all he said  you can see two hundred miles into utah he went on that bright rough surface like a washboard is windworn rock those little lines of cleavage are canyons there are a thousand canyons down there and only a few have we been in that long purple ragged line is the grand canyon of the colorado and there that blue fork in the red thats where the san juan comes in and theres escalante canyon  i had to adopt the indians method of studying unlimited spaces in the desertto look with slow contracted eyes from near to far  the packtrain and the drivers had begun to zigzag down a long slope bare of rock with scant strips of green and here and there a cedar half a mile down the slope merged in what seemed a green level but i knew it was not level this level was a rolling plain growing darker green with lines of ravines and thin undefined spaces that might be mirage miles and miles it swept and rolled and heaved to lose its waves in apparent darker level round red rocks stood isolated they resembled huge grazing cattle but as i gazed these rocks were strangely magnified they grew and grew into mounds castles domes crags great red windcarved buttes one by one they drew my gaze to the wall of upflung rock i seemed to see a thousand domes of a thousand shapes and colors and among them a thousand blue clefts each of which was a canyon  beyond this wide area of curved lines rose another wall dwarfing the lower dark red horizonlong magnificent in frowning boldness and because of its limitless deceiving surfaces incomprehensible to the gaze of man away to the eastward began a winding ragged blue line looping back upon itself and then winding away again growing wider and bluer this line was san juan canyon i followed that blue line all its length a hundred miles down toward the west where it joined a dark purple shadowy cleft and this was the grand canyon of the colorado my eye swept along with that winding mark farther and farther to the west until the cleft growing larger and closer revealed itself as a wild and winding canyon still farther westward it split a vast plateau of red peaks and yellow mesas here the canyon was full of purple smoke it turned it closed it gaped it lost itself and showed again in that chaos of a million cliffs and then it faded a mere purple line into deceiving distance  i imagined there was no scene in all the world to equal this the tranquillity of lesser spaces was here not manifest this happened to be a place where so much of the desert could be seen and the effect was stupendous sound movement life seemed to have no fitness here ruin was there and desolation and decay the meaning of the ages was flung at me a man became nothing but when i gazed across that sublime and majestic wilderness in which the grand canyon was only a dim line i strangely lost my terror and something came to me across the shining spaces  then nas ta bega and wetherill began the descent of the slope and the rest of us followed no sign of a trail showed where the base of the slope rolled out to meet the green plain there was a level bench a mile wide then a ravine and then an ascent and after that rounded ridge and ravine one after the other like huge swells of a monstrous sea indian paint brush vied in its scarlet hue with the deep magenta of cactus there was no sage soap weed and meager grass and a bunch of cactus here and there lent the green to that barren and it was green only at a distance  nas ta bega kept on at a steady gait the sun climbed the wind rose and whipped dust from under the mustangs there is seldom much talk on a ride of this nature it is hard work and everybody for himself besides it is enough just to see and that country is conducive to silence i looked back often and the farther out on the plain we rode the higher loomed the plateau we had descended and as i faced ahead again the lower sank the reddomed and castled horizon to the fore  it was a wild place we were approaching i saw piñon patches under the circled walls i ceased to feel the dry wind in my face we were already in the lee of a wall i saw the rock squirrels scampering to their holes then the indians disappeared between two rounded corners of cliff  i rode round the corner into a widening space thick with cedars it ended in a bare slope of smooth rock here we dismounted to begin the ascent it was smooth and hard though not slippery there was not a crack i did not see a broken piece of stone nas ta bega and wetherill climbed straight up for a while and then wound round a swell to turn this way and that always going up i began to see similar mounds of rock all around me of every shape that could be called a curve there were yellow domes far above and small red domes far below ridges ran from one hill of rock to another there were no abrupt breaks but holes and pits and caves were everywhere and occasionally deep down an amphitheater green with cedar and piñon we found no vestige of trail on those bare slopes  our guides led to the top of the wall only to disclose to us another wall beyond with a ridged bare and scalloped depression between here footing began to be precarious for both man and beast our mustangs were not shod and it was wonderful to see their slow short careful steps they knew a great deal better than we what the danger was it has been such experiences as this that have made me see in horses something besides beasts of burden in the ascent of the second slope it was necessary to zigzag up slowly and carefully taking advantage of every bulge and depression  then before us twisted and dropped and curved the most dangerous slopes i had ever seen we had reached the height of the divide and many of the drops on this side were perpendicular and too steep for us to see the bottom  illustration this immense cave would hold trinity church in it lies the ruined cliff dwelling called betatakin  at one bad place wetherill and nas ta bega with joe lee a mormon cowboy with us were helping one of the packhorses named chub on the steepest part of this slope chub fell and began to slide his momentum jerked the rope from the hands of wetherill and the indian but joe lee held on joe was a giant and being a mormon he could not let go of anything he had he began to slide with the horse holding back with all his might  illustration the windworn treacherous slopes on the way to nonnezoshe  it seemed that both man and beast must slide down to where the slope ended in a yawning precipice chub was snorting or screaming in terror our mustangs were frightened and rearing it was not a place to have trouble with horses  i had a moment of horrified fascination in which chub turned clear over then he slid into a little depression that with joes hold on the lasso momentarily checked his descent quick as thought joe ran sidewise and down to the bulge of rock and yelled for help i got to him a little ahead of wetherill and nas ta bega and together we pulled chub up out of danger at first we thought he had been choked to death but he came to and got up a bloody skinned horse but alive and safe i have never seen a more magnificent effort than joe lees those fellows are built that way wetherill has lost horses on those treacherous slopes and that risk is the only thing about the trip which is not splendid  we got over that bad place without further incident and presently came to a long swell of naked stone that led down to a narrow green split this one had straight walls and wound away out of sight it was the head of a canyon  nonnezoshe boco said the indian  this then was the canyon of the rainbow bridge when we got down into it we were a happy crowd the mode of travel here was a selection of the best levels the best places to cross the brook the best places to climb and it was a process of continual repetition there was no trail ahead of us but we certainly left one behind and as wetherill picked out the course and the mustangs followed him i had all freedom to see and feel the beauty color wildness and changing character of nonnezoshe boco  my experiences in the desert did not count much in the trip down this strange beautiful lost canyon all canyons are not alike this one did not widen though the walls grew higher they began to lean and bulge and the narrow strip of sky above resembled a flowing blue river huge caverns had been hollowed out by water or wind and when the brook ran close under one of these overhanging places the running water made a singular indescribable sound a crack from a hoof on a stone rang like a hollow bell and echoed from wall to wall and the croak of a frogthe only living creature i noted in the canyonwas a weird and melancholy thing  were sure gettin deep down said joe lee  how do you know i asked  here are the pink and yellow sego lilies only the white ones are found above  i dismounted to gather some of these lilies they were larger than the white ones of higher altitudes of a most exquisite beauty and fragility and of such rare pink and yellow hues as i had never seen  they bloom only where its always summer explained joe  that expressed their nature they were the orchids of the summer canyons they stood up everywhere starlike out of the green it was impossible to prevent the mustangs treading them under foot and as the canyon deepened and many little springs added their tiny volume to the brook every grassy bench was dotted with lilies like a green sky starspangled and this increasing luxuriance manifested itself in the banks of purple moss and clumps of lavender daisies and great mounds of yellow violets the brook was lined by blossoming buckbrush the rocky corners showed the crimson and magenta of cactus and there were ledges of green with shining moss that sparkled with little white flowers the hum of bees filled the fragrant dreamy air  but by and bye this green and colorful and verdant beauty the almost level floor of the canyon the banks of soft earth the thickets and clumps of cottonwood the shelving caverns and bulging wallsthese features were gradually lost and nonnezoshe began to deepen in bare red and white stone steps the walls sheered away from one another breaking into sections and ledges and rising higher and higher and there began to be manifested a dark and solemn concordance with the nature that had created this old rent in the earth  there was a stretch of miles where steep steps in hard red rock alternated with long levels of round boulders here one by one the mustangs went lame and we had to walk and we slipped and stumbled along over these loose treacherous stones the hours passed the toil increased the progress diminished one of the mustangs failed and was left and all the while the dimensions of nonnezoshe boco magnified and its character changed it became a thousandfoot walled canyon leaning broken threatening with great yellow slides blocking passage with huge sections split off from the main wall with immense dark and gloomy caverns strangely it had no intersecting canyons it jealously guarded its secret its unusual formations of cavern and pillar and halfarch led me to expect any monstrous stoneshape left by avalanche or cataclysm  down and down we toiled and now the streambed was bare of boulders and the banks of earth the floods that had rolled down that canyon had here borne away every loose thing all the floor in places was bare red and white stone polished glistening slippery affording treacherous foothold and the time came when wetherill abandoned the streambed to take to the rockstrewn and cactuscovered ledges above  the canyon widened ahead into a great ragged ironlined amphitheater and then apparently turned abruptly at right angles sunset rimmed the walls  i had been tired for a long time and now i began to limp and lag i wondered what on earth would make wetherill and the indians tired it was with great pleasure that i observed the giant joe lee plodding slowly along and when i glanced behind at my straggling party it was with both admiration for their gameness and glee for their disheveled and weary appearance finally i got so that all i could do was to drag myself onward with eyes down on the rough ground in this way i kept on until i heard wetherill call me he had stoppedwas waiting for me the dark and silent indian stood beside him looking down the canyon  i saw past the vast jutting wall that had obstructed my view a mile beyond all was bright with the colors of sunset and spanning the canyon in the graceful shape and beautiful hues of the rainbow was a magnificent natural bridge  nonnezoshe said wetherill simply  this rainbow bridge was the one great natural phenomenon the one grand spectacle which i had ever seen that did not at first give vague disappointment a confounding of reality a disenchantment of contrast with what the mind had conceived  but this thing was glorious it absolutely silenced me my body and brain weary and dull from the toil of travel received a singular and revivifying freshness i had a strange mystic perception that this rosyhued tremendous arch of stone was a goal i had failed to reach in some former life but had now found here was a rainbow magnified even beyond dreams a thing not transparent and ethereal but solidified a work of ages sweeping up majestically from the red walls its irishued arch against the blue sky  illustration first sight of the great natural bridge  illustration nonnezoshe  then we plodded on again wetherill worked around to circle the huge amphitheater the way was a steep slant rough and loose and dragging the rocks were as hard and jagged as lava and cactus hindered progress soon the rosy and golden lights had faded all the walls turned pale and steely and the bridge loomed dark  we were to camp all night under the bridge just before we reached it nas ta bega halted with one of his singular motions he was saying his prayer to this great stone god then he began to climb straight up the steep slope wetherill told me the indian would not pass under the arch  when we got to the bridge and unsaddled and unpacked the lame mustangs twilight had fallen the horses were turned loose to fare for what scant grass grew on bench and slope firewood was even harder to find than grass when our simple meal had been eaten there was gloom gathering in the canyon and stars had begun to blink in the pale strip of blue above the lofty walls the place was oppressive and we were mostly silent  presently i moved away into the strange dark shadow cast by the bridge it was a weird black belt where i imagined i was invisible but out of which i could see there was a slab of rock upon which i composed myself to watch to feel  a stiffening of my neck made me aware that i had been continually looking up at the looming arch i found that it never seemed the same any two moments near at hand it was too vast a thing for immediate comprehension i wanted to ponder on what had formed itto reflect upon its meaning as to age and force of nature yet it seemed that all i could do was to see white stars hung along the dark curved line the rim of the arch appeared to shine the moon was up there somewhere the far side of the canyon was now a blank black wall over its towering rim showed a pale glow it brightened the shades in the canyon lightened then a white disk of moon peeped over the dark line the bridge turned to silver  it was then that i became aware of the presence of nas ta bega dark silent statuesque with inscrutable face uplifted with all that was spiritual of the indian suggested by a somber and tranquil knowledge of his place there he represented to me that which a solitary figure of human life represents in a great painting nonnezoshe needed life wild life life of its millions of yearsand here stood the dark and silent indian  long afterward i walked there alone to and fro under the bridge the moon had long since crossed the streak of starfired blue above and the canyon was black in shadow at times a current of wind with all the strangeness of that strange country in its moan rushed through the great stone arch at other times there was silence such as i imagined might have dwelt deep in the center of the earth and again an owl hooted and the sound was nameless it had a mocking echo an echo of night silence gloom melancholy death age eternity  the indian lay asleep with his dark face upturned and the other sleepers lay calm and white in the starlight i seemed to see in them the meaning of life and the pastthe illimitable train of faces that had shone under the stars there was something nameless in that canyon and whether or not it was what the indian embodied in the great nonnezoshe or the life of the present or the death of the ages or the nature so magnificently manifested in those silent dreaming waiting wallsthe truth was that there was a spirit  i did sleep a few hours under nonnezoshe and when i awoke the tip of the arch was losing its cold darkness and beginning to shine the sun had just risen high enough over some low break in the wall to reach the bridge i watched slowly in wondrous transformation the gold and blue and rose and pink and purple blended their hues softly mistily cloudily until once more the arch was a rainbow  i realized that long before life had evolved upon the earth this bridge had spread its grand arch from wall to wall black and mystic at night transparent and rosy in the sunrise at sunset a flaming curve limned against the heavens when the race of man had passed it would perhaps stand there still it was not for many eyes to see the tourist the leisurely traveler the comfortloving motorist would never behold it only by toil sweat endurance and pain could any man ever look at nonnezoshe it seemed well to realize that the great things of life had to be earned nonnezoshe would always be alone grand silent beautiful unintelligible and as such i bade it a mute reverent farewell     chapter ii   colorado trails  riding and tramping trails would lose half their charm if the motive were only to hunt and to fish it seems fair to warn the reader who longs to embark upon a bloody game hunt or a chronicle of fishing records that this is not that kind of story but it will be one for those who love horses and dogs the long winding dim trails the wild flowers and the dark still woods the fragrance of spruce and the smell of campfire smoke and as well for those who love to angle in brown lakes or rushing brooks or chase after the baying hounds or stalk the stag on his lonely heights  illustration pack horses on a sage slope in colorado  we left denver on august twentysecond over the moffet road and had a long wonderful ride through the mountains the rockies have a sweep a limitless sweep majestic and grand for many miles we crossed no streams and climbed and wound up barren slopes once across the divide however we descended into a country of black forests and green valleys yampa a little hamlet with a past prosperity lay in the wide valley of the bear river it was picturesque but idle and a better name for it would have been sleepy hollow the main and only street was very wide and dusty bordered by old board walks and vacant stores it seemed a deserted street of a deserted village teague the guide lived there he assured me it was not quite as lively a place as in the early days when it was a stage center for an old and rich mining section we stayed there at the one hotel for a whole day most of which i spent sitting on the board walk whenever i chanced to look down the wide street it seemed always the samedeserted but yampa had the charm of being old and forgotten and for that reason i would like to live there a while  illustration the grassy uplands with whiteleys peak in the distance  on august twentythird we started in two buckboards for the foothills some fifteen miles westward where teagues men were to meet us with saddle and pack horses the ride was not interesting until the flattop mountains began to loom and we saw the dark green slopes of spruce rising to bare gray cliffs and domes spotted with white banks of snow i felt the first cool breath of mountain air exhilarating and sweet from that moment i began to live  we had left at sixthirty teague my guide had been so rushed with his manifold tasks that i had scarcely seen him let alone gotten acquainted with him and on this ride he was far behind with our load of baggage we arrived at the edge of the foothills about noon it appeared to be the gateway of a valley with aspen groves and ragged jackpines on the slopes and a stream running down our driver called it the stillwater that struck me as strange for the stream was in a great hurry rc spied trout in it and schools of darkish mulletlike fish which we were informed were grayling we wished for our tackle then and for time to fish  teagues man a young fellow called virgil met us here he did not resemble the ancient virgil in the least but he did look as if he had walked right out of one of my romances of wild riders so i took a liking to him at once  but the bunch of horses he had corralled there did not excite any delight in me horses of course were the most important part of our outfit and that moment of first seeing the horses that were to carry us on such long rides was an anxious and thrilling one i have felt it many times and it never grows any weaker from experience many a scrubby lot of horses had turned out well upon acquaintance and some i had found hard to part with at the end of trips up to that time however i had not seen a bear hunters horses and i was much concerned by the fact that these were a sorry looking outfit dusty ragged maneless cut and bruised and crippled still i reflected they were bunched up so closely that i could not tell much about them and i decided to wait for teague before i chose a horse for any one  in an hour teague trotted up to our resting place beside his own mount he had two white saddle horses and nine packanimals heavily laden teague was a sturdy rugged man with bronzed face and keen grayblue eyes very genial and humorous straightway i got the impression that he liked work  lets organize he said briskly have you picked the horses youre goin to ride  teague led from the midst of that dusty kicking bunch a rangy powerful horse with four white feet a white face and a noble head he had escaped my eye i felt thrillingly that here at least was one horse  the rest of the horses were permanently crippled or temporarily lame and i had no choice except to take the one it would be kindest to ride  he aint much like your silvermane or black star said teague laughing  what do you know about them i asked very much pleased at this from him  well i know all about them he replied ill have you the best horse in this country in a few days fact is ive bought him an hell come with my cowboy vern now were organized lets move  illustration a spruceshaded flowerskirted lake  illustration looking down upon cloudfilled valleys  illustration searching burnedover ranges for game  we rode through a meadow along a spruce slope above which towered the great mountain it was a zigzag trail rough boggy and steep in places the stillwater meandered here and little breaks on the water gave evidence of feeding trout we had several miles of meadow and then sheered off to the left up into the timber it was a spruce forest very still and fragrant we climbed out up on a bench and across a flat up another bench out of the timber into the patches of snow here snow could be felt in the air water was everywhere i saw a fox a badger and another furry creature too illusive to name one more climb brought us to the top of the flattop pass about eleven thousand feet the view in the direction from which we had come was splendid and led the eye to the distant sweeping ranges dark and dim along the horizon the flattops were flat enough but not very wide at this pass and we were soon going down again into a green gulf of spruce with ragged peaks lifting beyond here again i got the suggestion of limitless space it took us an hour to ride down to little trappers lake a small clear green sheet of water the larger lake was farther down it was big irregular and bordered by spruce forests and shadowed by the lofty gray peaks  the camp was on the far side the air appeared rather warm and mosquitoes bothered us however they did not stay long it was after sunset and i was too tired to have many impressions  our cook appeared to be a melancholy man he had a deep quavering voice a long drooping mustache and sad eyes he was silent most of the time the men called him bill and yelled when they spoke for he was somewhat deaf it did not take me long to discover that he was a good cook  our tent was pitched down the slope from the cook tent we were too tired to sit round a campfire and talk the stars were white and splendid and they hung over the flat ridges like great beacon lights the lake appeared to be inclosed on three sides by amphitheatric mountains black with spruce up to the gray walls of rock the night grew cold and very still the bells on the horses tinkled distantly there was a soft murmur of falling water a lonesome coyote barked and that thrilled me teagues dogs answered this prowler and some of them had voices to make a hunter thrill one the bloodhound cain had a roar like a lions i had not gotten acquainted with the hounds and i was thinking about them when i fell asleep  next morning i was up at fivethirty the air was cold and nipping and frost shone on grass and sage a red glow of sunrise gleamed on the tip of the mountain and slowly grew downward  the cool handle of an axe felt good i soon found however that i could not wield it long for lack of breath the elevation was close to ten thousand feet and the air at that height was thin and rare after each series of lusty strokes i had to rest rc who could handle an axe as he used to swing a baseball bat made fun of my efforts whereupon i relinquished the tool to him and chuckled at his discomfiture  after breakfast rc and i got out our tackles and rigged up fly rods and sallied forth to the lake with the same eagerness we had felt when we were boys going after chubs and sunfish the lake glistened green in the sunlight and it lay like a gem at the foot of the magnificent black slopes  the water was full of little floating particles that teague called wild rice i thought the lake had begun to work like eastern lakes during dog days it did not look propitious for fishing but teague reassured us the outlet of this lake was the head of white river we tried the outlet first but trout were not rising there then we began wading and casting along a shallow bar of the lake teague had instructed us to cast then drag the flies slowly across the surface of the water in imitation of a swimming fly or bug i tried this and several times when the leader was close to me and my rod far back i had strikes with my rod in that position i could not hook the trout then i cast my own way letting the flies sink a little to my surprise and dismay i had only a few strikes and could not hook the fish  rc however had better luck and that too in wading right over the ground i had covered to beat me at anything always gave him the most unaccountable fiendish pleasure  these are educated trout he said it takes a skillful fisherman to make them rise now anybody can catch the big game of the sea which is your forte but here you are ng watch me cast  i watched him make a most atrocious cast but the water boiled and he hooked two goodsized trout at once quite speechless with envy and admiration i watched him play them and eventually beach them they were cutthroat trout silverysided and marked with the red slash along their gills that gave them their name i did not catch any while wading but from the bank i spied one and dropping a fly in front of his nose i got him rc caught four more all about a pound in weight and then he had a strike that broke his leader he did not have another leader so we walked back to camp  wild flowers colored the open slopes leading down out of the forest golden rod golden daisies and bluebells were plentiful and very pretty here i found my first columbine the beautiful flower that is the emblem of colorado in vivid contrast to its blue indian paint brush thinly dotted the slopes and varied in color from red to pink and from white to yellow  my favorite of all wild flowersthe purple asterswere there too on tall nodding stems with pale faces held up to the light the reflection of mountain and forest in trappers lake was clear and beautiful  the hounds bayed our approach to camp we both made a great show about beginning our little camp tasks but we did not last very long the sun felt so good and it was so pleasant to lounge under a pine one of the blessings of outdoor life was that a man could be like an indian and do nothing so from rest i passed to dreams and from dreams to sleep  in the afternoon rc and i went out again to try for trout the lake appeared to be getting thicker with that floating muck and we could not raise a fish then we tried the outlet again here the current was swift i found a place between two willow banks where trout were breaking on the surface it took a long cast for me but about every tenth attempt i would get a fly over the right place and raise a fish they were small but that did not detract from my gratification the light on the water was just right for me to see the trout rise and that was a beautiful sight as well as a distinct advantage i had caught four when a shout from rc called me quickly down stream i found him standing in the middle of a swift chute with his rod bent double and a long line out  got a whale he yelled see himdown therein that white water see him flash red go down there and land him for me hurry hes got all the line  i ran below to an open place in the willows here the stream was shallow and very swift in the white water i caught a flashing gleam of red then i saw the shine of the leader but i could not reach it without wading in when i did this the trout lunged out he looked crimson and silver i could have put my fist in his mouth  grab the leader yank him out yelled rc in desperation there hes got all the line  but itd be better to wade down i yelled back  he shouted that the water was too deep and for me to save his fish this was an awful predicament for me i knew the instant i grasped the leader that the big trout would break it or pull free the same situation with different kinds of fish had presented itself many times on my numberless fishing jaunts with rc and they all crowded to my mind nevertheless i had no choice plunging in to my knees i frantically reached for the leader the red trout made a surge i missed him rc yelled that something would break that was no news to me another plunge brought me in touch with the leader then i essayed to lead the huge cutthroat ashore he was heavy but he was tired and that gave birth to hopes near the shore as i was about to lift him he woke up swam round me twice then ran between my legs  when a little later rc came panting down stream i was sitting on the bank all wet with one knee skinned and i was holding his broken leader in my hands strange to say he went into a rage blamed me for the loss of that big trout under such circumstances it was always best to maintain silence and i did so as long as i could after his paroxysm had spent itself and he had become somewhat near a rational being once more he asked me  was he big  oha whale of a trout i replied  humph well how big  thereupon i enlarged upon the exceeding size and beauty of that trout i made him out very much bigger than he actually looked to me and i minutely described his beauty and wonderful gaping mouth rc groaned and that was my revenge  we returned to camp early and i took occasion to scrape acquaintance with the dogs it was a strangely assorted packfour airedales one bloodhound and seven other hounds of mixed breeds there were also three pup hounds white and yellow very pretty dogs and like all pups noisy and mischievous they made friends easily this applied also to one of the airedales a dog recently presented to teague by some estimable old lady who had called him kaiser and made a pet of him as might have been expected of a dog even an airedale with that name he was no good but he was very affectionate and exceedingly funny when he was approached he had a trick of standing up holding up his forepaws in an appealing sort of way with his head twisted in the most absurd manner this was when he was chainedotherwise he would have been climbing up on anyone who gave him the chance he was the most jealous dog i ever saw he could not be kept chained very long because he always freed himself at meal time he would slip noiselessly behind some one and steal the first morsel he could snatch bill was always rapping kaiser with pans or billets of firewood  next morning was clear and cold we had breakfast and then saddled up to ride to big fish lake for an hour we rode up and down ridges of heavy spruce along a trail we saw elk and deer sign elk tracks appeared almost as large as cow tracks when we left the trail to climb into heavy timber we began to look for game the forest was dark green and brown silent as a grave no squirrels or birds or sign of life we had a hard ride up and down steep slopes a feature was the open swaths made by avalanches the ice and snow had cut a path through the timber and the young shoots of spruce were springing up i imagined the roar made by that tremendous slide  we found elk tracks everywhere and some fresh sign where the grass had been turned recently and also much old and fresh sign where the elk had skinned the saplings by rubbing their antlers to get rid of the velvet some of these rubs looked like blazes made by an axe the airedale fox a wonderful dog routed out a shecoyote that evidently had a den somewhere for she barked angrily at the dog and at us fox could not catch her she led him round in a circle and we could not see her in the thick brush it was fine to hear the wild staccato note again  we crossed many little parks bright and green blooming with wild asters and indian paint brush and golden daisies the patches of red and purple were exceedingly beautiful everywhere we rode we were knee deep in flowers at length we came out of the heavy timber down upon big fish lake this lake was about half a mile across deep bluegreen in color with rocky shores upon the opposite side were beaver mounds we could see big trout swimming round but they would not rise to a fly rc went out in an old boat and paddled to the head of the lake and fished at the inlet here he caught a fine trout i went around and up the little river that fed the lake it curved swiftly through a meadow and had deep dark eddies under mossy flowering banks at other places the stream ran swiftly over clean gravel beds it was musical and clear as crystal and to the touch of hand as cold as ice water i waded in and began to cast i saw several big trout and at last coaxed one to take my fly but i missed him then in a swift current a flash of red caught my eye and i saw a big trout lazily rise to my fly saw him take it and i hooked him he was not active but heavy and plunging and he bored in and out and made short runs i had not seen such beautiful red colors in any fish he made a fine fight but at last i landed him on the grass a cutthroat of about one and threequarter pounds deep red and silver and green and spotted all over that was the extent of my luck  we went back to the point and thought we would wait a little while to see if the trout would begin to rise but they did not a storm began to mutter and boom along the battlements great gray clouds obscured the peaks and at length the rain came it was cold and cutting we sought the shelter of spruces for a while and waited after an hour it cleared somewhat and rc caught a fine onepound cutthroat all green and silver with only two slashes of red along under the gills then another storm threatened before we got ready to leave for camp the rain began again to fall and we looked for a wetting it was raining hard when we rode into the woods and very cold the spruces were dripping but we soon got warm from hard riding up steep slopes after an hour the rain ceased the sun came out and from the open places high up we could see a great green void of spruce and beyond boundless black ranges running off to dim horizon we flushed a big blue grouse with a brood of little ones and at length another big one  in one of the open parks the airedale fox showed signs of scenting game there was a patch of ground where the grass was pressed down teague whispered and pointed i saw the gray rump of an elk protruding from behind some spruces i beckoned for rc and we both dismounted just then the elk rose and stalked out it was a magnificent bull with crowning lofty antlers the shoulders and neck appeared black he raised his head and turning trotted away with ease and grace for such a huge beast that was a wild and beautiful sight i had not seen before we were entranced and when he disappeared we burst out with exclamations  we rode on toward camp and out upon a bench that bordered the lofty red wall of rock from there we went down into heavy forest again dim and gray with its dank penetrating odor and oppressive stillness the forest primeval when we rode out of that into open slopes the afternoon was far advanced and long shadows lay across the distant ranges when we reached camp supper and a fire to warm cold wet feet were exceedingly welcome i was tired  later rc and i rode up a mile or so above camp and hitched our horses near teagues old corral our intention was to hunt up along the side of the slope teague came along presently we waited hoping the big black clouds would break but they did not they rolled down with gray swirling edges like smoke and a storm enveloped us we sought shelter in a thick spruce it rained and hailed by and bye the air grew bitterly cold and teague suggested we give up and ride back so we did the mountains were dim and obscure through the gray gloom and the black speartipped spruces looked ghostly against the background the lightning was vivid and the thunder rolled and crashed in magnificent bombardment across the heavens  next morning at sixthirty the sun was shining clear and only a few clouds sailed in the blue wind was in the west and the weather promised fair but clouds began to creep up behind the mountains first hazy then white then dark nevertheless we decided to ride out and cross the flattop rim and go around what they call the chinese wall it rained as we climbed through the spruces above little trappers lake and as we got near the top it began to hail again the air grew cold once out on top i found a wide expanse green and white level in places but with huge upheavals of ridge there were flowers here at eleven thousand feet the view to the rear was impressivea wide upanddown plain studded with outcropping of rocks and patches of snow we were then on top of the chinese wall and the view to the west was grand at the moment hail was falling thick and white and to stand above the streaked curtain as it fell into the abyss was a strange new experience below two thousand feet lay the spruce forest and it sloped and dropped into the white river valley which in turn rose a long ragged darkgreen slope up to a bare jagged peak beyond this stretched range on range dark under the lowering pall of clouds on top we found fresh rocky mountain sheep tracks a little later going into a draw we crossed a snowbank solid as ice we worked down into this draw into the timber it hailed and rained some more then cleared the warm sun felt good once down in the parks we began to ride through a flowergarden every slope was beautiful in gold and red and blue and white these parks were luxuriant with grass and everywhere we found elk beds where the great stags had been lying to flee at our approach but we did not see one the bigness of this slope impressed me we rode miles and miles and every park was surrounded by heavy timber at length we got into a burned district where the tall dead spruces stood sear and ghastly and the ground was so thickly strewn with fallen trees that we had difficulty in threading a way through them patches of aspen grew on the hillside still fresh and green despite this frosty morning here we found a sego lily one of the most beautiful of flowers here also i saw pink indian paint brush at the foot of this long burned slope we came to the white river trail and followed it up and around to camp  late in the evening about sunset i took my rifle and slipped off into the woods back of camp i walked a short distance then paused to listen to the silence of the forest there was not a sound it was a place of peace by and bye i heard snapping of twigs and presently heard rc and teague approaching me we penetrated half a mile into the spruce pausing now and then to listen at length rc heard something we stopped after a little i heard the ring of a horn on wood it was thrilling then came the crack of a hoof on stone then the clatter of a loosened rock we crept on but that elk or deer evaded us we hunted around till dark without farther sign of any game  rc and teague and i rode out at seventhirty and went down white river for three miles in one patch of bare ground we saw tracks of five deer where they had come in for salt then we climbed high up a burned ridge winding through patches of aspen we climbed ridge after ridge and at last got out of the burned district into reaches of heavy spruce coming to a park full of deer and elk tracks we dismounted and left our horses i went to the left and into some beautiful woods where i saw beds of deer or elk and many tracks returning to the horses i led them into a larger park and climbed high into the open and watched there i saw some little squirrels about three inches long and some gray birds very tame i waited a long time before there was any sign of rc or teague and then it was the dog i saw first i whistled and they climbed up to me we mounted and rode on for an hour then climbed through a magnificent forest of huge trees windfalls and a ferny mossy soft ground at length we came out at the head of a steep bare slope running down to a verdant park crossed by stretches of timber on the way back to camp we ran across many elk beds and deer trails and for a while a small band of elk evidently trotted ahead of us but out of sight  next day we started for a few days trip to big fish lake rc and i went along up around the mountain i found our old trail and was at a loss only a few times we saw fresh elk sign but no live game at all  in the afternoon we fished i went up the river half a mile while rc fished the lake neither of us had any luck later we caught four trout one of which was fair sized  toward sunset the trout began to rise all over the lake but we could not get them to take a fly  the following day we went up to twin lakes and found them to be beautiful little green gems surrounded by spruce i saw some big trout in the large lake but they were wary we tried every way to get a strike no use in the little lake matters were worse it was full of trout up to two pounds they would run at the fly only to refuse it exasperating work we gave up and returned to big fish after supper we went out to try again the lake was smooth and quiet all at once as if by concert the trout began to rise everywhere in a little bay we began to get strikes i could see the fish rise to the fly the small ones were too swift and the large ones too slow it seemed we caught one and then had bad luck we snarled our lines drifted wrong broke leaders snapped off flies hooked too quick and too slow and did everything that was clumsy i lost two big fish because they followed the fly as i drew it toward me across the water to imitate a swimming fly of course this made a large slack line which i could not get up finally i caught one big fish and altogether we got seven all in that little bay where the water was shallow in other places we could not catch a fish i had one vicious strike the fish appeared to be feeding on a tiny black gnat which we could not imitate this was the most trying experience of all we ought to have caught a basketful  the next day september first we rode down along the outlet of big fish to white river and down that for miles to fish for grayling the stream was large and swift and cold it appeared full of ice water and rocks but no fish we met fishermen an automobile and a camp outfit that was enough for me where an automobile can run i do not belong the fishing was poor but the beautiful open valley flowered in gold and purple was recompense for a good deal of bad luck  a grayling or what they called a grayling was not as beautiful a fish as my fancy had pictured he resembled a sucker or mullet had a small mouth dark color and was rather a sluggishlooking fish  we rode back through a thunderstorm and our yellow slickers afforded much comfort  next morning was bright clear cold i saw the moon go down over a mountain rim roseflushed with the sunrise  rc and i with teague started for the top of the big mountain on the west i had a new horse a roan and he looked a thoroughbred he appeared tired but i thought he would be great we took a trail through the woods dark greengray cool and verdant odorous and still we began to climb occasionally we crossed parks and little streams up near the long bare slope the spruce trees grew large and far apart they were beautiful gray as if bearded with moss beyond this we got into the rocks and climbing became arduous long zigzags up the slope brought us to the top of a notch where at the right lay a patch of snow the top of the mountain was comparatively flat but it had timbered ridges and bare plains and little lakes with dark domes rising beyond we rode around to the right climbing out of the timber to where the dwarf spruces and brush had a hard struggle for life the great gulf below us was immense dark and wild studded with lakes and parks and shadowed by moving clouds  sheep tracks old and fresh afforded us thrills  away on the western rim where we could look down upon a long rugged irongray ridge of mountain our guide using the glass found two big stags we all had our fill of looking i could see them plainly with naked eyes  we decided to go back to where we could climb down on that side halter the horses leave all extra accoutrements and stalk those stags and take a picture of them  i led the way and descended under the rim it was up and down over rough shale and up steps of broken rocks and down little cliffs we crossed the ridge twice many times having to lend a hand to each other  at length i reached a point where i could see the stags lying down the place was an open spot on a rocky promonotory with a fringe of low spruces the stags were magnificent in size with antlers in the velvet one had twelve points they were lying in the sun to harden their horns according to our guide  i slipped back to the others and we all decided to have a look so we climbed up all of us saw the stags twitching ears and tails  then we crept back and once more i took the lead to crawl round under the ledge so we could come up about even with them here i found the hardest going yet i came to a windworn crack in the thin ledge and from this i could just see the tips of the antlers i beckoned the others laboriously they climbed rc went through first i went over next and then came teague  rc and i started to crawl down to a big rock that was our objective point we went cautiously with bated breath and pounding hearts when we got there i peeped over to see the stags still lying down but they had heads intent and wary still i did not think they had scented us rc took a peep and turning excitedly he whispered  see only one and hes standing  and i answered lets get down around to the left where we can get a better chance it was only a few feet down we got there  when he peeped over at this point he exclaimed theyre gone  it was a keen disappointment they winded us i decided  we looked and looked but we could not see to our left because of the bulge of rock we climbed back then i saw one of the stags loping leisurely off to the left teague was calling he said they had walked off the promontory looking up and stopping occasionally  then we realized we must climb back along that broken ridge and then up to the summit of the mountain so we started  that climb back was proof of the effect of excitement on judgment we had not calculated at all on the distance or ruggedness and we had a job before us we got along well under the western wall and fairly well straight across through the long slope of timber where we saw sheep tracks and expected any moment to sight an old ram but we did not find one and when we got out of the timber upon the bare sliding slope we had to halt a hundred times we could zigzag only a few steps the altitude was twelve thousand feet and oxygen seemed scarce i nearly dropped all the climbing appeared to come hardest on the middle of my right foot and it could scarcely have burned hotter if it had been in fire despite the strenuous toil there were not many moments that i was not aware of the vastness of the gulf below or the peaceful lakes brown as amber or the golden parks and nearer at hand i found magentacolored indian paint brush very exquisite and rare  coming out on a ledge i spied a little dark animal with a long tail he was running along the opposite promontory about three hundred yards distant when he stopped i took a shot at him and missed by apparently a scant half foot  after catching our breath we climbed more and more and still more at last to drop on the rim hot wet and utterly spent  the air was keen cold and invigorating we were soon rested and finding our horses we proceeded along the rim westward upon rounding an outcropping of rock we flushed a flock of ptarmigansoft gray rockcolored birds about the size of pheasants and when they flew they showed beautiful white bands on their wings these are the rare birds that have feathered feet and turn white in winter they did not fly far and several were so tame they did not fly at all we got our little 22 revolvers and began to shoot at the nearest bird he was some thirty feet distant but we could not hit him and at last fox getting disgusted tried to catch the bird and made him fly i felt relieved for as we were getting closer and closer with every shot it seemed possible that if the ptarmigan sat there long enough we might eventually have hit him the mystery was why we shot so poorly but this was explained by rc who discovered we had been shooting the wrong shells  it was a long hard ride down the rough winding trail but riding down was a vastly different thing from going up  on september third we were up at fivethirty it was clear and cold and the red of sunrise tinged the peaks the snow banks looked pink all the early morning scene was green fresh cool with that mountain rareness of atmosphere  we packed to break camp and after breakfast it took hours to get our outfit in shape to starta long string resembling a caravan i knew that events would occur that day first we lost one of the dogs vern went back after him the dogs were mostly chained in pairs to prevent their running off samson the giant hound was chained to a little dog and the others were paired not according to size by any means the poor dogs were disgusted with the arrangement it developed presently that cain the bloodhound a strange and wild hound much like don of my old lionhunting days slipped us and was not missed for hours teague decided to send back for him later  next in order of events as we rode up the winding trail through the spruce forest we met teagues cow and calf which he had kept all summer in camp for some reason neither could be left teague told us to ride on and an hour later when we halted to rest on the flattop mountain he came along with the rest of the train and in the fore was the cow alone it was evident that she was distressed and angry for it took two men to keep her in the trail and another thing plain to me was the fact that she was going to demoralize the pack horses we were not across the wide range of this flat mountain when one of the pack animals a lean and lanky sorrel appeared suddenly to go mad and began to buck off a pack he succeeded this inspired a black horse very appropriately christened nigger to try his luck and he shifted his pack in short order it took patience time and effort to repack the cow was a disorganizer she took up as wide a trail as a road and the pack animals some with dignity and others with disgust tried to avoid her vicinity going down the steep forest trail on the other side the real trouble began the pack train split ran and bolted crashing through the trees plunging down steep places and jumping logs it was a wild sort of chase but luckily the packs remained intact until we were once more on open flat ground all went well for a while except for an accident for which i was to blame i spurred my horse and he plunged suddenly past rcs mount colliding with him tearing off my stirrup and spraining rcs ankle this was almost a serious accident as rc has an old baseball ankle that required favoring  next in order was the sorrel as i saw it he heedlessly went too near the cow which we now called bossy and she acted somewhat like a spanish bull to the effect that the sorrel was scared and angered at once he began to run and plunge and buck right into the other pack animals dropping articles from his pack as he dashed along he stampeded the train and gave the saddle horses a scare when order was restored and the whole outfit gathered together again a full hour had been lost by this time all the horses were tired and that facilitated progress because there were no more serious breaks  down in the valley it was hot and the ride grew long and wearisome nevertheless the scenery was beautiful the valley was green and level and a meandering stream formed many little lakes on one side was a steep hill of sage and aspens and on the other a black spearpointed spruce forest rising sheer to a bold blunt peak patched with snowbanks and bronze and gray in the clear light huge white clouds sailed aloft making dark moving shadows along the great slopes  we reached our turningoff place about five oclock and again entered the fragrant quiet foresta welcome change we climbed and climbed at length coming into an open park of slopes and green borders of forest with a lake in the center we pitched camp on the skirt of the western slope under the spruces and worked hard to get the tents up and boughs cut for beds darkness caught us with our hands still full and we ate supper in the light of a campfire with the black deep forest behind and the pale afterglow across the lake  i had a bad night being too tired to sleep well many times i saw the moon shadows of spruce branches trembling on the tent walls and the flickering shadows of the dying campfire i heard the melodious tinkle of the bells on the hobbled horses bossy bawled oftena discordant break in the serenity of the night occasionally the hounds bayed her  toward morning i slept some and awakened with what seemed a broken back all except rc were slow in crawling out the sun rose hot this lower altitude was appreciated by all after breakfast we set to work to put the camp in order  that afternoon we rode off to look over the ground we crossed the park and worked up a timbered ridge remarkable for mossy bare ground and higher up for its almost total absence of grass or flowers on the other side of this we had a fine view of mt dome a high peak across a valley then we worked down into the valley which was full of parks and ponds and running streams we found some fresh sign of deer and a good deal of old elk and deer sign but we saw no game of any kind it was a tedious ride back through thick forest where i observed many trees that had been barked by porcupines some patches were four feet from the ground indicating that the porcupine had sat on the snow when he gnawed those particular places  after sunset rc and i went off down a trail into the woods and sitting down under a huge spruce we listened the forest was solemn and still far down somewhere roared a stream and that was all the sound we heard the gray shadows darkened and gloom penetrated the aisles of the forest until all the sheltered places were black as pitch the spruces looked spectraland speaking the silence of the woods was deep profound and primeval it all worked on my imagination until i began to hear faint sounds and finally grand orchestral crashings of melody  on our return the strange creeping chill that must be a descendant of the old elemental fear caught me at all obscure curves in the trail  illustration a hunters cabin on a frosty morning  next day we started off early and climbed through the woods and into the parks under the dome we scared a deer that had evidently been drinking his fresh tracks led before us but we could not catch a glimpse of him  illustration the troublesome country noted for grizzly bears  we climbed out of the parks up onto the rocky ridges where the spruce grew scarce and then farther to the jumble of stones that had weathered from the great peaks above and beyond that up the slope where all the vegetation was dwarfed deformed and weird strange manifestation of its struggle for life here the air grew keener and cooler and the light seemed to expand we rode on to the steep slope that led up to the gap we were to cross between the dome and its companion  illustration under the shadow of the flattop mountains  i saw a red fox running up the slope and dismounting i took a quick shot at three hundred yards and scored a hit it turned out to be a cross fox and had very pretty fur  when we reached the level of the deep gap the wind struck us hard and cold on that side opened an abyss gray and shelving as it led down to green timber and then on to the yellow parks and black ridges that gleamed under the opposite range  we had to work round a wide amphitheater and up a steep corner to the top this turned out to be level and smooth for a long way with a short velvety yellow grass like moss spotted with flowers here at thirteen thousand feet the wind hit us with exceeding force and soon had us with freezing hands and faces all about us were bold black and gray peaks with patches of snow and above them clouds of white and drab showing blue sky between it developed that this grassy summit ascended in a long gradual sweep from the apex of which stretched a grand expanse like a plain of gold down and down endlessly almost and then up and up to end under a gray butte highest of the points around the ride across here seemed to have no limit but it was beautiful though severe on endurance i saw another fox and dismounting fired five shots as he ran dusting him with three bullets we rode out to the edge of the mountain and looked off it was fearful yet sublime the world lay beneath us in many places we rode along the rim and at last circled the great butte and worked up behind it on a swell of slope here the range ran west and the drop was not sheer but gradual with fine benches for sheep we found many tracks and fresh sign but did not see one sheep meanwhile the hard wind had ceased and the sun had come out making the ride comfortable as far as weather was concerned we had gotten a long way from camp and finding no trail to descend in that direction we turned to retrace our steps that was about one oclock and we rode and rode and rode until i was so tired that i could not appreciate the scenes as i had on the way up it took six hours to get back to camp  next morning we took the hounds and rode off for bear eight of the hounds were chained in braces one big and one little dog together and they certainly had a hard time of it sampson the giant gray and brown hound and jim the old black leader were free to run to and fro across the way we rode down a few miles and into the forest there were two long black ridges and here we were to hunt for bear it was the hardest kind of work turning and twisting between the trees dodging snags and brushing aside branches and guiding a horse among fallen logs the forest was thick and the ground was a rich brown and black muck soft to the horses feet many times the hounds got caught on snags and had to be released once sampson picked up a scent of some kind and went off baying old jim ran across that trail and returned thus making it clear that there was no bear trail we penetrated deep between the two ridges and came to a little lake about thirty feet wide surrounded by rushes and grass here we rested the horses and incidentally ourselves fox chased a duck and it flew into the woods and hid under a log fox trailed it and teague shot it just as he might have a rabbit we got two more ducks fine big mallards the same way it was amazing to me and rc remarked that never had he seen such strange and foolish ducks  this forest had hundreds of trees barked by porcupines and some clear to the top but we met only one of the animals and he left several quills in the nose of one of the pups i was of the opinion that these porcupines destroy many fine trees as i saw a number barked all around  we did not see any bear sign on the way back to camp we rode out of the forest and down a wide valley the opposite side of which was open slope with patches of alder even at a distance i could discern the color of these open glades and grassy benches they had a tinge of purple like purple sage when i got to them i found a profusion of asters of the most exquisite shades of lavender pink and purple that slope was long and all the way up we rode through these beautiful wild flowers i shall never forget that sight nor the many asters that shone like stars out of the green the pink ones were new to me and actually did not seem real i noticed my horse occasionally nipped a bunch and ate them which seemed to me almost as heartless as to tread them under foot  when we got up the slope and into the woods again we met a storm and traveled for an hour in the rain and under the dripping spruces feeling the cold wet sting of swaying branches as we rode by then the sun came out bright and the forest glittered all gold and green the smell of the woods after a rain is indescribable it combines a rare tang of pine spruce earth and air all refreshed  the day after we left at eight oclock and rode down to the main trail and up that for five miles where we cut off to the left and climbed into the timber the woods were fresh and dewy dark and cool and for a long time we climbed bench after bench where the grass and ferns and moss made a thick deep cover farther up we got into fallen timber and made slow progress at timber line we tied the horses and climbed up to the pass between two great mountain ramparts sheep tracks were in evidence but not very fresh teague and i climbed on top and rc with vern went below just along the timber line the climb on foot took all my strength and many times i had to halt for breath the air was cold we stole along the rim and peered over rc and vern looked like very little men far below and the dogs resembled mice  teague climbed higher and left me on a promontory watching all around  the cloud pageant was magnificent with huge billowy white masses across the valley and to the west great black thunderheads rolling up the wind began to blow hard carrying drops of rain that stung and the air was nipping cold i felt aloof from all the crowded world alone on the windy heights with clouds and storm all around me  when the storm threatened i went back to the horses it broke but was not severe after all at length rc and the men returned and we mounted to ride back to camp the storm blew away leaving the sky clear and blue and the sun shone warm we had an hour of winding in and out among windfalls of timber and jumping logs and breaking through brush then the way sloped down to a beautiful forest shady and green full of mossy dells almost overgrown with ferns and low spreading ground pine or spruce the aisles of the forest were long and shaded by the stately spruces water ran through every ravine sometimes a brawling brook sometimes a rivulet hidden under overhanging mossy banks we scared up two lonely grouse at long intervals at length we got into fallen timber and from that worked into a jumble of rocks where the going was rough and dangerous  the afternoon waned as we rode on and on up and down in and out around and at times the horses stood almost on their heads sliding down steep places where the earth was soft and black and gave forth a dank odor we passed ponds and swamps and little lakes we saw where beavers had gnawed down aspens and we just escaped miring our horses in marshes where the grass grew rich and golden hiding the treacherous mire the sun set and still we did not seem to get anywhere i was afraid darkness would overtake us and we would get lost in the woods presently we struck an old elk trail and following that for a while came to a point where rc and i recognized a tree and a glade where we had been beforeand not far from campa welcome discovery  next day we broke camp and started across country for new territory near whitleys peak  we rode east up the mountain after several miles along an old logging road we reached the timber and eventually the top of the ridge we went down crossing parks and swales there were cattle pastures and eaten over and trodden so much they had no beauty left teague wanted to camp at a salt lick but i did not care for the place  we went on the dogs crossed a bear trail and burst out in a clamor we had a hard time holding them  the guide and i had a hot argument i did not want to stay there and chase a bear in a cow pasture so we went on down into ranch country and this disgusted me further we crossed a ranch and rode several miles on a highway then turned abruptly and climbed a rough rocky ridge covered with brush and aspen we crossed it and went down for several miles and had to camp in an aspen grove on the slope of a ravine it was an uninviting place to stay but as there was no other we had to make the best of it the afternoon had waned i took a gun and went off down the ravine until i came to a deep gorge here i heard the sound of a brawling brook i sat down for an hour but saw no game  that night i had a wretched bed one that i could hardly stay in and i passed miserable hours i got up sore cramped sleepy and irritable we had to wait three hours for the horses to be caught and packed i had predicted straying horses at last we were off and rode along the steep slope of a canyon for several miles and then struck a stream of ambercolored water as we climbed along this we came into deep spruce forest where it was pleasure to ride i saw many dells and nooks cool and shady full of mossy rocks and great trees but flowers were scarce we were sorry to pass the headsprings of that stream and to go on over the divide and down into the wooded but dry and stony country we rode until late and came at last to a park where sheep had been run i refused to camp here and teague in high dudgeon rode on as it turned out i was both wise and lucky for we rode into a park with many branches where there was good water and fair grass and a pretty grove of white pines in which to pitch our tents i enjoyed this camp and had a fine rest at night  the morning broke dark and lowering we hustled to get started before a storm broke it began to rain as we mounted our horses and soon we were in the midst of a cold rain it blew hard we put on our slickers after a short ride down through the forest we entered buffalo park this was a large park and we lost time trying to find a foresters trail leading out of it at last we found one but it soon petered out and we were lost in thick timber in a driving rain with the cold and wind increasing but we kept on  this forest was deep and dark with tremendous windfalls and great canyons around which we had to travel it took us hours to ride out of it when we began to descend once more we struck an old lumber road more luckthe storm ceased and presently we were out on an aspen slope with a great valley beneath and high black peaks beyond below the aspens were long swelling slopes of sage and grass gray and golden and green a ranch lay in the valley and we crossed it to climb up a winding ravine once more to the aspens where we camped in the ranchers pasture it was a cold wet camp but we managed to be fairly comfortable  the sunset was gorgeous the mass of clouds broke and rolled there was exquisite golden light on the peaks and many rose and violethued banks of cloud  morning found us shrouded in fog we were late starting about nine the curtain of gray began to lift and break we climbed pastures and aspen thickets high up to the spruce where the grass grew luxuriant and the red wall of rock overhung the long slopes the view west was magnificenta long bulging range of mountains vast stretches of green aspen slopes winding parks of all shapes gray and gold and green and jutting peaks and here and there patches of autumn blaze in grass and thicket  we spent the afternoon pitching camp on an aspen knoll with water grass and wood near at hand and the splendid view of mountains and valleys below  we spent many full days under the shadow of whitleys peak after the middle of september the aspens colored and blazed to the touch of frost and the mountain slopes were exceedingly beautiful against a background of gray sage the gold and red and purple aspen groves showed too much like exquisite paintings to seem real in the mornings the frost glistened thick and white on the grass and after the gorgeous sunsets of gold over the violethazed ranges the air grew stingingly cold  bearchasing with a pack of hounds has been severely criticised by many writers and i was among them i believed it a cowardly business and that was why if i chased bears with dogs i wanted to chase the kind that could not be treed but like many another i did not know what i was writing about i did not shoot a bear out of a tree and i would not do so except in a case of hunger all the same leaving the tree out of consideration bearchasing with hounds is a tremendously exciting and hazardous game but my ideas about sport are changing hunting in the sportsmans sense is a cruel and degenerate business  illustration white aspen tree showing marks of bear claws  the more i hunt the more i become convinced of something wrong about the game i am a different man when i get a gun in my hands all is exciting hotpressed red hunting is magnificent up to the moment the shot is fired after that it is another matter it is useless for sportsmen to tell me that they in particular hunt right conserve the game do not go beyond the limit and all that sort of thing i do not believe them and i never met the guide who did a rifle is made for killing when a man goes out with one he means to kill he may keep within the law but that is not the question it is a question of spirit and men who love to hunt are yielding to and always developing the old primitive instinct to kill the meaning of the spirit of life is not clear to them an argument may be advanced that according to the laws of selfpreservation and the survival of the fittest if a man stops all strife all fight then he will retrograde and that is to say if a man does not go to the wilds now and then and work hard and live some semblance of the life of his progenitors he will weaken it seems that he will but i am not prepared now to say whether or not that would be well the germans believe they are the race fittest to survive over all othersand that has made me a little sick of this darwin business  illustration a black bear treed  to return however to the fact that to ride after hounds on a wild chase is a dangerous and wonderfully exhilarating experience i will relate a couple of instances and i will leave it to my readers to judge whether or not it is a cowardly sport  one afternoon a rancher visited our camp and informed us that he had surprised a big black bear eating the carcass of a dead cow  good well have a bear tomorrow night declared teague in delight well get him even if the trail is a day old but hell come back tonight  early next morning the young rancher and three other boys rode into camp saying they would like to go with us to see the fun we were glad to have them and we rode off through the frosted sage that crackled like brittle glass under the hoofs of the horses our guide led toward a branch of a park and when we got within perhaps a quarter of a mile teague suggested that rc and i go ahead on the chance of surprising the bear it was owing to this suggestion that my brother and i were well ahead of the others but we did not see any bear near the carcass of the cow old jim and sampson were close behind us and when jim came within forty yards of that carcass he put his nose up with a deep and ringing bay and he shot by us like a streak he never went near the dead cow sampson bayed like thunder and raced after jim  theyre off i yelled to rc its a hot scent come on  we spurred our horses and they broke across the open park to the edge of the woods jim and sampson were running straight with noses high i heard a string of yelps and bellows from our rear  look back shouted rc  teague and the cowboys were unleashing the rest of the pack it surely was great to see them stretch out yelping wildly like the wind they passed us jim and sampson headed into the woods with deep bays i was riding teagues best horse for this sort of work and he understood the game and plainly enjoyed it rcs horse ran as fast in the woods as he did in the open this frightened me and i yelled to rc to be careful i yelled to deaf ears that is the first great riska rider is not going to be careful we were right on top of jim and sampson with the pack clamoring mad music just behind the forest rang both horses hurdled logs sometimes two at once my old lion chases with buffalo jones had made me skillful in dodging branches and snags and sliding knees back to avoid knocking them against trees for a mile the forest was comparatively open and here we had a grand and ringing run i received two hard knocks was unseated once but held on and i got a stinging crack in the face from a branch rc added several more blackandblue spots to his already spotted anatomy and he missed just by an inch a solid snag that would have broken him in two the pack stretched out in wild staccato chorus the little airedales literally screeching jim got out of our sight and then sampson still it was ever more thrilling to follow by sound rather than sight they led up a thick steep slope here we got into trouble in the windfalls of timber and the pack drew away from us up over the mountain we were half way up when we heard them jump the bear the forest seemed full of strife and bays and yelps we heard the dogs go down again to our right and as we turned we saw teague and the others strung out along the edge of the park they got far ahead of us when we reached the bottom of the slope they were out of sight but we could hear them yell the hounds were working around on another slope from which craggy rocks loomed above the timber rcs horse lunged across the park and appeared to be running off from mine i was a little to the right and when my horse got under way full speed we had the bad luck to plunge suddenly into soft ground he went to his knees and i sailed out of the saddle fully twenty feet to alight all spread out and to slide like a plow i did not seem to be hurt when i got up my horse was coming and he appeared to be patient with me but he was in a hurry before we got across the wet place rc was out of sight i decided that instead of worrying about him i had better think about myself once on hard ground my horse fairly charged into the woods and we broke brush and branches as if they had been punk it was again open forest then a rocky slope and then a flat ridge with aisles between the trees here i heard the melodious notes of teagues hunting horn and following that the full chorus of the hounds they had treed the bear coming into still more open forest with rocks here and there i caught sight of rc far ahead and soon i had glimpses of the other horses and lastly while riding full tilt i spied a big black glistening bear high up in a pine a hundred yards or more distant  slowing down i rode up to the circle of frenzied dogs and excited men the boys were all jabbering at once teague was beaming rc sat his horse and it struck me that he looked sorry for the bear  fifteen minutes ejaculated teague with a proud glance at old jim standing with forepaws up on the pine  indeed it had been a short and ringing chase  all the time while i fooled around trying to photograph the treed bear rc sat there on his horse looking upward  well gentlemen better kill him said teague cheerfully if he gets rested hell come down  it was then i suggested to rc that he do the shooting  not much he exclaimed  the bear looked really pretty perched up there he was as round as a barrel and black as jet and his fur shone in the gleams of sunlight his tongue hung out and his plump sides heaved showing what a quick hard run he had made before being driven to the tree what struck me most forcibly about him was the expression in his eyes as he looked down at those devils of hounds he was scared he realized his peril it was utterly impossible for me to see teagues point of view  go aheadand plug him i replied to my brother get it over  you do it he said  no i wont  why notid like to know  maybe we wont have so good a chance againand i want you to get your bear i replied  why its likemurder he protested  oh not so bad as that i returned weakly we need the meat weve not had any game meat you know except ducks and grouse  you wont do it he added grimly  no i refuse  meanwhile the young ranchers gazed at us with wide eyes and the expression on teagues honest ruddy face would have been funny under other circumstances  that bear will come down an mebbe kill one of my dogs he protested  well he can come for all i care i replied positively and i turned away  i heard rc curse low under his breath then followed the spang of his 35 remington i wheeled in time to see the bear straining upward in terrible convulsion his head pointed high with blood spurting from his nose slowly he swayed and fell with a heavy crash  illustration crossing the colorado river at the bottom of the grand canyon  illustration where rolls the colorado  the next bear chase we had was entirely different medicine  off in the basin under the white slides back of our camp the hounds struck a fresh track and in an instant were out of sight with the cowboy vern setting the pace we plunged after them it was rough country bogs brooks swales rocky little parks stretches of timber full of windfalls groves of aspens so thick we could scarcely squeeze throughall these obstacles soon allowed the hounds to get far away we came out into a large park right under the mountain slope and here we sat our horses listening to the chase that trail led around the basin and back near to us up the thick green slope where high up near a ledge we heard the pack jump this bear it sounded to us as if he had been roused out of a sleep  ill bet its one of the big grizzlies weve heard about said teague  that was something to my taste i have seen a few grizzlies riding to higher ground i kept close watch on the few open patches up on the slope the chase led toward us for a while suddenly i saw a big bear with a frosted coat go lumbering across one of these openings  silvertip silvertip i yelled at the top of my lungs i saw him  my call thrilled everybody vern spurred his horse and took to the right teague advised that we climb the slope so we made for the timber once there we had to get off and climb on foot it was steep rough very hard work i had on chaps and spurs soon i was hot laboring and my heart began to hurt we all had to rest the baying of the hounds inspirited us now and then but presently we lost it teague said they had gone over the ridge and as soon as we got up to the top we would hear them again we struck an elk trail with fresh elk tracks in it teague said they were just ahead of us i never climbed so hard and fast in my life we were all tuckered out when we reached the top of the ridge then to our great disappointment we did not hear the hounds mounting we rode along the crest of this wooded ridge toward the western end which was considerably higher once on a bare patch of ground we saw where the grizzly had passed the big round tracks toeing in a little made a chill go over me no doubt of its being a silvertip  we climbed and rode to the high point and coming out upon the summit of the mountain we all heard the deep hoarse baying of the pack they were in the canyon down a bare grassy slope and over a wooded bench at our feet teague yelled as he spurred down rc rode hard in his tracks  but my horse was new to this bear chasing he was mettlesome and he did not want to do what i wanted when i jabbed the spurs into his flanks he nearly bucked me off i was looking for a soft place to light when he quit long before i got down that open slope teague and rc had disappeared i had to follow their tracks this i did at a gallop but now and then lost the tracks and had to haul in to find them if i could have heard the hounds from there i would have gone on anyway but once down in the jackpines i could hear neither yell or bay the pines were small close together and tough i hurt my hands scratched my face barked my knees the horse had a habit of suddenly deciding to go the way he liked instead of the way i guided him and when he plunged between saplings too close together to permit us both to go through it was exceedingly hard on me i was worked into a frenzy suppose rc should come face to face with that old grizzly and fail to kill him that was the reason for my desperate hurry i got a crack on the head that nearly blinded me my horse grew hot and began to run in every little open space he could scarcely be held in and i with the blood hot in me too did not hold him hard enough  it seemed miles across that wooded bench but at last i reached another slope coming out upon a canyon rim i heard rc and teague yelling and i heard the hounds fighting the grizzly he was growling and threshing about far below i had missed the tracks made by teague and my brother and it was necessary to find them that slope looked impassable i rode back along the rim then forward finally i found where the ground was plowed deep and here i headed my horse he had been used to smooth roads and he could not take these jumps i went forward on his neck but i hung on and spurred him hard the mad spirit of that chase had gotten into him too all the time i could hear the fierce baying and yelping of the hounds and occasionally i heard a savage bawl from the bear i literally plunged slid broke a way down that mountain slope riding all the time before i discovered the footprints of teague and rc they had walked leading their horses by this time i was so mad i would not get off i rode all the way down that steep slope of dense saplings loose rock slides and earth and jumble of splintered cliff that he did not break my neck and his own spoke the truth about that roan horse despite his inexperience he was great we fell over one bank but a thicket of aspens saved us from rolling the avalanches slid from under us until i imagined that the grizzly would be scared once as i stopped to listen i heard bear and pack farther down the canyonheard them above the roar of a rushing stream they went on and i lost the sounds of fight but rcs clear thrilling call floated up to me probably he was worried about me  then before i realized it i was at the foot of the slope in a narrow canyon bed full of rocks and trees with the din of roaring water in my ears i could hear nothing else tracks were everywhere and when i came to the first open place i was thrilled the grizzly had plunged off a sandy bar into the water and there he had fought the hounds signs of that battle were easy to read i saw where his huge tracks still wet led up the opposite sandy bank  then down stream i did my most reckless riding on level ground the horse was splendid once he leaped clear across the brook every plunge every turn i expected to bring me upon my brother and teague and that fighting pack more than once i thought i heard the spang of the 35 and this made me urge the roan faster and faster  the canyon narrowed the streambed deepened i had to slow down to get through the trees and rocks and suddenly i was overjoyed to ride pellmell upon rc and teague with half the panting hounds the canyon had grown too rough for the horses to go farther and it would have been useless for us to try on foot as i dismounted so sore and bruised i could hardly stand old jim came limping in to fall into the brook where he lapped and lapped thirstily teague threw up his hands old jims return meant an ended chase the grizzly had eluded the hounds in that jumble of rocks below  say did you meet the bear queried teague eyeing me in astonishment and mirth  bloody dirty ragged and wringing wet with sweat i must have been a sight rc however did not look so very immaculate and when i saw he also was lame and scratched and black i felt better     chapter iii   roping lions in the grand canyon  i  the grand canyon of arizona is over two hundred miles long thirteen wide and a mile and a half deep a titanic gorge in which mountains tablelands chasms and cliffs lie half veiled in purple haze it is wild and sublime a thing of wonder of mystery beyond all else a place to grip the heart of a man to unleash his daring spirit  on april 20th 1908 after days on the hot desert my weary party and pack train reached the summit of powells plateau the most isolated inaccessible and remarkable mesa of any size in all the canyon country cut off from the mainland it appeared insurmountable standing aloof from the towers and escarpments rugged and bold in outline its forest covering like a strip of black velvet its giant granite walls gold in the sun it seemed apart from the world haunting with its beauty isolation and wild promise  the members of my party harmoniously fitted the scene buffalo jones burlyshouldered bronzefaced and grim proved in his appearance what a lifetime on the plains could make of a man emett was a mormon a massively built greybearded son of the desert he had lived his life on it he had conquered it and in his falcon eyes shone all its fire and freedom ranger jim owens had the wiry supple body and careless tidy garb of the cowboy and the watchful gaze quiet face and locked lips of the frontiersman the fourth member was a navajo indian a copperskinned ravenhaired beadyeyed desert savage  i had told emett to hire some one who could put the horses on grass in the evening and then find them the next morning in northern arizona this required more than genius emett secured the best trailer of the desert navajos jones hated an indian and jim who carried an ounce of lead somewhere in his person associated this painful addition to his weight with an unfriendly apache and swore all indians should be dead so between the two emett and i had trouble in keeping our navajo from illustrating the plainsman idea of a really good indiana dead one  while we were pitching camp among magnificent pine trees and above a hollow where a heavy bank of snow still lay a sodden pounding in the turf attracted our attention  hold the horses yelled emett  as we all made a dive among our snorting and plunging horses the sound seemed to be coming right into camp in a moment i saw a string of wild horses thundering by a noble black stallion led them and as he ran with beautiful stride he curved his fine head backward to look at us and whistled his wild challenge  later a herd of large whitetailed deer trooped up the hollow the navajo grew much excited and wanted me to shoot and when emett told him we had not come out to kill he looked dumbfounded even the indian felt it a strange departure from the usual mode of hunting to travel and climb hundreds of miles over hot desert and rockribbed canyons to camp at last in a spot so wild that deer were tame as cattle and then not kill  nothing could have pleased me better incident to the settling into permanent camp the wild horses and tame deer added the allsatisfying touch to the background of forest flowers and mighty pines and sunlit patches of grass the white tents and red blankets the sleeping hounds and blazing firelogs all making a picture like that of a hunters dream  come saddle up called the never restful jones leave the indian in camp with the hounds and well get the lay of the land all afternoon we spent riding the plateau what a wonderful place we were completely bewildered with its physical properties and surprised at the abundance of wild horses and mustangs deer coyotes foxes grouse and other birds and overjoyed to find innumerable lion trails when we returned to camp i drew a rough map which jones laid flat on the ground as he called us around him  now boys lets get our heads together  in shape the plateau resembled the ace of clubs the center and side wings were high and well wooded with heavy pines the middle wing was longest sloped west had no pine but a dense growth of cedar numerous ridges and canyons cut up this central wing middle canyon the longest and deepest bisected the plateau headed near camp and ran parallel with two smaller ones which we named right and left canyons these three were lion runways and hundreds of deer carcasses lined the thickets north hollow was the only depression as well as runway on the northwest rim west point formed the extreme western cape of the plateau to the left of west point was a deep cutin of the rim wall called the bay the three important canyons opened into it from the bay the south rim was regular and impassable all the way round to the narrow saddle which connected it to the mainland  now then said jones when we assured him that we were pretty well informed as to the important features you can readily see our advantage the plateau is about nine or ten miles long and six wide at its widest we cant get lost at least for long we know where lions can go over the rim and well head them off make short cut chases something new in lion hunting we are positive the lions can not get over the second wall except where we came up at the saddle in regard to lion signs im doubtful of the evidence of my own eyes this is virgin ground no white man or indian has ever hunted lions here we have stumbled on a lion home the breeding place of hundreds of lions that infest the north rim of the canyon  the old plainsman struck a big fist into the palm of his hand a rare action with him jim lifted his broad hat and ran his fingers through his white hair in emetts clear deserteagle eyes shown a furtive anxious look which yet could not overshadow the smouldering fire  if only we dont kill the horses he said  more than anything else that remark from such a man thrilled me with its subtle suggestion he loved those beautiful horses what wild rides he saw in his minds eye in cold calculation we perceived the wonderful possibilities never before experienced by hunters and as the wild spell clutched us my last bar of restraint let down  during supper we talked incessantly and afterward around the campfire twilight fell with the dark shadows sweeping under the silent pines the night wind rose and began its moan  shore theres some scent on the wind said jim lighting his pipe with a red ember see how uneasy don is  the hound raised his fine dark head and repeatedly sniffed the air then walked to and fro as if on guard for his pack moze ground his teeth on a bone and growled at one of the pups sounder was sleepy but he watched don with suspicious eyes the other hounds mature and somber lay stretched before the fire  tie them up jim said jones and lets turn in   ii  when i awakened next morning the sound of emetts axe rang out sharply little streaks of light from the campfire played between the flaps of the tent i saw old moze get up and stretch himself a jangle of cowbells from the forest told me we would not have to wait for the horses that morning  the injuns all right jones remarked to emett  all rustle for breakfast called jim  we ate in the semidarkness with the gray shadow ever brightening dawn broke as we saddled our horses the pups were limber and ran to and fro on their chains scenting the air the older hounds stood quietly waiting  come navvycome chase cougie said emett  dam no replied the indian  let him keep camp suggested jim  all right but hell eat us out emett declared  climb up you fellows said jones impatiently have i got everythingrope chains collars wire nippers yes all right hyar you lazy dogsout of this  we rode abreast down the ridge the demeanor of the hounds contrasted sharply with what it had been at the start of the hunt the year before then they had been eager uncertain violent they did not know what was in the air now they filed after don in an orderly trot  we struck out of the pines at half past five floating mist hid the lower end of the plateau the morning had a cool touch but there was no frost crossing middle canyon about half way down we jogged on cedar trees began to show bright green against the soft gray sage we were nearing the dark line of the cedar forest when jim who led held up his hand in a warning check we closed in around him  watch don he said  the hound stood stiff head well up nose working and the hair on his back bristling all the other hounds whined and kept close to him  don scents a lion whispered jim ive never known him to do that unless there was the scent of a lion on the wind  hunt em up don old boy called jones  the pack commenced to work back and forth along the ridge we neared a hollow when don barked eagerly sounder answered and likewise jude mozes short angry bowwow showed the old gladiator to be in line  rangers gone cried jim he was farthest ahead ill bet hes struck it well know in a minute for were close  the hounds were tearing through the sage working harder and harder calling and answering one another all the time getting down into the hollow  don suddenly let out a string of yelps i saw him running head up pass into the cedars like a yellow dart sounder howled his deep full bay and led the rest of the pack up the slope in angry clamor  theyre off yelled jim and so were we  in less than a minute we had lost one another crashings among the dry cedars thud of hoofs and yells kept me going in one direction the fiery burst of the hounds had surprised me i remembered that jim had said emett and his charger might keep the pack in sight but that none of the rest of us could  it did not take me long to realize what my mustang was made of his name was foxie which suited him well he carried me at a fast pace on the trail of some one and he seemed to know that by keeping in this trail part of the work of breaking through the brush was already done for him nevertheless the sharp dead branches more numerous in a cedar forest than elsewhere struck and stung us as we passed we climbed a ridge and found the cedars thinning out into open patches then we faced a bare slope of sage and i saw emett below on his big horse  foxie bolted down this slope hurdling the bunches of sage and showing the speed of which emett had boasted the open ground with its brush rock and gullies was easy going for the little mustang i heard nothing save the wind singing in my ears emetts trail plain in the yellow ground showed me the way on entering the cedars again i pulled foxie in and stopped twice to yell waahoo i heard the baying of the hounds but no answer to my signal then i attended to the stern business of catching up for what seemed a long time i threaded the maze of cedar galloped the open sage flats always on emetts track  a signal cry sharp to the right turned me i answered and with the exchange of signal cries found my way into an open glade where jones and jim awaited me  heres one said jim emett must be with the hounds listen  with the labored breathing of the horses filling our ears we could hear no other sound dismounting i went aside and turned my ear to the breeze  i hear don i cried instantly  which way both men asked  west  strange said jones the hound wouldnt split would he jim  don leave that hot trail shore he wouldnt replied jim but his runnin do seem queer this morning  the breeze is freshening i said there now listen don and sounder too  the baying came closer and closer our horses threw up long ears it was hard to sit still and wait at a quick cry from jim we saw don cross the lower end of the flat  no need to spur our mounts the lifting of bridles served and away we raced foxie passed the others in short order don had long disappeared but with blended bays jude moze and sounder broke out of the cedars hot on the trail they too were out of sight in a moment  the crash of breaking brush and thunder of hoofs from where the hounds had come out of the forest attracted and even frightened me i saw the green of a low cedar tree shake and split to let out a huge gaunt horse with a big man doubled over his saddle the onslaught of emett and his desert charger stirred a fear in me that checked admiration  hounds running wild he yelled and the dark shadows of the cedars claimed him again  a hundred yards within the forest we came again upon emett dismounted searching the ground moze and sounder were with him apparently at fault suddenly moze left the little glade and venting his sullen quick bark disappeared under the trees sounder sat on his haunches and yelped  now what the hell is wrong growled jones tumbling off his saddle  shore something is said jim also dismounting  heres a lion track interposed emett  ha and heres another cried jones in great satisfaction thats the trail we were on and heres another crossing it at right angles both are fresh one isnt fifteen minutes old don and jude have split one way and moze another by george thats great of sounder to hang fire  put him on the fresh trail said jim vaulting into his saddle  jones complied with the result that we saw sounder start off on the trail moze had taken all of us got in some pretty hard riding and managed to stay within earshot of sounder we crossed a canyon and presently reached another which from its depth must have been middle canyon sounder did not climb the opposite slope so we followed the rim from a bare ridge we distinguished the line of pines above us and decided that our location was in about the center of the plateau  very little time elapsed before we heard moze sounder had caught up with him we came to a halt where the canyon widened and was not so deep with cliffs and cedars opposite us and an easy slope leading down sounder bayed incessantly moze emitted harsh eager howls and both hounds in plain sight began working in circles  the lion has gone up somewhere cried jim look sharp  repeatedly moze worked to the edge of a low wall of stone and looked over then he barked and ran back to the slope only to return when i saw him slide down a steep place make for the bottom of the stone wall and jump into the low branches of a cedar i knew where to look then i descried the lion a round yellow ball cunningly curled up in a mass of dark branches he had leaped into the tree from the wall  there he is treed treed i yelled moze has found him  down boys down into the canyon shouted jones in sharp voice make a racket we dont want him to jump  how he and jim and emett rolled and cracked the stone for a moment i could not get off my horse i was chained to my saddle by a strange vacillation that could have been no other thing than fear  are you afraid called jones from below  yes but i am coming i replied and dismounted to plunge down the hill it may have been shame or anger that dominated me then whatever it was i made directly for the cedar and did not halt until i was under the snarling lion  not too close warned jones he might jump its a tom a twoyearold and full of fight  it did not matter to me then whether he jumped or not i knew i had to be cured of my dread and the sooner it was done the better  old moze had already climbed a third of the distance up to the lion  hyar moze out of there you rascal coon chaser jones yelled as he threw stones and sticks at the hound moze however replied with his snarly bark and climbed on steadily  ive got to pull him out watch close boys and tell me if the lion starts down  when jones climbed the first few branches of the tree tom let out an ominous growl  make ready to jump shore hes comin called jim  the lion snarling viciously started to descend it was a ticklish moment for all of us particularly jones warily he backed down  boys maybe hes bluffing said jones try him out grab sticks and run at the tree and yell as if you were going to kill him  not improbably the demonstration we executed under the tree would have frightened even an african lion tom hesitated showed his white fangs returned to his first perch and from there climbed as far as he could the forked branch on which he stood swayed alarmingly  here punch moze out said jim handing up a long pole  the old hound hung like a leech to the tree making it difficult to dislodge him at length he fell heavily and venting his thick battle cry attempted to climb again  jim seized him made him fast to the rope with which sounder had already been tied  say emett ive no chance here called jones you try to throw at him from the rock  emett ran up the rock coiled his lasso and cast the noose it sailed perfectly in between the branches and circled toms head before it could be slipped tight he had thrown it off then he hid behind the branches  im going farther up said jones  be quick yelled jim  jones evidently had that in mind when he reached the middle fork of the cedar he stood erect and extended the noose of his lasso on the point of his pole tom with a hiss and snap struck at it savagely the second trial tempted the lion to saw the rope with his teeth in a flash jones withdrew the pole and lifted a loop of the slack rope over the lions ears  pull he yelled  emett at the other end of the lasso threw his great strength into action pulling the lion out with a crash and giving the cedar such a tremendous shaking that jones lost his footing and fell heavily  thrilling as the moment was i had to laugh for jones came up out of a cloud of dust as angry as a wet hornet and made prodigious leaps to get out of the reach of the whirling lion  look out he bawled  tom certainly none the worse for his tumble made three leaps two at jones one at jim which was checked by the short length of the rope in emetts hands then for a moment a thick cloud of dust enveloped the wrestling lion during which the quickwitted jones tied the free end of the lasso to a sapling  dod gast the luck yelled jones reaching for another lasso i didnt mean for you to pull him out of the tree now hell get loose or kill himself  when the dust cleared away we discovered our prize stretched out at full length and frothing at the mouth as jones approached the lion began a series of evolutions so rapid as to be almost indiscernible to the eye i saw a wheel of dust and yellow fur then came a thud and the lion lay inert  jones pounced upon him and loosed the lasso around his neck  i think hes done for but maybe not hes breathing yet here help me tie his paws together look out hes coming to  the lion stirred and raised his head jones ran the loop of the second lasso around the two hind paws and stretched the lion out while in this helpless position and with no strength and hardly any breath left in him the lion was easy to handle with emetts help jones quickly clipped the sharp claws tied the four paws together took off the neck lasso and substituted a collar and chain  there thats one hell come to all right said jones but we are lucky emett never pull another lion clear out of a tree pull him over a limb and hang him there while some one below ropes his hind paws thats the only way and if we dont stick to it somebody is going to get done for come now well leave this fellow here and hunt up don and jude theyve treed another lion by this time  remarkable to me was to see how as soon as the lion lay helpless sounder lost his interest moze growled yet readily left the spot before we reached the level both hounds had disappeared  illustration down the shinumo trail of the north river  illustration camp at the saddle  hear that yelled jones digging spurs into his horse hi hi hi  from the cedars rang the thrilling blending chorus of bays that told of a treed lion the forest was almost impenetrable we had to pick our way emett forged ahead we heard him smashing the deadwood and soon a yell proclaimed the truth of jones assertion  first i saw the men looking upward then moze climbing the cedar and the other hounds with noses skyward and last in the dead top of the tree a dark blot against the blue a big tawny lion  whoop the yell leaped past my lips quiet jim was yelling and emett silent man of the desert let from his wide cavernous chest a booming roar that drowned ours  jones next decisive action turned us from exultation to the grim business of the thing he pulled moze out of the cedar and while he climbed up emett ran his rope under the collars of all of the hounds quick as the idea flashed over me i leaped into the cedar adjoining the one jones was in and went up hand over hand a few pulls brought me to the top and then my blood ran hot and quick for i was level with the lion too close for comfort but in excellent position for taking pictures  the lion not heeding me peered down at jones between widespread paws i could hear nothing except the hounds jones gray hat came pushing up between the dead snags then his burly shoulders the quivering muscles of the lion gathered tense and his lithe body crouched low on the branches he was about to jump his open dripping jaws his wild eyes roving in terror for some means of escape his tufted tail swinging against the twigs and breaking them manifested his extremity the eager hounds waited below howling leaping  it bothered me considerably to keep my balance regulate my camera and watch the proceedings jones climbed on with his rope between his teeth and a long stick the very next instant it seemed to me i heard the cracking of branches and saw the lion biting hard at the noose which circled his neck  here i swung down branch to branch and dropped to the ground for i wanted to see what went on below above the howls and yelps i distinguished jones yell emett ran directly under the lion with a spread noose in his hands jones pulled and pulled but the lion held on firmly throwing the end of the lasso down to jim jones yelled again and then they both pulled the lion was too strong suddenly however the branch broke letting the lion fall kicking frantically with all four paws emett grasped one of the four whipping paws and even as the powerful animal sent him staggering he dexterously left the noose fast on the paw jim and jones in unison let go of their lasso which streaked up through the branches as the lion fell and then it dropped to the ground where jim made a flying grab for it jones plunging out of the tree fell upon the rope at the same instant  if the action up to then had been fast it was slow to what followed it seemed impossible for two strong men with one lasso and a giant with another to straighten out that lion he was all over the little space under the trees at once the dust flew the sticks snapped the gravel pattered like shot against the cedars jones ploughed the ground flat on his stomach holding on with one hand with the other trying to fasten the rope to something jim went to his knees and on the other side of the lion emetts huge bulk tipped a sharp angle and then fell  i shouted and ran forward having no idea what to do but emett rolled backward at the same instant the other men got a strong haul on the lion short as that moment was in which the lasso slackened it sufficed for jones to make the rope fast to a tree whereupon with the three men pulling on the other side of the leaping lion somehow i had flashed into my mind the game that children play called skipping the rope for the lion and lasso shot up and down  this lasted for only a few seconds they stretched the beast from tree to tree and jones running with the third lasso made fast the front paws  its a female said jones as the lion lay helpless her sides swelling a goodsized female shes nearly eight feet from tip to tip but not very heavy hand me another rope  when all four lassos had been stretched the lioness could not move jones strapped a collar around her neck and clipped the sharp yellow claws  now to muzzle her he continued  jones method of performing this most hazardous part of the work was characteristic of him he thrust a stick between her open jaws and when she crushed it to splinters he tried another and yet another until he found one that she could not break then while she bit on it he placed a wire loop over her nose slowly tightening it leaving the stick back of her big canines  the hounds ceased their yelping and when untied sounder wagged his tail as if to say well done and then lay down don walked within three feet of the lion as if she were now beneath his dignity jude began to nurse and lick her sore paw only moze the incorrigible retained antipathy for the captive and he growled as always low and deep and on the moment ranger dusty and lame from travel trotted wearily into the glade and looking at the lioness gave one disgusted bark and flopped down   iii  transporting our captives to camp bade fair to make us work when jones who had gone after the pack horses hove in sight on the sage flat it was plain to us that we were in for trouble the bay stallion was on the rampage  why didnt you fetch the indian growled emett who lost his temper when matters concerning his horses went wrong spread out boys and head him off  we contrived to surround the stallion and emett succeeded in getting a halter on him  i didnt want the bay explained jones but i couldnt drive the others without him when i told that redskin that we had two lions he ran off into the woods so i had to come alone  im going to scalp the navajo said jim complacently  these remarks were exchanged on the open ridge at the entrance to the thick cedar forest the two lions lay just within its shady precincts emett and i using a long pole in lieu of a horse had carried tom up from the canyon to where we had captured the lioness  jones had brought a packsaddle and two panniers  illustration buckskin forest  illustration buffalo jones with sounder and ranger  when emett essayed to lead the horse which carried these the animal stood straight up and began to show some of his primal desert instincts it certainly was good luck that we unbuckled the packsaddle straps before he left the vicinity in about three jumps he had separated himself from the panniers which were then placed upon the back of another horse this one a fine looking beast and amiable under surroundings where his life and health were considered even a little immediately disclaimed any intention of entering the forest  they scent the lions said jones i was afraid of it never had but one nag that would pack lions  maybe we cant pack them at all replied emett dubiously its certainly new to me  weve got to jones asserted try the sorrel  for the first time in a serviceable and honorable life according to emett the sorrel broke his halter and kicked like a plantation mule  its a matter of fright try the stallion he doesnt look afraid said jones who never knew when he was beaten  emett gazed at jones as if he had not heard right  go ahead try the stallion i like the way he looks  no wonder the big stallion looked a king of horsesjust what he would have been if emett had not taken him when a colt from his wild desert brothers he scented the lions and he held his proud head up his ears erect and his large dark eyes shone fiery and expressive  ill try to lead him in and let him see the lions we cant fool him said emett  marc showed no hesitation nor anything we expected he stood stifflegged and looked as if he wanted to fight  hes all right hell pack them declared jones  the packsaddle being strapped on and the panniers hooked to the horns jones and jim lifted tom and shoved him down into the left pannier while emett held the horse a madder lion than tom never lived it was cruel enough to be lassoed and disgrace enough to be hogtied as jim called it but to be thrust down into a bag and packed on a horse was adding insult to injury tom frothed at the mouth and seemed like a fizzing torpedo about to explode the lioness being considerably longer and larger was with difficulty gotten into the other pannier and her head and paws hung out both lions kept growling and snarling  i look to see marc bolt over the rim said emett resignedly as jones took up the end of the rope halter  no siree sang out that worthy hes helping us out hes proud to show up the other nags  jones was always asserting strange traits in animals and giving them intelligence and reason as to that many incidents coming under my observation while with him and seen with his eyes made me incline to his claims the fruit of a lifetime with animals  marc packed the lions to camp in short order and quoting jones without turning a hair we saw the navajos head protruding from a tree emett yelled for him and jones and jim hahaed derisively whereupon the black head vanished and did not reappear then they unhooked one of the panniers and dumped out the lioness jones fastened her chain to a small pine tree and as she lay powerless he pulled out the stick back of her canines this allowed the wire muzzle to fall off she signalled this freedom with a roar that showed her health to be still unimpaired the last action in releasing her from her painful bonds jones performed with sleightofhand dexterity he slipped the loop fastening one paw which loosened the rope and in a twinkling let her work all of her other paws free up she sprang ears flat eyes ablaze mouth wide once more capable of defense true to her instinct and her name  before the men lowered tom from marcs back i stepped closer and put my face within six inches of the lions he promptly spat on me i had to steel my nerve to keep so close but i wanted to see a wild lions eyes at close range they were exquisitely beautiful their physical properties as wonderful as their expression great half globes of tawny amber streaked with delicate wavy lines of black surrounding pupils of intense purple fire pictures shone and faded in the amber lightthe shaggy tipped plateau the dark pines and smoky canyons the great dotted downward slopes the yellow cliffs and crags deep in those live pupils changing quickening with a thousand vibrations quivered the soul of this savage beast the wildest of all wild nature unquenchable love of life and freedom flame of defiance and hate  jones disposed of tom in the same manner as he had the lioness chaining him to an adjoining small pine where he leaped and wrestled  presently i saw emett coming through the woods leading and dragging the indian i felt sorry for the navvy for i felt that his fear was not so much physical as spiritual and it seemed no wonder to me that the navvy should hang back from this sacrilegious treatment of his god a natural wisdom which i had in common with all human beings who consider self preservation the first law of life deterred me from acquainting my august companions with my belief at least i did not want to break up the camp  in the remorseless grasp of emett forced along the navajo dragged his feet and held his face sidewise though his dark eyes gleamed at the lions terror predominated among the expressions of his countenance emett drew him within fifteen feet and held him there and with voice and gesticulating of his free hand tried to show the poor fellow that the lions would not hurt him  navvy stared and muttered to himself here jim had some deviltry in mind for he edged up closer but what it was never transpired for emett suddenly pointed to the horses and said to the indian  chineago feed  it appeared when navvy swung himself over marcs broad back that our great stallion had laid aside his transiently noble disposition and was himself again marc proceeded to show us how truly jim had spoken shore he aint no use for the redskin before the indian had fairly gotten astride marc dropped his head humped his shoulders brought his feet together and began to buck now the navajo was a famous breaker of wild mustangs but marc was a tougher proposition than the wildest mustang that ever romped the desert not only was he unusually vigorous he was robust and heavy yet exceedingly active i had seen him roll over in the dust three times each way and do it easilya feat emett declared he had never seen performed by another horse  navvy began to bounce he showed his teeth and twisted his sinewy hands in the horses mane marc began to act like a demon he plowed the ground apparently he bucked five feet straight up as the indian had bounced he now began to shoot into the air he rose the last time with his heels over his head to the full extent of his arms and on plunging down his hold broke he spun around the horse then went hurtling to the ground some twenty feet away he sat up and seeing emett and jones laughing and jim prostrated with joy he showed his white teeth in a smile and said  no bueno dam  i think all of us respected navvy for his good humor and especially when he walked up to marc and with no show of the mean indian patted the glossy neck and then nimbly remounted marc not being so difficult to please as jim in the way of discomfiting the navajo appeared satisfied for the present and trotted off down the hollow with the string of horses ahead their bells jingling  campfire tasks were a necessary wage in order to earn the full enjoyment and benefit of the hunting trip and looking for some task with which to turn my hand i helped jim feed the hounds to feed ordinary dogs is a matter of throwing them a bone however our dogs were not ordinary it took time to feed them and a prodigious amount of meat we had packed between three and four hundred pounds of wildhorse meat which had been cut into small pieces and strung on the branches of a scrub oak near camp  don as befitted a gentleman and the leader of the greatest pack in the west had to be fed by hand i believe he would rather had starved than have demeaned himself by fighting starved he certainly would have if jim had thrown meat indiscriminately to the ground sounder asserted his rights and preferred large portions at a time jude begged with great solemn eyes but was no slouch at eating for all her gentleness ranger because of imperfectly developed teeth rendering mastication difficult had to have his share cut into very small pieces as for mozewell great dogs have their faults as do great menhe never got enough meat he would fight even poor crippled jude and steal even from the pups when he had gotten all jim would give him and all he could snatch he would growl away with bulging sides  how about feeding the lions asked emett  theyll drink tonight replied jones but wont eat for days then well tempt them with fresh rabbits  we made a hearty meal succeeding which jones and i walked through the woods toward the rim a yellow promontory huge and glistening invited us westward and after a detour of half a mile we reached it the points of the rim striking out into the immense void always drew me irresistibly we found the view from this rock one of startling splendor the corrugated rimwall of the middle wing extended to the west at this moment apparently running into the setting sun the gold glare touching up the millions of facets of chiseled stone created color and brilliance too glorious and intense for the gaze of men and looking downward was like looking into the placid blue bottomless depths of the pacific  here help me push off this stone i said to jones we heaved a huge round stone and were encouraged to feel it move fortunately we had a little slope the boulder groaned rocked and began to slide just as it toppled over i glanced at the second hand of my watch then with eyes over the rim we waited the silence was the silence of the canyon dead and vast intensified by our breathless earstrain ten long palpitating seconds and no sound i gave up the distance was too great for sound to reach us fifteen secondsseventeeneighteen  with that a puff of air seemed to rise and on it the most awful bellow of thunderous roar it rolled up and widened deadened to burst out and roll louder then slowly like mountains on wheels rumbled under the rimwalls passing on and on to roar back in echo from the cliffs of the mesas roar and rumbleroar and rumble for two long moments the dull and hollow echoes rolled at us to die away slowly in the fardistant canyons  thats a darned deep hole commented jones  twilight stole down on us idling there silent content to watch the red glow pass away from the buttes and peaks the color deepening downward to meet the ebon shades of night creeping up like a dark tide  on turning toward the camp we essayed a short cut which brought us to a deep hollow with stony walls which seemed better to go around the hollow however was quite long and we decided presently to cross it we descended a little way when jones suddenly barred my progress with his big arm  listen he whispered  it was quiet in the woods only a faint breeze stirred the pine needles and the weird gray darkness seemed to be approaching under the trees  i heard the patter of light hard hoofs on the scaly sides of the hollow  deer i asked my companion in a low voice  yes see he replied pointing ahead just right under that broken wall of rock right there on this side theyre going down  i descried gray objects the color of the rocks moving down like shadows  have they scented us  hardly the breeze is against us maybe they heard us break a twig theyve stopped but they are not looking our way now i wonder  rattling of stones set into movement by some quick sharp action an indistinct crash but sudden as of the impact of soft heavy bodies a strange wild sound preceded in rapid succession violent brushings and thumpings in the scrub of the hollow  lion jumped a deer yelled jones right under our eyes come on hi hi hi  he ran down the incline yelling all of the way and i kept close to him adding my yells to his and gripping my revolver toward the bottom the thicket barred our progress so that we had to smash through and i came out a little ahead of jones and farther up the hollow i saw a gray swiftly bounding object too long and too low for a deer and i hurriedly shot six times at it  by george come here called my companion hows this for quick work its a yearling doe  in another moment i leaned over a gray mass huddled at jones feet it was a deer gasping and choking i plainly heard the wheeze of blood in its throat and the sound like a deathrattle affected me powerfully bending closer i saw where one side of the neck low down had been terribly lacerated  waahoo pealed down the slope  thats emett cried jones answering the signal if you have another shot put this doe out of agony  but i had not a shot left nor did either of us have a clasp knife we stood there while the doe gasped and quivered the peculiar sound probably made by the intake of air through the laceration of the throat on the spur of the moment seemed pitifully human  i felt that the struggle for life and death in any living thing was a horrible spectacle with great interest i had studied natural selection the variability of animals under different conditions of struggling existence the law whereby one animal struck down and devoured another but i had never seen and heard that law enacted on such a scale and suddenly i abhorred it  emett strode to us through the gathering darkness  whats up he asked quickly  he carried my remington in one hand and his winchester in the other and he moved so assuredly and loomed up so big in the dusk that i experienced a sudden little rush of feeling as to what his advent might mean at a time of real peril  illustration jones about to lasso a mountain lion  illustration remains of a deer killed by lions  emett ive lived to see many things replied jones but this is the first time i ever saw a lion jump a deer right under my nose  as emett bent over to seize the long ears of the deer i noticed the gasping had ceased  neck broken he said lifting the head well im danged must have been an allfired strong lion hell come back you may be sure of that lets skin out the quarters and hang the carcass up in a tree  we returned to camp in a half an hour the richer for our walk by a quantity of fresh venison upon being acquainted with our adventure jim expressed himself rather more fairly than was his customary way  shore that beats hell i knowed there was a lion somewheres because don wouldnt lie down id like to get a pop at the brute  i believed jims wish found an echo in all our hearts at any rate to hear emett and jones express regret over the death of the doe justified in some degree my own feelings and i thought it was not so much the death but the lingering and terrible manner of it and especially how vividly it connoted the wildlife drama of the plateau the tragedy we had all but interrupted occurred every night perhaps often in the day and likely at different points at the same time emett told how he had found fourteen piles of bleached bones and dried hair in the thickets of less than a mile of the hollow on which we were encamped  well rope the danged cats boys or well kill them  its blowing cold hey navvy coco coco called emett  the indian carefully laying aside his cigarette kicked up the fire and threw on more wood  discass cold he said to me coco bueno fire good  i replied me savvyyes  sleepie he asked  mucha i returned  while we carried on a sort of novel conversation full of navajo english and gestures darkness settled down black i saw the stars disappear the wind changing to the north grew colder and carried a breath of snow i like north wind bestfrom under the warm blanketsbecause of the roar and lull and lull and roar in the pines crawling into the bed presently i lay there and listened to the rising stormwind for a long time sometimes it swelled and crashed like the sound of a breaker on the beach but mostly from a low incessant moan it rose and filled to a mighty rush then suddenly lulled this lull despite a wakeful thronging mind was conducive to sleep   iv  to be awaked from pleasant dreams is the lot of man the navajo aroused me with his singing and when i peeped languidly from under the flap of my sleeping bag i felt a cold air and saw fleecy flakes of white drifting through the small window of my tent  snow by all thats lucky i exclaimed remembering jones hopes straightway my langour vanished and getting into my boots and coat i went outside navvys bed lay in six inches of snow the forest was beautifully white a fine dazzling snow was falling i walked to the roaring campfire jims biscuits wellbrowned and of generous size had just been dumped into the middle of our breakfast cloth a tarpaulin spread on the ground the coffee pot steamed fragrantly and a dutch oven sizzled with a great number of slices of venison did you hear the indian chanting asked jones who sat with his horny hands to the blaze  i heard his singing  no it wasnt a song the navajo never sings in the morning what you heard was his morning prayer a chant a religious and solemn ritual to the break of day emett says it is a custom of the desert tribe you remember how we saw the mokis sitting on the roofs of their little adobe huts in the gray of the morning they always greet the sun in that way the navajos chant  it certainly was worth remembering i thought and mentally observed that i would wake up thereafter and listen to the indian  good luck and bad went on jones snow is what we want but now we cant find the scent of our lion of last night  low growls and snarls attracted me both our captives presented sorry spectacles they were wet dirty bedraggled emett had chopped down a small pine the branches of which he was using to make shelter for the lions while i looked on tom tore his to pieces several times but the lioness crawled under hers and began licking her chops at length tom seeing that emett meant no underhand trick backed out of the drizzling snow and lay down  emett had already constructed a shack for the hounds it was a way of his to think of everything he had the most extraordinary ability a stroke of his axe a twist of his great hands a turn of this or that made camp a more comfortable place and if something no matter what got out of order or broken there was emett to show what it was to be a man of the desert it had been my good fortune to see many able men on the trail and round the campfire but not one of them even approached emetts class when i said a word to him about his knack with things his reply was illuminating im fiftyeight and four out of every five nights of my life i have slept away from home on the ground  chineago called jim who had begun with all of us to assimilate a little of the navajos language  whereupon we fell to eating with appetite unknown to any save hunters somehow the indian had gravitated to me at meal times and now he sat crosslegged beside me holding out his plate and looking as hungry as moze at first he had always asked for the same kind of food that i happened to have on my own plate when i had finished and had no desire to eat more he gave up his faculty of imitation and asked for anything he could get the navajo had a marvelous appetite he liked sweet things sugar best of all it was a fatal error to let him get his hands on a can of fruit although he inspired jones with disgust and jim with worse he was a source of unfailing pleasure to me he called me mista gay and he pronounced the words haltingly in low voice and with unmistakable respect  whats on for today queried emett  i guess we may as well hang around camp and rest the hounds replied jones i did intend to go after the lion that killed the deer but this snow has taken away the scent  shore itll stop snowin soon said jim  the falling snow had thinned out and looked like flying powder the leaden clouds rolling close to the treetops grew brighter and brighter bits of azure sky shone through rifts  navvy had tramped off to find the horses and not long after his departure he sent out a prolonged yell that echoed through the forest  somethings up said emett instantly an indian never yells like that at a horse  illustration a lion tied  illustration fighting weetahs buffalo bulls on buffalo joness desert ranch  we waited quietly for a moment expecting to hear the yell repeated it was not though we soon heard the jangle of bells which told us he had the horses coming he appeared off to the right riding foxie and racing the others toward camp  cougiemucha bigdam he said leaping off the mustang to confront us  emett does he mean he saw a cougar or a track questioned jones  me savvy replied the indian butteen butteen  he says trailtrail put in emett i guess id better go and see  ill go with you said jones jim keep the hounds tight and hurry with the horses oats  we followed the tracks of the horses which lead southwest toward the rim and a quarter of a mile from camp we crossed a lion trail running at right angles with our direction  old sultan i cried breathlessly recognizing that the tracks had been made by a giant lion we had named sultan they were huge round and deep and with my spread hand i could not reach across one of them  without a word jones strode off on the trail it headed east and after a short distance turned toward camp i suppose jones knew what the lion had been about but to emett and me it was mystifying two hundred yards from camp we came to a fallen pine the body of which was easily six feet high on the side of this log almost on top were two enormous lion tracks imprinted in the mantle of snow from here the trail led off northeast  darn me ejaculated jones the big critter came right into camp he scented our lions and raised up on this log to look over  wheeling he started for camp on the trot emett and i kept even with him words were superfluous we knew what was coming a madetoorder lion trail could not have equalled the one right in the back yard of our camp  saddle up said jones with the sharp inflection of words that had come to thrill me jim old sultan has taken a look at us since break of day  i got into my chaps rammed my little automatic into its saddle holster and mounted foxie seemed to want to go the hounds came out of their sheds and yawned looking at us knowingly emett spoke a word to the navajo and then we were trotting down through the forest the sun had broken out warm causing water to drip off the snow laden pines the three of us rode close behind jones who spoke low and sternly to the hounds  what an opportunity to watch don i wondered how soon he would catch the scent of the trail he led the pack as usual and kept to a leisurely dogtrot when within twenty yards of the fallen log he stopped for an instant and held up his head though without exhibiting any suspicion or uneasiness  the wind blew strong at our backs a circumstance that probably kept don so long in ignorance of the trail a few yards further on however he stopped and raised his fine head he lowered it and trotted on only to stop again his easy air of satisfaction with the morning suddenly vanished his savage hunting instinct awakened through some channel to raise the short yellow hair on his neck and shoulders and make it stand stiff he stood undecided with warily shifting nose then jumped forward with a yelp another jump brought another sharp cry from him sounder close behind echoed the yelp jude began to whine then don with a wild howl leaped ten feet to alight on the lion trail and to break into wonderfully rapid flight the seven other hounds bunched in a black and yellow group tore after him filling the forest with their wild uproar  emetts horse bounded as i have seen a great racer leave the post and his desert brothers loving wild bursts of speed needing no spur kept their noses even with his flanks the soft snow not too deep rather facilitated than impeded this wild movement and the open forest was like a highway  so we rode bending low in the saddle keen eyes alert for branches vaulting the whiteblanketed logs and swerving as we split to pass the pines the mist from the melting snow moistened our faces and the rushing air cooled them with fresh soft sensation there were moments when we rode abreast and others when we sailed single file with white ground receding vanishing behind us  my feeling was one of glorious excitation in the swift smooth flight and a grim assurance of soon seeing the old lion but i hoped we would not rout him too soon from under a windfall or a thicket where he had dragged a deer because the race was too splendid a thing to cut short through my mind whirled with inconceivable rapidity the great lion chases on which we had ridden the year before and this was another chase only more stirring more beautiful because it was the nature of the thing to grow always with experience  don slipped out of sight among the pines the others strung along the trail glinted across the sunlit patches the black pup was neck and neck with ranger sounder ran at their heels leading the other pups moze dashed on doggedly ahead of jude  but for us to keep to the open forest close to the hounds was not in the nature of a lion chase old sultans trail turned due west when he began to go down the little hollows and their intervening ridges we lost ground the pack left us behind the slope of the plateau became decided we rode out of the pines to find the snow failing in the open water ran in little gullies and glistened on the sagebrush a half mile further down the snow had gone we came upon the hounds running at fault except sounder and he had given up  all over sang out jones turning his horse the lions track and his scent have gone with the snow i reckon well do as well to wait until tomorrow hes down in the middle wing somewhere and it is my idea we might catch his trail as he comes back  the sudden dashing aside of our hopes was exasperating there seemed no help for it abrupt ending to exciting chases were but features of the lion hunt the warm sun had been hours on the lower end of the plateau where the snow never lay long and even if we found a fresh morning trail in the sand the heat would have burned out the scent  so rapidly did the snow thaw that by the time we reached camp only the shady patches were left  it was almost eleven oclock when i lay down on my bed to rest awhile and fell asleep the tramp of a horse awakened me i heard jim calling jones thinking it was time to eat i went out the snow had all disappeared and the forest was brown as ever jim sat on his horse and navvy appeared riding up to the hollow leading the saddle horses  jones get out called jim  cant you let a fellow sleep im not hungry replied jones testily  get out and saddle up continued jim  jones burst out of his tent with rumpled hair and sleepy eyes  i went over to see the carcass of the deer an found a lion sittin up in the tree feedin for all he was worth pie jumped out an ran up the hollow an over the rim so i rustled back for you fellows lively now well get this one sure  was it the big fellow i asked  no but he aint no kitten an hes a fine color sort of reddish i never seen one just as bright wheres emett  i dont know he was here a little while ago shall i signal for him  dont yell cried jones holding up his fingers be quiet now  without another word we finished saddling mounted and close together with the hounds in front rode through the forest toward the rim   v  we rode in different directions toward the hollow the better to chance meeting with emett but none of us caught a glimpse of him  it happened that when we headed into the hollow it was at a point just above where the deer carcass hung in the scrub oak don in spite of jones stern yells let out his eager hunting yelp and darted down the slope the pack bolted after him and in less than ten seconds were racing up the hollow their thrilling blending bays a welcome spur to action though i spoke not a word to my mustang nor had time to raise the bridle he wheeled to one side and began to run the other horses also kept to the ridge as i could tell by the pounding of hoofs on the soft turf the hounds in full cry right under us urged our good steeds to a terrific pace it was well that the ridge afforded clear going  the speed at which we traveled however fast as it was availed not to keep up with the pack in a short half mile just as the hollow sloped and merged into level ground they left us behind and disappeared so quickly as almost to frighten me my mustang plunged out of the forest to the rim and dashed along apparently unmindful of the chasm the red and yellow surface blurred in a blinding glare i heard the chorus of hounds but as its direction baffled me i trusted to my horse and i did well for soon he came to a dead halt on the rim  then i heard the hounds below me i had but time to see the character of the placelong yellow promontories running out and slopes of weathered stone reaching up between to a level with the rimwhen in a dwarf pine growing just over the edge i caught sight of a long red pantherish body  i whooped to my followers now close upon me and leaping off hauled out my remington and ran to the cliff the lions long slender body of a rare goldenred color bright clean blacktipped and whitebellied proclaimed it a female of exceeding beauty i could have touched her with a fishing rod and saw how easily she could be roped from where i stood the tree in which she had taken refuge grew from the head of a weathered slope and rose close to the wall at that point it was merely a parapet of crumbling yellow rock no doubt she had lain concealed under the shelving wall and had not had time to get away before the hounds were right upon her  shes going to jump yelled jones in my rear as he dismounted  i saw a goldenred streak flash downward heard a mad medley from the hounds a cloud of dust rose then something bright shone for a second to the right along the wall i ran with all my might to a headland of rock upon which i scrambled and saw with joy that i could command the situation  the lioness was not in sight nor were the hounds the latter however were hot on the trail i knew the lioness had taken to another tree or a hole under the wall and would soon be routed out this time i felt sure she would run down and i took a rapid glance below the slope inclined at a steep angle and was one long slide of bits of yellow stone with many bunches of scrub oak and manzanita those latter i saw with satisfaction because in case i had to go down they would stop the little avalanches the slope reached down perhaps five hundred yards and ended in a thicket and jumble of rocks from which rose on the right a bare yellow slide this ran up to a low cliff i hoped the lion would not go that way for it led to great broken battlements of rim left of the slide was a patch of cedars  jims yell pealed out followed by the familiar penetrating howl of the pack when it sighted game with that i saw the lioness leaping down the slope and close behind her a yellow hound  go it don old boy i yelled wild with delight  a crushing step on the stones told me jones had arrived  hi hi hi roared he  i thought then that if the lioness did not cover thirty feet at every jump i was not in a condition to judge distance she ran away from don as if he had been tied and reached the thicket below a hundred yards ahead of him and when don leaving his brave pack far up the slide entered the thicket the lioness came out on the other side and bounded up the bare slope of yellow shale  shoot ahead of her head her off turn her back cried jones  with the word i threw forward the remington and let drive following the bellow of the rifle so loud in that thin air a sharp harsh report cracked up from below a puff of yellow dust rose in front of the lioness i was in line but too far ahead i fired again the steel jacketed bullet hit a stone and spitefully whined away into the canyon i tried once more this time i struck close to the lioness disconcerted by a cloud of dust rising before her very eyes she wheeled and ran back  we had forgotten don and suddenly he darted out of the thicket straight up the slide always in every chase we were afraid the great hound would run to meet his death we knew it was coming sometime when the lioness saw him and stopped both jones and i felt that this was to be the end of don  shoot her shoot her cried jones shell kill him shell kill him  as i knelt on the rock i had a hard contraction of my throat and then all my muscles set tight and rigid i pulled the trigger of my automatic once twice it was wonderful how closely the two bullets followed each other as we could tell by the almost simultaneous puffs of dust rising from under the beasts nose she must have been showered and stung with gravel for she bounded off to the left and disappeared in the cedars i had missed but the shots had served to a better end than if i had killed her  as don raced up the ground where a moment before a battle and probably death had awaited him the other hounds burst from the thicket with that a golden form seemed to stand out from the green of the cedar to move and to rise  shes treed shes treed shouted jones go down and keep her there while i follow  from the back of the promontory where i met the main wall i let myself down a niche foot here and there a hand hard on the soft stone braced knee and back until i jumped to the edge of the slope the scrub oak and manzanita saved me many a fall i set some stones rolling and i beat them to the bottom having passed the thicket i bent my efforts to the yellow slide and when i had surmounted it my breath came in labored pants the howling of the hounds guided me through the cedars  first i saw moze in the branches of cedar and above him the lioness i ran out into a little open patch of stony ground at the end of which the tree stood leaning over a precipice in truth the lioness was swaying over a chasm  those details i grasped in a glance then suddenly awoke to the fact that the lioness was savagely snarling at moze  moze moze get down i yelled  he climbed on serenely he was a most exasperating dog i screamed at him and hit him with a rock big enough to break his bones he kept on climbing here was a predicament moze would surely get to the lioness if i did not stop him and this seemed impossible it was out of the question for me to climb after him and if the lioness jumped she would have to pass me or come straight at me so i slipped down the safety catch on my automatic and stood ready to save moze or myself  the lioness with a show of fury that startled me descended her branch a few steps and reaching below gave moze a sounding smack with her big paw the hound dropped as if he had been shot and hit the ground with a thud whereupon she returned to her perch  this reassured me and i ran among the dogs and caught moze already starting for the tree again and tied him with a strap i always carried to a small bush nearby i heard the yells of my companions and looking back over the tops of the cedars i saw jim riding down and higher to the left jones sliding falling running at a great rate i encouraged them to keep up the good work and then gave my attention to the lioness  she regarded me with a cold savage stare and showed her teeth i repaid this incivility on her part by promptly photographing her from different points  jones and jim were on the spot before i expected them and both were dusty and dripping with sweat i found to my surprise that my face was wet as was also my shirt jones carried two lassos and my canteen which i had left on the promontory  aint she a beauty he panted wiping his face waittill i get my breath  when finally he walked toward the cedar the lioness stood up and growled as if she realized the entrance of the chief actor upon the scene jones cast his lasso apparently to try her out and the noose spread out and fell over her head as he tightened the rope the lioness backed down behind a branch  tie the dogs yelled jones  quick added jim shes goin to jump  jim had only time to aid me in running my lasso under the collar of don sounder jude and one of the pups i made them fast to a cedar i got my hands on ranger just as moze broke his strap i grabbed his collar and held on  right there was where trouble commenced for me ranger tussled valiantly and moze pulled me all over the place behind me i heard jones roar and jims yell the breaking of branches the howling of the other dogs ranger broke away from me and so enabled me to get my other hand on the neck of crazy moze on more than one occasion i had tried to hold him and had failed this time i swore i would do it if he rolled me over the precipice as to that only a bush saved me  more and louder roars and yells hoarser howls and sharper wrestling snapping sounds told me what was going on while i tried to subdue moze i had a grim thought that i would just as lief have had hold of the lioness the hound presently stopped his plunging which gave me an opportunity to look about the little space was smoky with a smoke of dust i saw the lioness stretched out with one lasso around a bush and another around a cedar with the end in the hands of jim he looked as if he had dug up the ground while he tied this lasso securely jones proceeded to rope the dangerous front paws  the hounds quieted down and i took advantage of this absence of tumult to get rid of moze  pretty lively said jones spitting gravel as i walked up sand and dust lay thick in his beard and blackened his face i tell you she made us root  either the lioness had been much weakened or choked or jones had unusual luck for we muzzled her and tied up her paws in short order  wheres ranger i asked suddenly missing him from the panting hounds  i grabbed him by the heels when he tackled the lion and i gave him a sling somewheres replied jim  ranger put in an appearance then under the cedars limping painfully  jim darn me if i dont believe you pitched him over the precipice said jones  examination proved this surmise to be correct we saw where ranger had slipped over a twentyfoot wall if he had gone over just under the cedar where the depth was much greater he would never have come back  the hounds are choking with dust and heat i said when i poured just a little water from my canteen into the crown of my hat the hounds began fighting around and over me and spilled the water  behave you coyotes i yelled either they were insulted or fully realized the exigency of the situation for each one came up and gratefully lapped every drop of his portion  shore now comes the hell of it said jim appearing with a long pole packin the critter out  an argument arose in regard to the best way up the slope and by virtue of a majority we decided to try the direction jim and i thought best my companions led the way carrying the lioness suspended on the pole i brought up the rear packing my rifle camera lasso canteen and a chain  it was killing work we had to rest every few steps often we would fall jim laughed jones swore and i groaned sometimes i had to drop my things to help my companions so we toiled wearily up the loose steep way  whats she shakin like that for asked jim suddenly  jones let down his end of the pole and turned quickly little tremors quivered over the lissome body of the lioness  shes dying cried jim jerking out the stick between her teeth and slipping off the wire muzzle  her mouth opened and her frothy tongue lolled out jones pointed to her quivering sides and then raised her eyelids we saw the eyes already glazing solemnly fixed  shes gone he said  very soon she lay inert and lifeless then we sat beside her without a word and we could hardly for the moment have been more stunned and heartbroken if it had been the tragic death of one of our kind in that wild environment obsessed by the desire to capture those beautiful cats alive the fateful ending of the successful chase was felt out of all proportion  shore shes dead said jim and wasnt she a beauty what was wrong  the heat and lack of water replied jones she choked what idiots we were why didnt we think to give her a drink  so we passionately protested against our want of forethought and looked again and again with the hope that she might come to but death had stilled the wild heart we gave up presently still did not move on we were exhausted and all the while the hounds lay panting on the rocks the bees hummed the flies buzzed the red colors of the upper walls and the purple shades of the lower darkened silently   vi  shore we cant set here all night said jim lets skin the lion an feed the hounds  the most astonishing thing in our eventful day was the amount of meat stowed away by the dogs lion flesh appealed to their appetites if hungry moze had an ounce of meat he had ten pounds it seemed a good opportunity to see how much the old gladiator could eat and jim and i cut chunks of meat as fast as possible moze gulped them with absolute unconcern of such a thing as mastication at length he reached his limit possibly for the first time in his life and looking longingly at a juicy red strip jim held out he refused it with manifest shame then he wobbled and fell down  we called to him as we started to climb the slope but he did not come then the business of conquering that ascent of sliding stone absorbed all our faculties and strength little headway could we have made had it not been for the brush we toiled up a few feet only to slide back and so it went on until we were weary of life  when one by one we at last gained the rim and sat there to recover breath the sun was a half globe of fire burning over the western ramparts a red sunset bathed the canyon in crimson painting the walls tinting the shadows to resemble dropping mists of blood it was beautiful and enthralling to my eyes but i turned away because it wore the mantle of tragedy  dispirited and worn out we trooped into camp to find emett and a steaming supper between bites the three of us related the story of the red lioness emett whistled long and low and then expressed his regret in no light terms  roping wild steers and mustangs is play to this work he said in conclusion  i was too tired to tease our captive lions that evening even the glowing campfire tempted me in vain and i crawled into my bed with eyes already glued shut  a heavy weight on my feet stirred me from oblivion at first when only half awake i could not realize what had fallen on my bed then hearing a deep groan i knew moze had come back i was dropping off again when a strange low sound caused my eyes to open wide the black night had faded to the gray of dawn the sound i recognized at once to be the navajos morning chant i lay there and listened soft and monotonous wild and swelling but always low and strange the savage song to the break of day was exquisitely beautiful and harmonious i wondered what the literal meaning of his words could have been the significance needed no translation to the black shadows fading away to the brightening of the gray light to the glow of the east to the morning sun to the giver of lifeto these the indian chanted his prayer  could there have been a better prayer pagan or not the navajo with his forefathers felt the spiritual power of the trees the rocks the light and sun and he prayed to that which was divinely helpful to him in all the mystery of his unintelligible life  we did not crawl out that morning as early as usual for it was to be a day of rest when we did a mooted question arosewhether we or the hounds were the more crippled ranger did not show himself don could just walk and that was all moze was either too full or too tired to move sounder nursed a foot and jude favored her lame leg  after lunch we brightened up somewhat and set ourselves different tasks jones had misplaced or lost his wire and began to turn the camp topsyturvy in his impatient efforts to locate it the wire however was not to be found this was a calamity for as we asked each other how could we muzzle lions without wire moreover a half dozen heavy leather straps which i had bought in kanab for use as lion collars had disappeared we had only one collar left the one that jones had put on the red lioness  whereupon we began to blame each other to argue to grow heated and naturally from that to become angry it seems a fatality of campers along a wild trail like explorers in an unknown land to be prone to fight if there is an explanation of this singular fact it must be that men at such time lose their poise and veneer of civilization in brief they go back at all events we had it hot and heavy with the center of attack gradually focusing on jones and as he was always losing something naturally we united in force against him  fortunately we were interrupted by yells from the navajo off in the woods the brushing of branches and pounding of hoofs preceded his appearance in some remarkable manner he had gotten a bridle on marc and from the way the big stallion hurled his huge bulk over logs and through thickets it appeared evident he meant to usurp jims ambition and kill the navajo hearing emett yell the indian turned marc toward camp the horse slowed down when he neared the glade and tried to buck but navvy kept his head up with that marc seemed to give way to ungovernable rage and plunged right through camp he knocked over the dogs shelter and thundered down the ridge  now the navajo with the bridle in his hand was thoroughly at home he was getting his revenge on marc and he would have kept his seat on a wild mustang but marc swerved suddenly under a low branch of a pine sweeping the indian off  when navvy did not rise we began to fear he had been seriously hurt perhaps killed and we ran to where he lay  face downward hands outstretched with no movement of body or muscle he certainly appeared dead  badly hurt said emett probably back broken i have seen it before from just such accidents  oh no cried jones and i felt so deeply i could not speak jim who always wanted navvy to be a dead indian looked profoundly sorry  hes a dead indian all right replied emett  we rose from our stooping postures and stood around uncertain and deeply grieved until a mournful groan from navvy afforded us much relief  thats your dead indian exclaimed jones  emett stooped again and felt the indians back and got in reward another mournful groan  its his back said emett and true to his ruling passion forever to minister to the needs of horses men and things he began to rub the indian and call for the liniment  illustration treed lion  illustration treed lion  jim went to fetch it while i still believing the navvy to be dangerously hurt knelt by him and pulled up his shirt exposing the hollow of his brown back  here we are said jim returning on the run with the bottle  pour some on replied emett  jim removed the cork and soused the liniment all over the indians back  dont waste it remonstrated emett starting to rub navvys back  then occurred a most extraordinary thing a convulsion seemed to quiver through the indians body he rose at a single leap and uttering a wild piercing yell broke into a run i never saw an indian or anybody else run so fleetly yell after yell pealed back to us  absolutely dumfounded we all gazed at each other  thats your dead indian ejaculated jim  what the hell exclaimed emett who seldom used such language  look here cried jones grabbing the bottle see dont you see it  jim fell face downward and began to shake  what shouted emett and i together  turpentine you idiots turpentine jim brought the wrong bottle  in another second three more forms lay stretched out on the sward and the forest rang with sounds of mirth   vii  that night the wind switched and blew cold from the north and so strong that the campfire roared like a furnace more snow was the verdict of all of us and in view of this i invited the navajo to share my tent  sleepieme i said to him  me savvy he replied and forthwith proceeded to make his bed with me  much to my surprise all my comrades raised protestations which struck me as being singularly selfish considering they would not be inconvenienced in any way  why not i asked its a cold night therell be frost if not snow  shore youll get em said jim  there never was an indian that didnt have em added jones  what i questioned  they made mysterious signs that rather augmented my ignorance as to what i might get from the indian but in no wise changed my mind when i went to bed i had to crawl over navvy moze lay at my feet as usual and he growled so deep that i could not but think he too resented the addition to my small tent  mista gay came in the indians low voice  well navvy i asked  sleepiesleepie  yes navvy sleepy and tired are you  me savvymucha sleepiemuchano bueno  i did not wonder at his feeling sleepy tired and bad he did not awaken me in the morning for when my eyes unclosed the tent was light and he had gone i found my companions up and doing  we had breakfast and got into our saddles by the time the sun a red ball low down among the pines began to brighten and turn to gold no snow had fallen but a thick frost encrusted the ground the hounds wearing cloth moccasins which plainly they detested trotted in front don showed no effects of his great run down the sliding slope after the red lioness it was one of his remarkable qualities that he recuperated so quickly ranger was a little stiff and sounder favored his injured foot the others were as usual  jones led down the big hollow to which he kept after we had passed the edge of the pines then marking a herd of deer ahead he turned his horse up the bank  we breasted the ridge and jogged toward the cedar forest which we entered without having seen the hounds show interest in anything under the cedars in the soft yellow dust we crossed lion tracks many of them but too old to carry a scent even north hollow with its regular beaten runway failed to win a murmur from the pack  spread out said jones and look for tracks ill keep the center and hold in the hounds  signalling occasionally to one another we crossed almost the breadth of the cedar forest to its western end where the open sage flats inclined to the rim in one of those flats i came upon a broken sage bush the grass being thick thereabout i discovered no track but dismounted and scrutinized the surroundings carefully a heavy body had been dragged across the sage crushing it the ends of broken bushes were green the leaves showed bruises  i began to feel like don when he scented game leading my mustang i slowly proceeded across the open guided by an occasional downtrodden bush or tuft of grass as i neared the cedars again foxie snorted under the first tree i found a ghastly bunch of red bones a spread of grayish hairs and a split skull the bones were yet wet two long doe ears were still warm then i saw big lion tracks in the dust and even a well pressed imprint of a lions body where he had rolled or lain  the two yells i sent ringing into the forest were productive of interesting results answers came from near and far then what with my calling and the replies the forest rang so steadily with shrill cries that the echoes had no chance to follow  an elephant in the jungle could not have caused more crashing and breaking of brush than did emett as he made his way to me he arrived from the forest just as jim galloped across the flat mutely i held up the two long ears  get on your horse cried jim after one quick glance at the spread of bones and hair  it was well he said that for i might have been left behind i ran to foxie and vaulted upon him a flash of yellow appeared among the sage and a string of yelps split the air  its don yelled jim  well we knew that what a sight to see him running straight for us he passed a savage yellow wolf in his ferocity and disappeared like a gleam under the gloomy cedars  we spurred after him the other hounds sped by jones closed in on us from the left and in a few minutes we were strung out behind emett fighting the branches dodging and swerving hugging the saddle and always sending out our sharp yells  the race was furious but short the three of us coming up together found emett dismounted on the extreme end of west point  the hounds have gone down he said pointing to the runway  we all listened to the meaning bays  shore theyve got him up asserted jim like as not they found him under the rim here sleeping off his gorge now fellows ill go down it might be a good idea for you to spread along the rim  illustration treed lion  illustration hiding  with that we turned our horses eastward and rode as close to the rim as possible clumps of cedars and deep fissures often forced us to circle them the hounds traveling under the walls below kept pace with us and then forged ahead which fact caused jones to dispatch emett on the gallop for the next runway at north hollow  soon jones bade me dismount and make my way out upon one of the promontories while he rode a little farther on as i tied my mustang i heard the hounds faint and far beneath i waded through the sage and cedar to the rim  cape after cape jutted out over the abyss some were very sharp and bare others covered with cedar some tottering crags with a crumbling bridge leading to their rims and some ran down like giant steps from one of these i watched below the slope here under the wall was like the side of a rugged mountain somewhere down among the dark patches of cedar and the great blocks of stone the hounds were hunting the lion but i could not see one of them  the promontory i had chosen had a split and choked as this was with brush rock and shale it seemed a place where i might climb down once started i could not turn back and sliding clinging to what afforded i worked down the crack a wall of stone hid the sky from me part of the way i came out a hundred feet below upon a second promontory of huge slabs of yellow stone over these i clambered to sit with my feet swinging over the last one  straight before my gaze yawned the awful expanse of the canyon in the soft morning light the red mesas the yellow walls the black domes were less harsh than in the full noonday sun purer than in the tender shadow of twilight below me were slopes and slides divided by ravines full of stones as large as houses with here and there a lonesome leaning crag giving irresistible proof of the downward trend of the rolling weathering ruins of the rim above the wall bulged out full of fissures ragged and rotten shelves toppling columns of yellow limestone beaded with quartz and colored by wild flowers wonderfully growing in crannies  wild and rare as was this environment i gave it but a glance and a thought the bay of the hounds caused me to bend sharp and eager eyes to the open spaces of stone and slide below luck was mine as usual the hounds were working up toward me how i strained my sight hearing a single cry i looked eastward to see jones silhouetted against the blue on a black promontory he seemed a giant primeval man overlooking the ruin of a former world i signalled him to make for my point  black ranger hove in sight at the top of a yellow slide he was at fault but hunting hard jude and sounder bayed off to his left i heard dons clear voice permeating the thin cool air seemingly to leave a quality of wildness upon it yet i could not locate him ranger disappeared then for a time i only heard jim moze was next to appear and he too was upward bound a jumble of stone hid him and then ranger again showed evidently he wanted to get around the bottom of a low crag for he jumped and jumped only to fall back  quite naturally my eyes searched that crag stretched out upon the top of it was the long slender body of a lion  hi hi hi hi hi i yelled till my lungs failed me  where are you came from above  here here i cried seeing jones on the rim come down climb down the crack the lion is here on top of that round crag hes fooled the hounds and they cant find him  i see him i see him yelled jones then he roared out a single call for emett that pealed like a clear clarion along the curved broken rim wall opening up echoes which clapped like thunder  while jones clattered down i turned again to the lion he lay with head hidden under a little shelf and he moved not a muscle what a place for him to choose but for my accidental venturing down the broken fragments and steps of the rim he could have remained safe from pursuit  suddenly right under my feet don opened his string of yelps i could not see him but decided he must be above the lion on the crag i leaned over as far as i dared at that moment among the varied and thrilling sounds about me i became vaguely aware of hard panting breaths like coughs somewhere in my vicinity as jones had set in motion bushels of stone and had already scraped his feet over the rocks behind me i thought the forced respiration came from him when i turned he was yet far offtoo far for me to hear him breathe i thought this circumstance strange but straightway forgot it  on the moment from my right somewhere don pealed out his bugle blast and immediately after sounder and jude joining him sent up the thrice welcome news of a treed lion  there re two there re two i yelled to jones now working down to my right  hes treed down here ive got him spotted replied jones you stay there and watch your lion yell for emett  signal after signal for emett earned no response though jim far below to the left sent me an answer  the next few minutes or more likely half an hour passed with jones and me separated from each other by a wall of broken stone waiting impatiently for jim and emett while the hounds bayed one lion and i watched the other  calmness was impossible under such circumstances no man could have gazed into that marvel of color and distance with wild life about him with wild sounds ringing in his ears without yielding to the throb and race of his wild blood  emett did not come jim had not answered a yell for minutes no doubt he needed his breath he came into sight just to the left of our position and he ran down one side of the ravine to toil up the other i hailed him jones hailed him and the hounds hailed him  steer to your left jim i called theres a lion on that crag above you he might jump round the cliff to the leftjones is there  the most painful task it was for me to sit there and listen to the sound rising from below without being able to see what happened my lion had peeped up once and seeing me had crouched closer to his crag evidently believing he was unseen which obviously made it imperative for me to keep my seat and hold him there as long as possible  but to hear the various exclamations thrilled me enough  hyar mozeget out of that catch himhold him damn these rotten limbs hand me a polejones back downback down hes cominhi hi whoop booo therenow youve got him no no it slipped now look out jim from underhes going to jump  a smashing and rattling of loose stones and a fiery burst of yelps with trumpetlike yells followed close upon jones last words then two yellow streaks leaped down the ravine the first was the lion the second was don the rest of the pack came tumbling helterskelter in their wake following them raced jim in long kangaroo leaps with jones in the rear running for all he was worth the animated and musical procession passed up out of the ravine and gradually lengthened as the lion gained and jones lost till it passed altogether from my jealous sight  on the other side of the ridge of cedars the hounds treed their quarry again as was easy to tell by their change from sharp intermittent yelping to an unbroken full deep chorus then presently all quieted down and for long moments at a time the still silence enfolded the slope shouts now and then floated up on the wind and an occasional bark  i sat there for an hour by my watch though it seemed only a few minutes and all that time my lion lay crouched on his crag and never moved  i looked across the curve of the canyon to the purple breaks of the siwash and the shaggy side of buckskin mountain and far beyond to where kanab canyon opened its dark mouth and farther still to the pink cliffs of utah weird and dim in the distance  something swelled within my breast at the thought that for the time i was part of that wild scene the eye of an eagle soaring above would have placed me as well as my lion among the few living things in the range of his allcompassing vision therefore all was mine not merely the lionfor he was only the means to an endbut the stupendous unnameable thing beneath me this chasm that hid mountains in the shades of its cliffs and the granite tombs some gleaming pale passionless others red and warm painted by a master hand and the windcaves darkportaled under their mist curtains and all that was deep and far off unapproachable unattainable of beauty exceeding dressed in everchanging hues was mine by right of presence by right of the eye to see and the mind to keep  waahoo  the cry lifted itself out of the depths i saw jones on the ridge of cedars  all right herehave you kept your line there he yelled  alls wellcome along come along i replied  i watched them coming and all the while my lion never moved the hounds reached the base of the cliff under me but they could not find the lion though they scented him for they kept up a continual baying jim got up to the shelf under me and said they had tied up the lion and left him below jones toiled slowly up the slope  some one ought to stay down there he might jump i called in warning  that crag is forty feet high on this side he replied  i clambered back over the uneven mass let myself down between the boulders and crawled under a dark ridge and finally with jim catching my rifle and camera and then lending his shoulders i reached the bench below jones came puffing around a corner of the cliff and soon all three of us with the hounds stood out on the rocky shelf with only a narrow space between us and the crouching lion  before we had a moment to speak much less form a plan of attack the lion rose spat at us defiantly and deliberately jumped off the crag we heard him strike with a frightful thud  surprise held us dumb to take the leap to the slope below seemed beyond any beast not endowed with wings we saw the lion bounding down the identical trail which the other lion had taken jones came out of his momentary indecision  hold the dogs call them back he yelled hoarsely theyll kill the lion we tied theyll kill him  the hounds had scattered off the bench here and there everywhere to come together on the trail below already they were in full cry with the matchless don at the fore manifestly to call them back was an injustice as well as impossible in ten seconds they were out of sight  in silence we waited each listening each feeling the tragedy of the situation each praying that they would pass by the poor helpless bound lion suddenly the regular baying swelled to a burst of savage snarling fury such as the pack made in a vicious fight this ceasedshort silence ensued dons sharp voice woke the echoes then the regular baying continued  as with one thought we all sat down painful as the certainty was it was not so painful as that listening hoping suspense  shore they cant be blamed said jim finally bumping their nose into a tied lion that wayhowd they know  who could guess the second lion would jump off that quick and run back to our captive burst out jones  shore we might have knowed it replied jim well im goin after the pack  he gathered up his lasso and strode off the bench jones said he would climb back to the rim and i followed jim  why the lions ran in that particular direction was clear to me when i saw the trail it was a runway smooth and hard packed i trudged along it with rather less enjoyment than on any trail i had ever followed to the canyon jim waited for me over the cedar ridge and showed me where the captive lion lay dead the hounds had not torn him they had killed him and passed on after the other  he was a fine fellow all of seven feet well skin him on our way back  only dogged determination coupled with a sense of duty to the hounds kept us on that trail for the time being enthusiasm had been submerged but we had to follow the pack  jim less weighted down and perhaps less discouraged forged ahead up and down the sun had burned all the morning coolness out of the air i perspired and panted and began to grow weary jims signal called me to hurry i took to a trot and came upon him and the hounds under a small cedar the lion stood among the dead branches his sides where shaking convulsively and his short breaths could be plainly heard he had the most blazing eyes and most untamed expression of any wild creature i have ever seen and this amazed me considering i had kept him on a crag for over an hour and had come to look upon him as my own  whatll we do jim now that we have him treed  shore well tie him up declared jim  the lion stayed in the cedar long enough for me to photograph him twice then he leaped down again and took to his back trail we followed as fast as we could soon to find that the hounds had put him up another cedar from this he jumped down among the dogs scattered them as if they had been so many leaves and bounded up the slope out of sight  i laid aside my rifle and camera and tried to keep up with jim the lion ran straight up the slope and treed again under the wall before we covered half the distance he was on the go once more flying down in clouds of dust  don is makin him hump said jim  and that alone was enough to spur us on we would reward the noble hound if we had the staying power don and his pack ran westward this time and along a mile of the beaten trail put him up two more trees but these we could not see and judged only by the sound  illustration a drink of cold granite water under the rim  illustration which is the piute  look there cried jim darn me if he aint comin right at us  it was true ahead of us the lion appeared loping wearily we stopped in our tracks undecided jim drew his revolver once or twice the lion disappeared behind stones and cedars when he sighted us he stopped looked back then again turning toward us he left the trail to plunge down he had barely got out of sight when old don came pattering along the trail then ranger leading the others don did not even put his nose to the ground where the lion had switched but leaped aside and went down here the long section of slope between the lions runway and the second wall had been weathered and worn racked and convulsed into deep ravines with ridges between we climbed and fell and toiled on always with the bay of the hounds in our ears we leaped fissures we loosened avalanches rolling them to crash and roar below and send long rumbling echoes out into the canyon  a gorge in the yellow rock opened suddenly before us we stood at the constricted neck of one of the great splits in the second wall the side opposite was almost perpendicular and formed of mass on mass of broken stones this was a weathered slope on a gigantic scale points of cliffs jutted out caves and cracks lined the wall  this is a rough place said jim but a lion could get over the second wall here an i believe a man could too the hounds seemed to be back further toward where the split narrows  through densely massed cedars and thickets of prickly thorns we wormed our way to come out at the neck of the gorge  there ye are sang out jim the hounds were all on a flat shelf some few feet below us and on a sharp point of rock close by but too far for the dogs to reach crouched the lion he was gasping and frothing at the mouth  shore if hed only stay there said jim  he loosened his lasso and stationing himself just above the tired beast he prepared to cast down the loop the first throw failed of its purpose but the rope hit the lion he got up painfully it seemed and faced the dogs that way barred he turned to the cliff almost opposite him a shelf leaned out he looked at it then paced to and fro like a beast in a cage  he looked again at the hounds then up at us all around and finally concentrated his attention on the shelf his long length sagged in the middle he stretched low his muscles gathered and strung and he sprang like a tawny streak  his aim was true the whole forepart of his body landed on the shelf and he hung there then he slipped we distinctly heard his claws scrape the hard smooth rock he fell turning a somersault struck twenty feet below on the rough slant bounded from that to fall down striking suddenly and then to roll a yellow wheel that lodged behind a rock and stretched out to move no more  the hounds were silent jim and i were silent a few little stones rattled then were still the dead silence of the canyon seemed to pay tribute to the lions unquenchable spirit and to the freedom he had earned to the last   viii  how long jim and i sat there we never knew the second tragedy not so pitiful but as heart sickening as the first crushed our spirits  shore he was a game lion said jim an ill have to get his skin   im all in jim i couldnt climb out of that hole i said  you neednt rest a little take a good drink an leave your canteen here for me then get your things back there on the trail an climb out were not far from west point ill go back after the first lions skin an then climb straight up you lead my horse to the point where you came off the rim  he clattered along the gorge knocking the stones and started down i watched him letting himself over the end of the huge slabs until he passed out of my sight a good long drink revived me and i began the ascent  from that moment on time did not matter to me i forgot all about it i felt only my leaden feet and my laboring chest and dripping skin i did not even notice the additional weight of my rifle and camera though they must have overburdened me i kept my eyes on the lion runway and plunged away with short steps to look at these towering walls would have been to surrender  at last stumbling bursting sick i gained the rim and had to rest before i could mount when i did get into the saddle i almost fell from it  jones and emett were waiting for me at the promontory where i had tied my horse and were soon acquainted with the particulars of my adventure and that jim would probably not get out for hours we made tracks for camp and never did a place rouse in me such a sense of gratefulness emett got dinner and left on the fire a kettle of potato stew for jim it was almost dark when that worthy came riding into camp we never said a word as he threw the two lion skins on the ground  fellows you shore have missed the windup he exclaimed  we all looked at him and he looked at us  was there any more i asked weakly  shore an it beats hell when i got the skin of the lion the dogs killed i started to work up to the place i knowed youd leave my horse its bad climbing where you came down i got on the side of that cliff an saw where i could work out if i could climb a smooth place so i tried there was little cracks an ridges for my feet and hands all to once just above where i helped you down i heard a growl looking up i saw a big lion biggern any we chased except sultan an he was pokin his head out of a hole an shore telling me to come no further i couldnt let go with either hand to reach my gun because id have fallen so i yelled at him with all my might he spit at me an then walked out of the hole over the bench as proud as a lord an jumped down where i couldnt see him any more i climbed out all right but hed gone an ill tell you for a minute he shore made me sweat  by george i yelled greatly excited i heard that lion breathing don chased him up there i heard hard wheezing breaths somewhere behind me but in the excitement i didnt pay any attention to them i thought it was jones panting but now i know what it meant  shore he was there all the time lookin at you an maybe he could have reached you  we were all too exhausted for more discussion and putting that off until the next day we sought our beds it was hardly any wonder that i felt myself jumping even in my sleep and started up wildly more than once in the dead of night  illustration wild horses drinking on a promontory in the grand canyon  morning found us all rather subdued yet more inclined to a philosophical resignation as regarded the difficulties of our special kind of hunting capturing the lions on the level of the plateau was easy compared to following them down into canyons and bringing them up alone we all agreed that that was next to impossible another feature which before we had not considered added to our perplexity and it was a dawning consciousness that we would be perhaps less cruel if we killed the lions outright jones and emett arrayed themselves on the side that life even in captivity was preferable while jim and i no doubt still under the poignant influence of the last lions heroic race and end inclined to freedom or death we compromised on the reasonable fact that as yet we had shown only a jackass kind of intelligence  illustration jones and emett packing lion on horse  illustration jones climbing up to lasso lion  about eleven oclock while the others had deserted camp temporarily for some reason or other i was lounging upon an odorous bed of pine needles the sun shone warmly the sky gleamed bright azure through the openings of the great trees a dry west breeze murmured through the forest i was lying on my bed musing idly and watching a yellow woodpecker when suddenly i felt a severe bite on my shoulder i imagined an ant had bitten me through my shirt in a moment or so afterward i received this time on my breast another bite that left no room for imagination there was some kind of an animal inside my shirt and one that made a mosquito blackfly or flea seem tame  suddenly a thought swept on the heels of my indolent and rather annoying realization could i have gotten from the navajo what jim and jones so characteristically called em i turned cold all over and on the very instant i received another bite that burned like fire  the return of my companions prevented any open demonstration of my fears and condition of mind but i certainly swore inwardly during the dinner hour i felt all the time as if i had on a horsehair shirt with the ends protruding toward my skin and in the exaggerated sensitiveness of the moment made sure em were chasing up and down my back  after dinner i sneaked off into the woods i remembered that emett had said there was only one way to get rid of em and that was to disrobe and make a microscopical search of garments and person with serious mind and murderous intent i undressed in the middle of the back of my jersey i discovered several long uncanny gray things  i guess i got em i said gravely  then i sat on a pine log in a state of unadorned nature oblivious to all around intent only on the massacre of the things that had violated me how much time flew i could not guess great loud hawhaws roused me to consternation there behind me stood jones and emett shaking as if with the ague  its not funny i shouted in a rage i had the unreasonable suspicion that they had followed me to see my humiliation jones who cracked a smile about as often as the equinoxes came and emett the sober mormon laughed until they cried  i wasjust wonderingwhat your folks wouldthinkif theysaw younow gurgled jones  that brought to me the humor of the thing and i joined in their mirth  all i hope is that you fellows will get em too i said  the good lord preserve me from that particular breed of navvys cried emett  jones wriggled all over at the mere suggestion now so much from the old plainsman who had confessed to intimate relations with every creeping crawling thing in the west attested powerfully to the unforgettable singularity of what i got from navvy  i returned to camp determined to make the best of the situation which owing to my failure to catch all of the gray devils remained practically unchanged jim had been acquainted with my dilemma as was manifest in his wet eyes and broad grin with which he greeted me  i think id scalp the navvy he said  you make the indian sleep outside after this snow or no snow was jones suggestion  no i wont i wont show a yellow streak like that besides i want to give em to you fellows  a blank silence followed my statement to which jim replied  shore thatll be easy jonesll have em soll emett an by thunder im scratchin now  navvy look here i said severely mucha no bueno heap bad youme here i scratched myself and made signs that a wooden indian would have understood  me savvy he replied sullenly then flared up heap big lie  he turned on his heel erect dignified and walked away amid the roars of my gleeful comrades   ix  one by one my companions sought their blankets leaving the shadows the dying embers the slowrising moan of the night wind to me old moze got up from among the other hounds and limped into my tent where i heard him groan as he lay down don sounder and ranger were fast asleep in wellearned rest shep one of the pups whined and impatiently tossed his short chain remembering that he had not been loose all day i unbuckled his collar and let him go  he licked my hand stretched and shook himself lifted his shapely sleek head and sniffed the wind he trotted around the circle cast by the fire and looked out into the darkening shadows it was plain that sheps instincts were developing fast he was ambitious to hunt but sure in my belief that he was afraid of the black night and would stay in camp i went to bed  the navajo who slept with me snored serenely and moze growled in his dreams the wind swept through the pines with an intermittent rush some time in the after part of the night i heard a distant sound remote mournful wild it sent a chill creeping over me borne faintly to my ears it was a fit accompaniment to the moan of the wind in the pines it was not the cry of a trailing wolf nor the lonesome howl of a prowling coyote nor the strange low sound like a cough of a hunting cougar though it had a semblance of all three it was the bay of a hound thinned out by distance and it served to keep me wide awake but for a while what with the roar and swell of the wind and navvys snores i could hear it only at long intervals  still in the course of an hour i followed the sound or imagined so from a point straight in line with my feet to one at right angles with my head finally deciding it came from shep and fancying he was trailing a deer or coyote i tried to go to sleep again  in this i would have succeeded had not all at once our captive lions begun to growl that ominous low murmuring awoke me with a vengeance for it was unusual for them to growl in the middle of the night i wondered if they as well as the pup had gotten the scent of a prowling lion  i reached down to my feet and groped in the dark for moze finding him i gave him a shake the old gladiator groaned stirred and came out of what must have been dreams of hunting meat he slapped his tail against my bed as luck would have it just then the wind abated to a soft moan and clear and sharp came the bay of a hound moze heard it for he stopped wagging his tail his body grew tense under my hand and he vented his low deep grumble  i lay there undecided to wake my companions was hardly to be considered and to venture off into the forest alone where old sultan might be scouting was not exactly to my taste and trying to think what to do and listening for the bay of the pup and hearing mostly the lions growling and the wind roaring i fell asleep  hey are you ever going to get up some one yelled into my drowsy brain i roused and opened my eyes the yellow flickering shadows on the wall of my tent told me that the sun had long risen i found my companions finishing breakfast the first thing i did was to look over the dogs shep the blackandwhite pup was missing  wheres shep i asked  shore i aint seen him this mornin replied jim  thereupon i told what i had heard during the night  everybody listen said jones  we quieted down and sat like statues a gentle cool breeze barely moving the pine tips had succeeded the night wind the sound of horses munching their oats and an occasional clink rattle and growl from the lions did not drown the faint but unmistakable yelps of a pup  south toward the canyon said jim as jones got up  now itd be funny if that little shep just to get even with me for tying him up so often has treed a lion all by himself commented jones and ill bet thats just what hes done  he called the hounds about him and hurried westward through the forest  shore it might be jim shook his head knowingly i reckon its only a rabbit but anythin might happen in this place  i finished breakfast and went into my tent for somethingi forget what for wild yells from emett and jim brought me flying out again  listen to that cried jim pointing west  the hounds had opened up their full wild chorus floated clearly on the breeze and above it jones stentorian yell signaled us  shore the old man can yell continued jim grab your lassos an hump yourselves ive got the collar an chain  come on navvy shouted emett he grasped the indians wrist and started to run jerking navvy into the air at every jump i caught up my camera and followed we crossed two shallow hollows and then saw the hounds and jones among the pines not far ahead  in my excitement i outran my companions and dashed into an open glade first i saw jones waving his long arms next the dogs noses upward and don actually standing on his hind legs then a dead pine with a wellknown tawny shape outlined against the blue sky  hurrah for shep i yelled and right vigorously did my comrades join in  its another female said jones when we calmed down and fair sized thats the best tree for our purpose that i ever saw a lion in so spread out boys surround her and keep noisy  navvy broke from emett at this juncture and ran away but evidently overcome by curiosity he stopped to hide behind a bush from which i saw his black head protruding  when jones swung himself on the first stubby branch of the pine the lioness some fifteen feet above leaped to another limb and the one she had left cracked swayed and broke it fell directly upon jones the blunt end striking his head and knocking him out of the tree fortunately he landed on his feet otherwise there would surely have been bones broken he appeared stunned and reeled so that emett caught him the blood poured from a wound in his head  this sudden shock sobered us instantly on examination we found a long jagged cut in jones scalp we bathed it with water from my canteen and with snow jim procured from a nearby hollow eventually stopping the bleeding i insisted on jones coming to camp to have the wound properly dressed and he insisted on having it bound with a bandana after which he informed us that he was going to climb the tree again  we objected to this each of us declared his willingness to go up and rope the lion but jones would not hear of it  im not doubting your courage he said its only that you cannot tell what move the lion would make next and thats the danger  we could not gainsay this and as not one of us wanted to kill the animal or let her go jones had his way so he went up the tree passed the first branch and then another the lioness changed her position growled spat clawed the twigs tried to keep the tree trunk between her and jones and at length got out on a branch in a most favorable position for roping  the first cast of the lasso did the business and jim and emett with nimble fingers tied up the hounds  coming shouted jones he slid down hand over hand on the rope the lioness holding his weight with apparent ease  make your noose ready he yelled to emett  i had to drop my camera to help jones and jim pull the animal from her perch the branches broke in a shower then the lioness hissing snarling whirling plunged down she nearly jerked the rope out of our hands but we lowered her to emett who noosed her hind paws in a flash  make fast your rope shouted jones there thats good now let her downeasy  as soon as the lioness touched ground we let go the lasso which whipped up and over the branch she became a round yellow rapidly moving ball emett was the first to catch the loose lasso and he checked the rolling cougar jones leaped to assist him and the two of them straightened out the struggling animal while jim swung another noose at her on the second throw he caught a front paw  pull hard stretch her out yelled jones he grasped a stout piece of wood and pushed it at the lioness she caught it in her mouth making the splinters fly jones shoved her head back on the ground and pressed his brawny knee on the bar of wood  the collar the collar quick he called  i threw chain and collar to him which in a moment he had buckled round her neck  there weve got her he said its only a short way over to camp so well drag her without muzzling  as he rose the lioness lurched and reaching him fastened her fangs in his leg jones roared emett and jim yelled and i though frightened was so obsessed with the idea of getting a picture that i began to fumble with the shutter of my camera  grab the chain pull her off bawled jones  i ran in took up the chain with both hands and tugged with all my might emett too had all his weight on the lasso round her neck between the two of us we choked her hold loose but she brought jones leather leggin in her teeth then i dropped the chain and jumped    exploded jones to me do you think more of a picture than of saving my life having expressed this not unreasonable protest he untied the lasso that emett had made fast to a small sapling  then the three men forming points of a triangle around an animated center began a march through the forest that for variety of action and splendid vociferation beat any show i ever beheld  so rare was it that the navajo came out of his retreat and straightway forgetting his reverence and fear began to execute a ghostdance or wardance or at any rate some kind of an indian dance along the side lines  there were moments when the lioness had jim and jones on the ground and emett wobbling others when she ran on her bound legs and chased the two in front and dragged the one behind others when she came within an ace of getting her teeth in somebody  they had caught a tartar they dared not let her go and though jones evidently ordered it no one made fast his rope to a tree there was no opportunity she was in the air three parts of the time and the fourth she was invisible for dust the lassos were each thirty feet long but even with that the men could just barely keep out of her reach  then came the climax as it always comes in a lion hunt unerringly unexpectedly and with lightning swiftness the three men were nearing the bottom of the second hollow well spread out lassos taut facing one another jones stumbled and the lioness leaped his way the weight of both brought jim over sliding and slipping with his rope slackening the leap of the lioness carried her within reach of jones and as he raised himself back toward her she reached a big paw for him just as emett threw all his bull strength and bulk on his lasso  the seat of jones trousers came away with the lioness claws then she fell backward overcome by emetts desperate lunge jones sprang up with the velocity of an arab tumbler and his scarlet face working spasmodically and his moving lips showed how utterly unable he was to give expression to his rage i had a stitch in my side that nearly killed me but laugh i had to though i should die for it  no laughing matter was it for them they volleyed and thundered back and forth meaningless words of which hell was the only one distinguishable and probably the word that best described their situation  all the while however they had been running from the lioness which brought them before they realized it right into camp our captive lions cut up fearfully at the hubbub and the horses stampeded in terror  whoa yelled jones whether to his companions or to the struggling cougar no one knew but navvy thought jones addressed the cougar  whoa repeated navvy no savvy whoa no savvy whoa which proved conclusively that the navajo had understanding as well as wit  soon we had another captive safely chained and growling away in tune with the others i went back to untie the hounds to find them sulky and out of sorts from being so unceremoniously treated they noisily trailed the lioness into camp where finding her chained they formed a ring around her  thereafter the day passed in roundthecampfire chat and task for once jim looked at navvy with toleration we dressed the wound in jones head and laughed at the condition of his trousers and at his awkward attempts to piece them  mucha dam cougie remarked navvy no savvy whoa  the lions growled all day and jones kept repeating to think how shep fooled me   x  next morning jones was out bright and early yelling at navvy to hurry with the horses calling to the hounds and lions just as usual  navvy had finally come to his full share of praise from all of us even jim acknowledged that the indian was invaluable to a hunting party in a country where grass and water were hard to find and wild horses haunted the trails  tohodena tohodena hurry hurry said navvy mimicking jones that morning  as we sat down to breakfast he loped off into the forest and before we got up the bells of the horses were jingling in the hollow  i believe its going to be cloudy said jones and if so we can hunt all day  we rode down the ridge to the left of middle canyon and had trouble with the hounds all the way first they ran foul of a coyote which was the one and only beast they could not resist spreading out to head them off we separated i cut into a hollow and rode to its head where i went up i heard the hounds and presently saw a big white coyote making fast time through the forest glades it looked as if he would cross close in front of me so i pulled foxie to a standstill jumped off and knelt with my rifle ready but the sharpeyed coyote saw my horse and shied off i had not much hope to hit him so far away and the five bullets i sent after him singing and zipping served only to make him run faster i mounted foxie and intercepted the hounds coming up sharply on the trail and turned them toward my companions now hallooing from the ridge below  then the pack lost a good hour on several lion tracks that were a day old and for such trails we had no time we reached the cedars however at seven oclock and as the sky was overcast with low duncolored clouds and the air cool we were sure it was not too late  one of the capes of the plateau between middle and left canyon was a narrow strip of rock covered with a dense cedar growth and cut up into smaller canyons all running down inevitably toward the great canyon with but a single bark to warn us don got out of our sight and hearing and while we split to look and call for him the remainder of the pack found the lion trail that he had gone on and they left us trying to find a way out as well as to find each other i kept the hounds in hearing for some time and meanwhile i signalled to emett who was on my right flank jones and jim might as well have vanished off the globe for all i could see or hear of them a deep narrow gully into which i had to lead foxie and carefully coax him out took so much time that when i once more reached a level i could not hear the hounds or get an answer to my signal cry  waahoo i called again  away on the dry rarified air pealed the cry piercing the cedar forest splitting sharp in the vaulted canyons rolling loud and long to lose power to die away in muffling echo but the silence returned no answer  i rode on under the cedars through a dark gloomy forest silent almost spectral which brought irresistibly to my mind the words i found me in a gloomy wood astray i was lost though i knew the direction of the camp this section of cedar forest was all but impenetrable dead cedars were massed in gray tangles live cedars branches touching the ground grew close together in this labyrinth i lost my bearings i turned and turned crossed my own back trail which in desperation i followed coming out of the cedars at the deep and narrow canyon  here i fired my revolver the echo boomed out like the report of heavy artillery but no answering shot rewarded me there was no alternative save to wander along the canyon and through the cedars until i found my companions this i began to do disgusted with my awkwardness in losing them turning foxie westward i had scarcely gotten under way when don came trotting toward me  hello old boy i called don appeared as happy to see me as i was to see him he flopped down on the ground his dripping tongue rolled as he panted covered with dust and flecked with light froth he surely looked to be a tired hound  all in eh don i said dismounting well well rest awhile then i discovered blood on his nose which i found to have come from a deep scratch aah been pushing a lion too hard this morning got your nose scratched didnt you you great crazy hound dont you know some day youll chase your last lion  don wagged his tail as if to say he knew it all very well i wet my handkerchief from my canteen and started to wash the blood and dust from his nose when he whined and licked my fingers  thirsty i asked sitting down beside him denting the top of my hat i poured in as much water as it would hold and gave him to drink four times he emptied my improvised cup before he was satisfied then with a sigh of relief he lay down again  the three of us rested there for perhaps half an hour don and i sitting quietly on the wall of the canyon while foxie browsed on occasional tufts of grass during that time the hound never raised his sleek dark head which showed conclusively the nature of the silence and now that i had companyas good company as any hunter ever hadi was once more contented  don got up at length of his own volition and with a wag of his tail set off westward along the rim remounting my mustang i kept as close to dons heels as the rough going permitted the hound however showed no disposition to hurry and i let him have his way without a word  we came out in the notch of the great amphitheater or curve we had named the bay and i saw again the downward slope the bold steps the color and depth below  i was just about to yell a signal cry when i saw don with hair rising stiff run forward he took a dozen jumps then yelping broke down the steep yellow and green gorge he disappeared before i knew what had happened  shortly i found a lion track freshly made leading down i believed i could follow wherever don led so i decided to go after him i tied foxie securely removed my coat kicked off spurs and chaps and remembering past unnecessary toil fastened a red bandana to the top of a dead snag to show me where to come up on my way out then i carefully strapped my canteen and camera on my back made doubly secure my revolver put on my heavy gloves and started down and i realized at once that only so lightly encumbered should i have ever ventured down the slope  little benches of rock grassy on top with here and there cedar trees led steeply down for perhaps five hundred feet a precipice stopped me from it i heard don baying below and almost instantly saw the yellow gleam of a lion in a treetop  hi hi hi hi hi i yelled in wild encouragement  i felt it would be wise to look before i leaped the bay lay under me a mile wide where it opened into the great slumbering smoky canyon all below was chaos of splintered stone and slope green jumble of cedar ruined detached sliding standing cliff walls leaning yellow cragsan awful hole but i could get down and that was all i cared for i ran along to the left jumping cracks bounding over the uneven stones with sure swift feet and came to where the cliff ended in weathered slope and scaly bench  it was like a game going down that canyon my heavy nailed boots struck fire from the rocks my heavy gloves protected my hands as i slid and hung on and let go i outfooted the avalanches and wherever i came to a scaly slope or bank or decayed rock i leaped down in sheer delight  but all too soon my progress was barred once under the cliff i found only a gradual slope and many obstacles to go round or surmount luck favored me for i ran across a runway and keeping to it made better time i heard don long before i tried to see him and yelled at intervals to let him know i was coming a white bank of weathered stones led down to a clump of cedars from where dons bay came spurring me to greater efforts i flew down this bank and through an opening saw the hound standing with fore feet against a cedar the branches over him swayed and i saw an indistinct tawny form move downward in the air then succeeded the crash and rattle of stones don left the tree and disappeared  i dashed down dodged under the cedars threaded a maze of rocks to find myself in a ravine with a bare waterworn floor in patches of sand showed the fresh tracks of don and the lion running down this dry clean bed was the easiest going i ever found in the canyon every rod the course jumped in a fall from four to ten feet often more and these i slid down how i ever kept don in hearing was a marvel but still i did  the lion evidently had no further intention of taking to a tree from the size of his track i concluded he was old and i feared every moment to hear the sounds of a fight jones had said that nearly always in the case of one hound chasing an old lion the lion would lie in wait for him and kill him and i was afraid for don  down down down we went till the yellow rim above seemed a thin band of gold i saw that we were almost to the canyon proper and i wondered what would happen when we reached it the dark shaded watercourse suddenly shot out into bright light and ended in a deep cove with perpendicular walls fifty feet high i could see where a few rods farther on this cove opened into a huge airy colored canyon  i called the hound wondering if he had gone to the right or left of the cove his bay answered me coming from the cedars far to the right i turned with all the speed left in me for i felt the chase nearing an end tracks of hound and lion once more showed in the dust the slope was steep and stones i sent rolling cracked down below soon i had a cliff above me and had to go slow and cautiously a misstep or slide would have precipitated me into the cove  almost before i knew what i was about i stood gasping on the gigantic second wall of the canyon with nothing but thin air under me except far below faint and indistinct purple clefts red ridges dotted slopes running down to merge in a dark winding strip of water that was the rio colorado a sullen murmur soared out of the abyss  illustration two lions in one tree  illustration jones emett and the navajo with the lions  the coloring of my mood changed never had the canyon struck me so terribly with its illimitable space its dread depth its unscalable cliffs and particularly with the desolate forbidding quality of its silence  i heard don bark turning the corner of the cliff wall i saw him on a narrow shelf he was coming toward me and when he reached me he faced again to the wall and barked fiercely the hair on his neck bristled i knew he did not fancy that narrow strip of rock nor did i but a sudden grim cold something had taken possession of me and i stepped forward  come on don old fellow weve got him corralled  that was the first instance i ever knew of dons hesitation in the chase of a lion i had to coax him to me but once started he took the lead and i closely followed  the shelf was twenty feet wide and upon it close to the wall in the dust were the deep imprints of the lion a jutting corner of cliff wall hid my view i peeped around it the shelf narrowed on the other side to a yard in width and climbed gradually by broken steps don passed the corner looked back to see if i was coming and went on he did this four times once even stopping to wait for me  im with you don i grimly muttered well see this trail out to a finish  i had now no eyes for the wonders of the place though i could not but see as i bent a piercing gaze ahead the ponderous overhanging wall above and sense the bottomless depth below i felt rather than saw the canyon swallows sweeping by in darting flight with soft rustle of wings and i heard the shrill chirp of some strange cliff inhabitant  don ceased barking how strange that seemed to me we were no longer man and hound but companions brothers each one relying on the other a protruding corner shut us from sight of what was beyond don slipped around i had to go sidewise and shuddered as my fingers bit into the wall  to my surprise i soon found myself on the floor of a shallow wind cave the lion trail led straight across it and on shelves of rock stuck out above under which i hurriedly walked i came upon a shrub cedar growing in a niche and marveled to see it there don went slower and slower  we suddenly rounded a point to see the lion lying in a boxlike space in the wall the shelf ended there i had once before been confronted with a like situation and had expected to find it here so was not frightened the lion looked up from his task of licking a bloody paw and uttered a fierce growl his tail began to lash to and fro it knocked the little stones off the shelf i heard them click on the wall again and again he spat showing great white fangs he was a tom heavy and large  it had been my purpose of course to photograph this lion and now that we had cornered him i proposed to do it what would follow had only hazily formed in my mind but the nucleus of it was that he should go free i got my camera opened it and focused from between twenty and twentyfive feet  then a growl from don and roar from the lion bade me come to my senses i did so and my first movement after seeing the lion had risen threateningly was to whip out my revolver  the lions cruel yellow eyes darkened and darkened in an instant i saw my error jones had always said in case any one of us had to face a lion never for a single instant to shift his glance i had forgotten that and in that short interval when i focused my camera the lion had seen i meant him no harm or feared him and he had risen even then in desperate lessening ambition for a great picture i attempted to take one still keeping my glance on him  it was then that the appalling nature of my predicament made itself plain to me the lion leaped ten feet and stood snarling horribly right in my face  brave noble don with infinitely more sense and courage than i possessed faced the lion and bayed him in his teeth i raised the revolver and aimed twice each time lowering it because i feared to shoot in such a precarious position to wound the lion would be the worst thing i could do and i knew that only a shot through the brain would kill him in his tracks  hold him don hold him i yelled and i took a backward step the lion put forward one big paw his eyes now all purple blaze i backed again and he came forward don gave ground slowly once the lion flashed a yellow paw at him it was frightful to see the widespread claws  in the consternation of the moment i allowed the lion to back me across the front of the wind cave where i saw the moment it was too late i should have taken advantage of more space to shoot him  fright succeeded consternation and i began to tremble the lion was master of the situation what would happen when i came to the narrow point on the shelf where it would be impossible for me to back around i almost fainted the thought of heroic don saved me and the weak moment passed  by god don youve got the nerve and i must have it too  i stopped in my tracks the lion appearing huge now took slow catlike steps toward me backing don almost against my knees he was so close i smelt him his wonderful eyes clear blue fire circled by yellow flame fascinated me hugging the wall with my body i brought the revolver up short armed and with clinched teeth and nerve strained to the breaking point i aimed between the eyes and pulled the trigger  the left eye seemed to go out blankly then followed the bellow of the revolver and the smell of powder the lion uttered a sound that was a mingling of snarls howls and roars and he rose straight up towering high over my head beating the wall heavily with his paws  in helpless terror i stood there forgetting weapon fearing only the beast would fall over on me  but in death agony he bounded out from the wall to fall into space  i sank down on the shelf legs powerless body in cold sweat as i waited slowly my mind freed itself from a tight iron band and a sickening relief filled my soul tensely i waited and listened don whined once  would the lion never strike what seemed a long period of time ended in a low distant roar of sliding rock quickly dying into the solemn stillness of the canyon   xi  i lay there for some moments slowly recovering eyes on the far distant escarpments now darkly red and repellent to me when i got up my legs were still shaky and i had the strange weak sensation of a long bedridden invalid three attempts were necessary before i could trust myself on the narrow strip of shelf but once around it with the peril passed i braced up and soon reached the turn in the wall  after that the ascent out of the bay was only a matter of work which i gave with a will don did not evince any desire for more hunting that day we reached the rim together and after a short rest i mounted my horse and we turned for camp  the sun had long slanted toward the western horizon when i saw the blue smoke of our campfire among the pines the hounds rose up and barked as don trotted in to the blaze and my companions just sitting to a dinner gave me a noisy greeting  shore wed began to get worried said jim we all had it comin to us today and dont you forget that  dinner lasted for a long hour besides being half famished we all took time between bites to talk i told my story first expecting my friends to be overwhelmed but they were not  its been the greatest day of lion hunting that i ever experienced declared jones we ran bang into a nest of lions and they split we all split and the hounds split that tells the tale we have nothing to show for our days toil six lions chased rounded up treed holed and one lion killed and we havent even his skin to show i did not go down but i helped ranger and two of the pups chase a lion all over the lower end of the plateau we treed him twice and i yelled for you fellows till my voice was gone  well said emett i fell in with sounder and jude they were hot on a trail which in a mile or two turned up this way i came on them just at the edge of the pines where they had treed their game i sat under that pine tree for five hours fired all my shots to make you fellows come yelled myself hoarse and then tried to tie up the lion alone he jumped out and ran over the rim where neither i nor the dogs could follow  shore i win three of a kind drawled jim as he got his pipe and carefully dusted the bowl when the stampede came i got my hands on moze and held him i held moze because just as the other hounds broke loose over to my right i saw down into a little pocket where a freshkilled deer lay half eaten so i went down i found two other carcasses layin there fresh killed last night flesh all gone hide gone bones crushed skull split open an damn me fellows if that little pocket wasnt all torn to pieces the sage was crushed flat the ground dug up dead snags broken and blood and hair everywhere lion tracks like leaves and old sultans was there i let moze loose and he humped the trail of several lions south over the rim major got down first an came back with his tail between his legs moze went down and i kept close to him it wasnt far down but steep and rocky full of holes moze took the trail to a dark cave i saw the tracks of three lions goin in then i collared moze an waited for you fellows i waited there all day an nobody came to my call then i made for camp  how do you account for the tornup appearance of the place where you found the carcasses i asked  lion fight sure replied jones maybe old sultan ran across the three lions feeding and pitched into them such fights were common among the lions in yellowstone park when i was there  what chance have we to find those three lions in a cave where jim chased them  we stand a good chance said jones especially if it storms tonight  shore the snow storm is comin returned jim  darkness clapped down on us suddenly and the wind roared in the pines like a mighty river tearing its way down a rocky pass as we could not control the campfire sparks of which blew fiercely we extinguished it and went to bed i had just settled myself comfortably to be sung to sleep by the concert in the pines when jones hailed me  say what do you think he yelled when i had answered him emett is mad hes scratching to beat the band hes got em  i signalled his information with a loud whoop of victory  you next jones theyre coming to you  i heard him grumble over my happy anticipation jim laughed and so did the navajo which made me suspect that he could understand more english than he wanted us to suppose  next morning a merry yell disturbed my slumbers snowed insnowed in  mucha snowdiscassno cougiedam no bueno exclaimed navvy  when i peeped out to see the forest in the throes of a blinding blizzard the great pines only pale grotesque shadows everything white mantled in a foot of snow i emphasized the indian words in straight english  much snowcoldno cougarbad  stay in bed yelled jones  all right i replied say jones have you got em yet  he vouchsafed me no answer i went to sleep then and dozed off and on till noon when the storm abated we had dinner or rather breakfast round a blazing bonfire  its going to clear up said jim  the forest around us was a somber and gloomy place the cloud that had enveloped the plateau lifted and began to move it hit the tree tops sometimes rolling almost to the ground then rising above the trees at first it moved slowly rolling forming expanding blooming like a column of whirling gray smoke then it gathered headway and rolled onward through the forest a gray gloomy curtain moving and rippling split by the trees seemed to be passing over us it rose higher and higher to split up in great globes to roll apart showing glimpses of blue sky  shafts of golden sunshine shot down from these rifts dispelling the shadows and gloom moving in paths of gold through the forest glade gleaming with brilliantly colored fire from the snowwreathed pines  the cloud rolled away and the sun shone hot the trees began to drip a mist of diamonds filled the air rainbows curved through every glade and feathered patches of snow floated down  a great bank of snow sliding from the pine overhead almost buried the navajo to our infinite delight we all sought the shelter of the tents and sleep again claimed us  i awoke about five oclock the sun was low making crimson paths in the white aisles of the forest a cold wind promised a frosty morning  tomorrow will be the day for lions exclaimed jones  while we hugged the fire navvy brought up the horses and gave them their oats the hounds sought their shelter and the lions lay hidden in their beds of pine the round red sun dropped out of sight beyond the trees a pink glow suffused all the ridges blue shadows gathered in the hollow shaded purple and stole upward a brief twilight succeeded to a dark coldly starlit night  once again when i had crawled into the warm hole of my sleeping bag was i hailed from the other tent  emett called me twice and as i answered i heard jones remonstrating in a low voice  shore jones has got em yelled jim he cant keep it a secret no longer  hey jones i cried do you remember laughing at me  no i dont growled jones  listen to this hawhaw haw haw hoho hoho bueno bueno and i wound up with a string of hi hi hi hi hi  the hounds rose up in a body and began to yelp  lie down pups i called to them nothing doing for you its only jones has got em   xii  when we trooped out of the pines next morning the sun rising gloriously bright had already taken off the keen edge of the frosty air presaging a warm day the white ridges glistened the bunches of sage scintillated and the cedars tipped in snow resembled trees with brilliant blossoms  we lost no time riding for the mouth of left canyon into which jim had trailed the three lions on the way the snow as we had expected began to thin out and it failed altogether under the cedars though there was enough on the branches to give us a drenching  jim reined in on the verge of a narrow gorge and informed us the cave was below jones looked the ground over and said jim had better take the hounds down while the rest of us remained above to await developments  jim went down on foot calling the hounds and holding them close we listened eagerly for him to yell or the pack to open up but we were disappointed in less than half an hour jim came climbing out with the information that the lions had left the cave probably the evening after he had chased them there  well then said jones lets split the pack and hunt round the rims of these canyons we can signal to each other if necessary  so we arranged for jim to take ranger and the pups across left canyon emett to try middle canyon with don and moze and we were to perform a like office in right canyon with sounder and jude emett rode back with us leaving us where we crossed middle canyon  jones and i rimmed a mile of our canyon and worked out almost to the west end of the bay without finding so much as a single track so we started to retrace our way the sun was now hot the snow all gone the ground dry as if it had never been damp and jones grumbled that no success would attend our efforts this morning  we reached the ragged mouth of right canyon where it opened into the deep wide bay and because we hoped to hear our companions across the canyon we rode close to the rim sounder and jude both began to bark on a cliff however as we could find no tracks in the dust we called them off sounder obeyed reluctantly but jude wanted to get down over the wall  they scent a lion averred jones lets put them over the wall  once permitted to go the hounds needed no assistance they ran up and down the rim till they found a crack hardly had they gone out of sight when we heard them yelping we rushed to the rim and looked over the first step was short a crumbled section of wall and from it led down a long slope dotted here and there with cedars both hounds were baying furiously  i spied jude with her paws up on a cedar and above her hung a lion so close that she could nearly reach him sounder was not yet in sight  there there i cried directing jones glance are we not lucky  i see by george come well go down leave everything that you dont absolutely need  spurs chaps gun coat hat i left on the rim taking only my camera and lasso i had forgotten to bring my canteen we descended a ladder of shaly cliff the steps of which broke under our feet the slope below us was easy and soon we stood on a level with the lion the cedar was small and afforded no good place for him evidently he jumped from the slope to the tree and had hung where he first alighted  wheres sounder look for him i hear him below this lion wont stay treed long  i too heard sounder the cedar tree obstructed my view and i moved aside a hundred feet farther down the hound bayed under a tall piñon high in the branches i saw a great mass of yellow and at first glance thought sounder had treed old sultan how i yelled then a second glance showed two lions close together  two more two more look look i yelled to jones  hi hi hi he joined his robust yell to mine and for a moment we made the canyon bellow when we stopped for breath the echoes bayed at us from the opposite walls  waahoo emetts signal faint far away soaring but unmistakable floated down to us across the jutting capes separating the mouths of these canyons high above them on the rim wall of the opposite side of the bay stood a giant white horse silhouetted against the white sky they made a brave picture one most welcome to us we yelled in chorus three lions treed three lions treed come downhurry  a crash of rolling stones made us wheel judes lion had jumped he ran straight down drawing sounder from his guard jude went tearing after them  ill follow you stay here keep them up there if you can yelled jones then in long strides he passed down out of sight among the trees and crags  it had all happened so quickly that i could scarcely realize it the yelping of the hounds the clattering of stones grew fainter telling me jude and sounder with jones were going to the bottom of the bay  both lions snarling at me brought me to a keen appreciation of the facts in the case two fullgrown lions to be kept treed without hounds without a companion without a gun  this is fine this is funny i cried and for a moment i wanted to run but the same grim deadly feeling that had taken me with don around the narrow shelf now rose in me stronger and fiercer i pronounced one savage malediction upon myself for leaving my gun i could not go for it i would have to make the best of my error and in the wildness born of the moment i swore if the lions would stay treed for the hounds they would stay treed for me  first i photographed them from different positions then i took up my stand about on a level with them in an open place on the slope where they had me in plain sight i might have been fifty feet from them they showed no inclination to come down  about this moment i heard hounds below coming down from the left i called and called but they passed on down the canyon bottom in the direction jones had taken  presently a chorus of bays emphasized by jones yell told me his lion had treed again  waahoo rolled down from above  i saw emett farther to the left from the point where he had just appeared  wherecanigetdown  i surveyed the walls of the bay cliff on cliff slide on slide jumble crag and ruin baffled my gaze but i finally picked out a path  farther to the left i yelled and waited he passed on don at his heels  there i yelled again stop there let don go down with your lasso and come yourself  i watched him swing the hound down a wall and pull the slip noose free don slid to the edge of a slope trotted to the right and left of crags threaded the narrow places and turned in the direction of the baying hounds he passed on the verge of precipices that made me tremble for him but surefooted as a goat he went on safely down to disappear far to my right  then i saw emett sliding leg wrapped around his lasso down the first step of the rim his lasso doubled so as to reach round a cedar above was too short to extend to the landing below he dropped raising a cloud of dust and starting the stones pulling one end of his lasso up around the cedar he gathered it in a coil on his arm and faced forward following dons trail  what strides he took in the clear light with that wild red and yellow background with the stones and gravel roaring down streaming over the walls like waterfalls he seemed a giant pursuing a foe from time to time he sent up a yell of encouragement that wound down the canyon to be answered by jones and the baying hounds and then the strange echoes at last he passed out of sight behind the crests of the trees i heard him going down down till the sounds came up faint and hollow  i was left absolutely alone with my two lions and never did a hunter so delight in a situation i sat there in the sun watching them for a long time they were quiet listening but as the bays and yells below diminished in volume and occurrence and then ceased altogether they became restless it was then that i remembering the lion i had held on top of the crag began to bark like a hound the lions became quiet once more  i bayed them for an hour my voice grew from hoarse to hoarser and finally failed in my throat the lions immediately grew restless again the lower one hissed spat and growled at me and made many attempts to start down each one of which i frustrated by throwing stones under the tree at length he made one more determined effort turned head downward and stepped from branch to branch  i dashed down the incline with a stone in one hand and a long club in the other instinctively i knew i must hurt himmake him fear me if he got far enough down to jump he would either escape or have me helpless i aimed deliberately at him and hit him square in the ribs he exploded in a spitroar that raised my hair directly under him i wielded my club pounded on the tree thrashed at the branches and like the crazy fool that i was yelled at him  go back go back dont you dare come down id break your old head for you  foolish or not this means effectually stopped the descent he climbed to his first perch it was then realizing what i had done that i would certainly have made tracks from under the piñon if i had not heard the faint yelp of a hound  i listened it came again faint but clearer i looked up at my lions they too heard for they were very still i saw how strained they held their heads i backed a little way up the slope then the faint yelp floated up again in the silence such dead strange silence that seemed never to have been broken i saw the lions quiver and if i ever heard anything in my life i heard their hearts thump the yelp wafted up again closer this time i recognized it it belonged to don the great hound on the back trail of the other lion was coming to my rescue  its don its don its don i cried shaking my club at the lions its all up with you now what feelings stirred me then pity for those lions dominated me big tawny cruel fellows as they were they shivered with fright their sides trembled but pity did not hold me long dons yelp now getting clear and sharp brought back the rush of savage grim sensations  a fulltoned bay attracted my attention from the lions to the downward slope i saw a yellow form moving under the trees and climbing fast it was don  hi hi old boy i yelled  then it seemed he moved up like a shot and stood all his long length forepaws against the piñon his deep bay ringing defiance to the lions  it was a great relief not to say a probable necessity for me to sit down just then  now come down i said to my lions you cant catch that hound and you cant get away from him  moments passed i was just on the point of deciding to go down to hurry up my comrades when i heard the other hounds coming yelp on yelp bay on bay made welcome music to my ears then a black and yellow swiftly flying string of hounds bore into sight down the slope streaked up and circled the piñon  jones who at last showed his tall stooping form on the steep ascent seemed as long in coming as the hounds had been swift  did you get the lion wheres emett i asked in breathless eagerness  lion tiedall fast replied the panting jones left emettto guardhim  what are we to do now  waittill i get my breath think outa plan we cant get both lionsout of one tree  all right i replied after a moments thought ill tie sounder and moze you go up the tree that first lion will jump sure hes almost ready now don and the other hounds will tree him again pretty soon if he runs up the canyon well and good then if you can get the lasso on the other ill yell for emett to come up to help you and ill follow don  jones began the ascent of the piñon the branches were not too close affording him easy climbing before we looked for even a move on the part of the lions the lower one began stepping down i yelled a warning but jones did not have time to take advantage of it he had half turned meaning to swing out and drop when the lion planted both forepaws upon his back jones went sprawling down with the lion almost on him  don had his teeth in the lion before he touched the ground and when he did strike the rest of the hounds were on him a cloud of dust rolled down the slope the lion broke loose and with great springy bounds ran up the canyon don and his followers hotfooting it after him  moze and sounder broke the dead sapling to which i had tied them and dragging it behind them endeavored in frenzied action to join the chase i drew them back loosening the rope so in case the other lion jumped i could free them quickly  jones calmly gathered himself up rearranged his lasso took his long stick and proceeded to mount the piñon again i waited till i saw him slip the noose over the lions head then i ran down the slope to yell for emett he answered at once i told him to hurry to jones assistance with that i headed up the canyon  i hung close to the broad trail left by the lion and his pursuers i passed perilously near the brink of precipices but fear of them was not in me that day i passed out of the bay into the mouth of left canyon and began to climb the baying of the hounds directed me in the box of yellow walls the chorus seemed to come from a hundred dogs  when i found them close to a low cliff baying the lion in a thick dark piñon ranger leaped into my arms and next don stood up against me with his paws on my shoulders these were strange actions and though i marked it at the moment i had ceased to wonder at our hounds i took one picture as the lion sat in the dark shade and then climbed to the low cliff and sat down i called don to me and held him in case our quarry leaped upon the cliff i wanted a hound to put quickly on his trail  another hour passed it must have been a dark hour for the lionhe looked as if it wereand one of impatience for the baying hounds but for me it was a full hour alone with the hounds and a lion far from the walks of men walled in by the wildcolored cliffs with the dry sweet smell of cedar and piñon i asked no more  sounder and moze vociferously venting their arrival were forerunners to jones i saw his gray locks waving in the breeze and yelled for him to take his time as he reached me the lion jumped and ran up the canyon this suited me for i knew he would take to a tree soon and the farther up he went the less distance we would have to pack him from the cliff i saw him run up a slope pass a big cedar cunningly turn on his trail and then climb into the tree and hide in its thickest part don passed him got off the trail and ran at fault the others so used to his leadership were also baffled but jude crippled and slow brought up the rear and she did not go a yard beyond where the lion turned she opened up her deep call under the cedar and in a moment the howling pack were around her  jones and i toiled laboriously upward he had brought my lasso and he handed it to me with the significant remark that i would soon have need of it  the cedar was bushy and overhung a yellow bare slope that made jones shake his head he climbed the tree lassoed the spitting lion and then leaped down to my side by united and determined efforts we pulled the lion off the limb and let him down the hounds began to leap at him we both roared in a rage at them but to no use  hold him there shouted jones leaving me with the lasso while he sprang forward  the weight of the animal dragged me forward and had i not taken a half hitch round a dead snag would have lifted me off my feet or pulled the lasso from my hands as it was the choking lion now within reach of the furious leaping hounds swung to and fro before my face he could not see me but his frantic lunges narrowly missed me  if never before jones then showed his genius don had hold of the lions flank and jones grabbing the hound by the hind legs threw him down the slope don fell and rolled a hundred feet before he caught himself then jones threw old moze rolling and ranger and all except faithful jude before they could get back he roped the lion again and made fast to a tree then he yelled for me to let go the lion fell jones grabbed the lasso at the same time calling for me to stop the hounds as they came bounding up the steep slope i had to club the noble fellows into submission  before the lion recovered wholly from his severe choking we had his paws bound fast then he could only heave his tawny sides glare and spit at us  now what asked jones emett is watching the second lion which we fastened by chain and lasso to a swinging branch im all in my heart wont stand any more climb  you go to camp for the pack horses i said briefly bring them all and all the packs and navvy too ill help emett tie up the second lion and then well pack them both up here to this one you take the hounds with you  can you tie up that lion asked jones mind you hes loose except for a collar and chain his claws havent been clipped besides itll be an awful job to pack those two lions up here  we can try i said you hustle to camp your horse is right up back of here across the point if i dont mistake my bearings  jones admonishing me again called the hounds and wearily climbed the slope i waited until he was out of hearing then began to retrace my trail down into the canyon i made the descent in quick time to find emett standing guard over the lion the beast had been tied to an overhanging branch that swung violently with every move he made  when i got here said emett he was hanging over the side of that rock almost choked to death i drove him into this corner between the rocks and the tree where he has been comparatively quiet now whats up where is jones did you get the third lion  i related what had occurred and then said we were to tie this lion and pack him with the other one up the canyon to meet jones and the horses  all right replied emett with a grim laugh wed better get at it now im some worried about the lion we left below he ought to be brought up but we both cant go this lion here will kill himself  what will the other one weigh  all of one hundred and fifty pounds  you cant pack him alone  ill try and i reckon thats the best plan watch this fellow and keep him in the corner  emett left me then and i began a third long vigil beside a lion the rest was more than welcome an hour and a half passed before i heard the sliding of stones below which told me that emett was coming he appeared on the slope almost bent double carrying the lion head downward before him he could climb only a few steps without lowering his burden and resting  i ran down to meet him we secured a stout pole and slipping this between the lions paws below where they were tied we managed to carry him fairly well and after several rests got him up alongside the other  now to tie that rascal exclaimed emett jones said he was the meanest one hed tackled and i believe it well cut a piece off of each lasso and unravel them so as to get strings i wish jones hadnt tied the lasso to that swinging branch  ill go and untie it acting on this suggestion i climbed the tree and started out on the branch the lion growled fiercely  im afraid youd better stop warned emett that branch is bending and the lion can reach you  but despite this i slipped out a couple of yards farther and had almost gotten to the knotted lasso when the branch swayed and bent alarmingly the lion sprang from his corner and crouched under me snarling and spitting with every indication of leaping  jump jump jump shouted emett hoarsely  illustration billy in camp  illustration lion licking snowball  i dared not for i could not jump far enough to get out of the lions reach i raised my legs and began to slide myself back up the branch the lion leaped missing me but scattering the dead twigs then the beast beside himself with fury half leaped half stood up and reached for me i looked down into his blazing eyes and open mouth and saw his white fangs  everything grew blurred before my eyes i desperately fought for control over mind and muscle i heard hoarse roars from emett then i felt a hot burning pain in my wrist which stung all my faculties into keen life again  i saw the lions beaked claws fastened in my leather wristband at the same instant emett dashed under the branch and grasped the lions tail one powerful lunge of his broad shoulders tore the lion loose and flung him down the slope to the full extent of his lasso quick as thought i jumped down and just in time to prevent emett from attacking the lion with the heavy pole we had used  ill kill him ill kill him roared emett  no you wont i replied quietly for my pain had served to soothe my excitement as well as to make me more determined well tie up the darned tiger if he cuts us all to pieces you know how jones will give us the laugh if we fail here bind up my wrist  mention of jones probable ridicule and sight of my injury cooled emett  its a nasty scratch he said binding my handkerchief round it the leather saved your hand from being torn off hes an ugly brute but youre right well tie him now lets each take a lasso and worry him till we get hold of a paw then we can stretch him out  jones did a fiendish thing when he tied that lion to the swinging branch it was almost worse than having him entirely free he had a circle almost twenty feet in diameter in which he could run and leap at will it seemed he was in the air all the time first at emett than at me he sprang mouth agape eyes wild claws spread we whipped him with our nooses but not one would hold he always tore it off before we could draw it tight i secured a precarious hold on one hind paw and straightened my lasso  thats far enough cried emett now hold him tight dont lift him off the ground  i had backed up the slope emett faced the lion noose ready waiting for a favorable chance to rope a front paw the lion crouched low and tense only his long tail lashing back and forth across my lasso emett threw the loop in front of the spread paws now half sunk into the dust  ease up ease up said he ill tease him to jump into the noose  i let my rope sag emett poked a stick into the lions face all at once i saw the slack in the lasso which was tied to the lions chain before i could yell to warn my comrade the beast leaped my rope burned as it tore through my hands the lion sailed into the air his paws widespread like wings and one of them struck emett on the head and rolled him on the slope i jerked back on my rope only to find it had slipped its hold  he slugged me one remarked emett calmly rising and picking up his hat did he break the skin  no but he tore your hat band off i replied lets keep at him  for a few moments or an hourno one will ever know how longwe ran round him raising the dust scattering the stones breaking the branches dodging his onslaughts he leaped at us to the full length of his tether sailing right into our faces a fierce uncowed tigerish beast if it had not been for the collar and swivel he would have choked himself a hundred times quick as a cat supple powerful tireless he kept on the go whirling bounding leaping rolling till it seemed we would never catch him  if anything breaks hell get one of us cried emett i felt his breath that time  lord how i wish we had some of those fellows here who say lions are rank cowards i exclaimed  in one of his sweeping side swings the lion struck the rock and hung there on its flat surface with his tail hanging over  attract his attention shouted emett but dont get too close dont make him jump  while i slowly manoeuvered in front of the lion emett slipped behind the rock lunged for the long tail and got a good hold of it then with a whoop he ran around the rock carrying the kicking squalling lion clear of the ground  nows your chance he yelled rope a hind foot i can hold him  in a second i had a noose fast on both hind paws and then passed my rope to emett while he held the lion i again climbed the tree untied the knot that had caused so much trouble and very shortly we had our obstinate captive stretched out between two trees after that we took a much needed breathing spell  not very scientific growled emett by way of apologizing for our crude work but we had to get him some way  emett do you know i believe jones put up a job on us i said  well maybe he did we had the job all right but well make short work of him now  he certainly went at it in a way that alarmed me and would have electrified jones while i held the chain emett muzzled the lion with a stick and a strand of lasso his big blacksmiths hands held twisted and tied with remorseless strength  now for the hardest part of it said he packing him up  we toiled and drudged upward resting every few yards wet with sweat boiling with heat parching for water we slipped and fell got up to slip and fall again the dust choked us we senselessly risked our lives on the brinks of precipices we had no thought save to get the lion up one hour of unremitting labor saw our task finished so far then we wearily went down for the other  this one is the heaviest gloomily said emett  we had to climb partly sidewise with the pole in the hollow of our elbows the lion dragged head downward catching in the brush and on the stones our rests became more frequent emett who had the downward end of the pole and therefore thrice the weight whistled when he drew breath half the time i saw red mist before my eyes how i hated the sliding stones  wait panted emett once youreyoungerthan mewait  for that mormon giantused all his days to strenuous toil peril and privationto ask me to wait for him was a compliment which i valued more than any i had ever received  at last we dropped our burden in the shade of a cedar where the other lions lay and we stretched ourselves a long sweet rest came abruptly to end with emetts next words  the lions are choking theyre dying of thirst we must have water  one glance at the poor gasping frothing beasts proved to me the nature of our extremity  water in this desert where will we find it oh why did i forget my canteen  after all our hopes our efforts our tragedies and finally our wonderful good fortune to lose these beautiful lions for lack of a little water was sickening maddening  think quick cried emett im no good im all in but you must find water it snowed yesterday theres water somewhere  into my mind flashed a picture of the many little pockets beaten by rains into the shelves and promontories of the canyon rim with the thought i was on the jump i ran i climbed i seemed to have wings i reached the rim and hurried along it with eager gaze i swung down on a cedar branch to a projecting point of rock small depressions were everywhere still damp but the water had evaporated but i would not give up i jumped from rock to rock and climbed over scaly ledges and set tons of yellow shale into motion and i found on a ragged promontory many little round holes some a foot deep all full of clear water using my handkerchief as a sponge i filled my cap  then began my journey down i carried the cap with both hands and balanced myself like a tightrope performer i zigzagged the slopes slipped over stones leaped fissures and traversed yellow slides i safely descended places that in an ordinary moment would have presented insurmountable obstacles and burst down upon emett with an indian yell of triumph  good ejaculated he if i had not known it already the way his face changed would have told me of his love for animals he grasped a lion by the ears and held his head up i saturated my handkerchief and squeezed the water into his mouth he wheezed coughed choked but to our joy he swallowed he had to swallow one after the other we served them so seeing with unmistakable relief the sure signs of recovery their eyes cleared and brightened the dry coughing that distressed us so ceased the froth came no more the savage fellow that had fought us to a standstill and for which we had named him spitfire raised his head the gold in his beautiful eyes darkened to fire and he growled his return to life and defiance  emett and i sank back in unutterable relief  waahoo jones yell came breaking the warm quiet of the slope our comrade appeared riding down the voice of the indian calling to marc mingled with the ringing of ironshod hoofs on the stones  jones surveyed the small level spot in the shade of the cedars he gazed from the lions to us his stern face relaxed and his dry laugh cracked  doggone me if you didnt do it   xiii  a strange procession soon emerged from left canyon and stranger to us than the lion heads bobbing out of the alfagoes was the sight of navvy riding in front of the lions i kept well in the rear for if anything happened which i calculated was more than likely i wanted to see it before we had reached the outskirts of pines i observed that the piece of lasso around spitfires nose had worked loose  just as i was about to make this known to jones the lion opened a corner of his mouth and fastened his teeth in the navajos overalls he did not catch the flesh for when navvy turned around he wore only an expression of curiosity but when he saw spitfire chewing him he uttered a shrill scream and fell sidewise off his horse  then two difficulties presented themselves to us to catch the frightened horse and persuade the indian he had not been bitten we failed in the latter navvy gave us and the lions a wide berth and walked to camp  jim was waiting for us and said he had chased a lion south along the rim till the hounds got away from him  spitfire having already been chained was the first lion we endeavored to introduce to our family of captives he raised such a fearful row that we had to remove him some distance from the others  we have two dog chains said jones but not a collar or a swivel in camp we cant chain the lions without swivels theyd choke themselves in two minutes  once more for the hundredth time emett came to our rescue with his inventive and mechanical skill he took the largest pair of hobbles we had and with an axe a knife and jones wire nippers fashioned two collars with swivels that for strength and serviceableness improved somewhat on those we had bought  darkness was enveloping the forest when we finished supper i fell into my bed and despite the throbbing and burning of my wrist soon lapsed into slumber and i crawled out next morning late for breakfast stiff worn out crippled but happy six lions roaring a concert for me was quite conducive to contentment  emett interestingly engaged himself on a new pair of trousers which he had contrived to produce from two of our empty mealbags the lower half of his overalls had gone to decorate the cedar spikes and brush and these new bagleg trousers while somewhat remarkable for design answered the purpose well enough jones coat was somewhere along the canyon rim his shoes were full of holes his shirt in strips and his trousers in rags jim looked like a scarecrow my clothes being of heavy waterproofed duck had stood the hard usage in a manner to bring forth the unanimous admiration of my companions  well fellows said jones theres six lions and thats more than we can pack out of here have you had enough hunting i have  and i rejoined emett  shore you can bet i have drawled jim  one more day boys and then ive done said i only one more day  signs of relief on the faces of my good comrades showed how they took this evidence of my satisfied ambition  i spent all the afternoon with the lions photographing them listening to them spit and growl watching them fight their chains and roll up like balls of fire from different parts of the forest i tried to creep unsuspected upon them but always when i peeped out from behind a tree or log every pair of ears would be erect every pair of eyes gleaming and suspicious  spitfire afforded more amusement than all the others he had indeed the temper of a king he had been born for sovereignty not slavery to intimidate me he tried every manner of expression and utterance and failing he always ended with a spring in the air to the length of his chain this means was always effective i simply could not stand still when he leaped and in turn i tried every artifice i could think of to make him back away from me to take refuge behind his tree i ran at him with a club as if i were going to kill him he waited crouching finally in dire extremity i bethought me of a red flannel hood that emett had given me saying i might use it on cold nights this was indeed a weird flaming headgear falling like a cloak down over the shoulders i put it on and camera in hand started to crawl on all fours toward spitfire  illustration some of our menagerie in buckskin forest  illustration white mustang stallion with his bunch of blacks in snake gulch  i needed no one to tell me that this proceeding was entirely beyond his comprehension in his astonishment he forgot to spit and growl and he backed behind the little pine from which he regarded me with growing perplexity then having revenged myself on him and getting a picture i left him in peace   xiv  i awoke before dawn and lay watching the dark shadows change into gray and gray into light the navajo chanted solemnly and low his morning song i got up with the keen eagerness of the hunter who faces the last day of his hunt  i warmed my frozen fingers at the fire a hot breakfast smoked on the red coals we ate while navvy fed and saddled the horses  shore theyll be somethin doin today said jim fatalistically  we havent crippled a horse yet put in emett hopefully don led the pack and us down the ridge out of the pines into the sage the sun a red ball glared out of the eastern mist shedding a dull glow on the ramparts of the far canyon walls a herd of whitetailed deer scattered before the hounds blue grouse whirred from under our horses feet  spread out ordered jones and though he meant the hounds we all followed his suggestion as the wisest course  ranger began to work up the sage ridge to the right jones emett and i followed while jim rode away to the left gradually the space widened and as we neared the cedars a sharply defined deep canyon separated us  we heard don open up then sounder ranger left the trail he was trying to work out in the thick sage and bounded in the direction of the rest of the pack we reined in to listen  first don then sounder then jude then one of the pups bayed eagerly telling us they were hunting hard suddenly the bays blended in one savage sound  hi hi hi cracked the cool thin air we saw jim wave his hand from the far side of the canyon spur his horse into action and disappear into the cedars  stick close together yelled jones as we launched forward we made the mistake of not going back to cross the canyon for the hounds soon went up the opposite side as we rode on and on the sounds of the chase lessened and finally ceased to our great chagrin we found it necessary to retrace our steps and when we did get over the deep gully so much time had elapsed that we despaired of coming up with jim emett led keeping close on jims trail which showed plain in the dust and we followed  up and down ravines over ridges through sage flats and cedar forests to and fro around and around we trailed jim and the hounds from time to time one of us let out a long yell  i see a big lion track called jones once and that stirred us on faster fully an hour passed before jones halted us saying we had best try a signal i dismounted while emett rolled his great voice through the cedars  a long silence ensued from the depths of the forest jims answer struck faintly on my ear with a word to my companions i leaped on my mustang and led the way i rode as far as i could mark a straight line with my eye then stopped to wait for another cry in this way slowly but surely we closed in on jim  we found him on the verge of the bay in the small glade where i had left my horse the day i followed don alone down the canyon jim was engaged in binding up the leg of his horse the baying of the hounds floated up over the rim  whats up queried jones  old sultan thats what replied jim we run plumb into him weve had him in five trees it aint been long since he was in that cedar there when he jumped the yellow pup was in the way an got killed my horse just managed to jump clear of the big lion an as it was nearly broke his leg  emett examined the leg and pronounced it badly strained and advised jim to lead the horse back to camp jones and i stood a moment over the remains of the yellow pup and presently emett joined us  he was the most playful one of the pack said emett and then he placed the limp bloody body in a crack and laid several slabs of stone over it  hurry after the other hounds said jim that lion will kill them one by one an look out for him  if we needed an incentive the danger threatening the hounds furnished one but i calculated the death of the pup was enough emett had a flare in his eye jones looked darker and more grim than ever and i had sensations that boded ill to old sultan  fellows i said ive been down this place and i know where the old brute has gone so come on  i laid aside my coat chaps and rifle feeling that the business ahead was stern and difficult then i faced the canyon down slopes among rocks under piñons around yellow walls along slides the two big men followed me with heavy steps we reached the white streambed and sliding slipping jumping always down and down we came at last within sound of the hounds we found them baying wildly under a piñon on the brink of the deep cove  then at once we all saw old sultan close at hand he was of immense size his color was almost gray his head huge his paws heavy and round he did not spit nor snarl nor growl he did not look at the hounds but kept his halfshut eyes upon us  we had no time to make a move before he left his perch and hit the ground with a thud he walked by the baying hounds looked over the brink of the cove and without an instant of hesitation leaped down the rattling crash of sliding stones came up with a cloud of dust then we saw him leisurely picking his way among the rough stones  exclamations from the three of us attested to what we thought of that leap  look the place over called jones i think weve got him  the cove was a hole hollowed out by running water at its head where the perpendicular wall curved the height was not less than forty feet the walls became higher as the cove deepened toward the canyon it had a length of perhaps a hundred yards and a width of perhaps half as many the floor was mass on mass of splintered rock  let the hounds down on a lasso said jones  easier said than done sounder ranger jude refused old moze grumbled and broke away but don stern and savage allowed jones to tie him in a slip noose  its a shame to send that grand hound to his death protested emett  well all go down declared jones  we cant one will have to stay up here to help the other two out replied emett  youre the strongest you stay up said jones better work along the wall and see if you can locate the lion  illustration on the way home  illustration riding with a navajo  we let don down into the hole he kicked himself loose before reaching the bottom and then yelping he went out of sight among the boulders moze as if ashamed came whining to us we slipped a noose around him and lowered him kicking and barking to the rocky floor jones made the lasso fast to a cedar root and i slid down like a flash burning my hands jones swung himself over wrapped his leg around the rope and came down to hit the ground with a thump then lassos in hands we began clambering over the broken fragments  for a few moments we were lost to sights and sounds away from our immediate vicinity the bottom of the cove afforded hard going dead piñons and cedars blocked our way the great jagged stones offered no passage we crawled climbed and jumped from piece to piece  a yell from emett halted us we saw him above on the extreme point of wall waving his arms he yelled unintelligible commands to us the fierce baying of don and moze added to our desperate energy  the last jumble of splintered rock cleared we faced a terrible and wonderful scene  look look i gasped to jones  a wide bare strip of stone lay a few yards beneath us and in the center of this last step sat the great lion on his haunches with his long tail lashing out over the precipice back to the canyon he confronted the furious hounds his demeanor had changed to one of savage apprehension  when jones and i appeared old sultan abruptly turned his back to the hounds and looked down into the canyon he walked the whole length of the bare rock with his head stretched over he was looking for a niche or a step whereby he might again elude his foes  faster lashed his tail farther and farther stretched his neck he stopped and with head bent so far over the abyss that it seemed he must fall he looked and looked  how grandly he fitted the savage sublimity of that place the tremendous purple canyon depths lay beneath him he stood on the last step of his mighty throne the great downward slopes had failed him majestically and slowly he turned from the deep that offered no hope  as he turned jones cast the noose of his lasso perfectly round the burly neck sultan roared and worked his jaws but he did not leap jones must have expected such a move for he fastened his rope to a spur of rock standing there revolver gripped hearing the baying hounds the roaring lion and jones yells mingled with emetts i had no idea what to do i was in a trance of sensations  old sultan ran rather than leaped at us jones evaded the rush by falling behind a stone but still did not get out of danger don flew at the lions neck and moze buried his teeth in a flank then the three rolled on the rock dangerously near the verge  bellowing jones grasped the lasso and pulled still holding my revolver i leaped to his assistance and together we pulled and jerked don got away from the lion with remarkable quickness but moze slow and dogged could not elude the outstretched paws which fastened in his side and leg we pulled so hard we slowly raised the lion moze never whimpering clawed and scratched at the rock in his efforts to escape the lions red tongue protruded from his dripping jaws we heard the rend of hide as our efforts combined with those of moze loosed him from the great yellow claws  the lion whirling and wrestling rolled over the precipice when the rope straightened with a twang had it not been fastened to the rock jones and i would have jerked over the wall the shock threw us to our knees  for a moment we did not realize the situation emetts yells awakened us  pull pull pull roared he  then knowing that old sultan would hang himself in a few moments we attempted to lift him jones pulled till his back cracked i pulled till i saw red before my eyes again and again we tried we could lift him only a few feet soon exhausted we had to desist altogether how emett roared and raged from his vantagepoint above he could see the lion in death throes  suddenly he quieted down with the words all over all over then he sat still looking into space jones sat mopping his brow and i all my hot resentment vanished lay on the rock with eyes on the distant mesas  presently jones leaned over the verge with my lasso  there he said ive roped one of his hind legs now well pull him up a little then well fasten this rope and pull on the other  so foot by foot we worked the heavy lion up over the wall he must have been dead though his sides heaved don sniffed at him in disdain moze dusty and bloody with a large strip of hide hanging from his flank came up growling low and deep and gave the lion a last vengeful bite  weve been fools observed jones meditatively the excitement of the game made us lose our wits ill never rope another lion  i said nothing while moze licked his bloody leg and don lay with his fine head on my knees jones began to skin old sultan once more the strange infinite silence enfolded the canyon the faroff golden walls glistened in the sun farther down the purple clefts smoked the manyhued peaks and mesas aloof from each other rose out of the depths it was a grand and gloomy scene of ruin where every glistening descent of rock was but a page of earths history  it brought to my mind a faint appreciation of what time really meant it spoke of an age of former men it showed me the lonesome crags of eagles and the cliff lairs of lions and it taught mutely eloquently a lesson of lifethat men are still savage still driven by a spirit to roam to hunt and to slay     chapter iv   tonto basin  the start of a camping trip the getting a big outfit together and packed and on the move is always a difficult and laborsome job nevertheless for me the preparation and the actual getting under way have always been matters of thrilling interest this start of my hunt in arizona september 24 1918 was particularly momentous because i had brought my boy romer with me for his first trip into the wilds  it may be that the boy was too young for such an undertaking his mother feared he would be injured his teachers presaged his utter ruin his old nurse with whom he waged war until he was free of her averred that the best it could do for him would be to show what kind of stuff he was made of his uncle rc was stoutly in favor of taking him i believe the balance fell in romers favor when i remembered my own boyhood as a youngster of three i had babbled of bars an buffers and woven fantastic and marvelous tales of fiction about my imagined adventuresa habit alas i have never yet outgrown  anyway we only made six miles travel on this september twentyfourth and romer was with us  indeed he was omnipresent his keen eager joy communicated itself to me once he rode up alongside me and said dad thiss great but id rather do like buck duane the boy had read all of my books in spite of parents and teachers and he knew them by heart and invariably liked the outlaws and gunmen best of all  we made camp at sunset with a flare of gold along the west and the peaks rising rosy and clear to the north we camped in a cutover pine forest where stumps and lopped tops and burned deadfalls made an aspect of blackened desolation from a distance however the scene was superb at sunset there was a faint wind which soon died away  my old guide on so many trips across the painted desert was in charge of the outfit he was a wiry gray old pioneer over seventy years hollowcheeked and bronzed with bluegray eyes still keen with fire he was no longer robust but he was tireless and willing when he told a story he always began in the early days his son lee had charge of the horses of which we had fourteen two teams and ten saddle horses lee was a typical westerner of many occupationscowboy rider rancher cattleman he was small thin supple quick tough and strong he had a bronzed face always chapped a hooked nose grayblue eyes like his fathers sharp and keen  lee had engaged the only man he could find for a cookjoe isbel a tall lithe cowboy straight as an indian with powerful shoulders round limbs and slender waist and isbel was what the westerners called a bronchobuster he was a prizewinning rider at all the rodeos indeed his seat in the saddle was individual and incomparable he had a rough redblue face hard and rugged like the rocks he rode over so fearlessly and his eyes were bright hazel steady and hard isbels vernacular was significant speaking of one of our horses he said like a mule hell be your friend for twenty years to git a chance to kick you speaking of another that had to be shod he said shore hell step high tomorrow isbel appeared to be remarkably efficient as camprustler and cook but he did not inspire me with confidence in speaking of this to the doyles i found them noncommittal on the subject westerners have sensitive feelings i could not tell whether they were offended or not and i half regretted mentioning my lack of confidence in isbel as it turned out however i was amply justified  sievert nielsen whom i have mentioned elsewhere was the fourth of my men  darkness had enveloped us at supper time i was tired out but the redembered campfire the cool air the smell of woodsmoke and the white stars kept me awake awhile romer had to be put to bed he was wild with excitement we had had a sleepingbag made for him so that once snugly in it with the flaps buckled he could not kick off the blankets when we got him into it he quieted down and took exceeding interest in his first bed in the open he did not however go quickly to sleep presently he called rc over and whispered say uncle rome i coiled a lasso an put it under nielsens bed when hes asleep you go pull it hes tenderfoot like dad was hell think its a rattlesnake this trick romer must have remembered from reading the last of the plainsmen where i related what buffalo jones cowboys did to me once romer got that secret off his mind he fell asleep  the hour we spent sitting around the campfire was the most pleasant of that night though i did not know it then the smell of woodsmoke and the glow of live coals stirred memories of other campfires i was once more enveloped by the sweetness and peace of the open listening to the sigh of the wind and the faint tinkle of bells on the hobbled horses  an uncomfortable night indeed it turned out to be our covers were scanty and did not number among them any blankets the bed was hard as a rock and lumpy no sleep as the night wore on the air grew colder and i could not keep warm at four am i heard the howling of coyotesa thrilling and well remembered wild chorus after that perfect stillness reigned presently i saw the morning starbig bluewhite beautiful uncomfortable hours seemed well spent if the reward was sight of the morning star how few people ever see it how very few ever get a glimpse of it on a desert dawn  just then about fivethirty romer woke up and yelled lustily dad my noses froze this was a signal for me to laugh and also to rise heroically not difficult because i wanted to stay in bed but because i could hardly crawl out soon we had a fire roaring at six the dawn was still gray cold and nipping air frost on everything pale stars a goldred light in the east were proofs that i was again in the open soon a rosecolored flush beautified the peaks  after breakfast we had trouble with the horses this always happened but it was made worse this morning because a young cowboy who happened along took upon himself the task of helping lee i suspected he wanted to show off a little in throwing his lasso to rope one the noose went over the heads of two then he tried to hold both animals they dragged him pulled the lasso out of his hands and stampeded the other horses these two roped together thundered off with the noose widening i was afraid they would split round a tree or stump but fortunately the noose fell off one as all the horses pounded off i heard romer remark to isbel say joe i dont see any medals on that cowboy isbel roared and said wal romer you shore hit the nail on the haid  owing to that stampede we did not get saddled and started till eleven oclock at first i was so sore and stiff from the hard bed that i rode a while on the wagon with doyle many a mile i had ridden with him and many a story he had related this time he told about sitting on a jury at prescott where they brought in as evidence bloody shirts overalls guns knives until there was such a pile that the table would not hold them doyle was a mine of memories of the early days  romers mount was a little black whitespotted horse named rye lee doyle had scoured the ranches to get this pony for the youngster rye was small for a horse about the size of an indian mustang and he was gentle as well as strong and fast romer had been given riding lessons all that summer in the east and upon his arrival at flagstaff he informed me that he could ride i predicted he would be in the wagon before noon of the second day out he offered to bet on it i told him i disapproved of betting he seemed to me to be daring adaptable selfwilled and i was divided between pride and anxiety as to the outcome of this trip for him  in the afternoon we reached lake mary a long ugly muddy pond in a valley between pineslopes dead and ghastly trees stood in the water and the shores were cattletracked probably to the ranchers this mudhole was a pleasing picture but to me who loved the beauty of the desert before its productiveness it was hideous when we passed lake mary and farther on the last of the cutover timberland we began to get into wonderful country we traveled about sixteen miles rather a small days ride romer stayed on his horse all through that ride and when we selected a camp site for the night he said to me well youre lucky you wouldnt bet  camp that evening was in a valley with stately pines straggling down to the level on the other slope the pines came down in groups the rim of this opposite slope was high rugged ironcolored with cracks and holes before supper i walked up the slope back of our camp to come upon level rocky ground for a mile then pines again leading to a low green mountain with lighter patches of aspen the level open strip was gray in color arizona color and arizona country gray of sage rocks pines cedars piñons heights and depths and plains wild and open and lonelythat was arizona  that night i obtained some rest and sleep lying awake only a few hours during which time i turned from side to side to find a soft place in the hard bed under such circumstances i always thought of the hard beds of the greeks and the spartans next day we rode twentythree miles on horseback trips like this it was every one for himself sometimes we would be spread out all separated at others we would be bunched and again we would ride in couples the morning was an ordeal for me as at first i could scarcely sit my saddle in the afternoon however riding grew to be less severe the road led through a winding shallow valley with clumps of pine here and there and cedars on the slopes romer rode all the way half the time with his feet out of the stirrups like a western boy born to the saddle and he wanted to go fast all the time camp was made at a place called fulton spring it might have been a spring once but now it was a mudhole with a dead cow lying in it clear cold water is necessary to my pleasure if not to my health i have lived on sheep waterthe water holes being tainted by sheepand alkali water and soapy water of the desert but never happily how i hailed the clear cold swiftlyflowing springs  this third camp lay in a woods where the pines were beautiful and the silence noticeable upon asking romer to enumerate the things i had called to his attention the few times i could catch up with him on the days journey he promptly repliedtwo big spiderstarantulas a hawk and mormon lake this lake was another snowmelted mudhole said to contain fish i doubted that perhaps the little bullhead catfish might survive in such muddy water but i did not believe bass or perch could  one familiar feature of arizona travel manifested itself to me that daythe dry air my nails became brittle and my lips began to crack i have had my lips cracked so severely that when i tried to bite bread they would split and bleed and hurt so that i could not eat this matter of sore lips was for long a painful matter i tried many remedies and finally found one camphor ice that would prevent the drying and cracking  next day at dawn the forest was full of the soughing of wind in the pinesa wind that presaged storm no stars showed romerboy piled out at six oclock i had to follow him the sky was dark and cloudy only a faint light showed in the east and it was just light enough to see when we ate breakfast owing to strayed horses we did not get started till after nine oclock  five miles through the woods gradually descending led us into an open plain where there was a grassbordered pond full of ducks here appeared an opportunity to get some meat rc tried with shotgun and i with rifle all to no avail these ducks were shy romer seemed to evince some disdain at our failure but he did not voice his feelings we found some wildturkey tracks and a few feathers which put our hopes high  crossing the open ground we again entered the forest which gradually grew thicker as we got down to a lower altitude oak trees began to show in swales and then we soon began to see squirrels big plump gray fellows with bushy tails almost silver they appeared wilder than we would have suspected at that distance from the settlements romer was eager to hunt them and with his usual persistence succeeded at length in persuading his uncle to do so  to that end we rode out far ahead of the wagon and horses lee had a yellow dog he called pups a closehaired keenfaced muscular canine to which i had taken a dislike to be fair to pups i had no reason except that he barked all the time pups and his barking were destined to make me hail them both with admiration and respect but i had no idea of that then now this dog of lees would run ahead of us trail squirrels chase them and tree them whereupon he would bark vociferously sometimes up in the bushy top we would fail to spy the squirrel but we had no doubt one was there romer wasted many and many a cartridge of the 22 winchester trying to hit a squirrel he had practiced a good deal and was a fairly good shot for a youngster but hitting a little gray ball of fur high on a tree or waving at the tip of a branch was no easy matter  son i said you dont take after your dad  and his uncle tried the lads temper by teasing him about wetzel now wetzel the great indian killer of frontier days was romers favorite hero  gimme the 20 gauge finally cried romer in desperation with his eyes flashing  whereupon his uncle handed him the shotgun with a word of caution as to the trigger this particular squirrel was pretty high up presenting no easy target romer stood almost directly under it raised the gun nearly straight up waved and wobbled and hesitated and finally fired down sailed the squirrel to hit with a plump that was romers first successful hunting experience how proud he was of that gray squirrel i suffered a pang to see the boy so radiant so full of fire at the killing of a beautiful creature of the woods then again i remembered my own first sensations boys are bloodthirsty little savages in their hunting playing even their reading some element of the wild brute instinct dominates them they are worthy descendants of progenitors who had to fight and kill to live this incident furnished me much food for reflection i foresaw that before this trip was ended i must face some knotty problems i hated to shoot a squirrel even when i was hungry probably that was because i was not hungry enough a starving man suffers no compunctions at the spilling of blood on the contrary he revels in it with a fierce primitive joy  some shot ill say declared romer to his uncle loftily and he said to me half a dozen times say dad wasnt it a grand peg  but toward the end of that afternoon his enthusiasm waned for shooting for anything especially riding he kept asking when the wagon was going to stop once he yelled out heres a peach of a place to camp then i asked him romer are you tired naw but whats the use ridin till dark at length he had to give up and be put on the wagon the moment was tragic for him soon however he brightened at something doyle told him and began to ply the old pioneer with rapidfire questions  we pitched camp in an open flat gray and red with short grass and sheltered by towering pines on one side under these we set up our tents the mat of pine needles was half a foot thick soft and springy and fragrant the woods appeared full of slanting rays of golden sunlight  this day we had supper over before sunset romer showed no effects from his long hard ride first he wanted to cook then he fooled around the fire bothering isbel i had a hard time to manage him he wanted to be eternally active he teased and begged to go huntingthen he compromised on target practice rc and i however were too tired and we preferred to rest beside the campfire  look here kid said rc save something for tomorrow  in disgust romer replied well i suppose if a flock of antelope came along here you wouldnt move you an dad are great hunters i dont think  after the lad had gone over to the other men rc turned to me and said reflectively does he remind you of us when we were little  to which i replied with emotion in him i live over again  that is one of the beautiful things about children so full of pathos and some strange stinging joythey bring back the days that are no more  this evening despite my fatigue i was the last one to stay up my seat was most comfortable consisting of thick folds of blankets against a log how the wind mourned in the trees how the campfire sparkled glowed red and white sometimes it seemed full of blazing opals always it held faces and storiesmore stories than i can ever tell once i was stirred and inspired by the beautiful effect of the pine trees in outline against the starry sky when the campfire blazed up the color of the foliage seemed indescribably bluegreen something never seen by day every line shone bright graceful curved rounded and all thrown with sharp relief against the sky how magical exquisitely delicate and fanciful the great trunks were soft serrated brown and the gnarled branches stood out in perfect proportions all works of art must be copied of nature  next morning early while romer slept and the men had just begun to stir i went apart from the camp out into the woods all seemed solemn and still and cool with the aisles of the forest brown and green and gold i heard an owl perhaps belated in his nocturnal habit then to my surprise i heard wild canaries they were flying high and to the south going to their winter quarters i wandered around among big gray rocks and windfalls and clumps of young oak and majestic pines more than one saucy red squirrel chattered at me  when i returned to camp my comrades were at breakfast romer appeared vastly relieved to see that i had not taken a gun with me  this morning we got an early start we rode for hours through a beautiful shady forest where a fragrant breeze in our faces made riding pleasant large oaks and patches of sumach appeared on the rocky slopes we descended a good deal in this mornings travel and the air grew appreciably warmer the smell of pine was thick and fragrant the sound of wind was sweet and soughing everywhere pine needles dropped shining in the sunlight like thin slants of rain  only once or twice did i see romer in all these morning hours then he was out in front with the cowboy isbel riding his black pony over all the logs and washes he could find i could see his feet sticking straight out almost even with his saddle he did not appear to need stirrups my fears gradually lessened  during the afternoon the ride grew hot and very dusty we came to a long open valley where the dust lay several inches deep it had been an unusually dry summer and falla fact that presaged poor luck for our huntingand the washes and streambeds were bleached white we came to two waterholes tanks the arizonians called them and they were vile mudholes with green scum on the water the horses drank but i would have had to be far gone from thirst before i would have slaked mine there we faced west with the hot sun beating on us and the dust rising in clouds no wonder that ride was interminably long  at last we descended a canyon and decided to camp in a level spot where several ravines met in one of which a tiny stream of dear water oozed out of the gravel the inclosure was rockysloped full of caves and covered with pines and the best i could say for it was that in case of storm the camp would be well protected we shoveled out a deep hole in the gravel so that it would fill up with water romer had evidently enjoyed himself this day when i asked isbel about him the cowboys hard face gleamed with a smile shore thet kids all right hell make a cowpuncher his remark pleased me in view of romers determination to emulate the worst bandit i ever wrote about i was tremendously glad to think of him as a cowboy but as for myself i was tired and the ride had been rather unprofitable and this campsite to say the least did not inspire me it was neither wild nor beautiful nor comfortable i went early to bed and slept like a log  the following morning some of our horses were lost the men hunted from daylight till ten oclock then it was that i learned more about lees dog pups at tenthirty lee came in with the lost horses they had hidden in a clump of cedars and remained perfectly quiet as cute as deer lee put pups on their trail pups was a horsetrailing dog and he soon found them i had a change of feeling for pups then and there  illustration the author and his men from left to right edd haught nielsen haught the bear hunter al doyle pioneer arizona guide lewis pyle zg george haught ben copple lee doyle  the sun was high and hot when we rode off the pleasant and dusty stretches alternated about one oclock we halted on the edge of a deep wooded ravine to take our usual noonday rest i scouted along the edge in the hope of seeing game of some kind presently i heard the cluckcluck of turkeys slipping along to an open place i peered down to be thrilled by sight of four goodsized turkeys they were walking along the open strip of dry streambed at the bottom of the ravine one was chasing grasshoppers they were fairly close i took aim at one and thought i could have hit him but suddenly i remembered romer and rc so i slipped back and called them  illustration romerboy on his favorite steed  hurriedly and stealthily we returned to the point where i had seen the turkeys romer had a pale face and wonderfully bright eyes his actions resembled those of a stalking indian the turkeys were farther down but still in plain sight i told rc to take the boy and slip down and run and hide and run till they got close enough for a shot i would keep to the edge of the ravine  some moments later i saw rc and the boy running and stooping and creeping along the bottom of the ravine then i ran myself to reach a point opposite the turkeys so in case they flew uphill i might get a shot but i did not see them and nothing happened i lost sight of the turkeys hurrying back to where i had tied my horse i mounted him and loped ahead and came out upon the ravine some distance above here i hunted around for a little while once i heard the report of the 20 gauge and then several rifle shots upon returning i found that lee and nielsen had wasted some shells rc and romer came wagging up the hill both red and wet and tired rc carried a small turkey about the size of a chicken he told me between pants that they chased the four large turkeys and were just about to get a shot when up jumped a henturkey with a flock of young ones they ran every way he got one then he told me between more pants and some laughs that romer had chased the little turkeys all over the ravine almost catching several romer said for himself i just almost pulled feathers out of their tails gee if id had a gun  we resumed our journey about the middle of the afternoon doyle called my attention to an opening in the forest through which i could see the yellowwalled rim of the mesa and the great blue void below arizona that explained the black forests the red and yellow cliffs of rock the gray cedars the heights and depths  lop ride indeed was it down off the mesa the road was winding rough full of loose rocks and dusty we were all tired out trying to keep up with the wagon romer however averred time and again that he was not tired still i saw him often shift his seat from one side of the saddle to the other  at last we descended to a comparative level and came to a little hamlet like all mormon villages it had quaint log cabins low stone houses an irrigation ditch running at the side of the road orchards and many rosycheeked children we lingered there long enough to rest a little and drink our fill of the cold granite water i would travel out of my way to get a drink of water that came from granite rock  about five oclock we left for the natural bridge romer invited or rather taunted me to a race when it ended in his victory i found that i had jolted my rifle out of its saddle sheath i went back some distance to look for it but did so in vain isbel said he would ride back in the morning and find it  the country here appeared to be on a vast scale but that was only because we had gotten out where we could see all around arizona is all on a grand vast scale mountain ranges stood up to the south and east north loomed up the lofty steep rim of the mogollon mesa with its cliffs of yellow and red and its black line of timber westward lay fold on fold of low cedarcovered hills the valley appeared a kind of magnificent bowl rough and wild with the distance lost in blue haze the vegetation was dense and rather low i saw both pricklypear and mescal cactus cedars manzanita brush scrub oak and juniper trees these last named were very beautiful especially the smaller ones with their graygreen foliage and purple berries and black and white checkered bark there were no pine trees since we had left the rim above the character of plant life had changed  we crossed the plateau leading to the valley where the natural bridge was located a winding road descended the east side of this valley a rancher lived down there green of alfalfa and orchard and walnut trees contrasted vividly with a bare gray slope on one side and a red rugged mountain on the other a deep gorge showed dark and wild at length just after sunset we reached the ranch and rode through orchards of peach and pear and apple trees all colored with fruit and down through grassy meadows to a walnut grove where we pitched camp by the time we had supper it was dark wonderful stars thick dreamy hum of insects murmur of swift water a rosy and golden afterglow on the notch of the mountain range to the westthese were inducements to stay up but i was so tired i had to go to bed where my eyelids fell tight as if pleasantly weighted  after the long hard rides and the barren campsites what delight to awaken in this beautiful valley with the morning cool and breezy and bright with smell of newmown hay from the green and purple alfalfa fields and the sunlight gilding the jagged crags above romer made a beeline for the peach trees he beat his daddy only a few yards the kind rancher had visited us the night before and he had told us to help ourselves to fruit melons alfalfa needless to state that i made my breakfast on peaches  i trailed the swift murmuring stream to its source on the dark green slope where there opened up a big hole bordered by watercress long grass and fragrant mint this spring was one of perfectly clear water six feet deep boiling up to bulge on the surface a grass of dark color and bunches of light green plant grew under the surface bees and blue dragonflies hummed around and frogs as green as the grass blinked with jewelled eyes from the wet margins the spring had a large volume that spilled over its borders with low hollow gurgle with fresh cool splash the water was soft tasting of limestone here was the secret of the verdure and fragrance and color and beauty and life of the oasis  it was also the secret of the formation of the wonderful natural bridge part of the ranchers cultivated land to the extent of several acres was the level top of this strange bridge a meadow of alfalfa and a fine vineyard in the air like the hanging gardens of babylon the natural bridge spanned a deep gorge at the bottom of which flowed a swift stream of water geologically this tremendous arch of limestone cannot be so very old in comparatively recent times an earthquake or some seismic disturbance or some other natural force caused a spring of water to burst from the slope above the gorge it ran down of course over the rim the lime salt in the water was deposited and year by year and age by age advanced toward the opposite side until a bridge crossed the gorge the swift stream at the bottom kept the opening clear under the bridge  a winding trail led deep down on the lower side of this wonderful natural span it showed the cliffs of limestone porous craggy broken chalky at the bottom the gorge was full of tremendous boulders waterworn ledges sycamore and juniper trees red and yellow flowers and dark beautiful green pools i espied tiny gray frogs reminding me of those i found in the gulches of the grand canyon many huge black beetles some alive but most of them dead lined the wet borders of the pools a species of fish that resembled mullet lay in the shadow of the rocks  from underneath the natural bridge showed to advantage and if not magnificent like the grand nonnezoshe of utah it was at least striking and beautiful it had a rounded ceiling colored gray yellow green bronze purple white making a crude and scalloped mosaic water dripped from it like a rain of heavy scattered drops the left side was dryest and large dark caves opened up one above the other the upper being so high that it was dangerous to attempt reaching it the right side was slippery and wet all rocks were thickly encrusted with lime salt doyle told us that any object left under the ceaseless drip drip of the lime water would soon become encrusted and heavy as stone the upper opening of the arch was much higher and smaller than the lower any noise gave forth strange and sepulchral echoes romer certainly made the welkin ring a streak of sunlight shone through a small hole in the thinnest part of the roof doyle pointed out the high cave where indians had once lived showing the markings of their fire also he told a story of apaches being driven into the highest cave from which they had never escaped this tale was manifestly to romers liking and i had to use force to keep him from risking his neck a very strong breeze blew under the arch when we rolled a boulder into the large dark pool it gave forth a hollow boom boom boom growing hollower the deeper it went i tried to interest romer in some bat nests in crevices high up but the boy wanted to roll stones and fish for the mullet when we climbed out and were once more on a level i asked him what he thought of the place some holeill say he panted breathlessly  the rancher told me that the summer rains began there about july and the snows about the first of the year snow never lay long on the lower slopes apaches had lived there forty years ago and had cultivated the soil there was gold in the mountains of the four peaks range in this sheltered nook the weather was never severely cold or hot and i judged from the quaint talk of the ranchers wife that life there was always afternoon  next day we rode from natural bridge to payson in four and a half hours payson appeared to be an old hamlet retaining many frontier characteristics such as old board and stone houses with high fronts hitching posts and pumps on sidewalks and one street so wide that it resembled a mexican plaza payson contained two stores where i hoped to buy a rifle and hoped in vain i had not recovered my lost gun and when night came my prospects of anything to hunt with appeared extremely slim but we had visitors and one of them was a stalwart darkskinned rider named copple who introduced himself by saying he would have come a good way to meet the writer of certain books he had profited by when he learned of the loss of my rifle and that i could not purchase one anywhere he pressed upon me his own i refused with thanks but he would not take no the upshot of it was that he lent me his 30 government winchester and gave me several boxes of ammunition also he presented me with a cowhide lasso whereupon romerboy took a shine to copple at once say you look like an indian he declared with a laugh copple replied i am part indian sonny manifestly that settled his status with romer for he piped up sos dad part indian youd better come huntin with us  we had for next day to look forward to the longest and hardest ride of the journey in and in order to make it and reach a good camping site i got up at three oclock in the morning to rout everybody out it was pitch dark until we kindled fires then everybody rustled to such purpose that we were ready to start before dawn and had to wait a little for light enough to see where we were going this procedure tickled romer immensely i believed he imagined he was in a pioneer caravan the gray breaking of dawn the coming of brighter light the rose and silver of the rising sun and the riding in its face with the air so tangy and nipping were circumstances that inspired me as the adventurous start pleased romer the brush and cactuslined road was rough up hill and down with ever increasing indications that it was seldom used from the tops of high points i could see black foothills round coneshaped flattopped all leading the gaze toward the great yellow and red wall of the mesa with its fringed borderline wild and beckoning  we walked our horses trotted loped and repeated the order over and over hour by hour mile after mile under a sun that burned our faces and through choking dust the washes and streambeds were bleached and dry the brush was sear and yellow and dust laden the mescal stalks seemed withered by hot blasts only the manzanita looked fresh that smooth redbranched and glistening greenleafed plant of the desert apparently flourished without rain on all sides the evidences of extreme drought proved the year to be the dreaded anno seco of the mexicans  for ten hours we rode without a halt before there was any prominent change in the weary up and downhill going in the heat and dust and brushwalled road but about the middle of the afternoon we reached the summit of the longest hill from which we saw ahead of us a cut up country wild and rugged and beautiful with pinesloped canyon at our feet we heard the faint murmur of running water hot dusty wet with sweat and thirsty as sheep we piled down that steep slope as fast as we dared our horses did not need urging at the bottom we plunged into a swift stream of clear cold watergranite waterto drink of which and to bathe hot heads and burning feet was a joy only known to the weary traveler of the desert romer yelled that the water was like that at our home in the mountains of pennsylvania and he drank till i thought he would burst and then i had to hold him to keep him from wallowing in it  here we entered a pine forest heat and dust stayed with us and the aches and pains likewise but the worst of them lay behind every mile grew shadier clearer cooler  nielsen happened to fall in and ride beside me for several miles as was often his wont the drink of water stirred him to an homeric recital of one of his desert trips in sonora at the end of which almost dead of thirst he had suddenly come upon such a stream as the one we had just passed then he told me about his trips down the west coast of sonora along the gulf where he traveled at night at low tide so that by daytime his footprints would be washed out this was the land of the seri indians undoubtedly these indians were cannibals i had read considerable about them much of which ridiculed the rumors of their cannibalistic traits this of course had been of exceeding interest to me because some day i meant to go to the land of the seris but not until 1918 did i get really authentic data concerning them professor bailey of the university of california told me he had years before made two trips to the gulf and found the seris to be the lowest order of savages he knew of he was positive that under favorable circumstances they would practice cannibalism nielsen made four trips down there he claimed the seris were an ugly tribe in winter they lived on tiburon island off which boats anchored on occasions and crews and fishermen and adventurers went ashore to barter with the indians these travelers did not see the worst of the seris in summer they range up the mainland and they go naked they do not want gold discovered down there they will fight prospectors they use arrows and attack at dawn also they poison the waterholes  nielsen told of some men who were massacred by seris on the mainland opposite tiburon island one man who had gone away from camp returned to hear the attack upon his companions he escaped and made his way to gyamus procuring assistance this man returned to the scene of the massacre only to find stakes in the sand with deep trails tramped around them and blackened remains of fires and bones everywhere nielsen went on to say that once from a hiding place he had watched seris tear up and devour a dead turtle that he afterward ascertained was putrid he said these seris were the greatest runners of all desert savages the best of them could outrun a horse one seri a giant seven feet tall could outrun a deer and break its neck with his hands  these statements of nielsens were remarkable and personally i believed them men of his stamp were honest and they had opportunities to learn strange and terrible facts in nature the great naturalist darwin made rather stronger claims for the barbarism of the savages of terra del fuego nielsen pursuing his theme told me how he had seen with his own eyesand they were certainly sharp and intelligentyaqui indians leap on the bare backs of wild horses and locking their legs stick there in spite of the mad plunges and pitches the gauchos of the patagonian pampas were famous for that feat of horsemanship i asked joe isbel what he thought of such riding and he said wal i can ride a wild steer bareback but excoose me from tacklin a buckin bronch without saddle an stirrups this coming from the acknowledged champion horseman of the southwest was assuredly significant  at five oclock we came to the end of the road it led to a forest glade overlooking the stream we had followed and that was as far as our wagon could go the glade shone red with sumach and surrounded by tall pines with a rocky and shady glen below it appeared a delightful place to camp as i was about to unsaddle my horses i heard the cluckcluck of turkeys pulling out my borrowed rifle and calling romer i ran to the edge of the glade the shady swift stream ran fifty feet or so below me across it i saw into the woods where shade and gray rocks and colored brush mingled again i heard the turkeys cluck look hard son i whispered theyre close rc came slipping along below us with his rifle ready suddenly romer stiffened then pointed there dadthere i saw two gobblers wade into the brook not more than a hundred and fifty feet away drawing down with fine aim i fired the bullet splashed water all over the turkeys one with loud whirr of wings flew away the other leaped across the brook and ranswift as a deerright up the slope as i tried to get the sight on him i heard other turkeys fly and the crackcrack of rcs gun i shot twice at my running turkey and all i did was to scatter the dirt over him and make him run faster rc had not done any better shooting romer wonderful to relate was so excited that he forgot to make fun of our marksmanship we scouted around some but the turkeys had gone by promising to take romer hunting after supper i contrived to get him back to the glade where we made camp   ii  after we had unpacked and while the men were pitching the tents and getting supper i took romer on a hunt up the creek i was considerably pleased to see goodsized trout in the deeper pools a little way above camp the creek forked as the righthand branch appeared to be larger and more attractive we followed its course soon the bustle of camp life and the sound of the horses were left far behind romer slipped along beside me stealthily as an indian all eyes and ears  we had not traveled thus for a quarter of a mile when my quick ear caught the cluckcluck of turkeys listen i whispered halting romer became like a statue his dark eyes dilating his nostrils quivering his whole body strung he was a zane all right a turkey called again then another answered romer started and nodded his head vehemently  come on now right behind me i whispered step where i step and do what i do dont break any twigs  cautiously we glided up the creek listening now and then to get the direction until we came to an open place where we could see some distance up a ridge the turkey clucks came from across the creek somewhere up this open aisle of the forest i crawled ahead several rods to a more advantageous point much pleased to note that romer kept noiselessly at my heels then from behind a stone we peeped out almost at once a turkey flew down from a tree into the open lane look dad whispered romer wildly i had to hold him down thats a hen turkey i said see its small and dullcolored the gobblers are big shiny and they have red on their heads  another hen turkey flew down from a rather low height then i made out grapevines and i saw several animated dark patches among them as i looked three turkeys flopped down to the ground one was a gobbler of considerable size with beautiful white and bronze feathers rather suspiciously he looked down our way the distance was not more than a hundred yards i aimed at him feeling as i did so how romer quivered beside me but i had no confidence in copples rifle the sights were wrong for me the stock did not fit me so hoping for a closer and better shot i let this opportunity pass of course i should have taken it the gobbler clucked and began to trot up the ridge with the others after him they were not frightened but they appeared rather suspicious when they disappeared in the woods romer and i got up and hurried in pursuit gee why didnt you peg that gobbler broke out romer breathlessly wasnt he a peach  when we reached the top of the ridge we advanced very cautiously again another open place led to a steep rocky hillside with cedars and pines growing somewhat separated i was disappointed in not seeing the turkeys then in our anxiety and eagerness we hurried on not noiselessly by any means all of a sudden there was a rustle and then a great whirr of wings three turkeys flew like grouse away into the woods next i saw the white gobbler running up the rocky hillside at first he was in the open aiming as best i could i waited for him to stop or hesitate but he did neither peg him dad yelled romer the lad was right my best chance i had again forfeited to hit a running wild turkey with a rifle bullet was a feat i had not done so often as to inspire conceit the gobbler was wise too for that matter all grown gobblers are as wise as old bucks except in the spring mating season when it is a crime to hunt them this one just as i got a bead on him always ran behind a rock or tree or shrub finally in desperation i took a snap shot at him hitting under him making him jump then in rapid succession i fired four more times i had the satisfaction of seeing where my bullets struck up the dust even though they did go wide of the mark after my last shot the gobbler disappeared  well dad you sure throwed the dirt over him declared romer  son i dont believe i could hit a flock of barns with this gun i replied gazing doubtfully at the old shiny wirewrapped wornout winchester copple had lent me i had been told that he was a fine marksman and could drive a nail with it upon my return to camp i tried out the rifle carefully with a rest to find that it was not accurate moreover it did not throw the bullets consistently it shot high wide low and right there i abandoned any further use for it rc tried to make me take his rifle to use on the hunting trip nielsen and lee wanted me to take theirs but i was disgusted with myself and refused thanks boys i said maybe this will be a lesson to me  we had been up since three oclock that morning and the days travel had been exhausting i had just enough energy left to scrape up a huge soft pile of pine needles upon which to make our bed after that all was oblivion until i was awakened by the ringing strokes of nielsens axe  the morning after the sun got up was exceedingly delightful and this camp was such a contrast to the others so pleasant and attractive that even if we had not arranged to meet lee haught and his sons here i would have stayed a while anyway haught was a famed bear hunter who lived in a logcabin somewhere up under the rim of the mesa while lee and nielsen rode off up the trail to find haught i gave romer his first try at rainbow trout the water of the creek was low and clear so that we could see plenty of goodsized trout but they were shy they would not rise readily to any of our flies though i got several strikes we searched under the stones for worms and secured a few whereupon romer threw a baited hook to a trout we plainly saw the trout gobbled it romer had been instructed in the fine art of angling but whenever he got a bite he always forgot science he yanked this teninch rainbow right out then in another pool he hooked a big fellow that had ideas of his own as well as weight and strength romer applied the same strenuous tactics but this trout nearly pulled romer off the rock before the line broke i took occasion then to deliver to the lad a lecture in reply he said tearfully i didnt know he was soso big  when we returned to camp haught and his sons were there even at a distance their horses weapons and persons satisfied my critical eye lee haught was a tall spare superbly built man with square shoulders he had a brown face with deep lines and sunken cheeks keen hazel eyes heavy dark mustache and hair streaked a little with gray the only striking features of his apparel were his black sombrero and long spurs  his sons edd and george were young lean sallow stillfaced lankylegged horsemen with clear gray eyes they did not appear to be given to much speech both were then waiting for the call of the army draft looking at them then feeling the tranquil reserve and latent force of these arizonians i reflected that the germans had failed in their psychology of american character a few hundred thousand americans like the haught boys would have whipped the german army  we held a council haught said he would send his son edd with doyle and by a long roundabout forest road get the wagon up on the mesa with his burros and some of our horses packed we could take part of the outfit up the creek trail past his cabin and climb out on the rim where we would find grass water wood and plenty of game  the idea of permanent camp before sunset that very day inspired us to united and vigorous effort by noon we had the pack train ready edd and doyle climbed on the wagon to start the other way romer waved his hand goodbye mr doyle dont break down and lose the apples  then we were off up the narrow trail along the creek haught led the way romer attached himself to the bearhunter and wherever the trail was wide enough rode beside him rc and i followed the other men fell in behind the pack train  the ride was hot and for the most part all up hill that basin could be likened to the ribs of a washboard it was all hills gorges ridges and ravines the hollows of this exceedingly rough country were thick with pine and oak the ridges covered with cedar juniper and manzanita the ground where it was not rocky was a dry red clay we passed haughts log cabin and clearing of a few acres where i saw fat hogs and cattle beyond this point the trail grew more zigzag and steeper and shadier as we got higher up the air grew cooler i noted a change in the timber the trees grew larger and other varieties appeared we crossed a roaring brook lined by thick green brush very pleasant to the eye and bronzegold ferns that were beautiful we passed oaks all green and yellow and maple trees wonderfully colored red and cerise then still higher up i espied some silver spruces most exquisite trees of the mountain forests  during the latter half of the climb up to the rim i had to attend to the business of riding and walking the trail was rough steep and long once haught called my attention to a flat stone with a plain trail made by a turtle in ages past when that sandstone was wet sedimentary deposit by and bye we reached the last slopes up to the mesa green with yellow crags and cliffs and here and there blazing maples to remind me again that autumn was at hand  at last we surmounted the rim from which i saw a scene that defied words it was different from any i had seen before black timber as far as eye could see then i saw a vast bowl inclosed by dim mountain ranges with a rolling floor of forested ridges and dark lines i knew to be canyons for wild rugged beauty i had not seen its equal  illustration the tonto basin  when the pack train reached the rim we rode on and now through a magnificent forest at eight thousand feet altitude big white and black clouds obscured the sun a thunder shower caught us there was hail and the dry smell of dust and a little cold rain romer would not put on his slicker haught said the drought had been the worst he had seen in twenty years there up in this odorous forestland i could not see where there had been lack of rain the forest appeared thick grassy gold and yellow and green and brown thickets and swales of oaks and aspens were gorgeous in their autumn hues the silver spruces sent down long graceful branches that had to be brushed aside or stooped under as we rode along big gray squirrels with white tails and tufted ears ran up trees to perch on limbs and watch us go by and other squirrels much smaller and darker gray frisked and chattered and scolded at a great rate  illustration listening for the hounds  we passed little depressions that ran down into ravines and these haught informed me were the heads of canyons that sloped away from the rim deepening and widening for miles the rim of the mesa was its highest point except here and there a few elevations like black butte geologically this mesa was an enormous fault like the north rim of the grand canyon during the formation of the earth or the hardening of the crust there had been a crack or slip so that one edge of the crust stood up sheer above the other we passed the heads of leonard canyon gentry and turkey canyons and at last near time of sunset headed down into beautifully colored pinesloped aspenthicketed beaver dam canyon  a mile from the rim we were deep in the canyon walled in by rockstrewn and pinetimbered slopes too steep for a horse to climb there was a little gully on the black soil where there were no evidences of recent water haught said he had never seen beaver dam creek dry until this season we traveled on until we came to a wide open space where three forks of this canyon met and where in the middle of this glade there rose a lengthy wooded bench shaded and beautified by stately pines and silver spruce at this point water appeared in the creek bed flowing in tiny stream that soon gathered volume cold and clear and pure it was all that was needed to make this spot an ideal camp site haught said half a mile below there was a grassy park where the horses would graze with elk  we pitched our tents on this bench and i chose for my location a space between two great monarchs of the forests that had surely shaded many an indian encampment at the upper end of the bench rose a knoll golden and green with scrub oaks and russetcolored with its lichened rocks about all we could manage that evening was to eat and go to bed  morning broke cool and bright with heavy dew i got my boots as wet as if i had waded in water this surprised me occurring on october sixth and at eight thousand feet altitude as i had expected frost most of this day was spent in making camp unpacking and attending to the many necessary little details that make for comfort in the open to be sure romer worked very spasmodically he spent most of his time on the back of one of haughts burros chasing and roping another i had not remembered seeing the lad so happily occupied  late in the afternoon i slipped off down the canyon alone taking haughts rifle for safety rather than a desire to kill anything by no means was it impossible to meet a bad bear in that forest some distance below camp i entered a ravine and climbed up to the level and soon found myself deep in the fragrant colorful wild forest like coming home again was it to enter that forest of silvertipped levelspreading spruce and great gnarled massive pines and oakpatches of green and gold and maple thickets with shining aspens standing white against the blaze of red and purple high wavy bleached grass brown mats of pine needles graygreen moss waving from the spruces long strands of sunlightall these seemed to welcome me  at a distance there was a roar of wind through the forest close at hand only a soft breeze rustling of twigs caused me to compose myself to listen and watch soon small gray squirrels came into view all around me brighteyed and saucy very curious about this intruder they began to chatter other squirrels were working in the tops of trees for i heard the fall of pine cones then came the screech of blue jays soon they too discovered me the male birds were superb dignified beautiful the color was light blue all over with dark blue head and tufted crest by and bye they ceased to scold me and i was left to listen to the wind and to the tiny patter of dropping seeds and needles from the spruces what cool sweet fresh smell this woody leafy earthy dry grassy odorous fragrance dominated by scent of pine how lonesome and restful i felt a sense of deep peace and rest this goldengreen forest barred with sunlight canopied by the blue sky and melodious with its soughing moan of wind absolutely filled me with content and happiness if a stag or a bear had trotted out into my sight and had showed me no animosity not improbably i would have forgotten my gun more and more as i lived in the open i grew reluctant to kill  presently a porcupine waddled along some rods away and unaware of my presence it passed by and climbed a spruce i saw it climb high and finally lost sight of it in searching up and down this spruce i grew alive to what a splendid and beautiful tree it was where so many trees grew it always seemed difficult to single out one and study it this silver spruce was five feet through at the base rugged grayseamed thick all the way to its lofty height its branches were small with a singular feature that they were uniform in shape length and droop most all spruce branches drooped toward the ground that explained why they made such excellent shelters from rain after a hard storm i had seen the ground dry under a thickfoliaged spruce many a time had i made a bed under one elk and deer stand under a spruce during a rain unless there is thunder and lightning in forests of high altitude where lightning strikes many trees i have never found or heard of elk and deer being killed this particular spruce was a natural tent in the forest the thickspreading graceful silver plumes extended clear to the top where they were bushiest and rounded out with all the largest branches there each dark gray branch was fringed and festooned with pale green moss like the cypresses of the south  suddenly i heard a sharp snapping of twigs and then stealthy light steps an animal of some species was moving in the thicket nearby naturally i sustained a thrill and bethought me of the rifle then i peered keenly into the red rose shadows of the thicket the sun was setting now and though there appeared a clear golden light high in the forest along the ground there were shadows i heard leaves falling rustling tall white aspens stood out of the thicket and two of the large ones bore the old black scars of bear claws i was sure however that no bear hid in the thicket at this moment presently whatever the animal was it pattered lightly away on the far side after that i watched the quiver of the aspen leaves some were green some yellow some gold but they all had the same wonderful tremor the silent fluttering that gave them the most exquisite action in nature the sun set the forest darkened reminding me of supper time so i returned to camp as i entered the open canyon romerboy espied memanifestly he had been watchingand he yelled here comes my daddy now say dad did you get any pegs  next morning haught asked me if i would like to ride around through the woods and probably get a shot at a deer romer coaxed so to go that i finally consented  we rode down the canyon and presently came to a wide grassy park inclosed by high greenclad slopes the features of which appeared to be that the timber on the west slope was mostly pine and on the east slope it was mostly spruce i could arrive at no certain reason for this but i thought it must be owing to the snow lying somewhat longer on the east slope the stream here was running with quite a little volume of water our horses were grazing in this park i saw fresh elk tracks made the day before elk were quite abundant through this forest haught informed me and were protected by law  a couple of miles down this trail the canyon narrowed losing its parklike dimensions the farther we traveled the more water there was in the stream and more elk deer and turkey tracks in the sand every half mile or so we would come to the mouth of a small intersecting canyon and at length we rode up one of these presently to climb out on top at this distance from the rim the forest was more open than in the vicinity of our camp affording better riding and hunting still the thickets of aspen and young pine were so frequent that seldom could i see ahead more than several hundred yards  haught led the way i rode next and romer kept beside me where it was possible to do so there was however no trail how difficult to keep the lad quiet i expected of course that haught would dismount and take me to hunt on foot after a while i gathered he did not hunt deer except on horseback he explained that cowboys rounded up cattle in this forest in the spring and fall and deer were not frightened at sound or sight of a horse some of the thrill and interest in the forest subsided for me i did not like to hunt in a country where cattle ranged no matter how wild they were then when we came to a forested ridge bare of grass and smelling of sheep that robbed the forest of a little more glamour mexican sheepherders drove their flocks up this far sometimes haught said bear lion lynx and coyote sometimes the big gray wolves followed the sheep deer however hated a sheeprun range  riding was exceedingly pleasant the forest was shady cool full of sunlight and beauty nothing but fire or the lumbermen could ever rob it of its beauty silence fragrance and of its templelike majesty so provided we did not meet any cattle or sheep i did not care whether or not we sighted any game in fact i would have forgotten we were hunting had not romer been along with him continually seeing things it was difficult to keep from imagining that we were hunting indians the apaches had once lived in this country haught informed us and it was a habit of theirs to burn the grass and fallen leaves over every fall thus keeping down the underbrush in this the indians showed how nearsighted they were the future growth of a forest did not concern them usually indians were better conservationists than white men  we rode across a grove of widely separated stately pines at the far end of which stood a thicket of young pines and other brush as we neared this haught suddenly reined in and in quick and noiseless action he dismounted then he jerked his rifle from his saddlesheath took a couple of forward steps and leveled it i was so struck with the rugged and significant picture he made that i did not dismount and did not see any game until after he fired then as i tumbled off and got out my rifle i heard romer gasping and crying out a gray streak with a bobbing white end flashed away out of sight to the left next i saw a deer bounding through the thicket haught fired again the deer ran so fast that i could not get my sights anywhere near him haught thudded through an opening and an instant later when both he and the deer had disappeared he shot the third time presently he returned  never could shoot with them open sights nohow he said shore i missed thet yearlin buck when he was standin why didnt you smoke him up  dad why didnt you peg him asked romer with intense regret why i could have knocked him  then it was incumbent upon me to confess that the action had appeared to be a little swift wal said haught when you see one you want to pile off quick  as we rode on romer naively asked me if ever in my life i had seen anything run so fast as that deer we entered another big grove with thin patches of thicket here and there haught said these were good places for deer to lie down relying on their noses to scent danger from windward and on their eyes in the other direction we circled to go round thickets descending somewhat into a swale here haught got off a little to the right romer and i rode up a gentle slope toward a thin line of little pines through which i could see into the pines beyond suddenly up jumped three big gray bucks literally i fell off my horse bounced up and pulled out my rifle one buck was loping in a thicket i could see his broad gray body behind the slender trees i aimedfollowed himgot a bead on himand was just about to pull trigger when he vanished plunging forward i yelled to haught then romer cried in his shrill treble dad heres a big buckhurry turning i ran back in wild excitement romer was pointing i was just in time to see a gray rump disappear in the green just then haught shot and after that he halloed romer and i went through the thicket working to our left and presently came out into the open forest haught was leading his horse to romers eager query he replied shore i piled him up twoyearold blacktail buck  sure enough he had shot straight this time the buck lay motionless under a pine with one point of his antlers imbedded deep in the ground a sleek gray graceful deer he was just beginning to get his winter coat his color was indeed a bluish gray haught hung him up to a branch spread his hind legs and cut him down the middle the hunters dexterity with a knife made me wonder how many deer he had dressed in his life in the open we lifted the deer upon the saddle of haughts horse and securely tied it there with a lasso then with the hunter on foot leading the way we rode through the forest up the main ridge between beaver and turkey canyons toward the rim i found the pines and spruces larger and the thickets of aspen denser we passed the heads of many ravines running down to the canyons on either side and these were blazing gold and red in color and so thick i could not see a rod into them about the middle of the afternoon we reached camp with venison hanging up to cool we felt somewhat like real hunters rc had gone off to look for turkeys which enterprise had been unsuccessful  upon the following day which was october tenth we started our bear hunting haughts method appeared to me to lack something he sent the hounds down below the rim with george and taking rc and me and lee and nielsen he led us over to what he called horton thicket never would i forget my first sight of that immense forestchoked canyon it was a great cove running up from the basin into the rim craggy ledges broken ruined tottering and gray slanted down into this abyss the place was so vast that these ledges appeared far apart yet they were many an empire of splintered cliff  high up these cracked and stained walls were covered with lichens with little spruces growing in niches and tiny yellow bushes points of crumbling rock were stained gold and russet and bronze below the huge gorge was full of aspens maples sprucesa green crimson yellow density of timber apparently impenetrable we were accorded different stations on the ledges all around the cove and instructed to stay there until called by four blasts from a hunting horn my point was so far from rcs across the canyon that i had to use my fieldglass to see him when i did look he seemed contented lee and nielsen and haught i could not see at all finding a comfortable seat if hard rock could ever be that i proceeded to accept my wait for developments one thing was sureeven though it were a futile way to hunt it seemed rich in other recompense for me my stand towered above a vast colorful slope down which the wind roared as in a gale how could i ever hear the hounds i watched the stormclouds scudding across the sky once i saw a rare bird a black eagle in magnificent flight and so whatever happened i had my reward in that sight  nothing happened for hours and hours i sat there with frequent intermissions away from my hard rocky seat toward the close of afternoon when the wind began to get cold i saw that rc had left his stand he had undoubtedly gone back to camp which was some miles nearer his stand than mine at last i gave up any hope of hearing either the hounds or the horn as the roar of wind had increased once i thought i heard a distant rifle shot so i got on my horse and set out to find camp i was on a promontory the sides of which were indented by long ravines that were impassable except near their heads in fact i had been told there was only one narrow space where it was possible to get off this promontory lucky indeed that i remembered haught telling of this anyway i soon found myself lost in a maze of forested heads of ravines finally i went back to the rim on the west side and then working along i found our horsetracks these i followed with difficulty and after an hours travel i crossed the narrow neck of the promontory and backtracked myself to camp arriving there at sunset  the haughts had put up two bear one bear had worked around under one of the great promontories the hounds had gotten on his backtrail staying on it until it grew cold then had left it their baying had roused the bear out of his bed and he had showed himself once or twice on the open rockslides haught saw the other bear from the rim this was a big red cinnamon bear asleep under a pine tree on an open slope haught said when the hounds gave tongue on the other trail this red bear awakened sat up and wagged his head slowly he had never been chased by hounds he lay down in his piny bed again the distance was too great for an accurate shot but haught tried anyway with the result that he at least scared the cinnamon off  these bear were both thin as they were not the sheepkilling and cowkilling kind their food consisted mainly of mast acorns and berries but this season there were no berries at all and very few acorns so the bears were not fat when a bear was thin he could always outrun the hounds if he was fat he would get hot and tired enough to climb a tree or mad enough to stop and fight the dogs  haught told me there were a good many mountain lions and lynx under the rim they lived on elk deer and turkey the lynx were the tufteared shorttailed species they would attack and kill a cowelk in winter on the rim the snow sometimes fell fifteen feet deep so that the game wintered underneath snow did not lay long on the sunny open ridges of the basin  that night a stormwind roared mightily in the pines how wonderful to lie snug in bed down in the protected canyon and hear the marching and retreating gale above in the forest next day we expected rain or snow but there was only wind and that quieted by afternoon so i took romer off into the woods he carried his rifle and he wore his chaps i could not persuade him to part with these they rustled on the brush and impeded his movements and particularly tired him and made him look like a diminutive cowboy how eager keen boyishly vain imaginative he was crazy to see game to shoot anything particularly bears but it contented him to hunt turkeys many a stump and bit of color he mistook for game of some kind nevertheless i had to take credence in what he thought he saw for his eyesight was unusually quick and keen  that afternoon edd and doyle arrived reporting an extremely rough roundabout climb up to the rim where they had left the wagon as it was impossible to haul the supplies down into the canyon they were packed down to camp on burros isbel had disapproved of this procedure a circumstance that struck me with peculiar significance which lee explained by telling me isbel was one of the peculiar breed of cowboys who no sooner were they out on the range than they wanted to go back to town again the truth was i had not met any of that breed though i had heard of them this peculiarity of isbels began to be related in my mind to his wastefulness as a cook he cooked and threw away as much as we ate i asked him to be careful and to go easy with our supplies but i could not see that my request made any difference  after supper this evening rc heard a turkey call up on the hill east of camp then i heard it and romer also we ran out a ways into the open to listen the better rcs ears were exceptionally keen he could hear a squirrel jump a long distance in the forest in this case he distinctly heard three turkeys fly up into trees i heard one romer declared he heard a flock then rc located a big bronze and white gobbler on a lower limb of a huge pine presently i too espied it whereupon we took shotgun and rifle and sallied forth sure of fetching back to camp some wild turkey meat romer tagged at our heels  hurrying to the slope we climbed up at least threequarters of the way as swiftly as possible and that was work enough to make me wet and hot the sun had set and twilight was upon us so that we needs must hurry if we were to be successful locating the big gobbler turned out to be a task we had to climb over brush and around rocks up a steep slope rather open and we had to do it without being seen or making noise romer despite his eagerness did very well indeed at last i espied our quarry and indeed the sight was thrilling wild turkey gobblers to me who had hunted them enough to learn how sagacious and cunning and difficult to stalk they were always seemed as provocative of excitement as larger game this big fellow hopped up from limb to limb of the huge dead pine and he bobbed around as if undecided and tried each limb for a place to roost then he hopped farther up until we lost sight of him in the gnarled network of branches  rc wanted me to slip on alone but i preferred to have him and romer go too so we slipped stealthily upward until we reached the level then progress was easier i went to the left with the rifle and rc with the 20gauge and romer went around to the right how rapidly it was growing dark low down in the forest i could not distinguish objects we circled that big pine tree and i made rather a wide detour perhaps eighty yards from it at last i got the upper part of the dead pine silhouetted against the western sky moving to and fro i finally made out a large black lump way out upon a spreading branch could that be the gobbler i studied that dark enlarged part of the limb with great intentness and i had about decided that it was only a knot when i saw a long neck shoot out that lump was the wise old turkey all right he was almost in the top of the tree and far out from the trunk no wild cat or lynx could ever surprise him there i reflected upon the instinct that governed him to protect his life so cunningly safe he was from all but man and gun  when i came to aim at him with the rifle i found that i could see only a blur of sights other branches and the tip of a very high pine adjoining made a dark background i changed my position working around to where the background was all open sky it proved to be better by putting the sights against this open sky i could faintly see the front sight through the blurred ring it was a good long shot even for daylight and i had a rifle i knew nothing about but all the difficulty only made a keener zest just then i heard romer cry out excitedly and then rc spoke distinctly far more careless than that they began to break twigs under their feet the gobbler grew uneasy how he stretched out his long neck he heard them below i called out low and sharp stand still be quiet then i looked again through the blurred peepsight until i caught the front sight against the open sky this done i moved the rifle over until i had the sight aligned against the dark shape straining my eyes i held hardthen fired the big dark lump on the branch changed shape and fell to alight with a sounding thump i heard romer running but could not see him then his high voice pealed out i got him dad you made a grand peg  not only had romer gotten him but he insisted on packing him back to camp the gobbler was the largest i ever killed not indeed one of the huge thirtyfive pounders but a fat heavy turkey and quite a load for a boy romer packed him down that steep slope in the dark without a slip for which performance i allowed him to stay up a while around the campfire  the haughts came over from their camp that night and visited us much as i loved to sit alone beside a redembered fire at night in the forest or on the desert i also liked upon occasions to have company we talked and talked oldtimer doyle told more than one of his in the early days stories then haught told us some bear stories the first was about an old black bear charging and sliding down at him he said no hunter should ever shoot at a bear above him because it could come down at him as swiftly as a rolling rock this time he worked the lever of his rifle at lightning speed and at the last shot he shore saw bear hair right before his eyes his second story was about a boy who killed a bear and was skinning it when five more bears came along in single file and made it very necessary that he climb a tree until they had gone his third story was about an old shebear that had two cubs haught happened to ride within sight of her when evidently she thought it time to put her cubs in a safe place so she tried to get them to climb a spruce tree and finally had to cuff and spank them to make them go up in connection with this story he told us he had often seen shebears spank their cubs more thrilling was his fourth story about a huge grizzly a sheep and cattle killer that passed through the country leaving death behind him on the range  romers enjoyment of this storytelling hour around the glowing campfire was equalled by his reluctance to go to bed aw dad please let me hear one more he pleaded his shining eyes would have weakened a sterner discipline than mine and haught seemed inspired by them  wal now listen to this hyar he began again with a twinkle in his eye thar was an old fellar had a ranch in chevelon canyon an he was always bein pestered by mountain lions his name was bill tinker now bill was no sort of a hunter fact was he was afeerd of lions an bears but he shore did git riled when any critters rustled around his cabin one day in the fall he comes home an seen a big shelion sneakin around he grabbed a club an throwed it and yelled to scare the critter away wal he had an old water barrel layin around an darned if the lion didnt run in thet barrel an hide bill run quick an flopped the barrel end up so he had the lion trapped he had to set on the barrel to hold it down shore that lion raised old jasper under the barrel bill was plumb scared then he seen the lions tail stick out through the bunghole bill bent over an shore quick tied a knot in thet long tail then he run fer his cabin when he got to the door he looked back to see the lion tearin down the hill fer the woods with the barrel bumpin behind her bill said he never seen her again till next spring an she had the barrel still on her tail but what was strangern thet bill swore she had four cubs with her an each of them had a keg on its tail  we all roared with laughter except romer his interest had been so allabsorbing his excitement so great and his faith in the storyteller so reverential that at first he could not grasp the trick at the end of the story his face was radiant his eyes were dark and dilated when the truth dawned upon him amaze and disappointment changed his mobile face and then came mirth he shouted as if to the treetops on high long after he was in bed i heard him laughing to himself  i was awakened a little after daylight by the lad trying to get into his boots his boots were rather tight and somehow even in a dry forest he always contrived to get them wet so that in the morning it was a herculean task for him to pull them on this occasion appeared more strenuous than usual son whats the idea i inquired its just daylightnot time to get up he desisted from his labors long enough to pant uncle romesgone after turkeys edds going tocall them witha callermade out of a turkeys wingbone and i said but theyve gone now whereupon he subsided darned old boots i heard edd and uncle rome id been ready if i could have got into my darned old boots see here dad im gonna wear moccasins   iii  as we were sitting round the campfire eating breakfast rc and edd returned and rc carried a turkey gobbler the very size and color of the one i had shot the night before rcs face wore the keen pleased expression characteristic of it when he had just had some unusual and satisfying experience  illustration zane grey on don carlos  illustration wild turkey  sure was great he said warming his hands at the fire we went up on the hill where you killed your gobbler last night got there just in the gray light of dawn we were careful not to make any noise edd said if there were any more turkeys they would come down at daylight so we waited until it was light enough to see then edd got out his turkey bone and began to call turkeys answered from the trees all around by george it was immense edd had picked out a thicket of little pines for us to hide in and in front of us was a glade with a big fallen tree lying across it edd waited a few moments the woods was all gray and quiet i dont know when ive felt so good then he called again at once turkeys answered from all around in the trees next i heard a swish of wings then a thump then more swishes the turkeys were flying down from their roosts it seemed to me in my excitement that there were a hundred of them we could hear them pattering over the dry ground edd whispered theyre down now we got to do some real callin i felt how tense how cautious he was when he called again there was some little difference i dont know what unless it was his call sounded more like a real turkey they answered they were gathering in front of us and i made sure were coming into the glade edd stopped calling then he whispered ready now look out sure i was looking all right this was my first experience calling turkeys and i simply shook all over suddenly i saw a turkey head stick up over the log thenup hopped a beautiful gobbler he walked along the log looked and peered and stretched his neck sure he was suspicious edd gave me a hunch which i took to be a warning to shoot quick that was a hard place for me i wanted to watch the gobbler i wanted to see the others we could hear them all over the glade but this was my chance quickly i rose and took a peg at him a cloud of feathers puffed off him he gave a great bounce flapping his wings i heard a roaring whirr of other turkeys with my eye on my gobbler i seemed to see the air full of big black flying things my gobbler came down bounced up again got goingwhen with the second barrel i knocked him cold then i stood there watching the flock whirring every way into the forest must have been thirtyfive or forty of them all gobblers it was a great sight and right here i declared myselfwild turkey is the game for me  romer manifestly listened to this narrative with mingled feelings of delight and despair uncle rome wild turkeys the game for me too  and by gosh ill fix those boots of mine  that morning we were scheduled for another bear hunt on which i had decided to go down under the rim with edd and george lee had his doubts about my horse and desired me to take his or at least one of the others now his horse was too spirited for me to ride after hounds and i did not want to take one of the others so i was compelled to ride my own at the last moment lee had been disappointed in getting a mustang he particularly wanted for me and so it had fallen about that my horse was the poorest in the outfit which to put it mildly was pretty poor i had made the best of the matter so far and hoped to continue doing so  we rode up the east slope of beaver dam canyon through the forest and out along the rim for five or six miles way on the other side of the promontory where i had gotten lost here haught left us taking with him rc and lee and nielsen all of whom were to have stands along the rim we hoped to start a bear and chase him round under the high points toward horton thicket  the magnificent view from the head of a trail where edd started down impressed me so powerfully that i lagged behind below me heaved a split tossed dimpled waving rolling world of blackgreen forestland far across it stood up a rugged blue waved range of mountainsthe sierra anchas  the trail was rough even for arizonians which made it for me little short of impassable i got off to lead my horse he had to be pulled most of the time wherefore i lost patience with him i loved horses but not stubborn ones all the way down the rocky trail the bunch grass and wild oak and manzanita were so thick that i had to crush my way through at length i had descended the steep part to find edd and george waiting for me below on the juniper benches these were slopes of red earth or clay bare of grass but thick with junipers cactus and manzanita this face of the great rim was a southern exposure hot and dusty the junipers were thick the green of their foliage somewhat resembled cedars but their berries were grayblue almost lavender in color i tasted several from different trees until i found one with sweet somewhat acrid taste significant it was that this juniper had broken branches where bears had climbed to eat the fruit and all around on the ground beneath was bear sign edd said the tracks were cold but all the same he had to be harsh with the hounds to hold them in i counted twenty piles of bear manure under one juniper and many places where bears had scraped in the soft earth and needles  we went on down this slope getting into thicker brush and rougher ground all at once the hounds opened up in thrilling chorus of bays and barks i saw edd jump off his horse to stoop and examine the ground where evidently he had seen a bear track freshmade last night he yelled mounting hurriedly hi hi hi his horse leaped through the brush and george followed in an instant they were out of sight right there my trouble began i spurred my horse after them and it developed that he differed from me in regard to direction and going he hated the brush but i made him take to it and made him run dodging branches was an old story for me and if i had been on a good fast horse i might have kept edd and george in sight as it was however i had to follow them by the sound of hoofs and breaking brush from the way the hounds bayed i knew they had struck a hot scent they worked down the slope and assuredly gave me a wild ride to keep within hearing of them my horse grew excited which fact increased his pace his obstinacy and likewise my danger twice he unseated me i tore my coat lost my hat scratched my face skinned my knees but somehow i managed to keep within hearing  i came to a deep brushchoked gorge impassable at that point luckily the hounds turned here and started back my way by riding along the edge of this gorge i kept up with them they climbed out an intersecting ravine and up on the opposite side i forced my horse to go down this rather steep soft slope at the bottom i saw a little spring of water with fresh bear tracks around it and one place where the bear had caved in a soft bank here my horse suddenly plunged and went to his knees in the yielding red clay he snorted in fright the bank slid with him and i tumbled off but nothing serious happened i ran down caught him mounted and spurred him up the other side once up he began to run i heard the boys yelling not far away and the hounds were baying up above me they were climbing fast working to the left toward an oak thicket it took effort to slow down my steed he acted crazy and i began to suspect that he had caught a whiff of the bear most horses are afraid of bears and lions sight of edd and george who appeared in an open spot somewhat quieted my mount  trails gettin hot up there declared edd that bears bedded somewhere an ill bet the hounds jumped him listen to old tom  how the deep sonorous bay of old tom awoke the echoes under the cliffs and old dans voice was a hoarse bellow the other hounds yelped  edd blew a mellow blast from his huntinghorn and that awoke other and more melodious echoes theres father up on the rim he said i looked and finally saw haught perched like a black eagle on a crag his gun flashed in the strong sunlight  somewhere up there the hounds jumped the bear anybody could have told that what a wild chorus edd and george answered to it with whoops as wild and they galloped their horses over ground and through brush where they should have been walked i followed or tried to follow and here my steed showed his bullheaded obstinate nature if he had been afraid but still game i would have respected him but he was a coward and mean he wanted to have his way which was to go the other direction and to rid himself of me so we had it hot and heavy along that rough slope with honors about even as for bruises and scratches however i sustained the most in the excitement of the chase and anger at the horse i forgot all about any risks this always is the way in adventure hot racing blood governed me entirely whenever i got out in an open place where i could ride fast and hear and see then it was all intensely thrilling both hounds and comrades were above me but apparently working down  thus for me the necessity of hurry somewhat lessened i slowed to a trot peering everywhere listening with all my ears i had stopped yelling because my horse had misunderstood that we got into a region of oak thickets small saplings scrubby close together but beautiful with their autumntinted leaves next i rode through a maple dell shady cool where the leafy floor was all rosepinkred my horse sent the colored leaves flying  soon however we got into the thickets again low liveoak and manzanita which kind of brush my horse detested i did not blame him for that as the hounds began to work down my keen excitement increased if they had jumped the bear and were chasing him down i might run upon him any moment this both appealed to me and caused me apprehension suppose he were a bad cinnamon or a grizzly what would become of me on that horse i decided that i had better carry my rifle in my hand so in case of a sudden appearance of the bear and i was thrown or had a fall off then i would be prepared so forthwith i drew the rifle out of the scabbard remembering as i did so that haught had cautioned me in case of close quarters with a bear and the need of quick shooting to jerk the lever down hard if my horse had cut up abominably before he now began to cover himself with a glory of abominableness i had to jam him through the thickets he was an uncomfortable horse to ride under the best circumstances here he was as bad as riding a picketfence when he got his head which was often he carried me into thickets of manzanita that we could not penetrate and had to turn back i found that i was working high up the slope and bad luck as i was having with my horse i still appeared to keep fairly close to the hounds  when we topped a ridge of this slope the wind struck us strong in the face the baying of the hounds rang clear and full and fierce my horse stood straight up then he plunged back and bolted down the slope his mouth was like iron i could neither hold nor turn him however perilous this ride i had to admit that at last my horse was running beautifully in fact he was running away he had gotten a hot scent of that bear he hurdled rocks leaped washes slid down banks plunged over places that made my hair stand up stiff and worst of all he did not try to avoid brush or trees or cactus manzanita he tore right through leaving my coat in strips decorating our wake i had to hold on to lie flat to dodge and twist and all the time watch for a place where i might fall off in safety but i did not get a chance to fall off a loud clamoring burst from the hounds apparently close behind drove my horse frantic before he had only runnow he flew he left me hanging in the thick branches of a juniper from which i dropped blind and breathless and stunned disengaging myself from the broken and hanging branches i staggered aside rifle in hand trying to recover breath and wits  then in that nerveless and shaken condition i heard the breaking of twigs and thud of soft steps right above me peering up with my halfblinded eyes i saw a huge red furry animal coming half obscured by brush it waved aside from his broad back a shock ran over mea bursting gush of hot blood that turned to ice as it rushed big cinnamon bear i whispered hoarsely  instinctively i cocked and leveled the rifle and though i could not clearly see the red animal bearing down the slope such was my state that i fired then followed a roaring crasha terrible breaking onslaught upon the brushand the huge red mass seemed to flash down toward me i worked the lever of the rifle but i had forgotten haughts caution i did not work the lever far enough down so that the next cartridge jammed in the receiver with a second shock different this time i tried again in vain the terrible crashing of brush appeared right upon me for an instant that seemed an age i stood riveted to the spot my blood congealing my heart choking me my tongue pasted to the roof of my mouth then i dropped the rifle and whirled to plunge away like a deer i bounded i took prodigious bounds to escapeto find a tree to leap intothat was my only thought a few rods down the slopeit seemed a milei reached a pine with low branches like a squirrel i ran up thisstraddled a limb high upand gazed back  my sensations then were dominated by the relief of salvation i became conscious of them racing blood bursting heart labored pang of chest prickling burning skin a queer involuntary flutter of muscles like a palsythese attested to the instinctive primitive nature of my state i heard the crashing of brush the pound of soft jumps over to my left with eyes that seemed magnifying i gazed to see a big red woolly steer plunge wildly down the slope and disappear a third shock possessed meamaze i had mistaken a wild frightened steer for a red cinnamon bear  i sat there some moments straddling that branch then i descended and went back to the place i had dropped my rifle and securing that i stood a moment listening the hounds had taken the chase around below me into the gorge and were drawing away it was useless to try to follow them i sat down again and gave myself up to meditation  i tried to treat the situation as a huge joke but that would not go no joke indeed my horse had made me risk too much my excitement had been too intense my fright had been too terrible reality for me could not have been any more grave i had risked my neck on a stubborn coward of a horse i had mistaken a steer for a bear i had forgotten how to manipulate the borrowed rifle these were the careless elements of tragedy the thought sobered me i took the lesson to heart and i reflected on the possible point of view of the bear he had probably gone to sleep on a full stomach of juniper berries and a big drink of spring water rudely he had been routed out by a pack of yelping fiendish hounds he had to run for his life what had he done to deserve such treatment possibly he might have killed some of haughts pigs but most assuredly he had never harmed me in my sober frame of mind then i rather disapproved of my wholly unjustifiable murderous intent i would have deserved it if the steer had really been the bear certainly i hoped the bear would outrun the hounds and escape i weighed the wonderful thrill of the chase the melody of hounds the zest of spirited action the peril to limb and life against the thing that they were done for with the result that i found them sadly lacking peril to limb and life was good for man if this had not been a fact my performance would have been as cowardly as that of my horse again i had rise up before my mind the spectacle of opposing forcesthe elemental in man restrained by the spiritual then the old haunting thought returned to vex meman in his development needed the exercise of brawn muscle bone redblood violence labor and pain and agony nature recognized only the survival of the fittest of any species if a man allowed a spiritual development intellect gentleness to keep him from all hard violent action from tremendous exertion from fierce fight with elements and beasts and his own kindwould he not soon degenerate as a natural physical man evolution was a stern inevitable seeking of nature for perfection for the unattainable this perfection was something that lived and improved on strife barbarians indians savages were the most perfect specimens of natures handiwork and in proportion to their development toward socalled civilized life their physical prowess and perfectnessthat was to say their strength to resist and live and reproduce their kindabsolutely and inevitably deteriorated  my reflection did not carry me at that time to any positive convictions of what was truest and best the only conclusions i eventually arrived at were that i was sore and bruised and dirty and tornthat i would be happy if the bear got awaythat i had lost my mean horse and was glad thereforethat i would have half a dozen horses and rifles upon my next huntand lastly that i would not be in any hurry to tell about mistaking a steer for a bear and climbing a tree indeed these last facts have been religiously kept secret until chronicled here  shortly afterward as i was making a lame and slow headway toward horton thicket where i hoped to find a trail out i heard edd yelling and i answered presently we met he was leading my horse and some of the hounds notably old tom and dan were with him  wheres the bear i asked  he got away down in the breaks replied edd george is tryin to call the hounds back what happened to you i heard you shoot  my horse didnt care much for me or the brush i replied he left merather suddenly andi took a shot at what i thought was a bear  i seen him once said edd with eyes flashing was just goin to smoke him up when he jumped out of sight  my mortification and apprehension were somewhat mitigated when i observed that edd was dirty ragged and almost as much disheveled as i was i had feared he would see in my appearance certain unmistakable evidences that i had made a tenderfoot blunder and then run for my life but edd took my loss of hat and torn coat and general bedraggled state as a matter of course indeed i somehow felt a little pride at his acceptance of me there in the flesh  we rode around the end of this slope gradually working down into horton thicket where a wild confusion of dense timber engaged my sight presently george trotted up behind us with the other dogs we lost him down on the hot dry ridges hounds couldnt track him was all george said thereupon edd blew four blasts upon his huntinghorn which were signals to those on the stands above that the hunt was over for the day  even in the jungle tropics i had never seen such dense shade as this down in horton thicket the timber grew close and large and the foliage was matted letting little sunlight through dark green and brown fragrant cool thicket indeed it was we came to a huge spruce tree the largest i ever sawedd said eight feet through at the base but he was conservative it was a gnarled bearded gray old monarch of the forest with bleached dead top for many years it had been the home of swarms of wild honey bees edd said more than one beehunter had undertaken to cut down this spruce this explained a number of deeply cut notches in the huge trunk ill bet nielsen could chop it down declared edd i admitted the compliment to our brawny norwegian axewielder but added that i certainly would not let him do it whether we were to get any honey or not  by and bye we reached the bottom of the thicket where we crossed a swift clear cold brook here the smells seemed cool sweet wild with spruce and pine this stream of granite water burst from a spring under a cliff what a roar it made i drank until i could drink no more huge boulders and windfalls moved by water at flood season obstructed the narrow streambed we crossed to start climbing the north slope and soon worked up out of the thicket upon a steep rocky slope with isolated pines we struck a deertrail hard to follow above me loomed the pinetipped rim with its crags cliffs pinnacles and walls all gray seamed and stained and in some clefts blazes of deep red and yellow foliage  when we surmounted the slope and eventually reached camp i found isbel entertaining strangers men of rough garb evidently riders of the range that was all right but i did not like his prodigality with our swiftly diminishing store of eatables  to conclude about isbelmatters pertaining to our commissary department during the next few days went from bad to worse doyle advised me not to take isbel to task and was rather evasive of reasons for so advising me of course i listened and attended to my old guides advice but i fretted under the restraint we had a spell of bad weather wind and rain and hail off and on and at length the third day a cold drizzling snow during this spell we did but little hunting the weather changed and the day afterward i rode my mean horse twenty miles on a deer hunt we saw one buck upon our arrival at camp about four oclock which hour was too early for dinner i was surprised and angered to find isbel eating an elaborate meal with three more strange roughappearing men doyle looked serious nielsen had a sharp glint in his gray eye as for myself this procedure of our cooks was more than i could stand  isbel youre discharged i said shortly take your outfit and get out lee will lend you a pack horse  wal i aint fired drawled isbel i quit before you rode in beat you to it  then if you quit it seems to me you are taking liberties with supplies you have no right to i replied  nope cook of any outfit has a right to all the chuck he wants thats western way  isbel listen to this and then get out i went on youve wasted our supplies just to get us to hurry and break camp as for western ways i know something of them its a western way for a man to be square and honest in his dealings with an outsider in all my years and in all my trips over the southwest you are the first westerner to give me the doublecross you have that distinction  then i turned my back upon him and walked to my tent his acquaintances left at once and he quickly packed and followed faithful old doyle took up the duties of cook and we gained rather than missed by the change our supplies however had been so depleted that we could not stay much longer on the hunt  by dint of much determination as to the manner and method of my next hunt i managed to persuade myself that i could make the best of this unlucky sojourn in the woods no rifle no horse worth riding no food to stay out our timeit was indeed bad luck for me after supper the tension relaxed then i realized all the men were relieved only romer regretted loss of isbel when the doyles and haughts saw how i took my hard luck they seemed all the keener to make my stay pleasant and profitable little they knew that their regard was more to me than material benefits and comforts of the trip to travelers of the desert and hunters and riders of the open there are always hard and uncomfortable and painful situations to be met with and in meeting these if it can be done with fortitude and spirit that win the respect of westerners it is indeed a reward  next day in defiance of a thing which never should be consideredlucki took haughts rifle again and my lazy sullen intractable horse and rode with edd and george down into horton thicket at least i could not be cheated out of fresh air and beautiful scenery  we dismounted and tied our horses at the brook and while edd took the hounds up into the dense thicket where the bears made their beds george and i followed a trail up the brook in exactly ten minutes the hounds gave tongue they ran up the thicket which was favorable for us and from their baying i judged the bear trail to be warm in the dense forest we could not see five rods ahead george averred that he did not care to have a big cinnamon or a grizzly come running down that black thicket and as for myself i did not want one so very exceedingly much i tried to keep from letting the hounds excite me which effort utterly failed we kept even with the hounds until their baying fell off and finally grew desultory and then ceased guess they had the wrong end of his trail said george with this exasperating feature of bear and lion chases i was familiar most hounds when they struck a trail could not tell in which direction the bear was traveling a really fine hound however like buffalo jones famous don or scott teagues sampson or haughts old dan would grow suspicious of a scent that gradually cooled and would eventually give it up young hounds would backtrack game as far as possible  after waiting a while we returned to our horses and presently edd came back with the pack big bear but cold trail called them off was all he said we mounted and rode across the mouth of horton thicket round to the juniper slopes which i had occasion to remember i even saw the pine tree which i had so ignominiously climbed how we ridicule and scorn some of our perfectly natural actionsafterwards edd had brought three of the pups that day twoyearolds as full of mischief as pups could be they jumped a bunch of deer and chased them out on the hard red cedar covered ridges we had a merry chase to head them off edd gave them a tonguelashing and thrashing at one and the same time i felt sorry for the pups they had been so full of frolic and fight how crestfallen they appeared after edd got through whaddaye mean yelled edd in conclusion chasin deer do you think youre a lot of rabbit dogs from the way the pups eyed edd so sheepishly and adoringly i made certain they understood him perfectly and humbly confessed their error  old tom and old dan had not come down off the slopes with us after the pups and upon our return both the old hounds began to bay deep and fast with shrill kiyi the pups bounded off apparently frantic to make up for misbehavior soon the whole pack was in full chorus edd and george spurred into the brush yelling encouragement to the hounds this day i managed to make my horse do a little of what i wanted to keep in sight of the haught boys was indeed beyond me but i did not lose sound of them this chase led us up slope and down slope through the brush and pine thickets over bare ridges and into gullies and eventually out into the basin where the hounds got beyond hearing  one of them long lean hungry bears remarked edd hed outrun any dogs  leisurely then we turned to the threehour ride back to camp hot sun in the open cool wind in the shade dry smells of the forest green and red and orange and purple of the foliagethese rendered the hours pleasant for me when i reached camp i found romer in trouble he had cut his hand with a forbidden hunting knife as he told me about it his face was a study and his explanation was astounding when he finished i said you mean then that my hunting knife walked out of its sheath on my belt and followed you around and cut you of its own accord  aw iiit he floundered  whereupon i lectured him about forbidden things and untruthfulness his reply was but dad it hurts like sixty wont you put somethin on it  i dressed and bandaged the trifling cut for him telling him the while how little indian boys when cut or kicked or bruised never showed that they were hurt huh he grunted guess theres no indian in me i must take after mother  that afternoon and night the hounds straggled in old tom and dan first and then the others one by one faggedout and footsore next morning however they appeared none the worse for their long chase we went again to horton thicket to rout out a bear  this time i remained on top of the rim with rc and nielsen and we took up a stand across the canyon near where my first stand had been here we idled the hours away waiting for the hounds to start something while walking along the rim i happened to look across the big cove that cut into the promontory and way on the other slope what did i espy but a black bear he appeared to be very small or merely a cub running back to rc and nielsen i told them and we all took up our rifles it occurred to me that the distance across this cove was too far for accurate shooting but it never occurred to me to jump on my horse and ride around the head of the cove  hes not scared lets watch him suggested rc  illustration wild turkeys  illustration the white quaking asps  we saw this bear walk along poke around dig into the ground go behind trees come out again and finally stand up on his hind feet and apparently reach for berries or something on a bush rc bethought himself of his fieldglass after one look he exclaimed say fellows hes a whopper of a bear hell weigh five hundred pounds just take a look at him  my turn with the glasses revealed to me that what i had imagined to be a cub was indeed a big bear after nielsen looked he said never saw one so big in norway  well look at that black scoundrel exclaimed rc standing up looking around wagging his head say you saw him first suppose you take some pegs at him  wish romer were here id let him shoot at that bear i replied then i got down on my knee and aiming as closely as possible i fired the report rang out in the stillness making hollow echoes we heard the bullet pat somewhere so did the bear hear it curiously he looked around as if something had struck near him but scared he certainly was not then i shot four times in quick succession  well ill be darned ejaculated rc he heard the bullets hit and wonders what the dickens say now he hears the reports look at him stand  boys smoke him up i said after the manner of haughts vernacular so while i reloaded rc and nielsen began to shoot we had more fun out of it than the bear evidently he located us then he began to run choosing the open slope by which he had come i got five more shots at him as he crossed this space and the last bullet puffed up dust under him making him take a header down the slope into the thicket whereupon we all had a good laugh nielsen appeared particularly pleased over his first shots at a real live bear  say why didnt you think to ride round there queried rc thoughtfully he didnt see us he wasnt scared in a few minutes you could have been on the rim of that slope right over him got him sure  rc why didnt you think to tell me to do that i retorted why dont we ever think the right thing before it is too late  thats our last chance this yeari feel it in my bones declared rc mournfully  his premonition turned out to be correct upon our arrival at camp we heard some very disquieting news a neighbor of haughts had taken the trouble to ride up to inform us about the epidemic of influenza the strange disease was all over the country in the cities the villages the cowcamps the mineseverywhere at first i thought haughts informant was exaggerating a mere rumor but when he told of the indians dying on the reservations and that in flagstaff eighty people had succumbed in a few weeksthen i was thoroughly alarmed imperative was it indeed for me to make a decision at once i made it instantly we would break camp so i told the men doyle was relieved and glad he wanted to get home to his family the haughts naturally were sorry my decision once arrived at the next thing was to consider which way to travel the long tenday trip down into the basin round by payson and up on the rim again and so on to flagstaff was not to be considered at all the roads by way of winslow and holbrook were long and bad doyle wanted to attempt the old army road along the rim made by general crook when he moved the captured apaches to the reservation assigned to them no travel over this road for many years haught looked dubious but finally said we could chop our way through thickets and haul the wagon empty up bad hills the matter of decision was left to me decisions of such nature were not easy to make the responsibility was great but as the hunt had been for me it seemed incumbent upon me to accept responsibility what made me hesitate at all was the fact that i had ridden five miles or more along the old crook road i remembered i told lee and i told nielsen that we would find it tough going lee laughed like a cowboy well go ahummin he said nielsen shrugged his brawny shoulders what were obstacles to this man of the desert i realized that his look had decided me  all right men well try the old crook road i said pack what you can up to the wagon today and tomorrow early well break camp  i walked with the haughts from our camp across the brook to theirs where we sat down in the warm sunshine i made light of this hunting trip in which it had turned out i had no gun no horse no blankets no rainproof tent no adequate amount of food supplies and no good luck except the wonderful good luck of being well of seeing a magnificent country of meeting some more fine westerners but the haughts appeared a little slow to grasp or at least to credit my philosophy we were just beginning to get acquainted their regret was that they had been unable to see me get a bear a deer a lion and some turkeys their conviction perhaps formed from association with many sportsman hunters was that owing to my bad luck i could not and would not want to come again  see here haught i said ive had a fine time now forget about this hunt its past well plan another will you save next fall for me  i shore will he replied  very well then its settled say by august you and the boys cut a trail or two in and out of horton thicket ill send you money in advance to pay for this work and get new hounds and outfit ill leave flagstaff on september fifteenth meet you here september twentyfirst along about noon  we shook hands upon the deal it pleased me that the haughts laughed at me yet appeared both surprised and happy as i left i heard edd remark not a kick meet him next year at noon what do you know about thet this remark proved that he had paid me a compliment in eastern slang most likely assimilated from rc and romer  the rest of the afternoon our camp resembled a beehive and next morning it was more like a bedlam the horses were fresh spirited and they had tender backs the burros stampeded because of some surreptitious trick of romers but by noon we had all the outfit packed in the wagon considering the amount of stuff and the long rough climb up to the wagon this was a most auspicious start i hoped that it augured well for us but while i hoped i had a gloomy foreboding we bade goodbye to haught and his son george edd offered to go with us as far as he knew the country which distance was not many miles so we set out upon our doubtful journey our saddlehorses in front of the lumbering wagon  we had five miles of fairly level road through open forest along the rim and then we struck such a rocky jumble of downhill grade that the bundles fell off the wagon they had to be tied on when we came to a long slow slant uphill a road of loose rocks we made about one mile an hour this slow travel worked havoc upon my mind i wanted to hurry i wanted to get out of the wilds that awful rumor about influenza occupied my mind and struck cold fear into my heart what of my family no making the best of this slowly we toiled on sunset overtook us at a rocky ledge which had to be surmounted with lassos on saddle horses in front of the two teams all pulling hard we overcame that obstacle but at the next little hill which we encountered about twilight one of the team horses balked urging him whipping him served no purpose and it had bad effect upon the other horses darkness was upon us with the campsite edd knew of still miles to the fore no grass no water for the horses but we had to camp there all hands set to work it really was funit should have been fine for mebut my gloomy obsession to hurry obscured my mind i marveled at old doyle over seventy after that long hard day quickly and efficiently cooking a good hot supper romer had enjoyed the day he said he was tired but would like to stay up beside the mighty campfire nielsen built i had neither energy or spirit to oppose him the night was dark and cold and windy the fire felt so good that i almost went asleep beside it we had no time to put up tents i made our bed crawled into it stretched out with infinite relief and the last thing i was aware of was romer snuggling in beside me  morning brought an early bestirring of every one we had to stir to get warm the air nipped like cold pincers all the horses were gone we could not hear a bell but lee did not appear worried i groaned in spirit more delay gloom assailed me lee sallied out with his yellow dog pups i had forgotten the good quality of pups but not my dislike for him he barked vociferously and that annoyed me rc and i helped edd and nielsen pack the wagon we worked quick and hard then doyle called us to breakfast we had scarcely started to eat when we heard a jangle of bells and the pound of hoofs i could not believe my ears our horses were lost nevertheless suddenly they appeared driven by lee riding bareback and pups barking his head off we all jumped up with ropes and nosebags to head off the horses and soon had them secured not one missing i asked lee how in the world he had found that wild bunch in less than an hour lee laughed pups he rounded them up in no time  then i wanted to go away and hide behind a thicket and kick myself but what i actually did was to give pups part of my meat i reproached myself for my injustice to him how often had i been deceived in the surface appearance of people and things and dogs most of our judgments are wrong we do not see clearly  by nine oclock we were meeting our first obstaclethe little hill at which the sorrel horse had balked lo rested and full of grain he balked again he ruined our start he spoiled the teams lee had more patience than i would have had he unhitched the lead team and in place of the sorrel put a saddle horse called pacer then doyle tried again and surmounted the hill our saddle horses slowly worked ahead over as rocky and rough a road as i ever traveled most of the time we could see over the rim down into the basin along here the rim appeared to wave in gentle swells heavily timbered and thickly rockstrewn with heads of canyons opening down to our right i saw deer tracks and turkey tracks neither of which occasioned me any thrills now about the middle of the afternoon edd bade us farewell and turned back we were sorry to see him go but as all the country ahead of us was as unfamiliar to him as to us there seemed to be no urgent need of him  we encountered a long steep hill up which the teams and our saddle horses combined could not pull the wagon we unpacked it and each of us romer included loaded a bundle or box in front of his saddle and took it up the hill then the teams managed the wagon this incident happened four times in less than as many miles the team horses having had a rest from hard labor had softened and this sudden return to strenuous pulling had made their shoulders sore they either could not or would not pull we covered less than ten miles that day a very discouraging circumstance we camped in a pine grove close to the rim a splendid site that under favorable circumstances would have been enjoyable at sunset rc and nielsen and romer saw a black bear down under the rim the incident was so wonderful for romer that it brightened my spirits a bear a big bear dad i saw him he was alive he stood uplike thiswagging his head oh i saw him  our next days progress was no less than a nightmare crawling along unpacking and carrying and packing again we toiled up and down the interminable length of three almost impassable miles when night overtook us it was in a bad place to camp no grass no water a cold gale blew out of the west it roared through the forest it blew everything loose away in the darkness it almost blew us away in our beds the stars appeared radiantly coldly white up in the vast blue windy vault of the sky a full moon soared majestically shadows crossed the weird moonblanched forest glades  at daylight we were all up cramped stiff half frozen mostly silent the water left in the buckets was solid ice suddenly some one discovered that nielsen was missing the fact filled me with consternation and alarm he might have walked in his sleep and fallen over the rim what had become of him all his outfit lay scattered round in his bed in my bewilderment i imagined many things even to the extreme that he might have left us in the lurch but when i got to that sad pass of mind i suddenly awakened as if out of an evil dream my worry my hurry had obsessed me high time indeed was it for me to meet this situation as i had met other difficult ones to this end i went out away from camp and forgot myself my imagined possibilities and thought of my present responsibility and the issue at hand that instant i realized my injustice toward nielsen and reproached myself  upon my return to camp nielsen was there warming one hand over the campfire and holding a cup of coffee in the other  nielsen you gave us a scare please explain i said  yes sir last night i was worried i couldnt sleep i got to thinking we were practically lost some one ought to find out what was ahead of us so i got up and followed the road bright moonlight i walked all the rest of the night and thats all sir  i liked nielsens looks then he reminded me of jim emett the mormon giant to whom difficulties and obstacles were but spurs to achievement such men could not be defeated  well what did you find out i inquired  change of conditions sir he replied as a mate to his captain only one more steep hill so far as i went but well have to cut through thickets and logs from here on the road is all grown over about ten miles west we turn off the rim down a ridge  that about the turningoff place was indeed good news i thanked nielsen and doyle appeared immensely relieved the packing and carrying had begun to tell on us pups ingratiated himself into my affections he found out that he could coax meat and biscuit from me we had three axes and a hatchet and these we did not pack in the wagon when doyle finally got the teams started lee and nielsen and rc and i went ahead to clear the road soon we were halted by thickets of pines some of which were six inches in diameter at the base the road had ceased to be rocky and that no doubt was the reason pine thickets had grown up on it the wagon kept right at our heels and many times had to wait we cut a way through thickets tore rotten logs to pieces threw stumps aside and moved windfalls brawny nielsen seemed ten men in one what a swath he hacked with his big axe when i rested which circumstance grew oftener and oftener i had to watch nielsen with his magnificent swing of the axe or with his mighty heave on a log time and again he lifted tree trunks out of the road he sweat till he was wringing wet neither that day nor the next would we have ever gotten far along that stretch of thicketed and obstructed road had it not been for nielsen  at sunset we found ourselves at the summit of a long slowly ascending hill deeply forested it took all the horses together to pull the wagon to the top thus when we started down a steep curve horses and men both were tired i was ahead riding beside romer nielsen and rc were next and lee had fallen in behind the wagon as i turned the sharp curve i saw not fifty feet below me a huge log obstructing the road  look out stop i yelled looking back  but i was too late the horses could not hold back the heavily laden wagon and they broke into a gallop i saw doyles face turn whiteheard him yell then i spurred my horse to the side romer was slow or frightened i screamed at him to get off the road my heart sank sick within me surely he would be run down as his pony rye jumped out of the way the shoulder of the black horse on the off side struck him a glancing blow then the big team hurdled the log the tongue struck with a crash the wagon stopped with a lurch and doyle was thrown from his seat  quick as a flash nielsen was on the spot beside the team the bay horse was down the black horse was trying to break away nielsen cut and pulled the bay free of the harness and lee came tearing down to grasp and hold the black  like a fool i ran around trying to help somehow but i did not know what to do i smelled and then saw blood which fact convinced me of disaster only the black horse that had hurdled the log made any effort to tear away the other lay quiet when finally it was extricated we found that the horse had a bad cut in the breast made by a snag on the log we could find no damage done to the wagon the harness nielsen had cut could be mended quickly what a fortunate outcome to what had seemed a very grave accident i was thankful indeed but not soon would i forget sight of romer in front of that plunging wagon  with the horses and a rope we hauled the log to one side of the road and hitching up again we proceeded on our way once i dropped back and asked doyle if he was all right fine as a fiddle he shouted thiss play to what we teamsters had in the early days and verily somehow i could see the truth of that a mile farther on we made camp and all of us were hungry weary and quiet  doyle proved a remarkable example to us younger men next morning he crawled out before any one else and his call was cheery i was scarcely able to get out of my bed but i was ashamed to lie there an instant after i heard doyle possibly my eyesight was dulled by exhaustion when it caused me to see myself as a worn unshaven wrinkled wretch romerboy did not hop out with his usual alacrity rc had to roll over in his bed and get up on all fours  we had scant rations for three more days it behooved us to work and waste not an hour all morning at the pace of a snail it seemed we chopped and lifted and hauled our way along that old crook road not since my trip down the santa rosa river in mexico had i labored so strenuously  at noon we came to the turningoff junction an old blazed road doyle had some vague knowledge of it must lead to jones ranch doyle kept saying anyway weve got to take it north was our direction and to our surprise and exceeding gladness the road down this ridge proved to be a highway compared to what we had passed in the open forest we had to follow it altogether by the blazes on the trees but with all our eyes alert that was easy the grade was down hill so that we traveled fast covering four miles an hour occasionally a log or thicket halted rapid progress toward the end of the afternoon sheep and cattle trails joined the now welldefined road and we knew we were approaching a ranch i walked or rather limped the last mile for the very good reason that i could not longer bear the trot of my horse the forest grew more open with smaller pines and fewer thickets at sunset i came out upon the brow of a deep barrenlooking canyon in the middle of which squatted some old ruined logcabins deserted alas for my visions of a cup of cold milk for hours they had haunted me when doyle saw the brokendown cabins and corrals he yelled boys its jones ranch ive been here were only three miles from long valley and the main road  elated we certainly were and we rushed down the steep hill to look for water all our drinking water was gone and the horses had not slaked their thirst for two days separating we rode up and down the canyon rc and romer found running water thereupon with immense relief and joy we pitched camp near the cabins forgetting our aches and pains in the certainty of deliverance  what a cold dismal bleak stony and lonesome place we unpacked only bedding and our little store of food and huddled around the campfire we waited upon doyles cooking the old pioneer talked while he worked  jones ranchi knew jones in the early days and ive heard of him lately thirty years ago he rode a prairie schooner down into this canyon he had his wife a fine strong girl and he had a gun an axe some chuck a few horses and cattle and not much else he built him that cabin there and began the real old pioneering of the early days he raised cattle he freighted to the settlements twice a year in twentyfive years he had three strapping boys and a girl just as strapping and he had a fortune in cattle then he sold his stock and left this ranch he wanted to give his faithful wife and his children some of the comforts and luxuries and advantages of civilization the war came his sons did not wait for the draft they entered the army i heard a story about abe jones the old mans first boy abe was a quiet sort of chap when he got to the army training camp a sergeant asked abe if he could shoot abe said nope not much so they gave him a rifle and told him to shoot at the near target abe looked at it sort of funny like and he picked out the farthest target at one thousand yards and he hit the bulls eye ten times straight running hey gasped the sergeant you long lanky galoot you said you couldnt shoot abe sort of laughed reckon i was thinkin about what dad called shootin well abe and his brothers got to france to the front abe was a sharpshooter he was killed at argonne both his brothers were wounded theyre over there yet i met a man not long ago whod seen jones recently and the old pioneer said he and his wife would like to be back home and home to them means right herejones ranch  doyles story affected me profoundly what a theme for a novel i walked away from the campfire into the dark lonely melancholy arizona night the ruined cabins the brokendown corrals the stone fence the wash where water ran at wet seasonall had subtly changed for me leaning in the doorway of the oneroom cabin that had been home for these joneses i was stirred to my depths their spirits abided in that lonely hut at least i felt something theresomething strange great simple inevitable tragic as life itself yet what could have been more beautiful more splendid than the life of jones and his wife and daughter and sons especially abe abe jones the name haunted me in one clear divining flash i saw the life of the lad i yearned with tremendous passion for the power to tell the simplicity the ruggedness the pathos and the glory of his story the moan of wind in the pines seemed a requiem for the boy who had prattled and romped and played under them who had chopped and shot and rode under them into his manhood had gone something of their strength and nature  we sought our beds early the night down in that deep open canyon was the coldest we had experienced i slept but little at dawn all was hoarwhite with frost it crackled under foot the air had a stinging bite yet how sweet pure cold to breathe  doyles cheery come and get it was welcome call to breakfast lee and pups drove the horses into one of the old corrals in an hour while the frost was yet hard and white we were ready to start then doyle somewhat chilled our hopes twenty years ago there was a bad road out of here maybe ones been made since  but one had not been made and the old road had not been used for years right at the outset we struck a long steep winding rocky road we got stalled at the very foot of it more toil unloading the wagon we packed on our saddles the whole load more than a mile up this last and crowning obstacle then it took all the horses together to pull the empty wagon up to a level by that time sunset had overtaken us where had the hours gone nine hours to go one mile but there had to be an end to our agonies by twilight we trotted down into long valley and crossed the main road to camp in a grove we remembered well we partook of a meagre supper but we were happy and bed that night on a thick layer of soft pine needles in a spot protected from the cold wind was immensely comfortable  lee woke the crowd next morning all rustle he yelled thirtyfive miles to mormon lake good road well camp there tonight  how strange that the eagerness to get home now could only be compared to the wild desire for the woods a few weeks back we made an early start the team horses knew that road they knew they were now on the way home what difference that made jaded as they were they trotted along with a briskness never seen before on that trip it began to be a job for us to keep up with lee who was on the wagon unless a rider is accustomed to horseback almost all of the time a continuous trot on a hard road will soon stove him up my horse had an atrocious trot time and again i had to fall behind to a walk and then lope ahead to catch up i welcomed the hills that necessitated lee walking the teams  at noon we halted in a grassy grove for an hours rest that seemed a precious hour but to start again was painful i noticed that romerboy no longer rode out far in front nor did he chase squirrels with pups he sagged twisted and turned and lolled in his saddle thereafter i tried to keep close to him but that was not easy for he suspected me of seeing how tired he was and kept away from me thereafter i took to spying upon him from some distance behind we trotted and walked trotted and walked the long miles arizona miles were twice as long as ordinary properly measured miles an event of the afternoon was to meet some mexican sheepherders driving a flock south nielsen got some fresh mutton from them toward sunset i caught romer hanging over his saddle then i rode up to him son are you tired i asked oh dad i sure am but im going to ride rye to mormon lake i believed he would accomplish it his saddle slipped letting him down i saw him fall when he made no effort to get up i was frightened rye stood perfectly still over him i leaped off and ran to the lad he had hit his head on a stone drawing the blood and appeared to be stunned i lifted him holding him up while somebody got some water we bathed his face and washed off the blood presently he revived and smiled at me and staggered out of my hold  helluva note that saddle slipped he complained manifestly he had acquired some of joe isbels strong language possibly he might have acquired some other of the cowboys traits for he asked to have his saddle straightened and to be put on his horse i had misgivings but i could not resist him then i lifted him upon rye once more our cavalcade got under way  sunset twilight night came as we trotted on and on we faced a cold wind the forest was black gloomy full of shadows lee gave us all we could do to keep up with him at eight oclock two hours after dark we reached the southern end of mormon lake a gale cold as ice blew off the water from the north half a dozen huge pine trees stood on the only level ground near at hand nielsen firepronto i yelled aye sir he shouted in his deep voice then what with hurry and bustle to get my bedding and packs and to thresh my tingling fingers and press my frozen ears i was selfishly busy a few minutes before i thought of romer  nielsen had started a fire that blazed and roared with burning pine needles the blaze blew low almost on a level with the ground and a stream of red sparks flew off into the woods i was afraid of forest fire but what a welcome sight that golden flame it lighted up a wide space showing the huge pines gloomencircled and a pale glimmer of the lake beyond the fragrance of burning pine greeted my nostrils  dragging my bags i hurried toward the fire nielsen was building a barricade of rocks to block the flying sparks suddenly i espied romer he sat on a log close to the blaze his position struck me as singular so i dropped my burdens and went to him he had on a heavy coat over sweater and under coat which made him resemble a little old man his sombrero was slouched down sidewise his gloved hands were folded across his knees his body sagged a little to one side his head drooped he was asleep i got around so i could see his face in the firelight pale weary a little sad very youthful and yet determined a bloody bruise showed over his temple he had said he would ride all the way to mormon lake and he had done it never never will that picture fade from my memory dear brave wild little lad he had made for me a magnificent success of this fruitless hunting trip i hoped and prayed then that when he grew to mans estate and faced the long rides down the hard roads of life he would meet them and achieve them as he had the weary thirtyfive arizona miles from long valley to mormon lake  illustration skunk a frequent and rather dangerous visitor in camp  illustration on the rim  illustration where elk deer and turkey drink  mutton tasted good that night around our campfire and romer ate a generous portion a ranger from the station near there visited us and two young ranchers who told us that the influenza epidemic was waning this was news to be thankful for moreover i hired the two ranchers to hurry us by auto to flagstaff on the morrow so right there at mormon lake ended our privations  under one of the huge pines i scraped up a pile of needles made romers bed in it heated a blanket and wrapped him in it almost he was asleep when he said some ride dadgoodnight  later beside him i lay awake a while watching the sparks fly and the shadows flit feeling the cold wind on my face listening to the crackle of the fire and the roar of the gale   iv  eventually rc and romer and i arrived in los angeles to find all well with our people which fact was indeed something to rejoice over hardly had this 1918 trip ended before i began to plan for that of 1919 but i did not realize how much in earnest i was until i received word that both lee doyle in flagstaff and nielsen in san pedro were very ill with influenza lee all but died and nielsen afterward told me he would rather die than have the flu again to my great relief however they recovered  from that time then it pleased me to begin to plan for my 1919 hunting trip i can never do anything reasonably i always overdo everything but what happiness i derive from anticipation when i am not working i live in dreams partly of the past but mostly of the future a man should live only in the present  i gave lee instructions to go about in his own way buying teams saddle horses and wagons for christmas i sent him a 35 remington rifle mr haught got instructions to add some new dogs to his pack i sent edd also a 35 remington and made nielsen presents of two guns in january nielsen and i went to picacho on the lower colorado river and then north to death valley so that i kept in touch with these men and did not allow their enthusiasm to wane for myself and rc i had the fun of ordering tents and woolen blankets and everything that we did not have on our 1918 trip but owing to the war it was difficult to obtain goods of any description to make sure of getting a 30 govt winchester i ordered from four different firms including the winchester co none of them had such a rifle in stock but all would try to find one the upshot of this deal was that when after months i despaired of getting any they all sent me a rifle at the same time so i found myself with four all the same caliber of course but of different style and finish when i saw them and thought of the haughts i had to laugh one was beautifully engraved and inlaid with goldthe most elaborate 30 govt the winchester people had ever built another was a walnutstocked shotgun butted fancy checkered takedown this one i presented to rc the third was a plain ordinary rifle with solid frame and the last was a carbine model which i gave to nielsen  during the summer at avalon i used to take the solid frame rifle and climb the hills to practice on targets at clemente island i used to shoot at the ravens i had a grudge against ravens there for picking the eyes out of newly born lambs at five hundred yards a raven was in danger from me i could make one jump at even a thousand yards these 30 govt 1906 rifles with 150grain bullet are the most wonderful shooting arms i ever tried i became expert at inanimate targets  from time to time i heard encouraging news from lee about horses edd wrote me about lion tracks in the snow and lynx up cedar trees and gobblers four feet high and that there was sure to be a good crop of acorns and therefore some bears he told me about a big grizzly cowkiller being chased and shot in chevelon canyon news about hounds however was slow in coming dogs were difficult to find at length haught wrote me that he had secured two and in this same letter he said the boys were cutting trails down under the rim  everything pertaining to my cherished plans appeared to be turning out well but during this time i spent five months at hard work and intense emotional strain writing the longest novel i ever attempted and i overtaxed my endurance by the middle of june when i finished i was tired out that would not have mattered if i had not hurt my back in an elevenhour fight with a giant broadbill swordfish this strain kept me from getting in my usual physical trim i could not climb the hills or exert myself swimming hurt me more than anything so i had to be careful and wait until my back slowly got better by september it had improved but not enough to make me feel any thrills over horseback riding it seemed to me that i would be compelled to go ahead and actually work the pain out of my back an ordeal through which i had passed before and surely dreaded  during the summer i had purchased a famous chestnut sorrel horse named don carlos he was much in demand among the motionpicture companies doing western plays and was really too fine and splendid a horse to be put to the risks common to the movies i saw him first at palm springs down in southern california where my book desert gold was being made into a motionpicture don would not have failed to strike any one as being a wonderful horse he was tremendously high and rangy and powerful in build yet graceful withal a sleek shiny chestnut red in color with fine legs broad chest and a magnificent head i rode him only once before i bought him and that was before i hurt my back his stride was what one would expect from sight of him his trot seemed to tear me to pieces his spirit was such that he wanted to prance all the time but in spite of his spirit he was a pet and how he could run nielsen took don to flagstaff by express and when nielsen wrote me he said all of flagstaff came down to the station to see the famous don carlos the car in which he had traveled was backed alongside a platform don refused to step on the boards they placed from platform to car he did not trust them dons intelligence had been sharpened by his experience with the movies nielsen tried to lead to coax and to drive don to step on the board walk don would not go but suddenly he snorted and jumped the space clear to plunge and pound down upon the platform scattering the crowd like quail  the day before my departure from los angeles was almost as terrible an ordeal as i anticipated would be my first days ride on don carlos and this ordeal consisted of listening to romers passionate appeals and importunities to let him go on the hunt my only defence was that he must not be taken from school school forsooth he was way ahead of his class if he got behind he could make it up i talked and argued once he lost his temper a rare thing with him and said he would run away from school ride on a freight train to flagstaff steal a horse and track me to my camp i could not say very much in reply to this threat because i remembered that i had made worse to my father and carried it out i had to talk sense to romer often we had spoken of a wonderful hunt in africa some day when he was old enough and i happened upon a good argument i said youll miss a year out of school then it wont be so very long dont you think you ought to stay in school faithfully now so in the end i got away from him victorious though not wholly happy the truth was i wanted him to go  my jap cook takahashi met me in flagstaff he was a very short very broad very muscular little fellow with a brown strong face more pleasant than usually seen in orientals secretly i had made sure that in takahashi i had discovered a treasure but i was careful to conceal this conviction from rc the doyles and nielsen they were glad to see him with us but they manifestly did not expect wonders  how brief the span of a year here i was in flagstaff again outfitting for another hunt it seemed incredible it revived that old haunting thought about the shortness of life but in spite of that or perhaps more because of it the pleasure was all the keener in truth the only drawback to this start was the absence of romer and my poor physical condition rc appeared to be in fine fettle  but i was not well in the mornings i could scarcely arise and when i did so i could hardly straighten myself more than once i grew doubtful of my strength to undertake such a hard trip this doubt i fought fiercely for i knew that the right thing for me to do was to goto stand the pain and hardshipto toil along until my old strength and elasticity returned what an opportunity to try out my favorite theory for i believed that labor and pain were good for mankindthat strenuous life in the open would cure any bodily ill  on september fourteenth edd and george drifted into flagstaff to join us and their report of game and water and grass and acorns was so favorable that i would have gone if i had been unable to ride on anything but a wagon   we got away on september fifteenth at twothirty oclock with such an outfit as i had never had in all my many trips put together we had a string of saddle horses besides those the men rode they were surely a spirited bunch and that first day it was indeed a job to keep them with us out of sheer defiance with myself i started on don carlos he was no trouble except that it took all my strength to hold him in he tossed his head champed his bit and pranced sideways along the streets of flagstaff manifestly to show off his brand new black mexican saddle with silver trappings and tapaderos i was sure that he did not do that to show me off but don liked to dance and prance along before a crowd a habit that he had acquired with the motion pictures  lee and nielsen and george had their difficulties driving the free horses takahashi rode a little buckskin navajo mustang an evidence of how extremely short the japs legs were made itself plain in the fact that stirrups could not be fixed so he could reach them with his feet when he used any support at all he stuck his feet through the straps above the stirrups how funny his squat broad figure looked in a saddle evidently he was not accustomed to horses when i saw the mustang roll the white of his eyes and glance back at takahashi then i knew something would happen sooner or later  nineteen miles on don carlos reduced me to a miserable aching specimen of manhood but what made me endure and go on and finish to camp was the strange fact that the longer i rode the less my back pained other parts of my anatomy however grew sorer as we progressed don carlos pleased me immensely only i feared he was too much horse for me a mormon friend of mine an indian trader looked don over in flagstaff and pronounced him shore one grand hoss this man had broken many wild horses and his compliment pleased me all the same the nineteen miles on don hurt my vanity almost as much as my body  we camped in a cedar pasture off the main road this road was a new one for us to take to our hunting grounds i was too bunged up to help nielsen pitch our tent in fact when i sat down i was anchored still i could use my eyes and that made life worth living sunset was a gorgeous spectacle the san francisco peaks were shrouded in purple stormclouds and the west was all gold and silver with low clouds rimmed in red this sunset ended in a great flare of dull magenta with a background of purple  that evening was the tryout of our new chuckbox and chef i had supplied the men with their own outfit and supplies to do with as they liked an arrangement i found to be most satisfactory takahashi was to take care of rc and me in less than half an hour from the time the jap lighted a fire he served the best supper i ever had in camp anywhere rc lauded him to the skies and i began to think i could unburden myself of my conviction  i did not awaken to the old zest and thrill of the open something was wrong with me the sunset the campfire the dark clear night with its trains of stars the distant yelp of coyotesthese seemed less to me than what i had hoped for my feelings were locked round my discomfort and pain  about noon next day we rode out of the cedars into the open deserta rolling level land covered with fine grass and yellow daisies indian paint brush and a golden flowering weed this luxuriance attested to the copious and recent rains they had been a boon to dry arizona no sage showed or greasewood and very few rocks the sun burned hot i gazed out at the desert and the cloud pageant in the sky trying hard to forget myself and to see what i knew was there for me rolling columnar white and cream clouds majestic and beautiful formed storms off on the horizon sunset on the open desert that afternoon was singularly characteristic of arizonapurple and gold and red with long lanes of blue between the colored cloud banks  we made camp at meteor crater one of the many wonders of this wonderland it was a huge hole in the earth over five hundred feet deep said to have been made by a meteor burying itself there seen from the outside the slope was gradual up to the edges which were scalloped and irregular on the inside the walls were precipitous our camp was on the windy desert a long sweeping range of grass sloping down dotted with cattle with buttes and mountains in the distance most of my sensations of the day partook of the nature of woe  september seventeenth bade fair to be my worst dayat least i did not see how any other could ever be so bad glaring hot sunreflected heat from i the bare roaddust and sand and wind particularly hard on me were what the arizonians called dustdevils whirlwinds of sand on and off i walked a good many miles the latter of which i hobbled don carlos did not know what to make of this he eyed me and nosed me and tossed his head as if to say i was a strange rider for him like my mustang night he would not stand to be mounted when i touched the stirrup that was a signal to go he had been trained to it as he was nearly seventeen hands high and as i could not get my foot in the stirrup from level ground to mount him in my condition seemed little less than terrible i always held back out of sight when i attempted this many times i failed once i fell flat and lay a moment in the dust don carlos looked down upon me in a way i imagined was sympathetic at least he bent his noble head and smelled at me i scrambled to my feet led him round into a low place and drawing a deep breath and nerving myself to endure the pain like a stab i got into the saddle again  two things sustained me in this ordeal which was the crudest horseback ride i ever hadfirst the conviction that i could cure my ills by enduring the agony of violent action of hot sun of hard bed and secondly the knowledge that after it was all over the remembrance of hardship and achievement would be singularly sweet so it had been in the case of the five days on the old crook road in 1918 when extreme worry and tremendous exertion had made the hours hideous so it had been with other arduous and poignant experiences a poet said that the crown of sorrow was in remembering happier times i believed that there was a great deal of happiness in remembering times of stress of despair of extreme and hazardous effort anyway without these two feelings in my mind i would have given up riding don carlos that day and have abandoned the trip  we covered twentytwo miles by sundown a rather poor days showing and camped on the bare flat desert using water and wood we had packed with us the last thing i remembered as my eyes closed heavily was what a blessing it was to rest and to sleep  next day we sheered off to the southward heading toward chevelon butte a black cedared mountain rising lone out of the desert thirty miles away we crossed two streams bank full of water a circumstance i never before saw in arizona everywhere too the grass was high we climbed gradually all day everybody sunburned and weary the horses settling down to save themselves and we camped high up on the desert plateau six thousand feet above sea level where it was windy cool and fragrant with sage and cedar except the first few the hours of this day each marked a little less torture for me but at that i fell off don carlos when we halted and i was not able to do my share of the camp work rc was not as spry and chipper as i had seen him a fact from which i gathered infinite consolation misery loves company  a storm threatened all the west was purple under oncoming purple clouds at sight of this something strange and subtle yet familiar revived in me it made me feel a little more like the self i thought i knew so i watched the lightning flare and string along the horizon some time in the night thunder awakened me the imminence of a severe storm forced us to roll out and look after the tent what a pitch black night down through the murky weird blackness shot a wonderful zigzag rope of lightning bluewhite dazzling and it disintegrated leaving segments of fire in the air all this showed in a swift flashthen we were absolutely blind i could not see for several moments it rained a little only the edge of the storm touched us thunder rolled and boomed along the battlements deep and rumbling and detonating  no dust or heat next morning the desert floor appeared clean and damp with fresh gray sage and shining bunches of cedar we climbed into the high cedars and then to the piñons and then to the junipers and pines climbing so out of desert to forestland was a gradual and accumulating joy to me what contrast in vegetation in air in color still the forest consisted of small trees not until next day did we climb farther to the deepening darkening forest and at last to the silver spruce that camp the fifth night out was beside a lake of surface water where we had our first big campfire  september twentyfirst and ten miles from beaver dam canyon where a year before i had planned to meet haught this day and date at noon i could make that appointment saddlesore and weary as i was but i doubted we could get the wagons there the forest ground was soft all the little swales were full of water how pleasant how welcome how beautiful and lonely the wild forestland we made advance slowly it was afternoon by the time we reached the rim road and four oclock when we halted at the exact spot where we had left our wagon the year before  lee determined to drive the wagons down over the rocky benches into beaver dam canyon and to that end he and the men began to cut pines drag logs and roll stones  rc and i rode down through the forest crossing half a dozen swift little streams of amber water where a year before all had been dry as tinder we found haughts camp in a grove of yellowing aspens haught was there to meet us he had not changed any more than the rugged pine tree under which a year past we had made our agreement he wore the same blue shirt and the old black sombrero  hello haught was my greeting as i dismounted and pulled out my watch im four hours and a quarter late sorry i could have made it but didnt want to leave the wagons  wal wal i shore am glad to see you he replied with a keen flash in his hazel eyes and a smile on his craggy face i reckoned youd make it how are you look sort of fagged  just about all in haught i replied as we shook hands  then copple appeared swaggering out of the aspens he was the man i met in payson and who so kindly had made me take his rifle i had engaged him also for this hunt a brawny man he was with powerful shoulders swarthyskinned and darkeyed looking indeed the indian blood he claimed  wouldnt have recognized you anywheres else he said  these keeneyed outdoor men at a glance saw the havoc work and pain had played with me they were solicitous and when i explained my condition they made light of that and showed relief that i was not ill saw wood an rustle around said haught and copple said he needs venison an bear meat  they rode back with us up to the wagons copple had been a freighter he picked out a way to drive down into the canyon so rough and steep it was that i did not believe driving down would be possible but with axes and pick and shovel and a heaving of rocks they worked a road that lee drove down some places were almost straight down but the ground was soft hoofs and wheels sank deeply and though one wagon lurched almost over and the heavily laden chuckwagon almost hurdled the team lee made the bad places without accident two hours after our arrival such was the labor of many strong hands we reached our old camp ground one thing was certain however and that was we would never get back up the way we came down  except for a luxuriance of grass and ferns and two babbling streams of water our old camp ground had not changed i sat down with mingled emotions how familiarly beautiful and lonely this canyon glade the great pines and spruces looked down upon me with a benediction how serene passionless strong they seemed it was only men who changed in brief time the long year of worry and dread and toil and pain had passed it was nothing on the soft fragrant pinescented breeze came a whispering of welcome from the forestland you are here again live nowin the present  takahashi beamed upon me more better place to camp he said grinning already the jap had won my admiration and liking his ability excited my interest and i wanted to know more about him as to this campsite being a joy compared to the ones stretched back along the road he was assuredly right that night we did no more than eat and unroll our beds but next day there set in the pleasant tasks of unpacking putting up tents and flies cutting spruce for thick soft beds and a hundred odd jobs dear to every camper takahashi would not have any one help him he dug a wide space for fires erected a stone windbreak and made two ovens out of baked mud the like of which and the cleverness of which i had never seen he was a whirlwind for work  the matter of firewood always concerned nielsen and me more than any one nielsen was a norwegian raised as a boy to use a crosscut saw and as for me i was a connoisseur in campfires and a lover of them hence we had brought a crosscut sawa long one with two handles i remembered from the former year a huge dead pine that had towered bleached and white at the edge of the glade it stood there still the storms and blasts of another winter had not changed it in the least it was five feet thick at the base and solid nielsen chopped a notch in it on the lower side and then he and edd began to saw into it on the other i saw the first tremor of the lofty top then soon it shivered all the way down gave forth a loud crack swayed slowly and fell majestically to strike with a thundering crash only the top of this pine broke in the fall but there were splinters and knots and branches enough to fill a wagon these we carried up to our campfire  then the boys sawed off half a dozen fourfoot sections which served as fine solid flat tables for comfort around camp the method of using a crosscut saw was for two men to take a stand opposite one another with the log between the handles of the saw stood upright each man should pull easily and steadily toward himself but should not push back nor bear down it looked a rhythmic manly exercise and not arduous but what an illusion nielsen and copple were the only ones that day who could saw wholly through the thick log without resting later takahashi turned out to be as good if not better than either of them but we had that as well as many other wonderful facts to learn about the jap  come on said rc to me invitingly youve been talking about this crosscut saw game ill bet you find it harder than pulling on a swordfish  pride goes before a fall i knew that in my condition i could do little with the saw but i had to try rc was still fresh when i had to rest perhaps no one except myself realized the weakness of my back but the truth was a couple of dozen pulls on that saw almost made me collapse wherefore i grew furious with myself and swore i would do it or die i sawed till i fell overthen i rested and went back at it half an hour of this kind of exercise gave me a stab in my left side infinitely sharper than the pain in my back also it made me wringing wet hot as fire and as breathless as if i had run a mile up hill that experience determined me to stick to crosscut sawing every day next morning i approached it with enthusiasm yet with misgivings i could not keep my breath pain i could and did bear without letting on but to have to stop was humiliating if i tried to keep up with the sturdy haught boys or with the brawny copple or the giant nielsen soon i would be compelled to keel over in the sawing through a fourfoot section of log i had to rest eight times they all had a great deal of fun out of it and i pretended to be good natured but to me who had always been so vigorous and active and enduring it was not fun it was tragic but all was not gloom for me this very afternoon nielsen the giant showed that a stiff climb out of the canyon at that eight thousand feet altitude completely floored him yet i accomplished that with comparative ease i could climb which seemed proof that i was gaining a man becomes used to certain labors and exercises i thought the crosscut saw a wonderful tool to train a man but it must require time it harked back to pioneer days when men were men nielsen said he had lived among mexican boys who sawed logs for nineteen cents apiece and earned seven dollars a day copple said three minutes was good time to saw a fourfoot log in two pieces so much for physical condition as for firewood for which our crosscut saw was intended pitch pine and yellow pine and spruce were all odorous and inflammable woods but they did not make good firewood dead aspen was good dead oak the best it burned to red hot coals with little smoke as for campfires any kind of dry wood pleased smoke or no smoke in fact i loved the smell and color of woodsmoke in spite of the fact that it made my eyes smart  by october first which was the opening day of the hunting season i had labored at various exercises until i felt fit to pack a rifle through the woods rc and i went out alone on foot not by any means was the day auspicious the sun tried to show through a steely haze making only a pale shift of sunshine and the air was rather chilly enthusiasm however knew no deterrents we walked a mile down beaver dam canyon then climbed the western slope as long as the sun shone i knew the country fairly well or rather my direction we slipped along through the silent woods satisfied with everything presently the sun broke through the clouds and shone fitfully making intervals of shadow and others of goldengreen verdure  along an edge of one of the grassy parks we came across fresh deer tracks several deer had run out of the woods just ahead of us evidently having winded us one track was that of a big buck we trailed these tracks across the park then made a detour in hopes of heading the deer off but failed a huge dark cloud scudded out of the west and let down a shower of fine rain we kept dry under a spreading spruce the forest then was gloomy and cool with only a faint moan of wind and pattering of raindrops to break the silence the cloud passed by the sun shone again the forest glittered in its dress of diamonds there had been but little frost so that aspen and maple thickets had not yet taken on their cloth of gold and blaze of red most of the leaves were still on the trees making these thickets impossible to see into we hunted along the edges of these and across the wide open ridge from canyon to canyon and saw nothing but old tracks black and white clouds rolled up and brought a squall we took to another spruce tent for shelter after this squall the sky became obscured by a field of gray cloud through which the sun shone dimly this matter worried me i was aware of my direction then but if i lost the sun i would soon be in difficulties  gradually we worked back along the ridge toward camp and headed several ravines that ran and widened down into the big canyon all at once rc held up a warning finger listen with abatement of breath i listened but heard nothing except the mournful sough of the pines thought i heard a whistle he said we went on all eyes and ears  rc and i flattered ourselves that together we made rather a good hunting team we were fairly well versed in woodcraft and could slip along stealthily i possessed an indian sense of direction that had never yet failed me to be sure we had much to learn about deer stalking but i had never hunted with any man whose ears were as quick as rcs a naturally keen hearing and many years of still hunting accounted for this faculty as for myself the one gift of which i was especially proud was my eyesight almost invariably i could see game in the woods before any one who was with me this had applied to all my guides except indians and i believed that five summers on the pacific searching the wide expanse of ocean for swordfish fins had made my eyes all the keener for the woods rc and i played at a game in which he tried to hear the movement of some forest denizen before i saw it this fun for us dated back to boyhood days  suddenly rc stopped short with his head turning to one side and his body stiffening i heard that whistle again he said we stood perfectly motionless for a long moment then from far off in the forest i heard a high clear melodious bugling note how thrilling how lonely a sound  its a bullelk i replied then we sat down upon a log and listened rc had heard that whistle in colorado but had not recognized it just as the mournful howl of a wolf is the wildest most haunting sound of the wilderness so is the bugle of the elk the noblest most melodious and thrilling with tingling nerves and strained ears we listened we heard elk bugling in different directions hard to locate one bull appeared to be low down another high up another working away rc and i decided to stalk them the law prohibited the killing of elk but that was no reason why we might not trail them and have the sport of seeing them in their native haunts so we stole softly through the woods halting now and then to listen pleased to note that every whistle we heard appeared to be closer  at last apparently only a deep thicketed ravine separated us from the ridge upon which the elk were bugling here our stalk began to become really exciting we did not make any noise threading that wet thicket and we ascended the opposite slope very cautiously what little wind there was blew from the elk toward us so they could not scent us once up on the edge of the ridge we halted to listen after a long time we heard a faraway bugle then another at least half a mile distant had we miscalculated rc was for working down the ridge and i was for waiting there a few moments so we sat down again the forest was almost silent now somewhere a squirrel was barking the sun peeped out of the pale clouds lighted the glades rimmed the pines in brightness i opened my lips to speak to rc when i was rendered mute by a piercing whistle highpitched and sweet and melodiously prolonged it made my ears tingle and my blood dance right close whispered rc come on we began to steal through the forest keeping behind trees and thickets peeping out and making no more sound than shadows the ground was damp facilitating our noiseless stalk in this way we became separated by about thirty steps but we walked on and halted in unison passing through a thicket of little pines we came into an open forest full of glades keenly i peered everywhere as i slipped from tree to tree finally we stooped along for a space and then at a bugle blast so close that it made me jump i began to crawl my objective point was a fallen pine the trunk of which appeared high enough to conceal me rc kept working a little farther to the right once he beckoned me but i kept on still i saw him drop down to crawl our stalk was getting toward its climax my state was one of quivering intensity of thrill of excitement of pleasure reaching my log i peeped over it i saw a cowelk and a yearling calf trotting across a glade about a hundred yards distant wanting rc to see them i looked his way and pointed but he was pointing also and vehemently beckoning for me to join him i ran on all fours over to where he knelt he whispered pantingly grandest sightever saw i peeped out  in a glade not seventyfive yards away stood a magnificent bull elk looking back over his shoulder his tawny hindquarters then his dark brown almost black shaggy shoulders and head then his enormous spread of antlers like the top of a dead cedarthese in turn fascinated my gaze how graceful stately lordly  rc stepped out from behind the pine in full view i crawled out took a kneeling position and drew a bead on the elk i had the fun of imagining i could have hit him anywhere i did not really want to kill him yet what was the meaning of the sharp hot gush of my blood the fiery thrill along my nerves the feeling of unsatisfied wildness the bull eyed us for a second then laid his forest of antlers back over his shoulders and with singularly swift level stride sped like a tawny flash into the green forest  rc and i began to chatter like boys and to walk toward the glade without any particular object in mind when my roving eye caught sight of a moving brown and checkered patch low down on the ground vanishing behind a thicket i called rc and ran i got to where i could see beyond the thicket an immense flock of turkeys i yelled as i tried to get a bead on a running turkey rc joined me chase em he yelled so we dashed through the forest with the turkeys running ahead of us never did they come out clear in the open i halted to shoot but just as i was about to press the trigger my moving target vanished this happened again no use to shoot at random i had a third fleeting chance but absolutely could not grasp it then the big flock of turkeys eluded us in an impenetrable brushy ravine  by george exclaimed rc can you beat that they run like streaks i couldnt aim these wild turkeys are great  i echoed his sentiments we prowled around for an hour trying to locate this flock again but all in vain well said rc finally as he wiped his perspiring face its good to see some game anyhow where are we  it developed that our whereabouts was a mystery to me the sun had become completely obliterated a fine rain was falling the forest had grown wet and dismal we had gotten turned around the matter did not look serious however until we had wandered around for another hour without finding anything familiar then we realized we were lost this sort of experience had happened to rc and me often nevertheless we did not relish it especially the first day out as usual on such occasions rc argued with me about direction and then left the responsibility with me i found an open spot somewhat sheltered on one side from the misty rain and there i stationed myself to study trees and sky and clouds for some clue to help me decide what was north or west after a while i had the good fortune to see a momentary brightening through the clouds i located the sun and was pleased to discover that the instinct of direction i had been subtly prompted to take would have helped me as much as the sun  we faced east and walked fast and i took note of trees ahead so that we should not get off a straight line at last we came to a deep canyon in the gray misty rain i could not be sure i recognized it well rc i said this may be our canyon and it may not but to make sure well follow it up to the rim then we can locate camp rc replied with weary disdain all right my redskin brother lead me to camp as loren says im starved to death loren is my threeyearold boy who bids fair to be like his brother romer he has an enormous appetite and before meal times he complains bitterly im starvved to death how strange to remember him while i was lost in the forest  when we had descended into the canyon rain was falling more heavily we were in for it but i determined we would not be kept out all night so i struck forward with long stride  in half an hour we came to where the canyon forked i deliberated a moment not one familiar landmark could i descry from which fact i decided we had better take to the lefthand fork grass and leaves appeared almost as wet as running water soon we were soaked to the skin after two miles the canyon narrowed and thickened so that traveling grew more and more laborsome it must have been four miles from its mouth to where it headed up near the rim once out of it we found ourselves on familiar ground about five miles from camp exhausted and wet and nearly frozen we reached camp just before dark if i had taken the righthand fork of the canyon which was really beaver dam canyon we would have gotten back to camp in short order rc said to the boys well doc dragged me nine miles out of our way everybody but the jap enjoyed my discomfiture takahashi said in his imperfect english go get on more better dry clothes soon hot supper maybe good yes   v  it rained the following day making a good excuse to stay in camp and rest beside the little tentstove and the next morning i started out on foot with copple we went down beaver dam canyon intending to go up on the ridge where rc and i had seen the flock of turkeys  i considered copple an addition to my long list of outdoor acquaintances in the west and believed him a worthy partner for nielsen copple was born near oak creek some twenty miles south of flagstaff and was onefourth indian he had a good education his whole life had been in the open which fact i did not need to be told a cowboy when only a boy he had also been sheepherder miner freighter and everything arizonian eighteen years he had hunted game and prospected for gold in mexico he had been a sailor and fireman on the pacific he had served in the army in the philippines altogether his had been an adventurous life and as doyle had been a mine of memories for me so would copple be a mine of information such men have taught me the wonder the violence the truth of the west  copple was inclined to be loquaciousa trait that ordinarily was rather distasteful to me but in his case would be an advantage on our way down the canyon not only did he give me an outline of the history of his life but he talked about how he had foretold the storm just ended the fresh diggings of gopherslittle mounds of dirt thrown uphad indicated the approach of the storm so had the hooting of owls likewise the twittering of snowbirds at that season also the feeding of blackbirds near horses particularly a wind from the south meant storm from that he passed to a discussion of deer during the light of the moon deer feed at night and in the day time they will lie in a thicket if a hunter came near the deer would lower their horns flat and remain motionless unless almost ridden over in the dark of the moon deer feed at early morning lie down during the day and feed again toward sunset always alert trusting to nose more than eyes and ears  copple was so interesting that i must have passed the place where rc and i had come down into the canyon at any rate i missed it and we went on farther copple showed me old bear sign an old wolf track and then fresh turkey tracks the latter reminded me that we were out hunting i could carry a deadly rifle in my hands yet dream dreams of flowerdecked elysian fields we climbed a wooded bench or low step of the canyon slope and though copple and i were side by side i saw two turkeys before he did they were running swiftly up hill i took a snap shot at the lower one but missed my bullet struck low upsetting him both of them disappeared  then we climbed to the top of the ridge and in scouting around along the heavily timbered edges we came to a ravine deep enough to be classed as a canyon here the forest was dark and still with sunlight showing down in rays and gleams while hunting i always liked to sit down here and there to listen and watch copple liked this too so we sat down opposite us the rocky edge of the other slope was about two hundred yards we listened to jays and squirrels i made note of the significant fact that as soon as we began to hunt copple became silent  presently my roving eye caught sight of a moving object it is movement that always attracts my eye in the woods i saw a plump woolly beast walk out upon the edge of the opposite slope and stand in the shade  copple is that a sheep i whispered pointing lionno big lynx he replied i aimed and shot just a little too swiftly judging by the puff of dust my bullet barely missed the big cat he leaped fully fifteen feet copple fired hitting right under his nose as he alighted that whirled him back he bounced like a rubber ball my second shot went over him and copples hit between his legs then with another prodigious bound he disappeared in a thicket by golly we missed him declared copple but you must have shaved him that first time biggest lynx i ever saw  we crossed the canyon and hunted for him but without success then we climbed an open grassy forest slope up to a level ridge and crossed that to see down into a beautiful valley with stately isolated pines and patches of aspens and floor of luxuriant grass a ravine led down into this long park and the mouth of it held a thicket of small pines just as we got half way out i saw bobbing black objects above the high grass i peered sharply these objects were turkey heads i got a shot before copple saw them there was a bouncing a whirring a thumpingand then turkeys appeared to be running every way  copple fired turkey number one he called out i missed a big gobbler on the run copple shot again turkey number two he called out i could not see what he had done but of course i knew he had done execution it roused my ire as well as a desperate ambition turkeys were running up hill everywhere i aimed at this one then at that again i fired another miss how that gobbler ran he might just as well have flown every turkey contrived to get a tree or bush between him and me just at the critical instant in despair i tried to hold on the last one got a bead on it through my peep sight moved it with him as we moved and holding tight i fired with a great flop and scattering of bronze feathers he went down i ran up the slope and secured him a fine gobbler of about fifteen pounds weight  upon my return to copple i found he had collected his two turkeys both shot in the neck in the same place he said if you hit them in the body you spoil them for cooking i used to hit all mine in the head let me give you a hunch always pick out a turkey running straight away from you or straight toward you never crossways you cant hit them running to the side  then he bluntly complimented me upon my eyesight that at least was consolation for my poor shooting we rested there and after a while heard a turkey cluck copple had no turkeycaller but he clucked anyhow we heard answers the flock evidently was trying to get together again and some of them were approaching us copple continued to call then i appreciated how fascinating rc had found this calling game copple got answers from all around growing closer but presently the answers ceased theyre on to me he whispered and did not call again at that moment a young gobbler ran swiftly down the slope and stopped to peer around his long neck stretching it was not a very long shot and i scorning to do less than copple tried to emulate him and aimed at the neck of the gobbler all i got however was a few feathers like a grouse he flew across the opening and was gone we lingered there a while hoping to see or hear more of the flock but did neither copple tried to teach me how to tell the age of turkeys from their feet a lesson i did not think i would assimilate in one hunting season he tied their legs together and hung them over his shoulder a net weight of about fifty pounds  all the way up that valley we saw elk tracks and once from over the ridge i heard a bugle on our return toward camp we followed a rather meandering course over ridge and down dale and through grassy parks and stately forests and along the slowly coloring mapleaspen thickets copple claimed to hear deer running but i did not many tired footsteps i dragged along before we finally reached beaver dam canyon how welcome the sight of camp rc had ridden miles with edd and had seen one deer that they said was still enjoying his freedom in the woods takahashi hailed sight of the turkeys with that fine that fine nice fat ones  but tired as i was that night i still had enthusiasm enough to visit haughts camp and renew acquaintance with the hounds haught had not been able to secure more than two new hounds and these named rock and buck were still unknown quantities  old dan remembered me and my heart warmed to the old gladiator he was a very big largeboned hound gray with age and wrinkled and lame and blearyeyed dan was too old to be put on trails or at least to be made chase bear he loved a campfire and would almost sit in the flames this fact and the way he would beg for a morsel to eat had endeared him to me  old tom was somewhat smaller and leaner than dan yet resembled him enough to deceive us at times tom was gray too and had crinkly ears and many other honorable battlescars tom was not quite so friendly as dan in fact he had more dignity still neither hound was ever demonstrative except upon sight of his master haught told me that if dan and tom saw him shoot at a deer they would chase it till they dropped accordingly he never shot at anything except bear and lion when he had these hounds with him  sue was the best hound in the pack as she still had in spite of years of service a good deal of speed and fight left in her she was a slim dark brown hound with fine and very long ears rock one of the new hounds from kentucky was white and black and had remarkably large clear and beautiful eyes almost human in expression i could not account for the fact that i suspected rock was a deer chaser buck the other hound from kentucky was no longer young he had a stump tail his color was a little yellow with dark spots and he had a hangdog head and distrustful eye i made certain that buck had never had any friends for he did not understand kindness nor had he ever had enough to eat he stayed away from the rest of the pack and growled fiercely when a pup came near him i tried to make friends with him but found that i would not have an easy task  kaiser bill was one of the pups black in color a long lean hungrylooking dog and crazy he had not grown any in a year either in body or intelligence i remembered how he would yelp just to hear himself and run any kind of a trailhow he would be the first to quit and come back and if any one fired a gun near him he would run like a scared deer  to be fair to kaiser bill the other pups were not much better trailer and big foot were young still and about all they could do was to run and howl  if however they got off right on a bear trail and no other trail crossed it they would stick and in fact lead the pack till the bear got away once big foot came whimpering into camp with porcupine quills in his nose of all the whipped and funny pups  bobby was the dog i liked best he was a curly black halfshepherd small in size and he had a sharp intelligent face with the brightest hazel eyes his manner of wagging his tail seemed most comical yet convincing bobby wagged only the nether end and that most emphatically he would stand up to me holding out his forepaws and beg what an appealing beggar he was bobbys value to haught was not inconsiderable he was the only dog haught ever had that would herd the pigs on a bear hunt bobby lost his shepherd ways and his kindly disposition and yelped fiercely and hung on a trail as long as any of the pack he had no fear of a bear for which reason haught did not like to run him  all told then we had a rather nondescript and poor pack of hounds and the fact discouraged me i wanted to hunt the bad cinnamons and the grizzly sheepkillers with which this rimrock country was infested i had nothing against the acorneating brown or black bears and with this pack of hounds i doubted that we could hold one of the vicious fighting species but there was now nothing to do but try no one could tell we might kill a big grizzly and the fact that the chances were against us perhaps made for more determined effort i regretted however that i had not secured a pack of trained hounds somewhere  frost was late this fall the acorns had hardly ripened the leaves had scarcely colored and really good bear hunting seemed weeks off a storm and then a cold snap would help matters wonderfully and for these we hoped indeed the weather had not settled hardly a day had been free of clouds but despite conditions we decided to start in bear hunting every other day feeling that at least we could train the pack and get them and ourselves in better shape for a favorable time when it arrived  accordingly next day we sallied forth for horton thicket and i went down with edd and george it was a fine day sunny and windy at intervals the new trail the boys had made was boggy from above horton thicket looked dark green verdant with scarcely any touch of autumn colors from below once in it all seemed a darker green cool and damp water lay in all low places the creek roared bankfull of clear water  the new trail led up and down over dark red rich earth through thickets of jackpine and maple and then across long slopes of manzanita and juniper mescal and oak junipers were not fruitful this year as they were last only a few having clusters of lavendercolored berries the manzanita brush appeared exceptionally beautiful with its vivid contrasts of crimson and green leaves orangecolored berries and smooth shiny bark of a chocolate red the mescal consisted of round patches of cactus with spearshaped leaves low on the ground with a long dead stalk standing or broken down this stalk grows fresh every spring when it is laden with beautiful yellow blossoms the honey from the flowers of mescal and mesquite is the best to be obtained in this country of innumerable bees  presently the hounds opened up on some kind of a trail and they worked on it around under the ledges toward the next canyon called see canyon after a while the country grew so rough that fast riding was impossible the thickets tore and clutched at us until they finally stopped the horses we got off edd climbed to a ridgetop pack gone way round he called ill walk take my horse back i decided to let george take my horse also and i hurried to catch up with edd  following that longlegged arizonian on foot was almost as strenuous as keeping him in sight on horseback i managed it we climbed steep slopes and the farther we climbed the thicker grew the brush often we would halt to listen for hounds at which welcome intervals i endeavored to catch my breath we kept the hounds in hearing which fact incited us to renewed endeavors at length we got into a belt of liveoak and scrubpine brush almost as difficult to penetrate as manzanita and here we had to bend and crawl bear and deer tracks led everywhere small stones and large stones had been lifted and displaced by bears searching for grubs these slopes were dry we found no water at the heads of ravines yet the red earth was rich in bearded tufted grass yellow daisies and purple asters and a wan blue flower we climbed and climbed until my back began to give me trouble reckon webit offa big hunk remarked edd once and i thought he referred to the endless steep and brushy slopes by and bye the hounds came back to us one by one all footsore and weary manifestly the bear had outrun them our best prospect then was to climb on to the rim and strike across the forest to camp  i noticed that tired as i was i had less trouble to keep up with edd his boots wore very slippery on grass and pineneedles so that he might have been trying to climb on ice i had nails in my boots and they caught hold hotter and wetter i grew until i had a burning sensation all over my legs and arms ached the rifle weighed a ton my feet seemed to take hold of the ground and stick we could not go straight up owing to the nature of that jumble of broken cliffs and matted scrub forests for hours we toiled onward upward downward and then upward only through such experience could i have gained an adequate knowledge of the roughness and vastness of this rimrock country  at last we arrived at the base of the gray leaning crags and there on a long slide of weathered rock the hounds jumped a bear i saw the dust he raised as he piled into the thicket below the slide what a wild clamor from the hounds we got out on the rocky slope where we could see and kept sharp eyes roving but the bear went straight down hill amazing indeed was it the way the hounds drew away from us in a few moments they were at the foot of the slopes tearing back over the course we had been so many hours in coming then we set out to get on the rim so as to follow along it and keep track of the chase edd distanced me on the rocks i had to stop often my breast labored and i could scarcely breathe i sweat so freely that my rifle stock was wet my hardest battle was in fighting a tendency to utter weariness and disgust my old poignant feelings about my physical condition returned to vex me as a matter of fact i had already that very day accomplished a climb not at all easy for the arizonian and i should have been happy but i had not been used to a lame back when i reached the rim i fell there and lay there a few moments until i could get up then i followed along after edd whose yells to the hounds i heard and overtook him upon the point of a promontory far below the hounds were baying theyre chasin him all right declared edd grimly hes headin for low country i think sue stopped him once but the rest of the pack are behind  i had never been on the point of this promontory grand indeed was the panorama under me yawned a darkgreen smokycanyoned rippling basin of timber and red rocks leading away to the mountain ranges of the four peaks and mazatzals westward toward the yellowing sunset stood out long escarpments for miles and long sloping lines of black ridges leading down to the basin where there seemed to be a ripple of the earth a vast upset region of canyon and ridge wild and lonely and dark  i did not get to see the sunset from that wonderful point a matter i regretted we were far from camp and edd was not sure of a beeline during daylight let alone after dark deep in the forest the sunset gold and red burned on grass and leaf the aspens took most of the color swiftflying wisps of cloud turned pink and low along the western horizon of the forest the light seemed golden and blue  i was almost exhausted and by the time we reached camp just at dark i was wholly exhausted my voice had sunk to a whisper a fact that occasioned rc some concern until i could explain undoubtedly this was the hardest days work i had done since my lion hunting with buffalo jones it did not surprise me that next day i had to forget my crosscut saw exercise  late that afternoon the hounds came straggling into camp lame and starved sue was the last one in arriving at suppertime  another day found me still sore but able to ride and rc and i went off into the woods in search of any kind of adventure this day was cloudy and threatening with spells of sunshine we saw two bull elk a cow and a calf the bulls appeared remarkably agile for so heavy an animal neither of these however were of such magnificent proportions as the one rc and i had stalked the first day out a few minutes later we scared out three more cows and three yearlings i dismounted just for fun and sighted my rifle at four of them next we came to a canyon where beaver had cut aspen trees these animals must have chisellike teeth they left chippings somewhat similar to those cut by an axe aspen bark was their winter food in this particular spot we could not find a dam or slide when we rode down into turkey canyon however we found a place where beavers had dammed the brook many aspens were fresh cut one at least two feet thick and all the small branches had been cut off and dragged to the water where i could find no further trace of them the grass was matted down and on the bare bits of ground showed beaver tracks  illustration where bear cross the ridge from one canyon to another  illustration climbing over the tough manzanita  game appeared to be scarce haught had told us that deer turkey and bear had all gone to feed on the mast fallen acorns and if we could locate the mast we would find the game he said he had once seen a herd of several hundred deer migrating from one section of country to another apparently this was to find new feeding grounds  illustration bear in sight across canyon  while we were resting under a spruce i espied a whitebreasted blueheaded graybacked little bird at work on a pine tree he walked head first down the bark pecking here and there i saw a moth or a winged insect fly off the tree and then another then i saw several more fly away the bird was feeding on winged insects that lived in the bark some of them saw or heard him coming and escaped but many of them he caught he went about this deathdealing business with a brisk and cheerful manner no doubt nature had developed him to help protect the trees from bugs and worms and beetles  later that day in an open grassy canyon we came upon quite a large bird near the size of a pigeon which i thought appeared to be a species of jay or magpie this bird had gray and black colors a round head and a stout bill at first i thought it was crippled as it hopped and fluttered about in the grass i got down to catch it then i discovered it was only tame i could approach to within a foot of reaching it once it perched upon a low snag and peeped at me with little bright dark eyes very friendly as if he liked my company i sat there within a few feet of him for quite a while we resumed our ride crossing a fresh buck track caused us to dismount and tie our horses but that buck was too wary for us we returned to camp as usual empty handed as far as game was concerned  i forgot to say anything to haught or doyle about the black and gray bird that had so interested me quite a coincidence was it then to see another such bird and that one right in camp he appeared to be as tame as the other he flew and hopped around camp in such a friendly manner that i placed a piece of meat in a conspicuous place for him not long was he in finding it he alighted on it and pecked and pulled at a great rate doyle claimed it was a clark crow named after one of the lewis and clark expedition its a rare bird said doyle first one ive seen in thirty years as doyle spent most of his time in the open this statement seemed rather remarkable  we had frost on two mornings temperature as low as twentysix degrees and then another change indicative of unsettled weather it rained and sleeted and then snowed but the ground was too wet to hold the snow  the wilderness began all at once as if by magic to take on autumn colors then the forest became an enchanted region of white aspens goldengreen aspens purple spruces dark green pines maples a blaze of vermilion cerise scarlet magenta roseand slopes of dull red sumac these were the beginning of indian summer days the melancholy days with their color and silence and beauty and fragrance and mystery  hunting then became quite a dream for me as if it called back to me dim mystic days in the woods of some past weird world one afternoon copple rc and i went as far as the east side of gentry canyon and worked down copple found fresh deer and turkey sign we tied our horses and slipped back against the wind rc took one side of a ridge with copple and me on the other and we worked down toward where we had seen the sign after half an hour of slow stealthy glide through the forest we sat down at the edge of a park expecting rc to come along soon the white aspens were all bare and oak leaves were rustling down the wind lulled a while then softly roared in the pines all at once both of us heard a stick crack and light steps of a walking deer on leaves copple whispered get ready to shoot we waited keen and tight expecting to see a deer walk out into the open but none came leaving our stand we slipped into the woods careful not to make the slightest sound such careful slow steps were certainly not accountable for the rapid beat of my heart something gray moved among the green and yellow leaves i halted and held copple back then not twenty paces away i descried what i thought was a fawn it glided toward us without the slightest sound suddenly half emerging from some maple saplings it saw us and seemed stricken to stone not ten steps from me soft gray hue slender graceful neck and body sleek small head with long ears and great dark distended eyes wilder than any wild eyes i had ever beheld i saw it quiver all over i was quivering too but with emotion copple whispered yearlin buck shoot  his whisper low as it was made the deer leap like a gray flash also it broke the spell for me year old buck i exclaimed quite loud thought he was a fawn but i couldnt have shot  a crash of brush interrupted me thump of hoofs crack of branchesthen a big buck deer bounded onward into the thicket i got one snap shot at his fleeting blurred image and missed him we ran ahead but to no avail  fourpoint buck said copple he must have been standin behind that brush  did you see his horns i gasped incredulously  sure but he was runnin some lets go down this slope where he jumped now will you look at that heres where he started after you shot  a gentle slope rather open led down to the thicket where the buck had vanished we measured the first of his downhill jumps and it amounted to eighteen of my rather short steps what a magnificent leap it reminded me of the story of hartleap well  as we retraced our steps rc met us reporting that he had heard the buck running but could not see him we scouted around together for an hour then rc and copple started off on a wide detour leaving me at a stand in the hope they might drive some turkeys my way i sat on a log until almost sunset all the pine tips turned gold and patches of gold brightened the ground jays were squalling gray squirrels were barking red squirrels were chattering snowbirds were twittering pine cones were dropping leaves were rustling but there were no turkeys and i did not miss them rc and copple returned to tell me there were signs of turkeys and deer all over the ridge well ride over here early tomorrow said copple an ill bet my gun we pack some meat to camp  but the unsettled weather claimed the next day and the next giving us spells of rain and sleet and periods of sunshine deceptive in their promise camp however with our big campfire and little tentstoves and takahashi would have been delightful in almost any weather takahashi was insulted the boys told me because i said he was born to be a cook it seemed the jap looked down upon this culinary job cookthat woman joob he said contemptuously  as i became better acquainted with takahashi i learned to think more of the japanese i studied takahashi very earnestly and i grew to like him the orientals are mystics and hard to understand but any one could see that here was a japanese who was a real man i never saw him idle he resented being told what to do and after my first offense in this regard i never gave him another order he was a wonderful cook it pleased his vanity to see how good an appetite i always had when i would hail him george what you got to eat he would grin and reply aw turkee then i would let out a yell for i never in my life tasted anything so good as the roast wild turkey takahashi served us or he would say pancakesapple dumplingsrice puddings no one but the japs know how to cook rice i asked him how he cooked rice over an open fire and he said i know how hotwhen done takahashi must have possessed an uncanny knowledge of the effects of heat how swift clean efficient and saving he was he never wasted anything in these days of american prodigality a frugal cook like takahashi was a revelation seldom are the real producers of food ever wasters takahashis ambition was to be a rancher in california i learned many things about him in summer he went to the imperial valley where he picked and packed cantaloupes he could stand the intense heat he was an expert he commanded the highest wage then he was a raisinpicker which for him was another art he had accumulated a little fortune and knew how to save his money he would have been a millionaire in japan but he intended to live in the united states  takahashi had that best of traitsgenerosity whenever he made pie or cake or doughnuts he always saved his share for me to have for my lunch next day no use to try to break him of this kindly habit he was keen too and held in particular disfavor any one who picked out the best portions of turkey or meat no like that he would say and i heartily agreed with him life in the open brought out the little miserable traits of human nature of which no one was absolutely free  i admired takahashis cooking i admired the enormous pile of firewood he always had chopped i admired his generosity but most of all i liked his cheerfulness and good humor he grew to be a joy to me we had some pop corn which we sometimes popped over the campfire he was fond of it and he said you eat all timemuch pop cornjust so long you keep mouth going all same like horseyou happy we were troubled a good deal by skunks now some skunks were not bad neighbors but others were disgusting and dangerous the hognosed skunk according to westerners very often had hydrophobia and would bite a sleeper i knew of several men dying of rabies from this bite copple said he had been awakened twice at night by skunks biting the noses of his companions in camp copple had to choke the skunks off one of these men died we were really afraid of them doyle said one had visited him in his tent and he had been forced to cover his head until he nearly smothered now takahashi slept in the tent with the store of supplies one night a skunk awakened him in reporting this to me the jap said see skunk all black and white at tent door i flash light skunk no fraid he no run he act funnythen just walk off  after that experience takahashi set a boxtrap for skunks one morning he said with a huge grin i catch skunk want you take picture for me send my wife sadayo  so i got my camera and being careful to take a safe position as did all the boys i told takahashi i was ready to photograph him and his skunk he got a pole that was too short to suit me and he lifted up the boxtrap a furry white and black cat appeared with remarkably bushy tail what a beautiful little animal to bear such opprobrium all same like cat said takahashi kitteekittee it appeared that kitty was not in the least afraid on the contrary she surveyed the formidable jap with his pole and her other enemies in a calm dignified manner then she turned away here i tried to photograph her and takahashi together when she started off the jap followed and poked her with the pole take nother picture but kitty suddenly whirled with fur and tail erect a most surprising and brave and assured front then ran at takahashi i yelled run george pellmell everybody fled from that beautiful little beast we were arrant cowards but takahashi grasped up another and longer pole and charged back at kitty this time he chased her out of camp when he returned his face was a study nashty thing she make awful stink she no fraid a tall next time i kill her sure  the head of gentry canyon was about five miles from camp and we reached it the following morning while the frost was still white and sparkling we tied our horses copple said this is a deer day ill show you a buck sure lets stick together an walk easy  so we made sure to work against the wind which however was so light as almost to be imperceptible and stole along the dark ravine taking half a dozen steps or so at a time how still the forest when it was like this i always felt as if i had discovered something new the big trees loomed stately and calm stretching a rugged network of branches over us fortunately no saucy squirrels or squalling jays appeared to be abroad to warn game of our approach not only a tang but a thrill seemed to come pervasively on the cool air all the colors of autumn were at their height and gorgeous plots of maple thicket and sumac burned against the brown and green we slipped along each of us strung to be the first to hear or see some living creature of the wild rc as might have been expected halted us with a softly whispered listen but neither copple nor i heard what rc heard and presently we moved on as before presently again rc made us pause with a like result somehow the forest seemed unusually wild it provoked a tingling expectation the pinecovered slope ahead of us the thicketed ridge to our left the dark widening ravine to our right all seemed to harbor listening watching softfooted denizens of the wild at length we reached a level bench beautifully forested where the ridge ran down in points to where the junction of several ravines formed the head of gentry canyon  how stealthily we stole on here copple said was a place for deer to graze but the grass plots golden with sunlight and white with frost and blackbarred by shadows of pines showed no game  copple sat down on a log and i took a seat beside him to the left rc stood just to my left as i laid my rifle over my knees and opened my lips to whisper i was suddenly struck mute i saw rc stiffen then crouch a little he leaned forwardhis eyes had the look of a falcon then i distinctly heard the soft crack of hoofs on stone and breaking of tiny twigs quick as i whirled my head i still caught out of the tail of my eye the jerk of rc as he threw up his rifle i lookedi strained my eyesi flashed them along the rim of the ravine where rc had been gazing a gray form seemed to move into the field of my vision that instant it leaped and rcs rifle shocked me with its bursting crack i seemed stunned so near was the report but i saw the gray form pitch headlong and i heard a solid thump  buck an hes your meat called copple low and sharp look for another one  no other deer appeared rc ran toward the spot where the gray form had plunged in a heap and copple and i followed it was far enough to make me pant for breath we found rc beside a fine threepoint buck that had been shot square in the back of the head between and below the roots of its antlers  never knew what struck him exclaimed copple and he laid hold of the deer and hauled it out of the edge of the thicket fine an fat venison for camp boys one of you go after the horses an the other help me hang him up   vi  i had been riding eastward of beaver dam canyon with haught and we had parted up on the ridge he to go down a ravine leading to his camp and i to linger a while longer up there in the indiansummer woods so full of gold and silence and fragrance on that october afternoon  the trail gradually drew me onward and downward and at length i came out into a narrow open park lined by spruce trees suddenly don carlos shot up his ears i had not ridden him for days and he appeared more than usually spirited he saw or heard something i held him in and after a moment i dismounted and drew my rifle a crashing in brush somewhere near at hand excited me peering all around i tried to locate cause for the sound again my ear caught a violent swishing of brush accompanied by a snapping of twigs this time i cocked my rifle don carlos snorted after another circling swift gaze it dawned upon me that the sound came from overhead  i looked into this tree and that suddenly to have my gaze arrested by a threshing commotion in the very top of a lofty spruce i saw a dark form moving against a background of blue sky instantly i thought it must be a lynx and was about to raise my rifle when a voice as from the very clouds utterly astounded me i gasped in my astonishment was i dreaming but violent threshings and whacks from the treetop absolutely assured me that i was neither dreaming nor out of my head i get youwhee shouted the voice there was a man up in the swaying top of that spruce and he was no other than takahashi for a moment i could not find my voice then i shouted  hey up there george what in the world are you doing i came near shooting you  aw hulloi come down now replied takahashi  i had seen both lynx and lion climb down out of a tree but nothing except a squirrel could ever have beaten takahashi the spruce was fully one hundred and fifty feet high and unless i made a great mistake the jap descended in two minutes he grinned from ear to ear  i no see youno hear he said you take me for big cat  yes george and i might have shot you what were you doing up there  takahashi brushed the needles and bark from his clothes i go out with little gun you give me i hunt no see squirrel go out no gunsee squirrel i chase him up treei climb highawful high no good squirrel he too quick he run right over meget away  takahashi laughed with me i believed he was laughing at what he considered the surprising agility of the squirrel while i was laughing at him here was another manifestation of the japs simplicity and capacity if all japanese were like takahashi they were a wonderful people men are men because they do things the persians were trained to sweat freely at least once every day of their lives it seemed to me that if a man did not sweat every day which was to saylabor hardhe very surely was degenerating physically i could learn a great deal from george takahashi right there i told him that my father had been a famous squirrel hunter in his day he had such remarkable eyesight that he could espy the ear of a squirrel projecting above the highest limb of a tall white oak and he was such a splendid shot that he had often barked squirrels as was a noted practice of the old pioneer i had to explain to takahashi that this practice consisted of shooting a bullet to hit the bark right under the squirrel and the concussion would so stun it that it would fall as if dead  aw my goodnishyour daddy more better shot than you ejaculated takahashi  yes indeed he was i replied reflectively as in a flash the longpast boyhood days recurred in memory hunting daysplaying days of boyhood were the best of life it seemed to me that one of the few reasons i still had for clinging to hunting was this keen thrilling hark back to early days books firstthen gunsthen fishing polesso ran the list of material possessions dear to my heart as a lad  that night was moonlight cold starry with a silver sheen on the spectral spruces during the night there came a change it rainedfirst a drizzle then a heavy downpour and at fivethirty a roar of hail on the tent this music did not last long at seven oclock the thermometer registered thirtyfour degrees but there was no frost the morning was somewhat cloudy or foggy with promise of clearing  we took the hounds over to see canyon and while edd and nielsen went down with them the rest of us waited above for developments scarcely had they more than time enough to reach the gorge below when the pack burst into full chorus haught led the way then around the rough rim for better vantage points i was mounted on one of the horses lee had gotten for mea fine spirited animal named stockings probably he had been a cavalry horse he was a bay with white feet well built and powerful though not over medium size one splendid feature about him was that a saddle appeared to fit him so snugly it never slipped and another feature infinitely the most attractive to me was his easy gait his trot and lope were so comfortable and swinging like the motion of a rockingchair that i could ride him all day with pleasure but when it came to chasing after hounds and bears along the rim stockings gave me trouble too eager too spirited he would not give me time to choose the direction he jumped ditches and gullies plunged into bad jumbles or rock tried to hurdle logs too high for him carried me under low branches and through dense thickets and in general showed he was exceedingly willing to chase after the pack but ignorant of rough forest travel owing to this i fell behind and got out of hearing of both hounds and men and eventually found myself lost somewhere on the west side of see canyon to get out i had to turn my back to the sun travel west till i came to the rim above horton thicket and from there return to camp arriving rather late in the afternoon  all the men had returned and all the hounds except buck i was rather surprised and disturbed to find the haughts in a high state of dudgeon edd looked pale and angry upon questioning nielsen i learned that the hounds had at once struck a fresh bear track in see canyon nielsen and edd had not followed far before they heard a hound yelping in pain they found buck caught in a bear trap the rest of the hounds came upon a little bear cub caught in another trap and killed it nielsen said it had evidently been a prisoner for some days being very poor and emaciated fresh tracks of the mother bear were proof that she had been around trying to save it or minister to it there were trappers in see canyon and between bear hunters and trappers manifestly there was no love lost edd said they had as much right to trap as we had to hunt but that was not the question there had been opportunity to tell the haughts about the big number four bear traps set in see canyon but they did not tell it edd had brought the dead cub back to our camp it was a pretty little bear cub about six months old with a soft silky brown coat no one had to look at it twice to see how it had suffered  this matter of trapping wild animals is singularly hateful to me bad enough is it to stalk deer to shoot them for their meat but at least this is a game where the deer have all the advantage bad indeed it may be to chase bear with hounds but that is a hard dangerous method of hunting which gives it some semblance of fairness most of my bear hunts proved to me that i ran more risks than the bears to set traps however to hide big ironspringed spiketoothed traps to catch and clutch wild animals alive and hold them till they died or starved or gnawed off their feet or until the trapper chose to come with his gun or club to end the miserable businesswhat indeed shall i call that cruelbasecowardly  it cannot be defended on moral grounds but vast moneyed interests are at stake one of the greatest of american fortunes was built upon the brutal merciless trapping of wild animals for their furs and in this fall of 1919 the prices of fox marten beaver raccoon skunk lynx muskrat mink otter were higher by double than they had ever been trappers were going to reap a rich harvest well everybody must make a living but is this trapping business honest is it manly to my knowledge trappers are hardened market fishermen are hardened too but the public eat fish they do not eat furs now in cold climates and seasons furs are valuable to protect people who must battle with winter winds and sleet and ice and against their use by such i daresay there is no justification for censure but the vast number of furs go to deck the persons of vain women i appreciate the beautiful contrast of fair skin against a background of sable fur or silver fox or rich black velvety seal but beautiful women would be just as beautiful just as warmly clothed in wool instead of fur and infinitely better women not long ago i met a young woman in one of new yorks fashionable hotels and i remarked about the exquisite evening coat of fur she wore she said she loved furs she certainly was handsome and she appeared to be refined cultured a girl of high class and i said it was a pity women did not know or care where furs came from she seemed surprised then i told her about the ironjawed spiketoothed traps hidden by the springs or on the runways of gameabout the fox or beaver or marten seeking its food training its young to fare for themselvesabout the sudden terrible clutch of the trap and then the frantic fear the instinctive fury the violent struggleabout the foot gnawed off by the beast that was too fierce to die a captiveabout the hours of agony the horrible thirstthe horrible days till death and i concluded all because women are luxurious and vain she shuddered underneath the beautiful coat of furs and seemed insulted  upon inquiry i learned from nielsen that buck was coming somewhere back along the trail hopping along on three legs i rode on down to my camp and procuring a bottle of iodine i walked back in the hope of doing buck a good turn during my absence he had reached camp and was lying under an aspen apart from the other hounds buck looked meaner and uglier and more distrustful than ever evidently this injury to his leg was a trick played upon him by his arch enemy man i stood beside him as he licked the swollen bloody leg and talked to him as kindly as i knew how and finally i sat down beside him the trapteeth had caught his right front leg just above the first joint and from the position of the teeth marks and the way he moved his leg i had hopes that the bone was not broken apparently the big teeth had gone through on each side of the bone when i tried gently to touch the swollen leg buck growled ominously he would have bitten me i patted his head with one hand and watching my chance at length with the other i poured iodine over the open cuts then i kept patting him and holding his head until the iodine had become absorbed perhaps it was only my fancy but it seemed that the ugly gleam in his distrustful eyes had become sheepish as if he was ashamed of something he did not understand that look more than ever determined me to try to find some way to his affections  a campfire council that night resulted in plans to take a pack outfit and ride west along the rim to a place haught called dude creek reckon well shore smoke up some bars along dude said haught never was in there but i jumped bars good deer an turkey country too  next day we rested the hounds and got things into packing shape with the intention of starting early the following morning but it rained on and off and the day after that we could not find haughts burros and not until the fourth morning could we start it turned out that buck did not have a broken leg and had recovered surprisingly from the injury he had received aloof as he held himself it appeared certain he did not want to be left behind  we rode all day along the old crook road where the year before we had encountered so many obstacles i remembered most of the road but how strange it seemed to me and what a proof of my mental condition on that memorable trip that i did not remember all usually forest or desert ground i have traveled over i never forget this ride in the middle of october when all the colors of autumn vied with the sunlight to make the forest a region of golden enchantment was one of particular delight to me i had begun to work and wear out the pain in my back every night i had suffered a little less and slept a little better and every morning i had less and less of a struggle to get up and straighten out many a groan had i smothered but now when i got warmed up from riding or walking or sawing wood the pain left me altogether and i forgot it i had given myself heroic treatment but my reward was in sight my theory that the outdoor life would cure almost any ill of body or mind seemed to have earned another proof added to the long list  at sunset we had covered about sixteen miles of rough road and had arrived at a point where we were to turn away from the rim down into a canyon named barber shop canyon where we were to camp  illustration zgs cinnamon bear  illustration rcs big brown bear  before turning aside i rode out to the rim for a look down at the section of country we were to hunt what a pleasure to recognize the point from which romerboy had seen his first wild bear it was a wonderful section of rimrock country i appeared to be at the extreme point of a vast tenleague promontory rising high over the basin where the rim was cut into canyons as thick as teeth of a saw they were notched and vshaped craggy russetlichened cliffs yellow and goldstained rocks old crumbling ruins of pinnacles crowned by pine thickets ravines and gullies and canyons choked with trees and brush all greengold purplered scarletfirethese indeed were the heights and depths the wild lonely ruggedness the color and beauty of arizona land there were long steep slopes of oak thickets where the bears lived long gray slides of weathered rocks long slanting ridges of pine descending for miles out and down into the green basin yet always seeming to stand high above that rolling wilderness the sun stood crossed by thin cloudsa golden blaze in a golden skysinking to meet a ragged horizon line of purple  illustration another bear  here again was i confronted with the majesty and beauty of the earth and with another and more striking effect of this vast tilted rim of mesa i could see many miles to west and east this rim was a huge wall of splintered rock a colossal cliff towering so high above the black basin below that ravines and canyons resembled ripples or dimples darker lines of shade and on the other side from its very edge where the pine fringe began it sloped gradually to the north with heads of canyons opening almost at the crest i saw one ravine begin its start not fifty feet from the rim  barber shop canyon had five heads all running down like the fingers of a hand to form the main canyon which was deep narrow forested by giant pines a round level dell watered by a murmuring brook deep down among the many slopes was our camp ground and never had i seen one more desirable the wind soughed in the lofty pine tops but not a breeze reached down to this sheltered nook with sunset gold on the high slopes our camp was shrouded in twilight shadows rc and i stretched a canvas fly over a rope from tree to tree staked down the ends and left the sides open under this we unrolled our beds  night fell quickly down in that sequestered pit and indeed it was black night a blazing campfire enhanced the circling gloom and invested the great brown pines with some weird aspect the boys put up an old tent for the hounds poor buck was driven out of this shelter by his canine rivals i took pity upon him and tied him at the foot of my bed when rc and i crawled into our blankets we discovered buck snugly settled between our beds and wonderful to hear he whined well buck old dog you keep the skunks away said rc and buck emitted some kind of a queer sound apparently meant to assure us that he would keep even a lion away from my bed i could see the tips of the black pines close to the white stars before i dropped to sleep the night grew silent except for the faint moan of wind and low murmur of brook  we crawled out early keen to run from the cold wash in the brook to the hot campfire george and edd had gone down the canyon after the horses which had been hobbled and turned loose lee had remained with his father at beaver dam camp for breakfast takahashi had venison biscuits griddle cakes with maple syrup and hot cocoa i certainly did not begin on an empty stomach what augured to be a hard day buck hung around me this morning and i subdued my generous impulses long enough to be convinced that he had undergone a subtle change then i fed him old dan and old tom were witnesses of this procedure which they regarded with extreme disfavor and the pups tried to pick a fight with buck  by eight oclock we were riding up the colored slopes through the still forest with the sweet fragrant frosty air nipping at our noses a mile from camp we reached a notch in the rim that led down to dude creek and here edd and nielsen descended with the hounds the rest of us rode out to a point there to await developments the sun had already flooded the basin with golden light the east slopes of canyon and rim were dark in shade i sat on a mat of pine needles near the rim and looked and cared not for passage of time  but i was not permitted to be left to sensorial dreams right under us the hounds opened up filling the canyon full of bellowing echoes they worked down slopes below us narrowed to promontories and along these we kept our gaze suddenly haught gave a jump and rose thumping to his horse saw a bar he yelled just got a glimpse of him crossin an open ridge come on we mounted and chased haught over the roughest kind of rocky ground to overtake him at the next point on the rim ride along you fellars he said an each pick out a stand keep ahead of the dogs an look sharp  then it was in short order that i found myself alone copple rc and george haught having got ahead of me i kept to the rim the hounds could be heard plainly and also the encouraging yells of nielsen and edd apparently the chase was working along under me in the direction i was going the baying of the pack the scent of pine the ring of ironshod hoofs on stone the sense of wild broken vast country the golden void beneath and the purpleranged horizonall these brought vividly and thrillingly to mind my hunting days with buffalo jones along the north rim of the grand canyon i felt a pang both for the past and for my friend and teacher this last of the old plainsmen who had died recently in his last letter to me written with a deathstricken hand he had talked of another hunt of more adventure of his cherished hope to possess an island in the north pacific there to propagate wild animalshe had dreamed again the dream that could never come true i was riding with my face to the keen sweet winds of the wild and he was gone no joy in life is ever perfect i wondered if any grief was ever wholly hopeless  i came at length to a section of rim where huge timbered steps reached out and down dismounting i tied stockings and descended to the craggy points below where i clambered here and there looking listening no longer could i locate the hounds now the baying sounded clear and sharp close at hand and then hollow and faint and far away i crawled under gnarled cedars over jumbles of rock around leaning crags until i got out to a point where i had such command of slopes and capes where the scene was so grand that i was both thrilled and awed somewhere below me to my left were the hounds still baying the lower reaches of the rim consisted of ridges and gorges benches and ravines canyons and promontoriesa country so wild and broken that it seemed impossible for hounds to travel it let alone men above me to my right stuck out a yellow point of rim and beyond that i knew there jutted out another point and more and more points on toward the west george was yelling from one of them and i thought i heard a faint reply from rc or copple i believed for the present they were too far westward along the rim and so i devoted my attention to the slopes under me toward my left but once my gaze wandered around and suddenly i espied a shiny black object moving along a bare slope far below a bear so thrilled and excited was i that i did not wonder why this bear walked along so leisurely and calmly assuredly he had not even heard the hounds i began to shoot and in five rapid shots i spattered dust all over him not until i had two more shots one of which struck close did he begin to run then he got out of my sight i yelled and yelled to those ahead of me along the rim somebody answered and next somebody began to shoot how i climbed and crawled and scuffled to get back to my horse stockings answered to the spirit of the occasion like a deer he ran around the rough rim and i had to perform with the agility of a contortionist to avoid dead snags of trees and green branches when i got to the point from which i had calculated george had done his shooting i found no one my yells brought no answers but i heard a horse cracking the rocks behind me then up from far below rang the sharp spangs of rifles in quick action nielsen and edd were shooting i counted seven shots how the echoes rang from wall to wall to die hollow and faint in the deep canyons  i galloped ahead to the next point finding only the tracks of rcs boots everywhere i peered for the bear i had sighted and at intervals i yelled for all the answer i got i might as well have been alone on the windy rim of the world my voice seemed lost in immensity then i rode westward then back eastward and to and fro until both stockings and i were weary at last i gave up and took a good long rest under a pine on the rim not a shot not a yell not a sound but wind and the squall of a jay disrupted the peace of that hour i profited by this lull in the excitement by more means than one particularly in sight of a flock of wild pigeons they alighted in the tops of pines below me so that i could study them through my field glass they were considerably larger than doves dull purple color on the back light on the breast with ringed or barred neck haught had assured me that birds of this description were indeed the famous wild pigeons now almost extinct in the united states i remembered my father telling me he had seen flocks that darkened the skies these pigeons appeared to have swift flight  another feature of this rest along the rim was a sight just as beautiful as that of the pigeons though not so rare and it was the flying of clouds of colored autumn leaves on the wind  the westering of the sun advised me that the hours had fled and it was high time for me to bestir myself toward camp on my way back i found haught his son george copple and rc waiting for edd and nielsen to come up over the rim and for me to return they asked for my story then i learned theirs haught had kept even with the hounds but had seen only the brown bear that had crossed the ridge early in the day copple had worked far westward to no avail rc had been close to george and me had heard our bullets pat yet had been unable to locate any bear to my surprise it turned out that george had shot at a brown bear when i had supposed it was my black one whereupon haught said reckon edd an nielsen smoked up some other bear  one by one the hounds climbed over the rim and wearily lay down beside us down the long grassy cedared aisle i saw edd and nielsen plodding up at length they reached us wet and dusty and thirsty when edd got his breath he said right off we struck a hot trail bear with eleveninch track hed come down to drink last night hounds worked up thet yeller oak thicket an somewhere sue an rock jumped him out of his bed he run down an he made some racket took to the low slopes an hit up lively all the way down dude then crossed climbed around under thet bare point of rock here some of the hounds caught up with him we heard a pup yelp an after a while kaiser bill come sneakin back it was awful thick down in the canyon so we climbed the east side high enough to see an we were workin down when the pack bayed the bear round thet bare point it was up an across from us nielsen an i climbed on a rock there was an open rockslide where we thought the bear would show it was five hundred yards we ought to have gone across an got a stand higher up well pretty soon we saw him come paddlin out of the brusha big grizzly almost black with a frosty back he was a silvertip all right niels an i began to shoot an thet bear began to hump himself he was mad too his fur stood up like a ruffle on his neck niels got four shots an i got three reckon one of us stung him a little lordy how he run an his last jump off the slide was a header into the brush he crossed the canyon an climbed thet high east slope of dude goin over the pass where father killed the big cinnamon three years ago the hounds stuck to his trail it took us an hour or more to climb up to thet pass broad bear trail goes over we heard the hounds way down in the canyon on the other side niels an i worked along the ridge down an around an back to dude creek i kept callin the hounds till they all came back they couldnt catch him he sure was a jackrabbit for runnin reckon thets all now who was smokin shells up on the rim  when all was told and talked over haught said wal you can just bet we put up two brown bears an one black bear an thet old jasper of a silvertip  how hungry and thirsty and tired i was when we got back to camp the day had been singularly rich in exciting thrills and sensorial perceptions i called to the jap im starvved to death and takahashi who had many times heard my little boy loren yell that grinned all over his dusky face aw lots good things pretty soon  after supper we lounged around a cheerful crackling campfire the blaze roared in the breeze the red embers glowed white and opal the smoke swooped down and curled away into the night shadows old dan as usual tried to sit in the fire and had to be rescued buck came to me where i sat with my back to a pine my feet to the warmth he was lame tonight having run all day on that injured leg the other dogs lay scattered around in range of the heat natural indeed was it then in such an environment after talking over the auspicious start of our hunt at dude creek that we should drift to the telling of stories  sensing this drift i opened the hour of reminiscence and told some of my experiences in the jungle of southern mexico copple immediately topped my stories by more wonderful and hairraising ones about his own adventures in northern mexico these stirred nielsen to talk about the seri indians and their cannibalistic traits and from these he drifted to the yuma indians speaking of their remarkable stature and strength he finally got to the subject of giants of brawn and bone in norway  one young norwegian was eight feet tall and broad in proportion his employer was a captain of a fishing boat one time on the way to their home port a quarrel arose about money due the young giant and in his anger he heaved the anchor overboard that of course halted the boat and it stayed halted because the captain and crew could not heave the heavy anchor without the help of their brawny comrade finally the money matter was adjusted and the young giant heaved the anchor without assistance nielsen went on to tell that this fisherman of such mighty frame had a beautiful young wife whom he adored she was not by any means a small or frail girlrather the contrarybut she appeared diminutive beside her giant husband one day he returned from a long absence on the sea when his wife in her joy ran into his arms he gave her such a tremendous hug that he crushed her chest and she died in his grief the young husband went insane and did not survive her long  next nielsen told a story about norwegians sailing to the arctic on a scientific expedition just before the long polar night of darkness set in there arose a necessity for the ship and crew to return to norway two men must be left in the arctic to care for the supplies until the ship came back the captain called for volunteers there were two young men in the crew and from childhood they had been playmates schoolmates closer than brothers and inseparable even in manhood one of these young men said to his friend ill stay if you will and the other quickly agreed after the ship sailed and the land of the midnight sun had become icy and black one of these comrades fell ill and soon died the living one placed the body in the room with the ship supplies where it froze stiff and during all the long polar night of solitude and ghastly gloom he lived next to this sepulchre that contained his dead friend when the ship returned the crew found the living comrade an old man with hair as white as snow and never in his life afterward was he seen to smile  these stories stirred my emotions like doyles tale about jones ranch how wonderful beautiful terrible and tragical is human life again i heard the still sad music of humanity the eternal beat and moan of the waves upon a lonely shingle shore who would not be a teller of tales  copple followed nielsen with a story about a prodigious feat of his owna story of incredible strength and endurance which at first i took to be a satire on nielsens remarkable narrative but copple seemed deadly serious and i began to see that he possessed a strange simplicity of exaggeration the boys thought copple stretched the truth a little but i thought that he believed what he told  haught was a great teller of tales and his first story of the evening happened to be about his brother bill they had a long chase after a bear and became separated bill was new at the game and he was a peculiar fellow anyhow much given to talking to himself haught finally rode to the edge of a ridge and espied bill under a pine in which the hounds had treed a bear bill did not hear haughts approach and on the moment he was stalking round the pine swearing at the bear which clung to a branch about half way up then haught discovered two more fullgrown bears up in the top of the pine the presence of which bill had not the remotest suspicion ahuh you ole black jasper bill was yelling i treed you an in a minnit im agoin to assassinate you chased me about a hundred miles an thought youd fool me didnt you why ive treed more bears than you ever saw you neednt look at me like thet cause im mad as a hornet im agoin to assassinate you in a minnit an skin your black har off i am  bill interrupted haught what are you goin to do about the other two bears up in the top of the tree  bill was amazed to hear and see his brother and greatly astounded and tremendously elated to discover the other two bears he yelled and acted as one demented three black jaspers ive treed you all an im agoin to assassinate you all  see here bill said haught before you begin that assassinatin make up your mind not to cripple any of them youve got to shoot straight so theyll be dead when they fall if theyre only crippled theyll kill the hounds  bill was insulted at any suggestions as to his possible poor marksmanship but this happened to be his first experience with bears in trees he began to shoot and it took nine shots for him to dislodge the bears worse than that they all tumbled out of the treeapparently unhurt the hounds of course attacked them and there arose a terrible uproar haught had to run down to save his dogs bill was going to shoot right into the melee but haught knocked the rifle up and forbid him to use it then bill ran into the thick of the fray to beat off the hounds haught became exceedingly busy himself and finally disposed of two of the bears then hearing angry bawls and terrific yells he turned to see bill climbing a tree with a big black bear tearing the seat out of his pants haught disposed of this bear also then he said bill i thought you was goin to assassinate them bill slid down out of the tree very pale and disheveled by golly ill skin em anyhow  haught had another brother named henry who had come to arizona from texas and had brought a halfhound with him henry offered to wager this dog was the best bear chaser in the country the general impression henrys hound gave was that he would not chase a rabbit finally haught took his brother henry and some other men on a bear hunt there were wagers made as to the quality of henrys halfhound when at last haughts pack struck a hot scent and were off with the men riding fast behind henrys halfbreed loped alongside his master paying no attention to the wild baying of the pack he would look up at henry as if to say no hurry boss wait a little then ill show them he loped along wagging his tail evidently enjoying this race with his master after a while the chase grew hotter then henrys halfhound ran ahead a little way and came back to look up wisely as if to say not time yet after a while when the chase grew very hot indeed henrys wonderful canine let out a wild yelp darted ahead overtook the pack and took the lead in the chase literally chewing the heels of the bear till he treed haught and his friends lost all the wagers  the most remarkable bears in this part of arizona were what haught called blue bears possibly some kind of a cross between brown and black this species was a long slim bluefurred bear with unusually large teeth and very long claws so different from ordinary bears that it appeared another species the blue bear could run like a greyhound and keep it up all day and all night its power of endurance was incredible in haughts twenty years of hunting there he had seen a number of blue bears and had killed two haught chased one all day with young and fast hounds he went to camp but the hounds stuck to the chase next day haught followed the hounds and bear from dude creek over into verde canyon back to dude creek and then back to verde again here haught gave out and was on his way home when he met the blue bear padding along as lively as ever  i never tired of listening to haught he had killed over a hundred bears many of them vicious grizzlies and he had often escaped by a breadth of a hair but the killing stories were not the most interesting to me haught had lived a singularly elemental life he never knew what to tell me because i did not know what to ask for so i just waited for stories experiences woodcraft natural history and the like to come when they would once he had owned an old bay horse named moze under any conditions of weather or country moze could find his way back to camp haught would let go the bridle and moze would stick up his ears look about him and circle home no matter if camp had been just where haught had last thrown a packsaddle  when haught first came to arizona and began his hunting up over the rim he used to get down in the cedar country close to the desert here he heard of a pure black antelope that was the leader of a herd of ordinary color which was a grayish white the day came when haught saw this black antelope it was a very large beautiful stag the most noble and wild and sagacious animal haught had ever seen for years he tried to stalk it and kill it and so did other hunters but no hunter ever got even a shot at it finally this black antelope disappeared and was never heard of again  by this time copple had been permitted a long breathing spell and now began a tale calculated to outdo the arabian nights i envied his most remarkable imagination his story had to do with hunting meat for a mining camp in mexico he got so expert with a rifle that he never aimed at deer just threw his gun as was a habit of gunfighters once the camp was out of meat and also he was out of ammunition only one shell left he came upon a herd of deer licking salt at a deer lick they were small deer and he wanted several or all of them so he manoeuvred around and waited until five of the deer had lined up close together then to make sure he aimed so as to send his one bullet through their necks killed the whole five in one shot  we were all reduced to a state of mute helplessness and completely at copples mercy next he gave us one of his animal tales he was hunting along the gulf shore on the coast of sonora where big turtles come out to bask in the sun and big jaguars come down to prowl for meat one morning he saw a jaguar jump on the back of a huge turtle and begin to paw at its neck promptly the turtle drew in head and flippers and was safe under its shell the jaguar scratched and clawed at a great rate but to no avail then the big cat turned round and seized the tail of the turtle and began to chew it whereupon the turtle stuck out its head opened its huge mouth and grasped the tail of the jaguar first to give in was the cat he let go and let out a squall but the turtle started to crawl off got going strong and dragged the jaguar into the sea and drowned him with naive earnestness copple assured his mute listeners that he could show them the exact spot in sonora where this happened  retribution inevitably overtakes transgressors copple in his immense loquaciousness was not transgressing much for he really was no greater dreamer than i but the way he put things made us want to see the mighty hunter have a fall  we rested the hounds next day and i was glad to rest myself about sunset copple rode up to the rim to look for his mules we all heard him shoot eight times with his rifle and two with his revolver everybody said turkeys ten turkeysmaybe a dozen if copple got two in line and we were all glad to think so we watched eagerly for him but he did not return till dark he seemed vastly sore at himself what a remarkable hard luck story he told he had come upon a flock of turkeys and they were rather difficult to see all of them were close and running fast he shot eight times at eight turkeys and missed them all too darkbrushtreesrunning like deer copple had a dozen excuses then he saw a turkey on a log ten feet away he shot twice the turkey was a knot and he had missed even that  thereupon i seized my opportunity and reminded all present how copple had called out turkey number one turkey number two the day i had missed so many then i said  ben you must have yelled out tonight like this and i raised my voice high  turkey number onenix turkey number twomissed by gosh turkey number threenever touched him turkey number fourno turkey number fiveaw im shootin blank shells turkey number six on the logby thunder i cant see straight  we all had our fun at copples expense the old bear hunter haught rolled on the ground over and over and roared in his mirth   vii  early next morning before the sun had tipped the pines with gold i went down barber shop canyon with copple to look for our horses during the night our stock had been chased by a lion we had all been awakened by their snorting and stampeding we found our horses scattered the burros gone and copples mules still squared on guard ready to fight copple assured me that this formation of his mules on guard was an infallible sign of lions prowling around one of these mules he had owned for ten years and it was indeed the most intelligent beast i ever saw in the woods  we found three beaver dams across the brook one about fifty feet long and another fully two hundred fresh turkey tracks showed in places and on the top of the longer dam fresh made in the mud were lion tracks as large as the crown of my hat how sight of them made me tingle all over here was absolute proof of the prowling of one of the great cats  beaver tracks were everywhere they were rather singular looking tracks the front feet being fivetoed and the back threetoed and webbed near the slides on the bank the water was muddy showing that the beaver had been at work early these animals worked mostly at night but sometimes at sunset and sunrise they were indeed very cautious and wary these dams had just been completed and no aspens had yet been cut for food beaver usually have two holes to their home one under the water and the other out on the bank we found one of these outside burrows and it was nearly a foot wide  upon our return to camp with the horses haught said he could put up that lion for us and from the size of its track he judged it to be a big one i did not want to hunt lions and rc preferred to keep after bears wal said haught ill take an off day an chase thet lion had a burro killed here a couple of years ago  so we rode out with the hounds on another bear hunt pyles canyon lay to the east of dude creek and we decided to run it that day edd and nielsen started down with the hounds copple and i followed shortly afterward with the intention of descending midway and then working along the ridge crests and promontories the other boys remained on the rim to take up various stands as occasion called for  i had never been on as steep slopes as these under the rim they were grassy brushy rocky but it was their steepness that made them so hard to travel right off half way down we started a herd of bucks the noise they made sounded like cattle we found tracks of half a dozen lots of deer under the rim declared copple his eyes gleaming theyre feedin on acorns heres where youll get your big buck after that i kept a sharp lookout arguing with myself that a buck close at hand was worth a lot of bears down in the brush  presently we changed a direct descent to work gradually along the slopes toward a great level bench covered with pines we had to cross gravel patches and pits where avalanches had slid and at last gaining the bench we went through the pine grove out to a manzanita thicket to a rocky point where the ledges were toppling and dangerous the stand here afforded a magnificent view we were now down in the thick of this sloped and canyoned and timbered wildness no longer above it and aloof from it the dry smell of pine filled the air when we finally halted to listen we at once heard the baying of the hounds in the black notch below us we watched and listened and presently across open patches we saw the flash of deer and then rock and buck following them thus were my suspicions of rock fully confirmed copple yelled down to edd that some of the hounds were running deer but apparently edd was too far away to hear  still after a while we heard the mellow tones of edds horn calling in the hounds and then he blew the signal to acquaint all of us above that he was going down around the point to drive the next canyon copple and i had to choose between climbing back to the rim or trying to cross the slopes and head the gorges and ascend the huge ridge that separated pyles canyon from the next canyon i left the question to copple with the result that we stayed below  we were still high up though when we gazed aloft at the rim we felt so far down and the slopes were steep stony soft in places and slippery in others with deep cuts and patches of manzanita no stranger was i to this beautiful treacherous spanish brush i shared with copple a dislike of it almost equal to that inspired by cactus we soon were hot dusty dry and had begun to sweat the immense distances of the place were what continually struck me distances that were deceptivethat looked short and were interminable that was arizona we covered miles in our detours and we had to travel fast because we knew edd could round the base of the lower points in quick time  above the head of the third gorge copple and i ran across an enormous bear track fresh in the dust leading along an old bear trail this track measured twelve inches hes an old jasper as haught says declared copple grizzly an you can bet he heard the dogs an got movin away from here but he aint scared he was walkin  i forgot the arduous toil how tight and cool and prickling the feel of my skin the fresh track of a big grizzly would rouse the hunter in any man we made sure how fresh this track was by observing twigs and sprigs of manzanita just broken the wood was green and wet with sap old bruin had not escaped our eyes any too soon we followed this bear trail evidently one used for years it made climbing easy for us trust a big heavy old grizzly to pick out the best traveling over rough country this fellow i concluded had the eye of a surveyor his trail led gradually toward a wonderful cragcrowned ridge that rolled and heaved down from the rim it had a dip or saddle in the middle and rose from that to the lofty mesa and then on the lower side rose to a bare round point of gray rock a landmark a domeshaped tower where the gods of that wild region might have kept their vigil  long indeed did it take us to climb up the bear trail to where it crossed the saddle and went down on the other side into a canyon so deep and wild that it was purple this saddle was really a remarkable placea natural trail and outlet and escape for bears traveling from one canyon to another our bear tracks showed fresh and we saw where they led down a steep long dark aisle between pines and spruces to a dense black thicket below the saddle was about twenty feet wide and on each side of it rose steep rocks affording most effective stands for a hunter to wait and watch  we rested then and listened there was only a little wind and often it fooled us it sounded like the baying of hounds and now like the hallooing of men and then like the distant peal of a horn by and bye copple said he heard the hounds i could not be sure soon we indeed heard the deepsounding wild bay of old dan the course sharp ringing bay of old tom and then less clear the chorus from the other hounds edd had started them on a trail up this magnificent canyon at our feet after a while we heard edds yell far away but clear hi hi we could see a part of the thicket shaggy and red and gold and a mile or more of the opposite wall of the canyon no rougher wilder place could have been imagined than this steep slope of bluffs ledges benches all matted with brush and spotted with pines holes and caves and cracks showed and yellow blank walls and bronze points and green slopes and weathered slides  soon the baying of the hounds appeared to pass below and beyond us up the canyon to our right a circumstance that worried copple lets go farther up he kept saying but i was loath to leave that splendid stand the baying of the hounds appeared to swing round closer under us to ring to swell to thicken until it was a continuous and melodious wild echoing roar the narrowing walls of the canyon threw the echoes back and forth  presently i espied moving dots one blue one brown on the opposite slope they were haught and his son edd slowly and laboriously climbing up the steep bluff how like snails they climbed theirs was indeed a task a yell pealed out now and then and though it seemed to come from an entirely different direction it surely must have come from the haughts presently some one high on the rim answered with like yells the chase was growing hotter  theyve got a bear up somewhere cried copple excitedly and i agreed with him  then we were startled by the sharp crack of a rifle from the rim  the balls open get your pardners boys exclaimed copple with animation  ben wasnt that a30 govt i asked  sure was he replied must have been rc openin up now look sharp  i gazed everywhere growing more excited and thrilled another shot from above farther off and from a different rifle augmented our stirring expectation  copple left our stand and ran up over the ridge and then down under and along the base of a rock wall i had all i could do to keep up with him we got perhaps a hundred yards when we heard the spang of haughts30 govt following this his big hoarse voice bawled out hes goin to the leftto the left that sent us right about face to climbing scrambling running and plunging back to our first stand at the saddle where we arrived breathless and eager  edd was climbing higher up evidently to reach the level top of the bluff above and haught was working farther up the canyon climbing a little copple yelled with all his might wheres the bear  bar everywhar pealed back haughts stentorian voice how the echoes clapped  just then copple electrified me with a wild shout wehow i see him what a whopper he threw up his rifle spangspangspangspangspang  his aim was across the canyon i heard his bullets strike i strained my eyes in flashing gaze everywhere where where i cried wildly  there shouted copple keenly and he pointed across the canyon hes goin over the benchabove edd now hes out of sight watch just over edd hell cross that bench go round the head of the little canyon an come out on the other side under the bare bluff watch sharpright by that big spruce with the dead top hes a grizzly an as big as a horse  i looked until my eyes hurt all i said was ben you saw game first today suddenly a large dark brown object furry and grizzled huge and round moved out of the shadow under the spruce and turned to go along the edge in the open sunlight  oh look at him i yelled a strong hot gust of blood ran all over me and i thrilled till i shook when i aimed at the bear i could see him through the circle of my peep sight but when i moved the bead of the front sight upon him it almost covered him up the distance was farmore than a thousand yardsover half a milewe calculated afterward but i tried to draw a bead on the big wagging brown shape and fired till my rifle was empty  meanwhile copple had reloaded you watch while i shoot he said tell me where im hittin  wonderful was it to see how swiftly he could aim and shoot i saw a puff of dust low ben spang rang his rifle high again he shot wide this time he emptied his magazine smoke him now he shouted gleefully ill watch while you shoot  its too far ben i replied as i jammed the last shell in the receiver  nono its only we dont hold right aim a little coarse said copple gee aint he some bear no scared tall as the jap says hes one of the old sheepkillers hell weigh half a ton smoke him now  my excitement was intense it seemed however i was most consumed with admiration for that grizzly not in the least was he afraid he walked along the rough places trotted along the ledges and here and there he halted to gaze below him i waited for one of these halts aimed a trifle high and fired the grizzly made a quick angry movement and then jumped up on a ledge he jumped like a rabbit  you hit close that time yelled ben hold the same waya little coarser  my next bullet struck a puff from rock above the bear and my third hitting just in front of him as he was on a yellow ledge covered him with dust he reared and wheeling sheered back and down the step he had mounted and disappeared in a clump of brush i shot into that we heard my bullet crack the twigs but it routed him out and then my last shot hit far under him  copple circled his mouth with his hands and bellowed to the haughts climb climb hurry hurry hes just above youunder that bluff  the haughts heard and evidently tried to do all in their power but they moved like snails then copple fired five more shots quick yet deliberate and he got through before i had reloaded and as i began my third magazine copple was so swift in reloading that his first shot mingled with my second how we made the welkin ring wild yells pealed down from the rim somewhere from the purple depths below nielsens giants voice rolled up the haughts opposite answered with their deep hoarse yells old dan and old tom bayed like distant thunder the young hounds let out a string of sharp keen yelps copple added his indian cry highpitched and wild to the pandemonium but i could not shoot and screech at one and the same time  hurry ben i said as i finished my third set of five shots the last shot of which was my best and knocked dirt in the face of the grizzly  again he reared this time he appeared to locate our direction above the bedlam of yells and bays and yelps and echoes i imagined i heard the grizzly roar he was now getting farther along the base of the bluff and i saw that he would escape us my rifle barrel was hot as fire my fingers were all thumbs i jammed a shell into the receiver my last chance had fled but copples big brown swift hands fed shells to his magazine as ears of corn go to a grinder he had a way of poking the base of a shell straight down into the receiver and making it snap forward and down then he fired five more shots as swiftly as he had reloaded some of these hit close to our quarry the old grizzly slowed up and looked across and wagged his huge head  my guns on fire all right said copple grimly as he loaded still more rapidly carefully he aimed and pulled trigger the grizzly gave a spasmodic jerk as if stung and suddenly he made a prodigious leap off a ledge down into a patch of brush where he threshed like a lassoed elephant  ben you hit him i yelled excitedly  only made him mad hes not hurt see hes up again will you look at that  the grizzly appeared to roll out of the brush and like a huge furry ball of brown he bounced down the thicketed slope to an open slide where he unrolled and stretched into a run copple got two more shots before he was out of sight  gone ejaculated copple an we never fetched him he aint hurt did you see him pile down an roll off that slope lets see i got twentythree shots at him how many had you  i had fifteen  say it was some fun wasnt itsmokin him along there but we ought to have fetched the old sheepkiller wonder whats happened to the other fellows  we looked about us not improbably the exciting moments had been few in number yet they seemed long indeed the haughts had gotten to the top of the bluff and were tearing through the brush toward the point copple had designated they reached it too late  where is he yelled edd  gone boomed copple runnin down the canyon call the dogs an go down after him  when the haughts came out into the open upon that bench one of the pups and the spotted hound rock were with them old dan and old tom were baying up at the head of the canyon and sue could be heard yelping somewhere else bear trails seemingly were abundant near our whereabouts presently the haughts disappeared at the back of the bench where the old grizzly had gone down and evidently they put the two hounds on his trail  that grizzly will climb over round the lower end of this ridge declared copple we want to be there  so we hurriedly left our stand and taking to the south side of the ridge we ran and walked and climbed and plunged down along the slope keeping up with copple on foot was harder than riding after edd and george when soon we reached a manzanita thicket i could no longer keep copple in sight he was so powerful that he just crashed through but i had to worm my way and walk over the tops of the bushes like a tightrope performer of all strong thick spiky brush manzanita was the worst  in half an hour i joined copple at the point under the dometopped end of the ridge only to hear the hounds apparently working back up the canyon there was nothing for us to do but return to our stand at the saddle copple hurried faster than ever but i had begun to tire and i could not keep up with him but as i had no wild cravings to meet that old grizzly face to face all by myself in a manzanita thicket i did manage by desperate efforts to keep the indian in sight when i reached our stand i was wet and exhausted after the hot stifling dusty glare of the yellow slope and the burning of the manzanita brush the cool shade was a welcome change  somewhere all the hounds were baying not for some time could we locate the haughts finally with the aid of my glass we discovered them perched high upon the bluff above where our grizzly had gone round it appeared that edd was pointing across the canyon and his father was manifesting a keen interest we did not need the glass then to tell that they saw a bear both leveled their rifles and fired apparently across the canyon then they stood like statues  ill go down into the thicket said copple maybe i can get a shot an anyway i want to see our grizzlys tracks with that he started down and once on the steep bear trail he slid rather than walked and soon was out of my sight after that i heard him crashing through thicket and brush soon this sound ceased the hounds too had quit baying and the wind had lulled not a rustle of a leaf all the hunters were likewise silent i enjoyed a lonely hour there watching and listening not however without apprehensions of a bear coming along certain i was that this canyon which i christened bear canyon had been full of bears  at length i espied copple down on the edge of the opposite slope the way he toiled along proved how rough was the going i watched him through my glasses and was again impressed with the strange difference between the semblance of distance and the reality every few steps copple would halt to rest he had to hold on to the brush and in the bare places where he could not reach a bush he had to dig his heels into the earth to keep from sliding down in time he ascended to the place where our grizzly had rolled down and from there he yelled up to the haughts high above him they answered and soon disappeared on the far side of the bluff copple also disappeared going round under the wall of yellow rock perhaps in fifteen minutes i heard them yell and then a wild clamor of the hounds some of the pack had been put on the trail of our grizzly but gradually the sound grew farther away  this was too much for me i decided to go down into the canyon forthwith i started it was easy to go down as a matter of fact it was hard not to slide down like a streak that long dark narrow aisle between the spruces had no charm for me anyway suppose i should meet a bear coming up as i was sliding down i sheered off and left the trail and also copples tracks this was a blunder i came out into more open slope but steeper and harder to cling on ledges cropped out cliffs and ravines obstructed my passage and trees were not close enough to help me much some long slopes of dark mossy bare earth i actually ran down trusting to light swift steps rather than slow careful ones it was exhilarating that descent under the shady spruces the lower down i got the smaller and more numerous the trees i could see where they left off to the dense thicket that choked the lower part of the vshaped canyon and i was amazed at the size and density of that jungle of scrub oaks maples and aspens from above the color was a blaze of scarlet and gold and green with bronze tinge  presently i crossed a fresh bear track so fresh that i could see the dampness of the dark earth the rolling of little particles the springing erect of bent grasses in some places big sections of earth a yard wide had slipped under the feet of this particular bear he appeared to be working down right then i wanted to go up but i could not climb out there i had to go down soon i was under lowspreading dense spruces and i had to hold on desperately to keep from sliding all the time naturally i kept a keen lookout for a bear every stone and tree trunk resembled a bear i decided if i met a grizzly that i would not annoy him on that slope i would say nice bear i wont hurt you still the situation had some kind of charm but to claim i was not frightened would not be strictly truthful i slid over the trail of that bear into the trail of another one and under the last big spruce on that part of the slope i found a hollow nest of pine needles and leaves and if that bed was not still warm then my imagination lent considerable to the moment  beyond this began the edge of the thicket it was small pine at first so close together that i had to squeeze through and as dark as twilight the ground was a slant of brown pine needles so slippery that if i could not have held on to trees and branches i never would have kept my feet in this dark strip i had more than apprehensions what a comfortable place to encounter an outraged or wounded grizzly bear the manzanita thicket was preferable but as providence would have it i did not encounter one  soon i worked or wormed out of the pines into the thicket of scrub oaks maples and aspens the change was welcome not only did the slope lengthen out but the light changed from gloom to gold there was half a foot of scarlet gold bronze red and purple leaves on the ground and every step i made i kicked acorns about to rustle and roll bear sign was everywhere tracks and trails and beds and scratches i kept going down and the farther down i got the lighter it grew and more approaching a level one glade was strangely luminous and beautiful with a blending of gold and purple light made by the sun shining through the leaves overhead down upon the carpet of leaves on the ground then i came into a glade that reminded me of kiplings moonlight dance of the wild elephants here the leaves and fern were rolled and matted flat smooth as if done by a huge roller bears and bears had lolled and slept and played there a little below this glade was a place shady and cool where a seep of water came from under a bank it looked like a herd of cattle had stamped the earth only the tracks were bear tracks little ones no longer than a childs hand and larger up to huge tracks a foot long and almost as wide many were old but some were fresh this little spot smelled of bear so strongly that it reminded me of the bear pen in the bronx park zoological garden i had been keen for sight of bear trails and scent of bear fur but this was a little too much i thought it was too much because the place was lonely and dark and absolutely silent i went on down to the gully that ran down the middle of the canyon it was more open here the sun got through and there were some big pines  i could see the bluff that the haughts had climbed so laboriously and now i understood why they had been so slow it was straight up brush and jumbled rock and two hundred feet over my head somewhere above that bluff was the bluff where our bear had run along  i rested and listened for the dogs there was no wind to deceive me but i imagined i heard dogs everywhere it seemed unwise for me to go on down the canyon for if i did not meet the men i would find myself lost as it was i would have my troubles climbing out  i chose a part of the thicket some distance above where i had come down hoping to find it more open if not less steep and not so vastly inhabited with bears lo and behold it was worse it was thicker darker wilder steeper and there was if possible actually more bear sign i had to pull myself up by holding to the trees and branches i had to rest every few steps i had to watch and listen all the time halfway up the trunks of the aspens and oaks and maples were all bent downhill they curved out and down before the rest of the tree stood upright and all the brush was flat bending down hill and absolutely almost impassable this feature of tree and brush was of course caused by the weight of snow in winter it would have been more interesting if i had not been so anxious to get up i grew hotter and wetter than i had been in the manzanitas moreover what with the labor and worry and exhaustion my apprehensions had increased they increased until i had to confess that i was scared once i heard a rustle and pad on the leaves somewhere below that made matters worse surely i would meet a bear i would meet him coming downhill and i must never shoot a bear coming downhill buffalo jones had cautioned me on that score so had scott teague the bear hunter of colorado and so had haught dont never shoot no ole bar comin down hill cause if you do hell just roll up an pile down on you  i climbed until my tongue hung out and my heart was likely to burst then when i had to straddle a tree to keep from sliding down i got desperate and mad and hoped an old grizzly would happen along to make an end to my misery  it took me an hour to climb up that part of the slope which constituted the thicket of oak maple and aspen it was halfpast three when finally i reached the saddle where we had shot at the grizzly i rested as long as i dared i had still a long way to go up that ridge to the rim and how did i know whether or not i could surmount it  however a good rest helped to revive strength and spirit then i started once above the saddle i was out clear in the open high above the canyons and the vast basin still farther below yet far indeed under the pinefringed rim above this climb was all over stone the ridge was narrowcrested yellow splintered rock with a few dwarf pines and spruces and an occasional bunch of manzanita i did not hear a sound that i did not make myself whatever had become of the hounds and the other hunters the higher i climbed the more i liked it after an hour i was sure that i could reach the rim by this route and of course that stimulated me to make sure and allay doubt i sat down on a high backbone of bare rock and studied the heave and bulge of ridge above me using my glasses i made sure that i could climb out it would be a task equal to those of lionhunting days with jones and it made me happy to realize that despite the intervening ten years i was still equal to the task  once assured of this i grew acute to the sensations of the hour this was one of my especial joys of the opento be alone high on some promontory above wild and beautiful scenery the sun was still an hour from setting and it had begun to soften to grow intense and more golden there were clouds and lights that promised a magnificent sunset  so i climbed on when i stopped to rest i would shove a stone loose and watch it heave and slide and leap out and hurtle down to make the dust fly and crash into the thickets and eventually start an avalanche that would roar down into the canyon  the tonto basin seemed a vast bowl of rolling rough black ridges and canyons green and dark and yellow with the great mountain ranges enclosing it to south and west the blackfringed promontories of the rim bold and rugged leagues apart stood out over the void the colors of autumn gleamed under the cliffs everywhere patches of gold and long slants of green and spots of scarlet and clefts of purple  the last benches of that ridge taxed my waning strength i had to step up climb up pull myself up by hand and knee and body my rifle grew to weigh a ton my cartridge belt was a burden of lead around my waist if i had been hot and wet below in the thicket i wondered what i grew on the last steps of this ridge yet even the toil and the pain held a keen pleasure i did not analyze my feelings then but it was good to be there  the rimrock came out to a point above me seeming unscalable all grown over with brush and lichen and stunted spruce but by hauling myself up and crawling here and winding under bridges of rock there and holding to the brush at last panting and spent i reached the top  i was ready to drop on the mats of pine needles and lie there unutterably grateful for rest when i heard old tom baying deep and ringing and close he seemed right under the rim on the side of the ridge opposite to where i had climbed i looked around there was georges horse tied to a pine and farther on my own horse stockings  then i walked to the rim and looked down into the gold and scarlet thicket actually it seemed to me then and always will seem that the first object i clearly distinguished was a big black bear standing in an open aisle at the upper reach of the thicket close to the cliff he shone black as shiny coal he was looking down into the thicket as if listening to the baying hound  i could not repress an exclamation of surprise and thrilling excitement and i uttered it as i raised my rifle just the instant i saw his shining fur through the circle of my rear sight he heard me and jumped and my bullet missed him like a black flash he was gone around a corner of gray ledge  well i ejaculated suddenly weak after all this long dayto get a chance like thatand miss  all that seemed left of that long day was the sunset out of which i could not be cheated by blunders or bad luck westward a glorious golden ball blazed over the rim above that shone an intense belt of colorcoleridges yellow lightningand it extended to a bank of cloud that seemed transparent purple and above all this flowed a sea of purest blue sky with fleecy sails of pink and white and rose exquisitely flecked with gold  lost indeed was i to weariness and time until the gorgeous transformation at last ended in dull gray i walked along the rim back to where i had tied my horse he saw me and whinnied before i located the spot i just about had strength enough left to straddle him and presently through the twilight shadows i caught a bright glimmer of our campfire supper was ready takahashi grinned his concern away all the men were waiting for me and like the ancient mariner i told my tale as i sat to a bountiful repast regaling myself the talk of my companions seemed absolutely satisfying  george haught on a stand at the apex of the canyon had heard and seen a big brown bear climbing up through the thicket and he had overshot and missed rc had espied a big black bear walking a slide some four hundred yards down the canyon slope and forgetting that he had a heavy closerange shell in his rifle instead of one of high trajectory he had aimed accordingly to undershoot half a foot and thus lose his opportunity nielsen had been lost most of the day it seemed everywhere he heard yells and bays down in the canyon and once he had heard a loud rattling crash of a heavy bear tearing through the thicket edd told of the fearful climb he and his father had made how they had shot at the grizzly a long way off how funny another bear had rolled around in his bed across the canyon but the hounds got too tired to hold the trails late in the day and lastly edd said when you an ben were smokin the grizzly i could hear the bullets hit close above us an i was sure scared stiff for fear youd roll him down on us but father wasnt scared he said let the old jasper roll down well assassinate him  when the old bear hunter began to tell his part in the days adventures my pleasure was tinglingly keen and nothing was wanting on the moment except that my boy romer was not there to hear  wal shore it was an old bar day said haught with quaint satisfaction his blue shirt ragged and torn and black from brush surely attested to the truth of his words all told we seen five bars two blacks two browns an the old jasper some of them big fellars too but we missed seein the boss bar of this canyon when old dan opened up first off i wanted edd to climb thet bluff but edd kept goin an we lost our chance fer pretty soon we heard a bustin of the brush my but thet bar was rockin her off he knocked the brush like a wild steer an he ran past us closenot a hundred yards i never heard a heavier bar but we couldnt see him then edd started up an thet bluff was a wolf of a place we was half up when i seen the grizzly thet you an ben smoked afterward he was far off but edd an i lammed a couple after him jest for luck one of the pups was nippin his heels think it was big foot wal thet was all of thet we plumb busted ourselves gettin on top of the bench to head off your bar only we hadnt time then we worried along around to the top of thet higher bluff an there i was so playedout i thought my day had come we kept our eyes peeled an pretty soon i spied a big brown bar actin queer in an open spot across the canyon edd seen him too an we argued about what thet bar was doin he lay in a small open place at the foot of a spruce he wagged his head slow an he made as if to roll over an he stretched his paws an acted shore queer edd said thet bars crippled hes been shot by one of the boys an hes tryin to get up but i shore didnt exactly agree with edd so i was for watchin him some more he looked like a sick barraisin his head so slow an droppin it so slow an sort of twistin his body he looked like his back had been broke an he was tryin to get up but somehow i couldnt believe thet then he lay still an edd swore he was dead shore i got almost to believin thet myself when he waked up an then the old scoundrel slid around lazy like a torn cat by the fire and sort of rolled on his back an stretched next he slapped at himself with his paws if he wasnt sick he was shore actin queer with thet canyon full of crackin guns an bayin hounds an yellin men i begun to get suspicious shore he must be a dyin bear so i said to edd lets bast him a couple just fer luck wal when we shot up jumped thet sick bar quickern you could wink an he piled into the thicket while i was goin down after another shell it shore was funny thet old jasper never heard the racket an if he heard it he didnt care he had a bed in thet sunny spot an he was foolin around playin with himself like a kitten playin an edd reckoned he was dyin an i come shore near bein fooled the old jasper well assassinate him fer thet   viii  five more long arduous days we put in chasing bears under the rim from pyles canyon to verde canyon in all we started over a dozen bears but i was inclined to think that we chased the same bears over and over from one canyon to another the boys got a good many longrange shots which however apparently did no damage but as for me the harder and farther i tramped and the longer i watched and waited the less opportunity had i to shoot a bear  this circumstance weighed heavily upon the spirits of my comrades they wore their boots out as well as the feet of the hounds trying to chase a bear somewhere near me and wherever i stayed or went there was the place the bears avoided edd and neilsen lost flesh in this daily toil haught had gloomy moments but as for me the daily tenor fifteenmile grind up and down the steep craggy slopes had at last trained me back to my former vigorous condition and i was happy no one knew it not even rc but the fact was i really did not care in the least whether i shot a bear or not bears were incidental to my hunting trip i had not a little secret glee over the praise accorded me by copple and haught and nielsen who all thought that the way i persevered was remarkable they would have broken their necks to get me a bear at times rc when he was tired fell victim to discouragement and he would make some caustic remark i dont know about you ive a hunch you like to pack a rifle because its heavy and you go dreaming along sometime a bear will rise up and swipe you one  takahashi passed from concern to grief over what he considered my bad luck my goodnish no see bear today maybe more better luck tomorrow if i could have had some of takahashis luck i would scarcely have needed to leave camp he borrowed nielsens 3040 rifle and went hunting without ever having shot it he rode the little buckskin mustang that remarkable to state had not yet thrown him or kicked him and on that occasion he led the mustang back to camp with a fine twopoint buck on the saddle camp need fresh meat said the jap with his broad smile i go hunt ride along old road soon nice fat deer walk out from bush twenty steps awaymaybe i get off i no want kill deer so close so i walk on him deer he no scared he jump off few stepsstick up his earslook at horse all same like he thought him deer too i no aim gun from shoulder i just shoot no good deer he run i aim thenway front of himshootdeer he drop right down dead aw easy to get deer  i would have given a great deal to have been able to describe haughts face when the jap finished his story of killing that deer but such feat was beyond human ingenuity wal ejaculated the hunter in all my days raslin round with fools packin guns i never seen the likes of thet no wonder the japs licked the russians this achievement of takahashis led me to suggest his hunting bear with us aw surei kill bear too he said takahashi outwalked and outclimbed us all he never made detours he climbed straight up or descended straight down copple and edd were compelled to see him take the lead and keep it what a wonderful climber what a picture the sturdy little brown man made carrying a rifle longer than himself agile and surefooted as a goat perfectly at home in the depths or on the heights i took occasion to ask takahashi if he had been used to mountain climbing in japan aw sure i have father own whole mountain more bigger here i climb highsaw wood leetle boy so big and he held his hand about a foot from the ground thus for me every day brought out some further interesting or humorous or remarkable feature pertaining to takahashi  the next day added to the discouragement of my party we drove verde canyon and ran the dogs into a nest of steeltraps big foot was caught in one and only the remarkable size and strength of his leg saved it from being broken nielsen found a poor miserable little fox in a trap where it had been for days and was nearly dead edd found a dead skunk in another he had to call the hounds in we returned to camp that night was really the only cheerless one the men spent around the fire they did not know what to do manifestly with trappers in a locality there could be no more bear chasing disappointment perched upon the countenances of the haughts and copple and nielsen i let them all have their say finally haught spoke up wal fellars im figgerin hard an i reckon heres my stand we jest naturally have to get doc an his brother a bear apiece shore i expected wed get em a couple now them traps we seen are all small we didnt run across no bear traps an i reckon we can risk the dogs well shore go back an drive verde canyon we cant do no worse than break a leg for a dog id hate to see thet happen to old dan or tom but well take a chance  after that there fell a moments silence i could see from edds face what a serious predicament this was nothing was plainer than his fondness for the hounds finally he said sure well take a chance their devotion to my interest their simple earnestness warmed me to them but not for all the bears under the rim would i have been wittingly to blame for old dan or old tom breaking a leg  men ive got a better plan i said well let the bears here rest for a spell supplies are about gone lets go back to beaver dam camp for a week or so rest up the hounds maybe well have a storm and a cold snap that will improve conditions then well come back here ill send haught down to buy off the trappers ill pay them to spring their traps and let us have our hunt without risk of the hounds  instantly the men brightened the insurmountable obstacles seemed to melt away only haught demurred a little at additional and unreasonable expense for me but i cheered him over this hindrance and the last part of that evening round the campfire was very pleasant  the following morning we broke camp and all rode off except haught and his son george who remained to hunt a strayed burro reckon thet lion eat him my best burro he was the one your boy was always playin with im goin to assassinate thet lion  on the way back to beaver dam camp i happened to be near takahashi when he dismounted to shoot at a squirrel returning to get back in the saddle the jap forgot to approach the mustang from the proper side there was a scuffle between takahashi and the mustang as to which of them should possess the bridle the jap lost this argument edd had to repair the broken bridle i watched takahashi and could see that he did not like the mustang any better than the mustang liked him soon the struggle for supremacy would take place between this ill assorted rider and horse i rather felt inclined to favor the latter nevertheless it was only fair to takahashi to admit that his buckskincolored mustang had some mean traits  in due time i arrived at our permanent camp to be the last to get in lee and his father welcomed us as familiar faces in a strange land as i dismounted i heard heavy thuds and cracks accompanied by fierce utterances in a foreign tongue these sounds issued from the corral  ill bet the jap got what was coming to him declared lee  we all ran toward the corral a bunch of horses obstructed our view and we could not see takahashi until we ran round to the other side the jap had the buckskin mustang up in a corner and was vigorously whacking him with a huge pole not by any means was the mustang docile like a mule he kicked hey george yelled lee dont kill him whats the matter  takahashi slammed the mustang one parting blow which broke the club and then he turned to us we could see from dust and dirt on his person that he had lately been in close relation to the earth takahashis face was pale except for a great red lump on his jaw the jap was terribly angry he seemed hurt too with a shaking hand he pointed to the bruise on his jaw  look what he do exclaimed takahashi he throw me off he kick me awful hard i kill him sure next time  lee and i managed to conceal our mirth until our irate cook had gotten out of hearing lookwhathedo choked lee imitating takahashi then lee broke out and roared i had to join him i laughed till i cried my family and friends severely criticise this primitive trait of mine but i can not help it later i went to takahashi and asked to examine his jaw fearing it might have been broken this fear of mine however was unfounded moreover the jap had recovered from his pain and anger more better now he said with a grin maybe my fault anyhow  next day we rested and the following morning was so fine and clear and frosty that we decided to go hunting we rode east on the way to see lake through beautiful deep forest  i saw a deer trotting away into the woods i jumped off jerked out my gun and ran hard hoping to see him in an opening lo i jumped a herd of six more deer some of them bucks they plunged everywhere i tried frantically to get my sights on one all i could aim at was bobbing ears i shot twice and of course missed rc shot four times once at a running buck and three at a small deer that he said was flying  here copple and haught caught up with us we went on and turned off the road on the blazed trail to see lake it was pretty open forest oaks and scattered pines and a few spruce the first park we came to was a flat grassy open with places where deer licked the bare earth copple left several pounds of salt in these spots rc and i went up to the upper end where he had seen deer before no deer this day but saw three turkeys one an old gobbler we lost sight of them  then copple and rc went one way and haught and i another we went clear to the rim and then circled around and eventually met rc and copple together we started to return going down a little draw we found water and rc saw where a rock had been splashed with water and was still wet then i saw a turkey track upon this rock we slipped up the slope with me in the lead as i came out on top i saw five big gobblers feeding strange how these game birds thrilled me one saw me and started to run like a streak another edged away into pines then i espied one with his head and neck behind a tree and he was scratching away in the pine needles i could not see much of him but that little was not running so i drew down upon him tried to aim fine and fired he leaped up with a roar of wings sending the dust and needles flying then he dropped back and like a flash darted into a thicket  another flew straight out of the glade another ran like an ostrich in the same direction i tried to get the sights on him in vain  rc and copple chased these two speeding turkeys and haught and i went the other way we could find no trace of ours and we returned to our horses  presently we heard shots onetwothreepausethen several more and finally more to a total number of fifteen i could not stand that and i had to hurry back into the woods i saw one old gobbler running wildly around as if lost but i did not shoot at him because he seemed to be in line with the direction which rc and copple had taken i should have run after him until he went some other way  i could not find the hunters and returned to our resting place which they had reached ahead of me they had a turkey each gobblers about two years old copple said  rc told an interesting story of how he had run in the direction the two turkeys had taken and suddenly flushed thirty or forty more some big old gobblers but mostly young they scattered and ran he followed as fast as he could shooting a few times copple could not keep up with him but evidently had a few shots himself rc chased most of the flock across several small canyons till he came to a deep canyon here he hoped to make a killing when the turkeys ran up the far slope but they flew across and he heard them clucking over there he crossed and went on cautiously once he saw three turkey heads sticking above a log wise old gobblers they protected their bodies while they watched for him he tried to get sidewise to them but they ran off then he followed until once more he heard clucking  here he sat down just beyond the edge of a canyon and began to call with his turkey wing it thrilled him to hear his calls answered on all sides here was a wonderful opportunity he realized that the turkeys were mostly young and scattered and frightened and wanted to come together he kept calling and as they neared him on all sides he felt something more than the zest of hunting suddenly copple began to shoot spang spang spang rc saw the dust fly under one turkey he heard the bullet glance the next shot killed a turkey then rc yelled that he was no turkey then of that scattering flock he managed to knock over one for himself  copple had been deceived by the call of an amateur that flattered rc but he was keenly disappointed that copple had spoiled the situation  during the day the blue sky was covered by thin flying clouds that gradually thickened and darkened the wind grew keener and colder and veered to the southwest we all said storm there was no sunset darker clouds rolled up obliterating the few stars  we went to bed long after that i heard the swell and roar and crash and lull of the wind in the pines a sound i had learned to love in buckskin forest with buffalo jones at last i fell asleep  sometime in the night i awoke a fine rain was pattering on the tent it grew stronger after a while i went to sleep again upon awakening i found that the storm had struck with a vengeance it was dull gray daylight foggy cold windy with rain and snow  i got up built a fire puttered around the tents to loosen the ground ropes and found that it was nipping cold my fingers ached the storm increased and then we fully appreciated the tent with stove the rain roared on the tent roof and all morning the wind increased and the air grew colder i hoped it would turn to snow  soon indeed we were storm bound on the third day the wind reached a very high velocity the roar in the pines was stupendous many times i heard the dull crash of a falling tree with the ground saturated by the copious rain and the fury of the storm blast a great many trees were felled that night it rained all night not so hard but steadily now low now vigorously after morning snow began to fall but it did not lay long after a while it changed to sleet at times the dark lowering scurrying clouds broke to emit a flare of sunshine and to show a patch of blue these last however were soon obscured by the scudding gray pall every now and then a little shower of rain or sleet pattered on the tents we looked for a clearing up  that night about eight oclock the clouds vanished and stars shone in the night the wind rose and roared in the morning all was dark cloudy raw cold but the wind had died out and there were spots of blue showing these spots enlarged as the morning advanced and about nine the sun golden and dazzling beautified the forest bright sunny days will soon come again  it was good to have hope and belief in that  all the horses but don carlos weathered the storm in good shape don lost considerable weight he had never before been left with hobbled feet to shift for himself in a prolonged storm of rain sleet and snow he had cut himself upon brush and altogether had fared poorly he showed plainly that he had been neglected don was the only horse i had ever known of that did not welcome the wilderness and companionship with his kind  we rested the following day and on the next we packed and started back to dude creek it was a cold raw bitter day with a gale from the north such a day as i could never have endured had i not become hardened as it was i almost enjoyed wind and cold what a transformation in the woods the little lakes were all frozen over pines moss grass were white with frost the sear days had come not a leaf showed in the aspen and maple thickets the scrub oaks were shaggy and ragged gray as the rocks from the rim the slopes looked steely and dark thinned out showing the rocks and slides  when we reached our old camp in barber shop canyon we were all glad to see haughts lost burro waiting for us there not a scratch showed on the shaggy lopeared little beast haught for once unhobbled a burro and set it free without a parting kick nielsen too had observed this omission on haughts part nielsen was a desert man and he knew burros he said prospectors were inclined to show affection for burros by sundry cuffs and kicks and nielsen told me a story about haught it seemed the bear hunter was noted for that habit of kicking burros sometimes he was in fun and sometimes when burros were obstinate he was in earnest upon one occasion a big burro stayed away from camp quite a long timelong enough to incur haughts displeasure he needed the burro and could not find it and all he could do was to hunt for it upon returning to camp there stood the big gray burro lazy and fat just as if he had been perfectly well behaved haught put a halter on the burro using strong language the while and then he proceeded to exercise his habit of kicking burros he kicked this one until its fat belly gave forth sounds exceedingly like a bass drum when haught had ended his exercise he tied up the burro presently a man came running into haughts camp he appeared alarmed he was wet and panting haught recognized him as a miner from a mine nearby hey haught panted the miner hev you seenyour gray burrothet big onewith white face  shore there he is replied haught son of a gun jest rustled home  the miner appeared immensely relieved he looked and looked at the gray burro as if to make sure it was there in the solid flesh a really tangible object then he said we was all afeared youd kick the stuffins out of him not an hour ago he was over at the mine an he ate five sticks of dynamite five sticks for lords sake handle him gently  haught turned pale and suddenly sat down ahuh was all he said but he had a strange hunted look and not for a long time did he ever again kick a burro                                       hunting conditions at dude creek had changed greatly to our benefit the trappers had pulled up stakes and gone to some other section of the country there was not a hunting party within fifteen miles of our camp leaves and acorns were all down trails were soft and easy to travel no dust rose on the southern slopes the days were cold and bright in every pocket and ravine there was water for the dogs from any stand we could see into the shaggy thickets where before all we could see was a blaze of color  in three days we drove pyles canyon dude creek and the small adjoining canyons chasing in all nine bears none of which ran anywhere near rc or me old dan gave out and had to rest every other day so the gloom again began to settle thick over the hopes of my faithful friends long since as in 1918 i had given up expectations of bagging a bear or a buck for rc however my hopes still held good at least i did not give up for him but he shared somewhat the feelings of the men still he worked harder than ever abandoning the idea of waiting on one of the high stands and took to the slopes under the rim where he toiled down and up all day long it pleased me to learn presently that this activity strenuous as it was became a source of delight to him how different such toil was from waiting and watching on the rim  on november first a bitter cold morning with ice in the bright air we went back to pyles canyon and four of us went down with edd and the hounds we had several chases and about the middle of the forenoon i found myself alone making tracks for the saddle overlooking bear canyon along the south side of the slope in the still air the sun was warm but when i got up onto the saddle in an exposed place the wind soon chilled me through i would keep my stand until i nearly froze then i had to go around to the sunny sheltered side and warm up the hounds finally got within hearing again and eventually appeared to be in bear canyon toward the mouth i decided i ought to go round the ridge on the east side and see if i could hear better accordingly i set off and the hard going over the sunny slope was just what i needed when i reached the end of the ridge under the great dome i heard the hounds below me somewhat to my left running and plowing down through the brush i gained the edge of the bluff just in time to see some of the hounds passing on they had run a bear through that thicket and if i had been there sooner i would have been fortunate but too late i worked around the head of this canyon and across a wide promontory again i heard the hounds right under me they came nearer and soon i heard rolling rocks and cracking brush which sounds i believed were made by a bear after a while i espied old tom and rock working up the canyon on a trail then i was sure i would get a shot presently however old tom left the trail and started back rock came on climbed the ridge and hearing me call he came to me i went over to the place where he had climbed out and found an enormous bear track pointing in the direction the hounds had come they had backtrailed him rock went back to join old tom some of the pack were baying at a great rate in the mouth of the next canyon but an impassable cliff prevented me from working around to that point so i had to address myself to the long steep climb upward i had not gone far when i crossed the huge bear track that rock and old tom had given up this track was six inches wide and ten inches long the bear that had made it had come down this very morning from over the ridge east of bear canyon i trailed him up this ridge over the steepest and roughest and wildest part of it marveling at the enormous steps and jumps he made and at the sagacity which caused him to choose this route instead of the saddle trail where i had waited so long his track led up nearly to the rim and proved how he had climbed over the most rugged break in the ridge indeed he was one of the wise old scoundrels when i reached camp i learned that sue and several more of the hounds had held a bear for some time in the box of the canyon just beyond where i had to give up edd and nielsen were across this canyon unable to go farther and then yelled themselves hoarse trying to call some of us i asked edd if he saw the bear sure did replied edd one of them long lean hungry cinnamons i had to laugh and told how near i had come to meeting a bear that was short fat and heavy one of the old jasper scoundrels  that night at dark the wind still blew a gale and seemed more bitterly cold we hugged the campfire my eyes smarted from the smoke and my face grew black before i went to bed i toasted myself so thoroughly that my clothes actually burned me as i lay down but they heated the blankets and that made my bed snug and soon i was in the land of dreams during the night i awoke the wind had lulled the canopy above was clear cold starry beautiful when we rolled out the mercury showed ten above zero perhaps looking at the thermometer made us feel colder but in any event we would have had to move about to keep warm i built a fire and my hands were blocks of ice when i got the blaze stirring  that day so keen and bright so wonderful with its clarity of atmosphere and the breath of winter through the pines promised to be as exciting as it was beautiful maybe this day rc would bag a bear  when we reached the rim the sunrise was just flushing the purple basin flooding with exquisite gold and rose light the slumberous shadows what a glorious wilderness to greet the eye at sunrise i suffered a pang to realize what men missedwhat i had to miss so many wonderful mornings  we had made our plan the hounds had left a bear in the second canyon east of dude edd started down copple and takahashi followed to hug the lower slopes nielsen and haught and george held to the rim to ride east in case the hounds chased a bear that way and rc and i were to try to climb out and down a thin rockcrested ridge which so far as haught knew no one had ever been on  looked at from above this ridge was indeed a beautiful and rugged backbone of rock sloping from the rim extending far out and downa very narrow knifeedge extended promontory green with cedar and pine yellow and gray with its crags and rocks a craggy point comparable to some of those in the grand canyon we had to study a way to get across the first deep fissures and eventually descended far under the crest and climbed back it was desperately hard work for we had so little time rc was to be at the middle of that ridge and i at the end in an hour like trojans we worked some slippery pineneedle slopes we had to run across for light quick steps were the only means of safe travel and that was not safe when we surmounted to the crest we found a jumble of weathered rocks ready to slide down on either side slabs pyramids columns shale rocks of all shapes except round lay toppling along the heaved ridge it seemed the whole ridge was ready to thunder down into the abyss half a mile down and out from the rim we felt lost marooned but there was something splendidly thrilling in our conquest of that narrow upflung edge of mountain twice rc thought we would have to abandon further progress but i found ways to go on how lonely and wild out there no foot save an indians had ever trod those gray rocks or brown mats of pine needles  before we reached the dip or saddle where rc was to make his stand the hounds opened up far below the morning was perfectly still an unusual occurrence there along the rim what wild music then edds horn pealed out ringing melody a long blast keen and clear telling us above that he had started a bear that made us hurry we arrived at the head of an incline leading down to rcs stand as luck would have it the place was ideal for a bear but risky for a hunter a bear could come four ways without being seen until he was close enough to kill a man we hurried on at the saddle there was a broad bear trail with several other trails leading into it suddenly rc halted me with a warning finger listen  i heard a faint clear rifle shot then another and a fainter yell we stood there and counted eleven more shots then the bay of the hounds seemed to grow closer we had little time to pick and choose stands i had yet to reach the end of the ridgea task requiring sevenleague boots but i took time to choose the best possible stand for rc and that was one where a bear approaching from only the east along under the ridge could surprise him in bad places like this we always tried to have our minds made up what to do and where to get in case of being charged by a wounded grizzly in this instance there was not a rock or a tree near at hand rc youll have to stand your ground and kill him thats all i declared grimly but its quiet you can hear a bear coming if you do hear onewaitand make sure your first shot lets him down  dont worry i could hear a squirrel coming over this ground replied rc  then i went on not exactly at ease in mind but stirred and thrilled to the keen charged atmosphere i had to go around under the base of a rocky ledge over rough ground presently i dropped into a bear trail well trodden i followed it to a corner of cliff where it went down then i kept on over loose rock and bare earth washed deep in ruts i had to leap these perhaps in ten minutes i had traveled a quarter of a mile or less then spang rcs rifleshot halted me so clear and sharp so close so startling i was thrilled delightedhe had gotten a shot i wanted to yell my pleasure my blood warmed and my nerves tingled swiftly my thoughts ranbad luck was nothinga man had only to stick at a thingwhat a fine sharp wonderful day for adventure how the hounds bayed had rc sighted a bear somewhere below suddenly the still air splitspang rcs second shot gave me a shock my breast contracted i started back suppose it was a grizzlyon that bad side i muttered spang i began to run a great sweeping wave of emotion charged over me swelling all my veins to the bursting point spang my heart came to my throat leaping the ruts bounding like a sheep from rock to rock i covered my back tracks all inside me seemed to flutter yet i felt cold and harda sickening sense of reproach that i had left my brother in a bad position spang his fifth and last shot followed swiftly after the fourthtoo swift to be accurate so hurriedly a man would act in close quarters rc now had an empty rifle like a flash i crossed that slope leading to the rocks and tore around the cliff at such speed that it was a wonder i did not pitch down and break my neck how longhow terribly long i seemed in reaching the corner of cliff then i plunged to a halt with eyes darting everywhere  rc was not in sight the steep curved neck of slope seemed all rocks all trees all brush then i heard a wild hoarse bawl and a loud crashing of brush my gaze swerved to an open spot a patch of manzanita seemed to blur round a big bear standing up fighting the branches threshing and growling but where was rc fearfully my gaze peered near and all around this wounded bear hey there i yelled with all my might  rcs answer was another spang i heard the bullet hit the bear it must have gone clear through him for i saw bits of fur and manzanita fly the bear plunged out of the bushesout of my sight how he crashed the brushrolled the rocks i listened down and down he crashed then the sound changed somewhat he was rolling at last that thumping sound ceased and after it the roll of rocks  are youall right i shouted  then after a moment that made me breathless i heard rc laugh a little shakily sure am did you see him  yes i think hes your bear  im afraid hes got away the hounds took another bear down the canyon whatll we do  come on down i said  fifty yards or more down the slope we met i showed him a great splotch of blood on a flat stone well find him not far down i said so we slid and crawled and held to brush and rocks following that bloody trail until we came to a ledge from there i espied the bear lodged against a manzanita bush he lay on his back all four paws extended and he was motionless rc and i sat down right there on the ledge  looks pretty bigblack and brownmostly brown i said im glad old man you stuck it out  big exclaimed rc with that same peculiar little laugh he doesnt look big now but up there he looked like a hill what do you think he came up that very way you told me to look out for and if i hadnt had ears hed got right on me as it was when i heard little rolling stones and then saw him he was almost on a level with me my nerve was all right i knew i had him and i made sure of my first shot i knocked him flat but he got uplet out an awful snarland plunged my way i cant say i know he charged me only it was just the same as if he had i knocked him down again and this time he began to kick and jump down the slope that was my best shot think i missed him the next three you see i had time to get shaky if he had kept coming at megood night i had trouble loading but when i got ready again i ran down and saw him in that bush wasnt far from him then when he let out that bawl he saw me i dont know much about bears but i know he wanted to get at me and im sure of what hed have done i didnt miss my last shot  we sat there a while longer slowly calming down wonderful indeed had been some of the moments of thrill but there had been others not conducive to happiness why do men yearn for adventure in wild moments and regret the risks and spilled blood afterward   ix  the hounds enjoyed a wellearned rest the next day rc and i behind haughts back fed them all they could eat the old hunter had a fixed idea that dogs should be kept lean and hungry so they would run bears the better perhaps he was right only i could not withstand old dan and old tom as they limped to me begging and whining yet not even sore feet and hunger could rob these grand old hounds of their dignity for an hour that morning i sat beside them in a sunny spot  in the afternoon copple took me on a last deer hunt for that trip we rode down the canyon a mile and climbed out on the west slope haught had described this country as a wolf to travel he used that word to designate anything particularly tough we found the ridge covered with a dense forest in places a matted jungle of pine saplings these thickets were impenetrable heavy snows had bent the pines so that they grew at an angle we found it necessary to skirt these thickets and at that sometimes had to cut our way through with our little axes hunting was scarcely possible under such conditions still we did not see any deer tracks  eventually we crossed this ridge or at least the jungle part of it and got lower down into hollows and swales full of aspens copple recognized country he had hunted before we made our way up a long shallow hollow that ended in an open where lay the remains of an old log cabin and corrals from under a bluff bubbled a clear beautiful spring copple looked all around slowly with strange expression and at last dismounting he knelt to drink of the spring  ahhgood he exclaimed after a deep draught get down an drink snow water an it never goes dry  indeed it was so cold it made my teeth ache and so pure and sweet that i drank until i could hold no more deer and cat and bear tracks showed along the margin of clean sand lower down were fresh turkey tracks a lonely spring in the woods visited by wild game this place was singularly picturesque and beautiful the purest drinking water is found in wild forest or on mountains men cities civilization contaminate waters that are not isolated  copple told me a man named mitchell had lived in that lonely place thirty years ago copple as a boy had worked for himhad ridden wild bronchos and roped wild steers in that open many and many a day something of unconscious pathos showed in copples eyes as he gazed around and in his voice we all hear the echoing footsteps of the past years in those days copple said the ranch was overrun by wild game and wild horses too  we rode on westward to come out at length on the rim of a magnificent canyon it was the widest and deepest and wildest gorge i had come across in this country so deep that only a faint roar of running water reached our ears the slopes were too steep for man let alone a horse and the huge cliffs and giant spruces gave it a singularly rugged appearance we saw deer on the opposite slope copple led along the edge searching for traces of an old trail where mitchell used to drive cattle across we did not find a trail but we found a place where copple said one used to be i could see no signs of it here leading his horse with one hand and wielding his little axe with the other copple started down for my part i found going down remarkably easy the only trouble i had was to hold on so i would not go down like a flash stockings my horse had in a few weeks become a splendid traveler in the forest he had learned to restrain his spirit and use his intelligence wherever i led he would go and that without any fear there is something fine in constant association with an intelligent horse under such circumstances in bad places stockings braced his forefeet sat on his haunches and slid sometimes making me jump to get out of his way we found the canyon bed a narrow notch darkly rich and green full of the melody of wild birds and murmuring brook with huge rocks all stained gold and russet and grass as high as our knees frost still lingered in the dark cool shady retreat and where the sun struck a narrow strip of the gorge there was warm sweet dry breath of the forest but for the most part down here all was damp dank cool shadow where sunshine never reached and where the smells were of dead leaves and wet moss and ferns and black rich earth  impossible we found it to ascend the other slope where we had seen the deer so we had to ride up the canyon a matter greatly to my liking copple thought i was hunting with him but really except to follow him i did not think of the meaning of his slow wary advance only a few more days had i to roam the pinescented forest that ride up this deep gorge was rich in sensation sun and sky and breeze and forest encompassed me the wilderness was all about me and i regretted when the canyon lost its splendid ruggedness and became like the others i had traversed and at last grew to be a shallow grassy ravine with patches of gray aspens along the tiny brook  as we climbed out once more this time into an open beautiful pine forest with little patches of green thicket i seemed to have been drugged by the fragrance and the color and the beauty of the wild for when copple called low and sharp hist i stared uncomprehendingly at him  deer he whispered pointing get off an smoke em up  something shot through mea different kind of thrill ahead in the open i saw gray graceful wild forms trotting away like a flash i slid off my horse and jerked out my rifle i ran forward a few steps the deer had haltedwere gazing at us with heads up and ears high what a wild beautiful picture as i raised my rifle they seemed to move and vanish in the green the hunter in me roused at last anathematized my miserable luck i ran ahead another few steps to be halted by copple buck he called sharply hurry then farther on in the open out in the sunlight i saw a noble stag moving trotting toward us keen hard fierce in my intensity i aligned the sights upon his breast and fired straight forward and high he bounded to fall with a heavy thud  copples horse startled by my shot began to snort and plunge good shot yelled copple hes our meat  what possessed me i knew not but i ran ahead of copple my eyes searched avidly the bushdotted ground for my quarry the rifle felt hot in my tight grip all inside me was a tumulteager keen wild excitement the great pines the green aisles leading away into the woods the shadows under the thickets the pinepitch tang of the air the loneliness of that lonely forestall these seemed familiar sweet beautiful things mine alone things seen and smelled and felt before things  then suddenly i ran right upon my deer lying motionless dead i thought he appeared fairly large with threepoint antlers i heard copples horse thudding the soft earth behind me and i yelled i got him ben that was a moment of exultation  it ended suddenly something halted me my buck now scarcely fifteen feet from me began to shake and struggle he raised his head uttering a choking gasp i heard the flutter of blood in his throat he raised himself on his front feet and lifted his head high higher until his nose pointed skyward and his antlers lay back upon his shoulders then a strong convulsion shook him i heard the shuddering wrestle of his whole body i heard the gurgle and flow of blood saw the smoke of fresh blood and smelled it i saw a small red spot in his gray breast where my bullet had struck i saw a great bloody gaping hole on his rump where the30 govt expanding bullet had come out from end to end that bullet had torn yet he was not dead straining to rise again  i saw felt all this in one flashing instant and as swiftly my spirit changed what i might have done i never knew but most likely i would have shot him through the brain only a sudden action of the stag paralyzed all my force he lowered his head he saw me and dying with lungs and heart and bowels shot to shreds he edged his stiff front feet toward me he dragged his afterquarters he slid he flopped he skittered convulsively at me no fear in the black distended wild eyes  only hate only terrible wild unquenchable spirit to live long enough to kill me i saw it he meant to kill me how magnificent how horrible this wild courage my eyes seemed riveted upon him as he came closer closer he gasped blood sputtered from his throat but more terrible than agony than imminent death was the spirit of this wild beast to slay its enemy inch by inch he skidded closer to me with a convulsive quivering awful to see no veil of the past no scale of civilization between beast and man then enemies as old as the earth i had shot him to eat and he would kill me before he died for me the moment was monstrous no hunter was i then but a man stricken by the spirit and mystery of life by the agony and terror of death by the awful strange sense that this stag would kill me  but copple galloped up and drawing his revolver he shot the deer through the head it fell in a heap  dont ever go close to a crippled deer admonished my comrade as he leaped off his horse i saw a fellow once that was near killed by a buck hed taken for dead strange the way this buck half stood up reckon he meant bad but he was all in you hit him plumb center  yes ben it wasstrange i replied soberly i caught copples keen dark glance studying me when you open him upsee what my bullet did will you  all right help me hang him to a snag here returned copple as he untied his lasso  when we got the deer strung up i went off into the woods and sat on a log and contended with a queer sort of sickness until it passed away but it left a state of mind that i knew would require me to probe into myself and try to understand once and for all time this bloodthirsy tendency of man to kill it would force me to try to analyze the psychology of hunting upon my return to copple i found he had the buck ready to load upon his horse his hands were bright red he was wiping his huntingknife on a bunch of green pine needles  that 150grain softnose bullet is some executioner he declared forcefully your bullet mushroomed just after it went into his breast it tore his lung to pieces cut open his heart made a mess of kidneys an paunch an broke his spine an look at this hole where it came out  i helped copple heave the load on his saddle and tie it securely and i got my hands red at the job but i did not really look at the buck again and upon our way back to camp i rode in the lead all the way we reached camp before sunset where i had to endure the felicitations of rc and my comrades all of whom were delighted that at last i had gotten a buck takahashi smiled all over his broad brown face my goodnish i awful glad nice fat deer  that night i lay awake a long time and though aware of the moan of the wind in the pines and the tinkle of the brook and the melancholy hoot of an owl and later the still sad black silence of the midnight hours i really had no pleasure in them my mind was active  boys are inherently cruel the games they play at least those they invent instinctively partake of some element of brute nature they chase they capture they imprison they torture and they kill no secret rendezvous of a boys pirate gang ever failed to be soaked with imaginary blood and what group of boys have not played at being pirates the indian games are worsescalping with redhot cinders thrown upon the bleeding head and the terrible running of the gauntlet and burning at the stake  what youngster has not made wooden knives to spill the blood of his pretended enemies little girls play with dolls and with toy houses and all the implements of making a home but sweet and dear as the little angels are they love a boys game and if they can through some lucky accident participate in one it is to scream and shudder and fight indeed like the females of the species no break here between these little mothers of dollbabies and the bloody mothers of the french revolution or of dusky naked barbarian children of a primitive day  boys love the chase and that chase depends upon environment for want of wild game they will harry a poor miserable tomcat with sticks and stones i belonged once to a gang of young ruffians who chased the neighbors chickens killed them with clubs and cooked them in tin cans over a hidden fire boys love nothing so much as to chase a squirrel or a frightened little chipmunk back and forth along a rail fence they brandish their sticks run and yell dart to and fro like young indians they rob birds nests steal the eggs pierce them and blow them they capture the young birds and are not above killing the parents that fly frantically to the rescue i knew of boys who ground captured birds to death on a grindstone who has not seen a boy fling stones at a helpless hoptoad  as boys grow older to the age of reading they select or at least love best those stories of bloodshed and violence stevenson wrote that boys read for some element of the brute instinct in them his two wonderful books treasure island and kidnapped are full of fight and the killing of men robinson crusoe is the only great boys book i ever read that did not owe its charm to fighting but still did not old crusoe fight to live on his lonely island and this wonderful tale is full of hunting and has at the end the battle with cannibals  when lads grow up they become hunters almost without exception at least in spirit if not in deed early days and environment decide whether or not a man becomes a hunter in all my life i have met only two grown men who did not care to go prowling and hunting in the woods with a gun an exception proves a great deal but all the same most men whether they have a chance or not love to hunt hunters therefore there are of many degrees hunters of the lowly cottontail and the woodland squirrel hunters of quail woodcock and grouse hunters of wild ducks and geese hunters of foxesthe redcoated english and the homespun clad american hunterswhich is a kinder name for trappersof beaver marten otter mink all the furred animals hunters of deer cat wolf bear antelope elk moose caribou hunters of the barren lands where the ice is king and where there are polar bears white foxes muskox walrus hunters of different animals of different countries african hunters for lion rhinoceros elephant buffalo eland hartebeest giraffe and a hundred species made known to all the world by such classical sportsmen as selous roosevelt stewart edward white  but they are all hunters and their game is the deadly chase in the open or the wild there are hunters who hate action who hate to walk and climb and toil and wear themselves out to get a shot such men are hunters still but still not men there are hunters who have game driven up to them i heard a story told by an officer whom i believe in the early days of the war he found himself somewhere on the border between austria and germany he was invited to a hunt by personages of high degree they motored to a sequestered palace in the forest and next day motored to a shootinglodge at daylight he was called and taken to the edge of a forest and stationed in an open glade his stand was an upholstered divan placed high in the forks of a tree his guide told him that pretty soon a doe would come out of the forest but he was not to shoot it in fifteen minutes a lame buck would come out but he was not to shoot that one either in ten more minutes another buck would come out and this third deer he was to kill my informant told me this was all very seriously meant the gun given him was large enough in calibre to kill an elephant he walked up the steps to the comfortable divan and settled himself to await events the doe trotted out exactly on schedule time so did the lame buck they came from the woods and were not frightened the third deer a large buck was a few moments latethree minutes to be exact according to instructions the american killed this bucka matter that took some nerve he said for the buck walked out like a cow that night a big supper was given in the guests honor he had to eat certain parts of the buck he had killed and drink flagons of wine this kind of hunting must be peculiarly german or austrian and illustrates the peculiar hunting ways of men  a celebrated bear hunter and guide of the northwest told me that for twenty years he had been taking eastern ministerspreachers of the gospelon hunting trips into the wild he assured me that of all the bloody murdererswaders in gore as he expressed itthese teachers of the gospel were the worst the moment they got out into the wild they wanted to kill kill kill he averred their natures seemed utterly to change  in reading the books of hunters and in listening to their talks at campfire club dinners i have always been struck with the expression of what these hunters felt what they thought they got out of hunting the change from city to the open wilderness the difference between noise tumult dirt foul air and the silence the quiet the cleanness and purity the sweet breath of gods country as so many called it the beauty of forest and mountain the wildness of ridge and valley the wonder of wild animals in their native haunts and the zest the joy the excitement the magnificent thrill of the stalk and the chase no one of them ever dwelt upon the kill it was mentioned as a result an end a consummation how strange that hunters believed these were the attractions of the chase they felt them to be sure in some degree or they would not remember them but they never realized that these sensations were only incidental to hunting  men take long rides hundreds and thousands of miles to hunt they endure hardships live in camps with absolute joy they stalk through the forest climb the craggy peaks labor as giants in the building of the pyramids all with a tight clutch on a deadly rifle they are keen intent strained quiveringly eager all with a tight clutch on a deadly rifle if hunters think while on a stalkwhich matter i doubt considerablythey think about the lay of the land or the aspect of it of the habits and possibilities of their quarry of their labor and chances and particularly of the vague unrealized sense of comfort pleasure satisfaction in the moment tight muscles alert eyes stealthy steps stalk and run and crawl and climb breathlessness a hot closepressed chest thrill on thrill and sheer bursting riot of nerve and veinthese are the ordinary sensations and actions of a hunter no ascent too loftyno descent too perilous for him then if he is a man as well as a hunter  take the brazilian hunter of the jungle he is solitary he is sufficient to himself he is a survival of the fittest the number of his tribe are few nature sees to that but he must eat and therefore he hunts he spears fish and he kills birds and beasts with a blowgun he hunts to live but the manner of his action though more skilful is the same as any hunters likewise his sensations perhaps more vivid because hunting for him is a matter of life or death take the gaucho of patagoniathe silent lonely indian hunter of the pampas he hunts with a bola a thin thong or string at each end of which is a heavy leathercovered ball of stone or iron this the gaucho hurls through the air at the neck or legs of his quarry the balls fly roundthe thong binds tightit is a deadly weapon the user of it rides and stalks and sees and throws and feels the same as any other hunter time and place weapon and game have little to do with any differences in hunters  up to this 1919 hunting trip in the wilds i had always marveled at the fact that naturalists and biologists hate sportsmen not hunters like the yellow knife indians or the snakeeating bushmen of australia or the terradelfuegians or even the native country rabbithuntersbut the socalled sportsmen naturalists and biologists have simply learned the truth why men hunt and that when it is done in the name of sport or for sensation it is a degenerate business stevenson wrote beautiful words about the hunter home from the hill but so far as i can find out he never killed anything himself he was concerned with the romance of the thought with alliteration and the singular charm of the truthsunset and the end of the day the hunters plod down the hill to the cottage to the home where wife and children awaited him indeed it is a beautiful truth and not altogether in the past for there are still farmers and pioneers  hunting is a savage primordial instinct inherited from our ancestors it goes back through all the ages of man and farther stillto the age when man was not man but hairy ape or some other beast from which we are descended to kill is in the very marrow of our bones if man after he developed into human state had taken to vegetable dietwhich he never did takehe yet would have inherited the flesheating instincts of his animal forebears and no instinct is ever wholly eradicated but man was a meat eater by brute strength by sagacity by endurance he killed in order to get the means of subsistence if he did not kill he starved and it is a matter of record even down to modern times that man has existed by cannibalism  the caveman stalked from his hole under a cliff boldly forth with his huge club or stone mace perhaps he stole his neighbors woman but if so he had more reason to hunt than beforehe had to feed her as well as himself this caveman savagely descended savagely surrounded must have had to hunt all the daylight hours and surely had to fight to kill his food or to keep it after he killed it long long ages was the being called caveman in developing more long ages he lived on the earth in that dim dark mystic past and just as long were his descendants growing into another and higher type of barbarian but they and their children and grandchildren and all their successive innumerable and varying descendants had to hunt meat and eat meat to live  the brain of barbarian man was small as shown by the size and shape of his skull but there is no reason to believe its construction and use were any different from the use of other organsthe eye to see withthe ear to hear withthe palate to taste with whatever the brain of primitive man was it held at birth unlimited and innumerable instincts like those of its progenitors and round and smooth in babyhood as it was it surely gathered its sensations one after another in separate and habitual channels until when manhood arrived it had its convolutions its folds and wrinkles and if instinct and tendency were born in the brain how truly must they be a part of bone tissue blood  we cannot escape our inheritance civilization is merely a veneer a thinskinned polish over the savage and crude nature fear anger lust the three great primal instincts are restrained but they live powerfully in the breast of man self preservation is the first law of human life and is included in fear fear of death is the first instinct then if for thousands perhaps millions of years man had to hunt because of his fear of death had to kill meat to surviveconsider the ineradicable and permanent nature of the instinct  the secret now of the instinctive joy and thrill and wildness of the chase lies clear  stealing through the forest or along the mountain slope eyes roving ears sensitive to all vibrations of the air nose as keen as that of a hound hands tight on a deadly rifle we unconsciously go back we go back to the primitive to the savage state of man therein lies the joy how sweet vague unreal those sensations of strange familiarity with wild places we know we never saw before but a million years before that hour a hairy ancestor of ours felt the same way in the same kind of a place and in us that instinct survives that is the secret of the wonderful strange charm of wild places of the barren rocks of the desert wilderness of the greatwalled lonely canyons something now in our blood in our bones once danced in men who lived then in similar places and lived by hunting  the child is father to the man in the light of this instinct how easy to understand his boyish cruelty he is true to nature unlimited and infinite in his imagination when he huntswhether with his toys or with real weapons if he flings a stone and kills a toad he is instinctively killing meat for his home in the cave how little difference between the lad and the man for a man the most poignantly exciting the most thrillingly wild is the chase when he is weaponless when he runs and kills his quarry with a club here we have the essence of the matter the hunter is proudest of his achievement in which he has not had the help of deadly weapons unconsciously he will brag and glow over that conquest wherein lay greatest peril to himwhen he had nothing but his naked hands what a hot gush of blood bursts over him he goes back to his barbarian state when a man only felt the savage lived in his sensations he saw heard smelled tasted touched but seldom thought the earthy the elemental of eye and ear and skin surrounded him when the man goes into the wilderness to change into a hunter that surviving kinship with the savage revives in his being and all unconsciously dominates him with driving passion passion it is because for long he has been restrained in the public haunts of men his real nature has been hidden the hunting of game inhibits his thoughts he feels only he forgets himself he sees the track he hears the stealthy step he smells the wild scent and his blood dances with the dance of the ages then he is a killer then the ages roll back then he is brother to the savage then all unconsciously he lives the chase the fight the deathdealing moment as they were lived by all his ancestors down through the misty past  what then should be the attitude of a thoughtful man toward this liberation of an instinctthat is to say toward the game or sport or habit of hunting to kill not easily could i decide this for myself after all life is a battle eternally we are compelled to fight if we do not fight if we do not keep our bodies strong supple healthy soon we succumb to some germ or other that gets a hold in our blood or lungs and fights for its life its species until it kills us fight therefore is absolutely necessary to long life and alas eventually that fight must be lost the savages the babylonians the persians the greeks all worshipped physical prowess in man manhood strengththe symbols of fight to be physically strong and well a man must work hard with frequent intervals of change of exercise and he must eat meat i am not a great meat eater but i doubt if i could do much physical labor or any brain work on a vegetable diet therefore i hold it fair and manly to go once a year to the wilderness to hunt let that hunt be clean hard toil as hard as i can stand perhaps nature created the lower animals for the use of man if i had been the creator i think i would have made it possible for the socalled higher animal man to live on air  somewhere i read a strange remarkable story about monkeys and priests in the jungle of india an old order of priests had from time out of mind sent two of their comrades into the jungle to live with the monkeys to tame them feed them study them love them and these priests told an incredible story yet one that haunted with its possibilities of truth after a long term of years in which one certain priest had lived with the monkeys and they had learned truly he meant them no harm and only loved them at rare moments an old monkey would come to him and weep and weep in the most terrible and tragic manner this monkey wanted to tell something but could not speak but the priest knew that the monkey was trying to tell him how once the monkey people had been human like him only they had retrograded in the strange scale of evolution and the terrible weeping was for lossloss of physical stature of speech perhaps of soul  what a profound and stunning idea does evolution work backward could nature in its relentless inscrutable design for the unattainable perfection have developed man only to start him backward toward the dim ages whence he sprang who knows but every man can love wild animals every man can study and try to understand the intelligence of his horse the loyalty of his dog and every hunter can hunt less with his instinct and more with an understanding of his needs and a consideration for the beasts only the creator knows   x  the last day of everything always comes time like the tide waits for no man anticipation is beautiful but it is best and happiest to enjoy the present live while we may  on this last day of my hunt we were up almost before it was light enough to see the morning star shone radiant in the dark gray sky all the other stars seemed dimmed by its glory silent as a grave was the forest i started a fire chopped wood so vigorously that i awakened nielsen who came forth like a burly caveman and i washed hands and face in the icy cold brook by the time breakfast was over the gold of the rising sun was tipping the highest pines on the ridges  we started on foot leaving the horses hobbled near camp all the hounds appeared fit even old dan trotted along friskily pyle a neighbor of haughts had come to take a hunt with us bringing two dogs with him for this last day i had formulated a plan edd and one of the boys were to take the hounds down on the east side of the great ridge that made the eastern wall of dude canyon rc was to climb out on this ridge and take his position at the most advantageous point we had already chased half a dozen bears over this saddle one of which was the big frostycoated grizzly that edd and nielsen had shot at the rest of us hurried to the head of dude canyon copple and i were to go down to the first promontories under the rim the others were to await developments and go where haught thought best to send them  copple and i started down over and around the crags going carefully until we reached the open slope under the rimrock it seemed this morning that i was fresh eager agile like a goat on my feet in my consciousness of this i boasted to copple that i would dislodge fewer stones and so make less noise than he the canyon sloped at an angle of about fortyfive degrees and we slid stepped jumped and ran down without starting an avalanche  when we descended to the first bare cape of projecting rock the hour was the earliest in which i had been down under the rim all the canyon and the great green gulf below were unusually fresh and beautiful i heard the lonely call of strange birds and the low murmur of running water an eagle soared in the sunlight high above us to the east rose the magnificent slope of dude canyon i gazed up to the black and green and silver ascent up to the goldtipped craggy crest where rc had his stand i knew he could see me but i could not see him afterward he told me that my red cap shone clearly out of green and gray so he had no difficulty in keeping track of my whereabouts the thickets of aspens and oaks seemed now to stand on end how dark in the shade and steely and cold they looked that giant ridge still obstructed the sun and all on this side of it under its frowning crest and slope was dark and fresh and cool in shadow the ravines were choked black with spruce trees here along this gray shady slant of wall in niches and cracks and under ledges and on benches were the beds of the bears even as i gazed momentarily i expected to see a bear it looked two hundred yards across the canyon from where we stood but copple declared it was a thousand on our other side capes and benches and groves were bright in sunshine clear across the rough breaks to the west wall of dude canyon i saw a flock of wild pigeons below way out and beyond rolled the floor of the basin green and vast like a ridged sea of pines to the bold black mazatzals so hauntingly beckoning from the distance copple spoke now and then but i wanted to be silent how wild and wonderful this place in the early morning  but i had not long to meditate and revel in beauty and wildness far down across the mouth of the canyon at the extreme southern end of that vast oak thicket the hounds gave tongue old dan first in the still cool air how his great wolfbay rang out the wildness of the time and place already edd and pyle had rounded the end of the east ridge and were coming up along the slope of dude canyon  hounds workin round declared copple now ill tell you what last night a bear was feedin along that end of the thicket the hounds are millin round tryin to straighten out his trail its a dead cinch theyll jump a bear an well see him  look everywhere i cautioned copple and my eyes roved and strained over all that vast slope suddenly i espied the flash of something black far down the thicket and tried to show it to my comrade  lets go around an down to that lower point of rock its a better stand than this closer to the thicket an commands those by golly i see what you see thats a bear slippin down stay with me now  staying with copple was a matter of utter disregard of clothes limbs life he plunged off that bare ledge slid flat on his back and wormed feet first under manzanita and gaining open slope got up to run and jump into another thicket by staying with him i saw that i would have a way opened through the brush and something to fall upon if i fell he rimmed the edge of a deep gorge that made me dizzy he leaped cracks he let himself down over a ledge by holding to bushes he found steps to descend little bluffs and he flew across the open slides of weathered rock i was afraid this short cut to the lower projecting cape of rock would end suddenly on some impassable break or cliff but though the travel grew rough we still kept on i wore only boots trousers and shirt and cap with cartridge belt strapped tight around me it was a wonder i was not stripped some of my rags went to decorate the wake we left down that succession of ledges but we made it with me at least bruised and ragged dusty and choked and absolutely breathless my body burned as with fire hot sweat ran in streams down my chest at last we reached the bare flat projecting cape of rock and indeed it afforded an exceedingly favorable outlook i had to sink down on the rock i could not talk until i got my breath but i used my eyes to every advantage neither copple nor i could locate the black moving object we had seen from above we were much closer to the hounds though they still were baying a tangled cross trail fortunate it was for me that i was given these few moments to rest from my tremendous exertions  my eyes searched the leafcovered slope so brown and sear and the shaggy thickets and tried to pierce the black tangle of spruce patches all at once magically it seemed my gaze held to a dark shadow a bit of dense shade under a large spruce tree something moved then a big bear rose right out of his bed of leaves majestically as if disturbed and turned his head back toward the direction of the baying hounds next he walked out he stopped i was quivering with eagerness to tell copple but i waited then the bear walked behind a tree and peeped out only his head showing after a moment again he walked out  ben arent you ever going to see him i cried at last  what ejaculated copple in surprise  bear and i pointed this side of dead spruce  no reckon you see a stump by golly i see him hes a dandy reddish color doc hes one of them mean old cinnamons  watch what will he doben he hears the hounds  how singularly thrilling to see him how slowly he walked how devoid of fear how stately  sure he hears them see him look back the sonofagun ill bet hes given us the bearlaugh more than once  ben how far away is he i asked  oh thats eight hundred yards declared copple a long shot lets wait he may work down closer but most likely hell run uphill  if he climbs hell go right to rcs stand i said gazing upward  sure will theres no other saddle  then i decided that i would not shoot at him unless he started down my excitement was difficult to control i found it impossible to attend to my sensations to think about what i was feeling but the moment was full of suspense the bear went into a small clump of spruces and stayed there a little while tantalizing moments the hounds were hot upon his trail still working to and fro in the oak thicket i judged scarcely a mile separated them from the bear again he disappeared behind a little bush remembering that five pairs of sharp eyes could see me from the points above i stood up and waved my red cap i waved it wildly as a man waves a red flag in moments of danger afterward rc said he saw me plainly and understood my action again the bear had showed this time on an open slide where he had halted he was looking across the canyon while i waved my cap  ben could he see us so far i asked  by golly ill bet he does see us you get to smokin him up an if you hit him dont be nervous if he starts for us cinnamons are bad customers lay out five extra shells an make up your mind to kill him  i dropped upon one knee the bear started down coming towards us over an open slide aim a little coarse an follow him said copple i did so and tightening all my muscles into a ball holding my breath i fired the bear gave a savage kick backwards he jerked back to bite at his haunch a growl low angry vicious followed the echoes of my rifle then it seemed he pointed his head toward us and began to run down the slope looking our way all the time  by golly yelled copple you stung him one an hes comin now youve got to shoot some he can roll downhill an run uphill like a jack rabbit take your timewait for open shotsan make sure  copples advice brought home to me what could happen even with the advantage on my side also it brought the cold tight prickle to my skin the shudder that was not a thrill the pressure of blood running too swiftly i did not feel myself shake but the rifle was unsteady i rested an elbow on my knee yet still i had difficulty in keeping the sight on him i could get it on him but could not keep it there again he came out into the open at the head of a yellow slide that reached to a thicket below i must not hurry yet i had to hurry after all he had not so far to come and most of the distance was under cover through my mind flashed haughts story of a cinnamon that kept coming with ten bullets in him  doc hes paddin along warned copple smoke some of them shells  straining every nerve i aimed as before only a little in advance held tight and pulled at the same instant the bear doubled up in a ball and began to roll down the slide he scattered the leaves then into the thicket he crashed knocking the oaks and cracking the brush  some shot yelled copple hes your bear  but my bear continued to crash through the brush i shot again and yet again missing both times apparently he was coming faster nowand then he showed dark almost at the foot of our slope trees were thick there i could not see there and i could not look for bear and reload at the same moment my fingers were not very nimble  dont shoot shouted copple hes your bear i never make any mistakes when i see game hit  but i see him coming  where by golly thats another bear hes black yours is red look sharp next time he shows smoke him  i saw a flash of black across an open spacei heard a scattering of gravel but i had no chance to shoot then both of us heard a bear running in thick leaves  hes gone down the canyon said copple now look for your bear  listen ben the hounds are coming fast theres rocktheres sue  i see them old danwhat do you think of that old dog thereyour red bears still comin  hes bad hurt  though copple tried hard to show me where and i strained my eyes i could not see the bear i could not locate the threshing of brush i knew it seemed close enough for me to be glad i was not down in that thicket how the hounds made the welkin ring rock was in the lead sue was next and old dan must have found the speed of his best days strange he did not bay all down that slope when rock and sue headed the bear then i saw him he sat up on his haunches ready to fight but they did not attack him instead they began to yelp wildly i dared not shoot again for fear of hitting one of them old dan just beat the rest of the pack to the bear up pealed a yelping chorus i had never heard old dan bay a bear at close range with deep hoarse quick wild roars he dominated that medley a box canyon took up the bays cracking them back in echo from wall to wall  from the saddle of the great ridge above pealed down rcs waahoo  i saw him silhouetted dark against the sky line he waved and i answered then he disappeared  nielsen bellowed from the craggy cape above and behind us from down the canyon edd sent up his piercing ki yi then takahashi appeared opposite to us like a goat on a promontory how his banzai rang above the baying of the hounds  wed better hurry down an across said copple reckon the hounds will jump that bear or some one else will get there first we got to skedaddle  as before we fell into a manzanita thicket and had to crawl then we came out upon the rim of a box canyon where the echoes made such a din it was too steep to descend we had to head it and copple took chances loose boulders tripped me and stout bushes saved me we knocked streams of rock and gravel down into this gorge sending up a roar as of falling water but we got around a steep slope lay below all pine needles and leaves from this point i saw edd on the opposite slope  i stopped one bear i yelled hurry look out for the dogs  then imitating copple i sat down and slid as on a toboggan for some thirty thrilling yards some of my anatomy and more of my rags i left behind me but it was too exciting then to think of hurts i managed to protect at least my rifle copple was charging into the thicket below i followed him into the dark gorge where huge boulders lay and a swift brook ran and leaves two feet deep carpeted the shady canyon bed it was gloomy down into the lower part i saw where bear had turned over the leaves making a dark track  the hounds have quit called copple suddenly i told you he was your bear  we yelled somebody above us answered then we climbed up the opposite slope through a dense thicket crossing a fresh bear track a running track and soon came into an open rocky slide where my bear lay surrounded by the hounds with old dan on guard the bear was red in color with silky fur a long keen head and fine limbs and of goodly size  cinnamon declared copple and turning him over he pointed to a white spot on his breast fine bear about four hundred pounds maybe not so heavy but hell take some packin up to the rim  then i became aware of the other men takahashi had arrived on the scene first finding the bear dead edd came next and after him pyle  i sat down for a much needed rest copple interested himself in examining the bear finding that my first shot had hit him in the flank and my second had gone through the middle of his body next copple amused himself by taking pictures of bear and hounds old dan came to me and lay beside me and looked as if to say well we got him  yells from both sides of the canyon were answered by edd rc was rolling the rocks on his side at a great rate but nielsen on the other side beat him to us the norwegian crashed the brush sent the avalanches roaring and eventually reached us all dirty ragged bloody with fire in his eye he had come all the way from the rim in short order what a performance that must have been he said he thought he might be needed rc guided by edds yells came cracking the brush down to us pale he was and wet with sweat and there were black brush marks across his face his eyes were keen and sharp he had started down for the same reason as nielsens but he had to descend a slope so steep that he had to hold on to keep from sliding down and he had jumped a big bear out of a bed of leaves the bed was still warm rc said he had smelled bear and that his toboggan slide down that slope with bears all around for all he knew had started the cold sweat on him  presently george haught joined us having come down the bed of the canyon  we knew youd got a bear said george father heard the first two bullets hit meat an i heard him rollin down the slope  well exclaimed rc thats what made those first two shots sound so strange to me different from the last two sounded like soft dead pats and it was lead hitting flesh i heard it half a mile away  this matter of the sound of bullets hitting flesh and being heard at a great distance seemed to me the most remarkable feature of our hunt later i asked haught he said he heard my first two bullets strike and believed from the peculiar sound that i had my bear and his stand was fully a mile away but the morning was unusually still and sound carried far  the men hung my bear from the forks of a maple then they decided to give us time to climb up to our stands before putting the hounds on the other fresh trail  nielsen rc and i started to climb back up to the points only plenty of time made it possible to scale those rugged bluffs nielsen distanced us and eventually we became separated the sun grew warm the bees hummed after a while we heard the baying of the hounds they were working westward under the bases of the bluffs we rimmed the heads of several gorges climbed and crossed the west ridge of dude canyon and lost the hounds somewhere as we traveled  rc did not seem to mind this misfortune any more than i we were content resting a while we chose the most accessible ridge and started the long climb to the rim westward under us opened a great noble canyon full of forests thicketed slopes cliffs and caves and crags next time we rested we again heard the hounds far away at first but gradually drawing closer in half an hour they appeared right under us again their baying however grew desultory and lacked the stirring note finally we heard edd calling and whistling to them after that for a while all was still then pealed up the clear tuneful melody of edds horn calling off the chase for that day and season  all over said rc are you glad  for old dans sake and toms and the bearsyes i replied  me too but id never get enough of this country  we proceeded on our ascent over and up the broken masses of rock climbing slowly and easily making frequent and long rests we liked to linger in the sun on the warm piny mossy benches every shady cedar or juniper wooed us to tarry a moment old bear tracks and fresh deer tracks held the same interest though our hunt was over above us the gray broken mass of rim towered and loomed more formidable as we neared it sometimes we talked a little but mostly we were silent  illustration meat in camp  illustration 2 meat in camp  like an indian at every pause i gazed out into the void how sweeping and grand the long sloping lines of ridges from the rim down away in the east ragged spurs of peaks showed hazily like uncertain mountains on the desert south ranged the upheaved and wild mazatzals everywhere beneath me for leagues and leagues extended the timbered hills of green the gray outcroppings of rocks the red bluffs the golden patches of grassy valleys lost in the canyons all these swept away in a vast billowy ocean of wilderness to become dim in the purple of distance and the sun was setting in a blaze of gold from the rim i took a last lingering look and did not marvel that i loved this wonderland of arizona  illustration burros packed for the trail  illustration the deadly cholla most poisonous and pain inflicting of the cactus     chapter v   death valley  of the five hundred and fiftyseven thousand square miles of desertland in the southwest death valley is the lowest below sea level the most arid and desolate it derives its felicitous name from the earliest days of the gold strike in california when a caravan of mormons numbering about seventy struck out from salt lake to cross the mojave desert and make a short cut to the gold fields all but two of these prospectors perished in the deep ironwalled ghastly sinkholes which from that time became known as death valley  the survivors of this fatal expedition brought news to the world that the sombre valley of death was a treasure mine of minerals and since then hundreds of prospectors and wanderers have lost their lives there to seek gold and to live in the lonely waste places of the earth have been and ever will be driving passions of men  my companion on this trip was a norwegian named nielsen on most of my trips to lonely and wild places i have been fortunate as to comrades or guides the circumstances of my meeting nielsen were so singular that i think they will serve as an interesting introduction some years ago i received a letter brief clear and wellwritten in which the writer stated that he had been a wanderer over the world a sailor before the mast and was now a prospector for gold he had taken four trips alone down into the desert of sonora and in many other places of the southwest and knew the prospecting game somewhere he had run across my story desert gold in which i told about a lost gold mine and the point of his letter was that if i could give him some idea as to where the lost gold mine was located he would go find it and give me half his name was sievert nielsen i wrote him that to my regret the lost gold mine existed only in my imagination but if he would come to avalon to see me perhaps we might both profit by such a meeting to my surprise he came he was a man of about thirtyfive of magnificent physique weighing about one hundred and ninety and he was so enormously broad across the shoulders that he did not look his five feet ten he had a wonderful head huge round solid like a cannonball and his bronzed face his regular features square firm jaw and clear gray eyes fearless and direct were singularly attractive to me well educated with a strange calm poise and a cool courtesy not common in americans he evidently was a man of good family by his own choice a rolling stone and adventurer  nielsen accompanied me on two trips into the wilderness of arizona on one of which he saved my life and on the other he rescued all our party from a most uncomfortable and possibly hazardous situationbut these are tales i may tell elsewhere in january 1919 nielsen and i traveled around the desert of southern california from palm springs to picacho and in march we went to death valley  nowadays a little railroad the tonapah and tidewater railroad runs northward from the santa fe over the barren mojave and it passes within fifty miles of death valley  it was sunset when we arrived at death valley junctiona weird strange sunset in drooping curtains of transparent cloud lighting up dark mountain ranges some peaks of which were clearcut and black against the sky and others veiled in trailing storms and still others white with snow that night in the dingy little store i heard prospectors talk about float which meant gold on the surface and about high grade ores zinc copper silver lead manganese and about how borax was mined thirty years ago and hauled out of death valley by teams of twenty mules next morning while nielsen packed the outfit i visited the borax mill it was the property of an english firm and the work of hauling grinding roasting borax ore went on day and night inside it was as dusty and full of a powdery atmosphere as an oldfashioned flour mill the ore was hauled by train from some twenty miles over toward the valley and was dumped from a high trestle into shutes that fed the grinders for an hour i watched this constant stream of borax as it slid down into the hungry crushers and i listened to the chalkfaced operator who yelled in my ear once he picked a piece of gypsum out of the borax he said the mill was getting out twentyfive hundred sacks a day the most significant thing he said was that men did not last long at such labor and in the mines six months appeared to be the limit of human endurance how soon i had enough of that choking air in the room where the borax was ground and the place where the borax was roasted in huge round revolving furnacesi found that intolerable when i got out into the cool clean desert air i felt an immeasurable relief and that relief made me thoughtful of the lives of men who labored who were chained by necessity by duty or habit or by love to the hard tasks of the world it did not seem fair these laborers of the borax mines and mills like the stokers of ships and coaldiggers and blastfurnace handslike thousands and millions of men killed themselves outright or impaired their strength and when they were gone or rendered useless others were found to take their places whenever i come in contact with some phase of this problem of life i take the meaning or the lesson of it to myself and as the years go by my respect and reverence and wonder increase for these men of elemental lives these hornyhanded toilers with physical things these uncomplaining users of brawn and bone these giants who breast the elements who till the earth and handle iron who fight the natural forces with their bodies  that day about noon i looked back down the long gravel and greasewood slope which we had ascended and i saw the boraxmill now only a smoky blot on the desert floor when we reached the pass between the black mountains and the funeral mountains we left the road and were soon lost to the works of man how strange a gladness a relief something dropped away from me i felt the same subtle change in nielsen for one thing he stopped talking except an occasional word to the mules  the blunt end of the funeral range was as remarkable as its name it sheered up very high a sawtoothed range with colored strata tilted at an angle of fortyfive degrees zigzag veins of black and red and yellow rather dull ran through the great drabgray mass this end of the range an iron mountain frowned down upon us with hard and formidable aspect the peak was draped in streaky veils of rain from lowdropping clouds that appeared to have lodged there all below lay clear and cold in the sunlight  illustration the colored calico mountains  illustration down the long winding wash to death valley  our direction lay to the westward and at that altitude about three thousand feet how pleasant to face the sun for the wind was cold the narrow shallow wash leading down from the pass deepened widened almost imperceptibly at first and then gradually until its proportions were striking it was a gully where the gravel washed down during rains and where a scant vegetation greasewood and few low cacti and scrubby sage struggled for existence not a bird or lizard or living creature in sight the trail was getting lonely from time to time i looked back because as we could not see far ahead all the superb scene spread and towered behind us by and bye our wash grew to be a wide canyon winding away from under the massive impondering wall of the funeral range the high side of this magnificent and impressive line of mountains faced westa succession of unscalable slopes of bare ragged rock jagged and jutted dark drab rusty iron with gray and oblique strata running through them far as eye could see clouds soared around the peaks shadows sailed along the slopes  illustration desolation and decay looking down over the denuded ridges to the stark valley of death  walking in loose gravel was as hard as trudging along in sand after about fifteen miles i began to have leaden feet i did not mind hard work but i wanted to avoid overexertion when i am extremely wearied my feelings are liable to be colored somewhat by depression or melancholy then it always bothered me to get tired while nielsen kept on with his wonderful stride  say nielsen do you take me for a yaqui i complained slow up a little  then he obliged me and to cheer me up he told me about a little tramping experience he had in baja california somewhere on the east slope of the sierra madre his burros strayed or were killed by mountainlions and he found it imperative to strike at once for the nearest ranch below the border a distance of one hundred and fifty miles he could carry only so much of his outfit and as some of it was valuable to him he discarded all his food except a few biscuits and a canteen of water resting only a few hours without sleep at all he walked the hundred and fifty miles in three days and nights i believed that nielsen by telling me such incidents of his own wild experience inspired me to more endurance than i knew i possessed  as we traveled on down the canyon its dimensions continued to grow it finally turned to the left and opened out wide into a valley running west a low range of hills faced us rising in a long sweeping slant of earth like the incline of a glacier to rounded spurs half way up this slope where the brown earth lightened there showed an outcropping of clayamber and cream and cinnamon and green all exquisitely vivid and clear this bright spot appeared to be isolated far above it rose other clay slopes of variegated hues red and russet and mauve and gray and colors indescribably merged all running in veins through this range of hills we faced the west again and descending this valley were soon greeted by a region of clay hills bare coneshaped fantastic in shade slope and ridge with a high sharp peak dominating all the colors were mauve taupe pearlgray all stained by a descending band of crimson as if a higher slope had been stabbed to let its life blood flow down the softness the richness and beauty of this texture of earth amazed and delighted my eyes  quite unprepared at time approaching sunset we reached and rounded a sharp curve to see down and far away and to be held mute in our tracks between a whitemantled mountain range on the left and the darkstriped lofty range on the right i could see far down into a gulf a hazy void a vast stark valley that seemed streaked and ridged and canyoned an abyss into which veils of rain were dropping and over which broken clouds hung pierced by red and gold rays  death valley far down and far away still yet confounding at first sight i gazed spellbound it oppressed my heart nielsen stood like a statue silent absorbed for a moment then he strode on i followed and every second saw more and different aspects that could not however change the first stunning impression immense unreal weird i went on down the widening canyon looking into that changing void how full of color it smoked the traceries of streams or shining white washes brightened the floor of the long dark pit patches and plains of white borax flats or alkali showed up like snow a red haze sinister and sombre hung over the eastern ramparts of this valley and over the western drooped gray veils of rain like thinnest lacy clouds through which gleams of the sun shone  nielsen plodded on mindful of our mules but i lingered and at last checked my reluctant steps at an open high point with commanding and magnificent view as i did not attempt the impossibleto write down thoughts and sensationsafterward i could remember only a few how desolate and grand the faraway lonely and terrible places of the earth were the most beautiful and elevating lifes little day seemed so easy to understand so pitiful as the sun began to set and the stormclouds moved across it this wondrous scene darkened changed every moment brightened grew full of luminous red light and then streaked by golden gleams the tips of the panamint mountains came out silver above the purple clouds at sunset the moment was gloriousdark forbidding dim weird dismal yet still tinged with gold not like any other scene dantes inferno valley of shadows canyon of purple veils  when the sun had set and all that upheaved and furrowed world of rock had received a mantle of gray and a slumberous sulphurous ruddy haze slowly darkened to purple and black then i realized more fully that i was looking down into death valley  twilight was stealing down when i caught up with nielsen he had selected for our camp a protected nook near where the canyon floor bore some patches of sage the stalks and roots of which would serve for firewood we unpacked fed the mules some grain pitched our little tent and made our bed all in short order but it was dark long before we had supper during the meal we talked a little but afterward when the chores were done and the mules had become quiet and the strange thick silence had settled down upon us we did not talk at all  the night was black with sky mostly obscured by clouds a pale haze marked the west where the after glow had faded in the south one radiant star crowned a mountain peak i strolled away in the darkness and sat down upon a stone how intense the silence dead vast sepulchrelike dreaming waiting a silence of ages burdened with the history of the past awful i strained my ears for sound of insect or rustle of sage or drop of weathered rock the soft cool desert wind was soundless this silence had something terrifying in it making me a man alone on the earth the great spaces the wild places as they had been millions of years before i seemed to divine how through them man might develop from savage to a god and how alas he might go back again  when i returned to camp nielsen had gone to bed and the fire had burned low i threw on some branches of sage the fire blazed up but it seemed different from other campfires no cheer no glow no sparkle perhaps it was owing to scant and poor wood still i thought it was owing as much to the place the sadness the loneliness the desolateness of this place weighed upon the campfire the same as it did upon my heart  we got up at fivethirty at dawn the sky was a cold leaden gray with a dull gold and rose in the east a hard wind eager and nipping blew up the canyon at six oclock the sky brightened somewhat and the day did not promise so threatening  an hour later we broke camp traveling in the early morning was pleasant and we made good time down the winding canyon arriving at furnace creek about noon where we halted to rest this stream of warm water flowed down from a gully that headed up in the funeral mountains it had a disagreeable taste somewhat acrid and soapy a green thicket of brush was indeed welcome to the eye it consisted of a rank coarse kind of grass and arrowweed mesquite and tamarack the last named bore a pink fuzzy blossom not unlike pussywillow which was quite fragrant here the deadness of the region seemed further enlivened by several small birds speckled and gray two ravens and a hawk they all appeared to be hunting food on a ridge above furnace creek we came upon a spring of poison water it was clear sparkling with a greenish cast and it deposited a white crust on the margins nielsen kicking around in the sand unearthed a skull bleached and yellow yet evidently not so very old some thirsty wanderer had taken his last drink at that deceiving spring the gruesome and the beautiful the tragic and the sublime go hand in hand down the naked shingle of this desolate desert  while tramping around in the neighborhood of furnace creek i happened upon an old almost obliterated trail it led toward the ridges of clay and when i had climbed it a little ways i began to get an impression that the slopes on the other side must run down into a basin or canyon so i climbed to the top  the magnificent scenes of desert and mountain like the splendid things of life must be climbed for in this instance i was suddenly and stunningly confronted by a yellow gulf of coneshaped and fanshaped ridges all bare crinkly clay of gold of amber of pink of bronze of cream all tapering down to roundknobbed lower ridges bleak and barren yet wonderfully beautiful in their stark purity of denudation until at last far down between two widely separated hills shone dim and blue and ghastly with shining white streaks like silver streamsthe valley of death then beyond it climbed the leaguelong red slope merging into the ironbuttressed base of the panamint range and here line on line and bulge on bulge rose the bold benches and on up the unscalable outcroppings of rock like colossal ribs of the earth on and up the steep slopes to where their density of blue black color began to thin out with streaks of white and thence upward to the last noble height where the cold pure snow gleamed against the sky  i descended into this yellow maze this world of gullies and ridges where i found it difficult to keep from getting lost i did lose my bearings but as my boots made deep imprints in the soft clay i knew it would be easy to backtrack my trail after a while this labyrinthine series of channels and dunes opened into a wide space enclosed on three sides by denuded slopes mostly yellow these slopes were smooth graceful symmetrical with tiny tracery of erosion and each appeared to retain its own color yellow or cinnamon or mauve but they were always dominated by a higher one of a different color and this mystic region sloped and slanted to a great amphitheater that was walled on the opposite side by a mountain of bare earth of every hue and of a thousand ribbed and scalloped surfaces at its base the golds and russets and yellows were strongest but ascending its slopes were changing colorsa dark beautiful mouse color on one side and a strange pearly cream on the other between these great corners of the curve climbed ridges of gray and heliotrope and amber to meet wonderful veins of greengreen as the sea in sunlightand tracery of whiteand on the bold face of this amphitheater high up stood out a zigzag belt of dull red the stain of which had run down to tinge the other hues above all this wondrous coloration upheaved the bare breast of the mountain growing darker with earthy browns up to the gray old rock ramparts  this place affected me so strangely so irresistibly that i remained there a long time something terrible had happened there to men i felt that something tragic was going on right thenthe wearing down the devastation of the old earth how plainly that could be seen geologically it was more remarkable to me than the grand canyon but it was the appalling meaning the absolutely indescribable beauty that overcame me i thought of those who had been inspiration to me in my work and i suffered a pang that they could not be there to see and feel with me  on my way out of this amphitheater a hard wind swooped down over the slopes tearing up the colored dust in sheets and clouds it seemed to me each gully had its mystic pall of color i lost no time climbing out what a hot choking ordeal but i never would have missed it even had i known i would get lost looking down again the scene was vastly changed a smoky weird murky hell with the dull sun gleaming magentahued through the shifting pall of dust  in the afternoon we proceeded leisurely through an atmosphere growing warmer and denser down to the valley reaching it at dusk we followed the course of furnace creek and made camp under some cottonwood trees on the west slope of the valley  the wind blew a warm gale all night i lay awake a while and slept with very little covering toward dawn the gale died away i was up at fivethirty the morning broke fine clear balmy a flare of pale gleaming light over the funeral range heralded the sunrise the tips of the higher snowcapped panamints were rose colored and below them the slopes were red the bulk of the range showed dark all these features gradually brightened until the sun came up how blazing and intense the wind began to blow again under the cottonwoods with their rustling leaves and green so soothing to the eye it was very pleasant  beyond our camp stood green and pink thickets of tamarack and some dark velvety green alfalfa fields made possible by the spreading of furnace creek over the valley slope a man lived there and raised this alfalfa for the mules of the borax miners he lived there alone and his was indeed a lonely wonderful and terrible life at this season a few shoshone indians were camped near helping him in his labors this lone ranchers name was denton and he turned out to be a brother of a denton hunter and guide whom i had met in lower california  illustration desert graves  illustration the ghastly sweep of death valley  like all desert men used to silence denton talked with difficulty but the content of his speech made up for its brevity he told us about the wanderers and prospectors he had rescued from death by starvation and thirst he told us about the terrific noonday heat of summer and about the incredible and horrible midnight furnace gales that swept down the valley with the mercury at one hundred and twentyfive degrees at midnight below the level of the sea when these furnace blasts bore down upon him it was just all he could do to live no man could spend many summers there as for white womendeath valley was fatal to them the indians spent the summers up on the mountains denton said heat affected men differently those who were meat eaters or alcohol drinkers could not survive perfect heart and lungs were necessary to stand the heat and density of atmosphere below sea level he told of a man who had visited his cabin and had left early in the day vigorous and strong a few hours later he was found near the oasis unable to walk crawling on his hands and knees dragging a full canteen of water he never knew what ailed him it might have been heat for the thermometer registered one hundred and thirtyfive and it might have been poison gas another man young of heavy and powerful build lost seventy pounds weight in less than two days and was nearly dead when found the heat of death valley quickly dried up blood tissue bone denton told of a prospector who started out at dawn strong and rational to return at sunset so crazy that he had to be tied to keep him out of the water to have drunk his fill then would have killed him he had to be fed water by spoonful another wanderer came staggering into the oasis blind with horrible face and black swollen tongue protruding he could not make a sound he also had to be roped as if he were a mad steer  illustration in the center of the saltincrusted floor of death valley three hundred feet below sea level  i met only one prospector during my stay in death valley he camped with us a rather undersized man he was yet muscular with brown wrinkled face and narrow dim eyes he seemed to be smiling to himself most of the time he liked to talk to his burros he was exceedingly interesting once he nearly died of thirst having gone from noon one day till next morning without water he said he fell down often during this ordeal but did not lose his senses finally the burros saved his life this old fellow had been across death valley every month in the year july was the worst in that month crossing should not be attempted during the middle of the day  i made the acquaintance of the shoshone indians or rather through nielsen i met them nielsen had a kindly friendly way with indians there were half a dozen families living in squalid tents the braves worked in the fields for denton and the squaws kept to the shade with their numerous children they appeared to be poor certainly they were a ragged unpicturesque group nielsen and i visited them taking an armload of canned fruit and boxes of sweet crackers which they received with evident joy through this overture i got a peep into one of the tents the simplicity and frugality of the desert piute or navajo were here wanting these children of the open wore white mens apparel and ate white mens food and they even had a cook stove and a sewing machine in their tent with all that they were trying to live like indians for me the spectacle was melancholy another manifestation added to my long list of degeneration of the indians by the whites the tent was a buzzing beehive of flies i never before saw so many in a corner i saw a naked indian baby asleep on a goat skin all his brown warmtinted skin spotted black with flies  later in the day one of the indian men called upon us at our camp i was surprised to hear him use good english he said he had been educated in a government school in california from him i learned considerable about death valley as he was about to depart on the way to his labor in the fields he put his hand in his ragged pocket and drew forth an old beaded hat band and with calm dignity worthy of any gift he made me a present of it then he went on his way the incident touched me i had been kind the indian was not to be outdone how that reminded me of the many instances of pride in indians who yet has ever told the story of the indianthe truth the spirit the soul of his tragedy  nielsen and i climbed high up the west slope to the top of a gravel ridge swept clean and packed hard by the winds here i sat down while my companion tramped curiously around at my feet i found a tiny flower so tiny as to almost defy detection the color resembled sagegray and it had the fragrance of sage hard to find and wonderful to seewas its tiny blossom the small leaves were perfectly formed very soft veined and scalloped with a fine fuzz and a glistening sparkle that desert flower of a day in its isolation and fragility yet its unquenchable spirit to live was as great to me as the tremendous reddening bulk of the funeral mountains looming so sinisterly over me  then i saw some large bats with white heads flitting around in zigzag flightsassuredly new and strange creatures to me  i had come up there to this high ridge to take advantage of the bleak lonely spot commanding a view of valley and mountains before i could compose myself to watch the valley i made the discovery that near me were six low gravelly mounds graves one had two stones at head and foot another had no mark at all the one nearest me had for the head a flat piece of board with lettering so effaced by weather that i could not decipher the inscription the bones of a horse lay littered about between the graves what a lonely place for graves death valley seemed to be one vast sepulchre what had been the lives and deaths of these people buried here lonely melancholy nameless graves upon the windy desert slope  by this time the long shadows had begun to fall sunset over death valley a golden flare burned over the panamintslong tapering notched mountains with all their rugged conformation showing above floated gold and gray and silveredged cloudsbelow shone a whorl of dusky ruddy bronze haze gradually thickening dim veils of heat still rose from the pale desert valley as i watched all before me seemed to change and be shrouded in purple how bold and desolate a scene what vast scale and tremendous dimension the clouds paled turned rosy for a moment with the afterglow then deepened into purple gloom a sombre smoky sunset as if this death valley was the gateway of hell and its sinister shades were upflung from fire  the desert day was done and now the desert twilight descended twilight of hazy purple fell over the valley of shadows the black bold lines of mountains ran across the sky and down into the valley and up on the other side a buzzard sailed low in the foregroundfitting emblem of life in all that wilderness of suggested death this fleeting hour was tranquil and sad what little had it to do with the destiny of man death valley was only a ragged rent of the old earth from which men in their folly and passion had sought to dig forth golden treasure the air held a solemn stillness peace how it rested my troubled soul i felt that i was myself here far different from my habitual self why had i longed to see death valley what did i want of the desert that was naked red sinister sombre forbidding ghastly stark dim and dark and dismal the abode of silence and loneliness the proof of death decay devastation and destruction the majestic sublimity of desolation the answer was that i sought the awful the appalling and terrible because they harked me back to a primitive day where my blood and bones were bequeathed their heritage of the elements that was the secret of the eternal fascination the desert exerted upon all men it carried them back it inhibited thought it brought up the ageold sensations so that i could feel though i did not know it then once again the allsatisfying state of the savage in nature  when i returned to camp night had fallen the evening star stood high in the pale sky all alone and difficult to see yet the more beautiful for that the night appeared to be warmer or perhaps it was because no wind blew nielsen got supper and ate most of it for i was not hungry as i sat by the campfire a flock of little bats the smallest i had ever seen darted from the woodpile nearby and flew right in my face they had no fear of man or fire their wings made a soft swishing sound later i heard the trill of frogs which was the last sound i might have expected to hear in death valley a sweet highpitched melodious trill it reminded me of the music made by frogs in the tamaulipas jungle of mexico every time i awakened that night and it was often i heard this trill once too sometime late my listening ear caught faint mournful notes of a killdeer how strange and still sweeter than the trill what a touch to the infinite silence and loneliness a killdeerbird of the swamps and marsheswhat could he be doing in arid and barren death valley nature is mysterious and inscrutable  next morning the marvel of nature was exemplified even more strikingly out on the hard gravelstrewn slope i found some more tiny flowers of a day one was a white daisy very frail and delicate on long thin stem with scarcely any leaves another was a yellow flower with four petals a pale miniature california poppy still another was a purplered flower almost as large as a buttercup with dark green leaves last and tiniest of all were infinitely fragile pink and white blossoms on very flat plants smiling wanly up from the desolate earth  nielsen and i made known to denton our purpose to walk across the valley he advised against it not that the heat was intense at this season he explained but there were other dangers particularly the brittle salty crust of the sinkhole nevertheless we were not deterred from our purpose  so with plenty of water in canteens and a few biscuits in our pockets we set out i saw the heat veils rising from the valley floor at that point one hundred and seventyeight feet below sea level the heat lifted in veils like thin smoke denton had told us that in summer the heat came in currents in waves it blasted leaves burned trees to death as well as men prospectors watched for the leaden haze that thickened over the mountains knowing then no man could dare the terrible sun that day would be a hazed and glaring hell leaden copper with sun blazing a sky of molten iron  a long sandy slope of mesquite extended down to the bare crinkly floor of the valley and here the descent to a lower level was scarcely perceptible the walking was bad little mounds in the salty crust made it hard to place a foot on the level this crust appeared fairly strong but when it rang hollow under our boots then i stepped very cautiously the color was a dirty gray and yellow far ahead i could see a dazzling white plain that looked like frost or a frozen river the atmosphere was deceptive making this plain seem far away and then close at hand  the excessively difficult walking and the thickness of the air tired me so i plumped myself down to rest and used my notebook as a means to conceal from the tireless nielsen that i was fatigued always i found this a very efficient excuse and for that matter it was profitable for me i have forgotten more than i have ever written  rather overpowering indeed was it to sit on the floor of death valley miles from the slopes that appeared so far away it was flat salty alkali or borax ground crusted and cracked the glare hurt my eyes i felt moist hot oppressed in spite of a rather stiff wind a dry odor pervaded the air slightly like salty dust thin dust devils whirled on the bare flats a valleywide mirage shone clear as a mirror along the desert floor to the west strange deceiving a thing both unreal and beautiful the panamints towered a wrinkled red grisly mass broken by rough canyons with long declines of talus like brown glaciers seamed and scarred indestructible by past ages yet surely wearing to ruin from this point i could not see the snow on the peaks the whole mountain range seemed an immense red barrier of beetling rock the funeral range was farther away and therefore more impressive its effect was stupendous leagues of brown chocolate slopes scarred by slashes of yellow and cream and shadowed black by sailing clouds led up to the magnificently peaked and jutted summits  splendid as this was and reluctant as i felt to leave i soon joined nielsen and we proceeded onward at last we reached the white winding plain that had resembled a frozen river and which from afar had looked so ghastly and stark we found it to be a perfectly smooth stratum of salt glistening as if powdered it was not solid not stable at pressure of a boot it shook like jelly under the white crust lay a yellow substance that was wet here appeared an obstacle we had not calculated upon nielsen ventured out on it and his feet sank in several inches i did not like the wave of the crust it resembled thin ice under a weight presently i ventured to take a few steps and did not sink in so deeply or make such depression in the crust as nielsen we returned to the solid edge and deliberated nielsen said that by stepping quickly we could cross without any great risk though it appeared reasonable that by standing still a person would sink into the substance  well nielsen you go ahead i said with an attempt at lightness you weigh one hundred and ninety if you go through ill turn back  nielsen started with a laugh the man courted peril the bright face of danger must have been beautiful and alluring to him i started after himcaught up with himand stayed beside him i could not have walked behind him over that strip of treacherous sinkhole if i could have done so the whole adventure would have been meaningless to me nevertheless i was frightened i felt the prickle of my skin the stiffening of my hair as well as the cold tingling thrills along my veins  this place was the lowest point of the valley in that particular location and must have been upwards of two hundred feet below sea level the lowest spot called the sink hole lay some miles distant and was the terminus of this river of salty white  we crossed it in safety on the other side extended a long flat of upheaved crusts of salt and mud full of holes and pitfalls an exceedingly toilsome and painful place to travel and for all we could tell dangerous too i had all i could do to watch my feet and find surfaces to hold my steps eventually we crossed this broken field reaching the edge of the gravel slope where we were very glad indeed to rest  denton had informed us that the distance was seven miles across the valley at the mouth of furnace creek i had thought it seemed much less than that but after i had toiled across it i was convinced that it was much more it had taken us hours how the time had sped for this reason we did not tarry long on that side  facing the sun we found the return trip more formidable hot indeed it washot enough for me to imagine how terrible death valley would be in july or august on all sides the mountains stood up dim and obscure and distant in haze the heat veils lifted in ripples and any object not near at hand seemed illusive nielsen set a pace for me on this return trip i was quicker and surer of foot than he but he had more endurance i lost strength while he kept his unimpaired so often he had to wait for me once when i broke through the crust he happened to be close at hand and quickly hauled me out i got one foot wet with some acid fluid we peered down into the murky hole nielsen quoted a prospectors saying forty feet from hell that broken sharp crust of salt afforded the meanest traveling i had ever experienced slopes of weathered rock that slip and slide are bad cacti and especially choya cacti are worse the jagged and corrugated surfaces of lava are still more hazardous and painful but this cracked floor of death valley with its salt crusts standing on end like pickets of a fence beat any place for hard going that either nielsen or i ever had encountered i ruined my boots skinned my shins cut my hands how those salt cuts stung we crossed the upheaved plain then the strip of white and reached the crinkly floor of yellow salt the last hour taxed my endurance almost to the limit when we reached the edge of the sand and the beginning of the slope i was hotter and thirstier than i had ever been in my life it pleased me to see nielsen wringing wet and panting he drank a quart of water apparently in one gulp and it was significant that i took the longest and deepest drink of water that i had ever had  we reached camp at the end of this still hot summer day never had a camp seemed so welcome what a wonderful thing it was to earn and appreciate and realize rest the cottonwood leaves were rustling bees were humming in the tamarack blossoms i lay in the shade resting my burning feet and achiag bones and i watched nielsen as he whistled over the camp chores then i heard the sweet song of a meadow lark and after that the melodious deep note of a swamp blackbird these birds evidently were traveling north and had tarried at the oasis  lying there i realized that i had come to love the silence the loneliness the serenity even the tragedy of this valley of shadows death valley was one place that could never be popular with men it had been set apart for the hardy diggers for earthen treasure and for the wanderers of the wastelandsmen who go forth to seek and to find and to face their souls perhaps most of them found death but there was a death in life desert travelers learned the secret that men lived too much in the worldthat in silence and loneliness and desolation there was something infinite something hidden from the crowd
