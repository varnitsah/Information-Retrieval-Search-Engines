abbey      preface  the first volume of these poems has already been submitted to general perusal it was published as an experiment which i hoped might be of some use to ascertain how far by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the real language of men in a state of vivid sensation that sort of pleasure and that quantity of pleasure may be imparted which a poet may rationally endeavour to impart  i had formed no very inaccurate estimate of the probable effect of those poems i flattered myself that they who should be pleased with them would read them with more than common pleasure and on the other hand i was well aware that by those who should dislike them they would be read with more than common dislike the result has differed from my expectation in this only that i have pleased a greater number than i ventured to hope i should please  for the sake of variety and from a consciousness of my own weakness i was induced to request the assistance of a friend who furnished me with the poems of the ancient mariner the fostermothers tale the nightingale the dungeon and the poem entitled love i should not however have requested this assistance had i not believed that the poems of my friend would in a great measure have the same tendency as my own and that though there would be found a difference there would be found no discordance in the colours of our style as our opinions on the subject of poetry do almost entirely coincide  several of my friends are anxious for the success of these poems from a belief that if the views with which they were composed were indeed realized a class of poetry would be produced well adapted to interest mankind permanently and not unimportant in the multiplicity and in the quality of its moral relations and on this account they have advised me to prefix a systematic defence of the theory upon which the poems were written but i was unwilling to undertake the task because i knew that on this occasion the reader would look coldly upon my arguments since i might be suspected of having been principally influenced by the selfish and foolish hope of reasoning him into an approbation of these particular poems and i was still more unwilling to undertake the task because adequately to display my opinions and fully to enforce my arguments would require a space wholly disproportionate to the nature of a preface for to treat the subject with the clearness and coherence of which i believe it susceptible it would be necessary to give a full account of the present state of the public taste in this country and to determine how far this taste is healthy or depraved which again could not be determined without pointing out in what manner language and the human mind act and react on each other and without retracing the revolutions not of literature alone but likewise of society itself i have therefore altogether declined to enter regularly upon this defence yet i am sensible that there would be some impropriety in abruptly obtruding upon the public without a few words of introduction poems so materially different from those upon which general approbation is at present bestowed  it is supposed that by the act of writing in verse an author makes a formal engagement that he will gratify certain known habits of association that he not only thus apprizes the reader that certain classes of ideas and expressions will be found in his book but that others will be carefully excluded this exponent or symbol held forth by metrical language must in different aeras of literature have excited very different expectations for example in the age of catullus terence and lucretius and that of statius or claudian and in our own country in the age of shakespeare and beaumont and fletcher and that of donne and cowley or dryden or pope i will not take upon me to determine the exact import of the promise which by the act of writing in verse an author in the present day makes to his reader but i am certain it will appear to many persons that i have not fulfilled the terms of an engagement thus voluntarily contracted i hope therefore the reader will not censure me if i attempt to state what i have proposed to myself to perform and also as far as the limits of a preface will permit to explain some of the chief reasons which have determined me in the choice of my purpose that at least he may be spared any unpleasant feeling of disappointment and that i myself may be protected from the most dishonorable accusation which can be brought against an author namely that of an indolence which prevents him from endeavouring to ascertain what is his duty or when his duty is ascertained prevents him from performing it  the principal object then which i proposed to myself in these poems was to make the incidents of common life interesting by tracing in them truly though not ostentatiously the primary laws of our nature chiefly as far as regards the manner in which we associate ideas in a state of excitement low and rustic life was generally chosen because in that situation the essential passions of the heart find a better soil in which they can attain their maturity are less under restraint and speak a plainer and more emphatic language because in that situation our elementary feelings exist in a state of greater simplicity and consequently may be more accurately contemplated and more forcibly communicated because the manners of rural life germinate from those elementary feelings and from the necessary character of rural occupations are more easily comprehended and are more durable and lastly because in that situation the passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature the language too of these men is adopted purified indeed from what appear to be its real defects from all lasting and rational causes of dislike or disgust because such men hourly communicate with the best objects from which the best part of language is originally derived and because from their rank in society and the sameness and narrow circle of their intercourse being less under the action of social vanity they convey their feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated expressions accordingly such a language arising out of repeated experience and regular feelings is a more permanent and a far more philosophical language than that which is frequently substituted for it by poets who think that they are conferring honour upon themselves and their art in proportion as they separate themselves from the sympathies of men and indulge in arbitrary and capricious habits of expression in order to furnish food for fickle tastes and fickle appetites of their own creation1  footnote 1 it is worth while here to observe that the affecting parts of chaucer are almost always expressed in language pure and universally intelligible even to this day  i cannot be insensible of the present outcry against the triviality and meanness both of thought and language which some of my contemporaries have occasionally introduced into their metrical compositions and i acknowledge that this defect where it exists is more dishonorable to the writers own character than false refinement or arbitrary innovation though i should contend at the same time that it is far less pernicious in the sum of its consequences from such verses the poems in these volumes will be found distinguished at least by one mark of difference that each of them has a worthy purpose not that i mean to say that i always began to write with a distinct purpose formally conceived but i believe that my habits of meditation have so formed my feelings as that my descriptions of such objects as strongly excite those feelings will be found to carry along with them a purpose if in this opinion i am mistaken i can have little right to the name of a poet for all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings but though this be true poems to which any value can be attached were never produced on any variety of subjects but by a man who being possessed of more than usual organic sensibility had also thought long and deeply for our continued influxes of feeling are modified and directed by our thoughts which are indeed the representatives of all our past feelings and as by contemplating the relation of these general representatives to each other we discover what is really important to men so by the repetition and continuance of this act feelings connected with important subjects will be nourished till at length if we be originally possessed of much organic sensibility such habits of mind will be produced that by obeying blindly and mechanically the impulses of those habits we shall describe objects and utter sentiments of such a nature and in such connection with each other that the understanding of the being to whom we address ourselves if he be in a healthful state of association must necessarily be in some degree enlightened his taste exalted and his affections ameliorated  i have said that each of these poems has a purpose i have also informed my reader what this purpose will be found principally to be namely to illustrate the manner in which our feelings and ideas are associated in a state of excitement but speaking in less general language it is to follow the fluxes and refluxes of the mind when agitated by the great and simple affections of our nature this object i have endeavoured in these short essays to attain by various means by tracing the maternal passion through many of its more subtle windings as in the poems of the idiot boy and the mad mother by accompanying the last struggles of a human being at the approach of death cleaving in solitude to life and society as in the poem of the forsaken indian by shewing as in the stanzas entitled we are seven the perplexity and obscurity which in childhood attend our notion of death or rather our utter inability to admit that notion or by displaying the strength of fraternal or to speak more philosophically of moral attachment when early associated with the great and beautiful objects of nature as in the brothers or as in the incident of simon lee by placing my reader in the way of receiving from ordinary moral sensations another and more salutary impression than we are accustomed to receive from them it has also been part of my general purpose to attempt to sketch characters under the influence of less impassioned feelings as in the old man travelling the two thieves c characters of which the elements are simple belonging rather to nature than to manners such as exist now and will probably always exist and which from their constitution may be distinctly and profitably contemplated i will not abuse the indulgence of my reader by dwelling longer upon this subject but it is proper that i should mention one other circumstance which distinguishes these poems from the popular poetry of the day it is this that the feeling therein developed gives importance to the action and situation and not the action and situation to the feeling my meaning will be rendered perfectly intelligible by referring my reader to the poems entitled poor susan and the childless father particularly to the last stanza of the latter poem  i will not suffer a sense of false modesty to prevent me from asserting that i point my readers attention to this mark of distinction far less for the sake of these particular poems than from the general importance of the subject the subject is indeed important for the human mind is capable of excitement without the application of gross and violent stimulants and he must have a very faint perception of its beauty and dignity who does not know this and who does not further know that one being is elevated above another in proportion as he possesses this capability it has therefore appeared to me that to endeavour to produce or enlarge this capability is one of the best services in which at any period a writer can be engaged but this service excellent at all times is especially so at the present day for a multitude of causes unknown to former times are now acting with a combined force to blunt the discriminating powers of the mind and unfitting it for all voluntary exertion to reduce it to a state of almost savage torpor the most effective of these causes are the great national events which are daily taking place and the encreasing accumulation of men in cities where the uniformity of their occupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident which the rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies to this tendency of life and manners the literature and theatrical exhibitions of the country have conformed themselves the invaluable works of our elder writers i had almost said the works of shakespeare and milton are driven into neglect by frantic novels sickly and stupid german tragedies and deluges of idle and extravagant stories in versewhen i think upon this degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation i am almost ashamed to have spoken of the feeble effort with which i have endeavoured to counteract it and reflecting upon the magnitude of the general evil i should be oppressed with no dishonorable melancholy had i not a deep impression of certain inherent and indestructible qualities of the human mind and likewise of certain powers in the great and permanent objects that act upon it which are equally inherent and indestructible and did i not further add to this impression a belief that the time is approaching when the evil will be systematically opposed by men of greater powers and with far more distinguished success  having dwelt thus long on the subjects and aim of these poems i shall request the readers permission to apprize him of a few circumstances relating to their style in order among other reasons that i may not be censured for not having performed what i never attempted except in a very few instances the reader will find no personifications of abstract ideas in these volumes not that i mean to censure such personifications they may be well fitted for certain sorts of composition but in these poems i propose to myself to imitate and as far as possible to adopt the very language of men and i do not find that such personifications make any regular or natural part of that language i wish to keep my reader in the company of flesh and blood persuaded that by so doing i shall interest him not but that i believe that others who pursue a different track may interest him likewise i do not interfere with their claim i only wish to prefer a different claim of my own there will also be found in these volumes little of what is usually called poetic diction i have taken as much pains to avoid it as others ordinarily take to produce it this i have done for the reason already alleged to bring my language near to the language of men and further because the pleasure which i have proposed to myself to impart is of a kind very different from that which is supposed by many persons to be the proper object of poetry i do not know how without being culpably particular i can give my reader a more exact notion of the style in which i wished these poems to be written than by informing him that i have at all times endeavoured to look steadily at my subject consequently i hope it will be found that there is in these poems little falsehood of description and that my ideas are expressed in language fitted to their respective importance something i must have gained by this practice as it is friendly to one property of all good poetry namely good sense but it has necessarily cut me off from a large portion of phrases and figures of speech which from father to son have long been regarded as the common inheritance of poets i have also thought it expedient to restrict myself still further having abstained from the use of many expressions in themselves proper and beautiful but which have been foolishly repeated by bad poets till such feelings of disgust are connected with them as it is scarcely possible by any art of association to overpower  if in a poem there should be found a series of lines or even a single line in which the language though naturally arranged and according to the strict laws of metre does not differ from that of prose there is a numerous class of critics who when they stumble upon these prosaisms as they call them imagine that they have made a notable discovery and exult over the poet as over a man ignorant of his own profession now these men would establish a canon of criticism which the reader will conclude he must utterly reject if he wishes to be pleased with these volumes and it would be a most easy task to prove to him that not only the language of a large portion of every good poem even of the most elevated character must necessarily except with reference to the metre in no respect differ from that of good prose but likewise that some of the most interesting parts of the best poems will be found to be strictly the language of prose when prose is well written the truth of this assertion might be demonstrated by innumerable passages from almost all the poetical writings even of milton himself i have not space for much quotation but to illustrate the subject in a general manner i will here adduce a short composition of gray who was at the head of those who by their reasonings have attempted to widen the space of separation betwixt prose and metrical composition and was more than any other man curiously elaborate in the structure of his own poetic diction     in vain to me the smiling mornings shine   and reddening phoebus lifts his golden fire   the birds in vain their amorous descant join   or chearful fields resume their green attire   these ears alas for other notes repine   a different object do these eyes require   my lonely anguish melts no heart but mine   and in my breast the imperfect joys expire   yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer   and newborn pleasure brings to happier men   the fields to all their wonted tribute bear   to warm their little loves the birds complain   i fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear   and weep the more because i weep in vain   it will easily be perceived that the only part of this sonnet which is of any value is the lines printed in italics it is equally obvious that except in the rhyme and in the use of the single word fruitless for fruitlessly which is so far a defect the language of these lines does in no respect differ from that of prose  is there then it will be asked no essential difference between the language of prose and metrical composition i answer that there neither is nor can be any essential difference we are fond of tracing the resemblance between poetry and painting and accordingly we call them sisters but where shall we find bonds of connection sufficiently strict to typify the affinity betwixt metrical and prose composition they both speak by and to the same organs the bodies in which both of them are clothed may be said to be of the same substance their affections are kindred and almost identical not necessarily differing even in degree poetry 2 sheds no tears such as angels weep but natural and human tears she can boast of no celestial ichor that distinguishes her vital juices from those of prose the same human blood circulates through the veins of them both  footnote 2 i here use the word poetry though against my own judgment as opposed to the word prose and synonomous with metrical composition but much confusion has been introduced into criticism by this contradistinction of poetry and prose instead of the more philosophical one of poetry and science the only strict antithesis to prose is metre   if it be affirmed that rhyme and metrical arrangement of themselves constitute a distinction which overturns what i have been saying on the strict affinity of metrical language with that of prose and paves the way for other distinctions which the mind voluntarily admits i answer that the distinction of rhyme and metre is regular and uniform and not like that which is produced by what is usually called poetic diction arbitrary and subject to infinite caprices upon which no calculation whatever can be made in the one case the reader is utterly at the mercy of the poet respecting what imagery or diction he may choose to connect with the passion whereas in the other the metre obeys certain laws to which the poet and reader both willingly submit because they are certain and because no interference is made by them with the passion but such as the concurring testimony of ages has shewn to heighten and improve the pleasure which coexists with it it will now be proper to answer an obvious question namely why professing these opinions have i written in verse to this in the first place i reply because however i may have restricted myself there is still left open to me what confessedly constitutes the most valuable object of all writing whether in prose or verse the great and universal passions of men the most general and interesting of their occupations and the entire world of nature from which i am at liberty to supply myself with endless combinations of forms and imagery now granting for a moment that whatever is interesting in these objects may be as vividly described in prose why am i to be condemned if to such description i have endeavoured to superadd the charm which by the consent of all nations is acknowledged to exist in metrical language to this it will be answered that a very small part of the pleasure given by poetry depends upon the metre and that it is injudicious to write in metre unless it be accompanied with the other artificial distinctions of style with which metre is usually accompanied and that by such deviation more will be lost from the shock which will be thereby given to the readers associations than will be counterbalanced by any pleasure which he can derive from the general power of numbers in answer to those who thus contend for the necessity of accompanying metre with certain appropriate colours of style in order to the accomplishment of its appropriate end and who also in my opinion greatly underrate the power of metre in itself it might perhaps be almost sufficient to observe that poems are extant written upon more humble subjects and in a more naked and simple style than what i have aimed at which poems have continued to give pleasure from generation to generation now if nakedness and simplicity be a defect the fact here mentioned affords a strong presumption that poems somewhat less naked and simple are capable of affording pleasure at the present day and all that i am now attempting is to justify myself for having written under the impression of this belief  but i might point out various causes why when the style is manly and the subject of some importance words metrically arranged will long continue to impart such a pleasure to mankind as he who is sensible of the extent of that pleasure will be desirous to impart the end of poetry is to produce excitement in coexistence with an overbalance of pleasure now by the supposition excitement is an unusual and irregular state of the mind ideas and feelings do not in that state succeed each other in accustomed order but if the words by which this excitement is produced are in themselves powerful or the images and feelings have an undue proportion of pain connected with them there is some danger that the excitement may be carried beyond its proper bounds now the copresence of something regular something to which the mind has been accustomed when in an unexcited or a less excited state cannot but have great efficacy in tempering and restraining the passion by an intertexture of ordinary feeling this may be illustrated by appealing to the readers own experience of the reluctance with which he comes to the reperusal of the distressful parts of clarissa harlowe or the gamester while shakespeares writings in the most pathetic scenes never act upon us as pathetic beyond the bounds of pleasurean effect which is in a great degree to be ascribed to small but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable surprise from the metrical arrangementon the other hand what it must be allowed will much more frequently happen if the poets words should be incommensurate with the passion and inadequate to raise the reader to a height of desirable excitement then unless the poets choice of his metre has been grossly injudicious in the feelings of pleasure which the reader has been accustomed to connect with metre in general and in the feeling whether chearful or melancholy which he has been accustomed to connect with that particular movement of metre there will be found something which will greatly contribute to impart passion to the words and to effect the complex end which the poet proposes to himself  if i had undertaken a systematic defence of the theory upon which these poems are written it would have been my duty to develope the various causes upon which the pleasure received from metrical language depends among the chief of these causes is to be reckoned a principle which must be well known to those who have made any of the arts the object of accurate reflection i mean the pleasure which the mind derives from the perception of similitude in dissimilitude this principle is the great spring of the activity of our minds and their chief feeder from this principle the direction of the sexual appetite and all the passions connected with it take their origin it is the life of our ordinary conversation and upon the accuracy with which similitude in dissimilitude and dissimilitude in similitude are perceived depend our taste and our moral feelings it would not have been a useless employment to have applied this principle to the consideration of metre and to have shewn that metre is hence enabled to afford much pleasure and to have pointed out in what manner that pleasure is produced but my limits will not permit me to enter upon this subject and i must content myself with a general summary  i have said that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity the emotion is contemplated till by a species of reaction the tranquillity gradually disappears and an emotion similar to that which was before the subject of contemplation is gradually produced and does itself actually exist in the mind in this mood successful composition generally begins and in a mood similar to this it is carried on but the emotion of whatever kind and in whatever degree from various causes is qualified by various pleasures so that in describing any passions whatsoever which are voluntarily described the mind will upon the whole be in a state of enjoyment now if nature be thus cautious in preserving in a state of enjoyment a being thus employed the poet ought to profit by the lesson thus held forth to him and ought especially to take care that whatever passions he communicates to his reader those passions if his readers mind be sound and vigorous should always be accompanied with an overbalance of pleasure now the music of harmonious metrical language the sense of difficulty overcome and the blind association of pleasure which has been previously received from works of rhyme or metre of the same or similar construction all these imperceptibly make up a complex feeling of delight which is of the most important use in tempering the painful feeling which will always be found intermingled with powerful descriptions of the deeper passions this effect is always produced in pathetic and impassioned poetry while in lighter compositions the ease and gracefulness with which the poet manages his numbers are themselves confessedly a principal source of the gratification of the reader i might perhaps include all which it is necessary to say upon this subject by affirming what few persons will deny that of two descriptions either of passions manners or characters each of them equally well executed the one in prose and the other in verse the verse will be read a hundred times where the prose is read once we see that pope by the power of verse alone has contrived to render the plainest common sense interesting and even frequently to invest it with the appearance of passion in consequence of these convictions i related in metre the tale of goody blake and harry gill which is one of the rudest of this collection i wished to draw attention to the truth that the power of the human imagination is sufficient to produce such changes even in our physical nature as might almost appear miraculous the truth is an important one the fact for it is a fact is a valuable illustration of it and i have the satisfaction of knowing that it has been communicated to many hundreds of people who would never have heard of it had it not been narrated as a ballad and in a more impressive metre than is usual in ballads  having thus adverted to a few of the reasons why i have written in verse and why i have chosen subjects from common life and endeavoured to bring my language near to the real language of men if i have been too minute in pleading my own cause i have at the same time been treating a subject of general interest and it is for this reason that i request the readers permission to add a few words with reference solely to these particular poems and to some defects which will probably be found in them i am sensible that my associations must have sometimes been particular instead of general and that consequently giving to things a false importance sometimes from diseased impulses i may have written upon unworthy subject but i am less apprehensive on this account than that my language may frequently have suffered from those arbitrary connections of feelings and ideas with particular words from which no man can altogether protect himself hence i have no doubt that in some instances feelings even of the ludicrous may be given to my readers by expressions which appeared to me tender and pathetic such faulty expressions were i convinced they were faulty at present and that they must necessarily continue to be so i would willingly take all reasonable pains to correct but it is dangerous to make these alterations on the simple authority of a few individuals or even of certain classes of men for where the understanding of an author is not convinced or his feelings altered this cannot be done without great injury to himself for his own feelings are his stay and support and if he sets them aside in one instance he may be induced to repeat this act till his mind loses all confidence in itself and becomes utterly debilitated to this it may be added that the reader ought never to forget that he is himself exposed to the same errors as the poet and perhaps in a much greater degree for there can be no presumption in saying that it is not probable he will be so well acquainted with the various stages of meaning through which words have passed or with the fickleness or stability of the relations of particular ideas to each other and above all since he is so much less interested in the subject he may decide lightly and carelessly  long as i have detained my reader i hope he will permit me to caution him against a mode of false criticism which has been applied to poetry in which the language closely resembles that of life and nature such verses have been triumphed over in parodies of which dr johnsons stanza is a fair specimen    i put my hat upon my head   and walkd into the strand   and there i met another man   whose hat was in his hand  immediately under these lines i will place one of the most justly admired stanzas of the babes in the wood    these pretty babes with hand in hand   went wandering up and down   but never more they saw the man   approaching from the town  in both of these stanzas the words and the order of the words in no respect differ from the most unimpassioned conversation there are words in both for example the strand and the town connected with none but the most familiar ideas yet the one stanza we admit as admirable and the other as a fair example of the superlatively contemptible whence arises this difference not from the metre not from the language not from the order of the words but the matter expressed in dr johnsons stanza is contemptible the proper method of treating trivial and simple verses to which dr johnsons stanza would be a fair parallelism is not to say this is a bad kind of poetry or this is not poetry but this wants sense it is neither interesting in itself nor can lead to any thing interesting the images neither originate in that sane state of feeling which arises out of thought nor can excite thought or feeling in the reader this is the only sensible manner of dealing with such verses why trouble yourself about the species till you have previously decided upon the genus why take pains to prove that an ape is not a newton when it is selfevident that he is not a man  i have one request to make of my reader which is that in judging these poems he would decide by his own feelings genuinely and not by reflection upon what will probably be the judgment of others how common is it to hear a person say i myself do not object to this style of composition or this or that expression but to such and such classes of people it will appear mean or ludicrous this mode of criticism so destructive of all sound unadulterated judgment is almost universal i have therefore to request that the reader would abide independently by his own feelings and that if he finds himself affected he would not suffer such conjectures to interfere with his pleasure  if an author by any single composition has impressed us with respect for his talents it is useful to consider this as affording a presumption that on other occasions where we have been displeased he nevertheless may not have written ill or absurdly and further to give him so much credit for this one composition as may induce us to review what has displeased us with more care than we should otherwise have bestowed upon it this is not only an act of justice but in our decisions upon poetry especially may conduce in a high degree to the improvement of our own taste for an accurate taste in poetry and in all the other arts as sir joshua reynolds has observed is an acquired talent which can only be produced by thought and a long continued intercourse with the best models of composition this is mentioned not with so ridiculous a purpose as to prevent the most inexperienced reader from judging for himself i have already said that i wish him to judge for himself but merely to temper the rashness of decision and to suggest that if poetry be a subject on which much time has not been bestowed the judgment may be erroneous and that in many cases it necessarily will be so  i know that nothing would have so effectually contributed to further the end which i have in view as to have shewn of what kind the pleasure is and how the pleasure is produced which is confessedly produced by metrical composition essentially different from what i have here endeavoured to recommend for the reader will say that he has been pleased by such composition and what can i do more for him the power of any art is limited and he will suspect that if i propose to furnish him with new friends it is only upon condition of his abandoning his old friends besides as i have said the reader is himself conscious of the pleasure which he has received from such composition composition to which he has peculiarly attached the endearing name of poetry and all men feel an habitual gratitude and something of an honorable bigotry for the objects which have long continued to please them we not only wish to be pleased but to be pleased in that particular way in which we have been accustomed to be pleased there is a host of arguments in these feelings and i should be the less able to combat them successfully as i am willing to allow that in order entirely to enjoy the poetry which i am recommending it would be necessary to give up much of what is ordinarily enjoyed but would my limits have permitted me to point out how this pleasure is produced i might have removed many obstacles and assisted my reader in perceiving that the powers of language are not so limited as he may suppose and that it is possible that poetry may give other enjoyments of a purer more lasting and more exquisite nature but this part of my subject i have been obliged altogether to omit as it has been less my present aim to prove that the interest excited by some other kinds of poetry is less vivid and less worthy of the nobler powers of the mind than to offer reasons for presuming that if the object which i have proposed to myself were adequately attained a species of poetry would be produced which is genuine poetry in its nature well adapted to interest mankind permanently and likewise important in the multiplicity and quality of its moral relations from what has been said and from a perusal of the poems the reader will be able clearly to perceive the object which i have proposed to myself he will determine how far i have attained this object and what is a much more important question whether it be worth attaining and upon the decision of these two questions will rest my claim to the approbation of the public     expostulation and reply     why william on that old grey stone   thus for the length of half a day   why william sit you thus alone   and dream your time away    where are your books that light

woman  when a northern indian from sickness is unable to continue his journey with his companions he is left behind covered over with deerskins and is supplied with water food and fuel if the situation of the place will afford it he is informed of the track which his companions intend to pursue and if he is unable to follow or overtake them he perishes alone in the desart unless he should

journey from hudsons bay to the northern ocean in the high northern latititudes as the same writer informs us when the northern lights vary their position in the air they make a rustling and a crackling noise this circumstance is alluded to in the first stanza of the following poem     the complaint etc    before i see another day   oh let my body die away   in sleep i heard the northern gleams   the stars they were among my dreams   in sleep did i behold the skies   i saw the crackling flashes drive   and yet they are upon my eyes   and yet i am alive   before i see another day   oh let my body die away    my fire is dead it knew no pain   yet is it dead and i remain   all stiff with ice the ashes lie   and they are dead and i will die   when i was well i wished to live   for clothes for warmth for food and fire   but they to me no joy can give   no pleasure now and no desire   then here contented will i lie   alone i cannot fear to die    alas you might have dragged me on   another day a single one   too soon despair oer me prevailed   too soon my heartless spirit failed   when you were gone my limbs were stronger   and oh how grievously i rue   that afterwards a little longer   my friends i did not follow you   for strong and without pain i lay   my friends when you were gone away    my child they gave thee to another   a woman who was not thy mother   when from my arms my babe they took   on me how strangely did he look   through his whole body something ran   a most strange something did i see   as if he strove to be a man   that he might pull the sledge for me   and then he stretched his arms how wild   oh mercy like a little child    my little joy my little pride   in two days more i must have died   then do not weep and grieve for me   i feel i must have died with thee   oh wind that oer my head art flying   the way my friends their course did bend   i should not feel the pain of dying   could i with thee a message send   too soon my friends you went away   for i had many things to say    ill follow you across the snow   you travel heavily and slow   in spite of all my weary pain   ill look upon your tents again   my fire is dead and snowy white   the water which beside it stood   the wolf has come to me tonight   and he has stolen away my food   for ever left alone am i   then wherefore should i fear to die    my journey will be shortly run   i shall not see another sun   i cannot lift my limbs to know   if they have any life or no   my poor forsaken child if i   for once could have thee close to me   with happy heart i then should die   and my last thoughts would happy be   i feel my body die away   i shall not see another day     the last of the flock       in distant countries i have been   and yet i have not often seen   a healthy man a man full grown   weep in the public roads alone   but such a one on english ground   and in the broad highway i met   along the broad highway he came   his cheeks with tears were wet   sturdy he seemed though he was sad   and in his arms a lamb he had    he saw me and he turned aside   as if he wished himself to hide   then with his coat he made essay   to wipe those briny tears away   i followd him and said my friend   what ails you wherefore weep you so   shame on me sir this lusty lamb   he makes my tears to flow   today i fetched him from the rock   he is the last of all my flock    when i was young a single man   and after youthful follies ran   though little given to care and thought   yet so it was a ewe i bought   and other sheep from her i raised   as healthy sheep as you might see   and then i married and was rich   as i could wish to be   of sheep i numbered a full score   and every year increasd my store    year after year my stock it grew   and from this one this single ewe   full fifty comely sheep i raised   as sweet a flock as ever grazed   upon the mountain did they feed   they throve and we at home did thrive   this lusty lamb of all my store   is all that is alive   and now i care not if we die   and perish all of poverty    six children sir had i to feed   hard labour in a time of need   my pride was tamed and in our grief   i of the parish askd relief   they said i was a wealthy man   my sheep upon the mountain fed   and it was fit that thence i took   whereof to buy us bread   do this how can we give to you   they cried what to the poor is due    i sold a sheep as they had said   and bought my little children bread   and they were healthy with their food   for me it never did me good   a woeful time it was for me   to see the end of all my gains   the pretty flock which i had reared   with all my care and pains   to see it melt like snow away   for me it was a woeful day    another still and still another   a little lamb and then its mother   it was a vein that never stoppd   like blooddrops from my heart they droppd   till thirty were not left alive   they dwindled dwindled one by one   and i may say that many a time   i wished they all were gone   they dwindled one by one away   for me it was a woeful day    to wicked deeds i was inclined   and wicked fancies crossd my mind   and every man i chancd to see   i thought he knew some ill of me   no peace no comfort could i find   no ease within doors or without   and crazily and wearily   i went my work about   ofttimes i thought to run away   for me it was a woeful day    sir twas a precious flock to me   as dear as my own children be   for daily with my growing store   i loved my children more and more   alas it was an evil time   god cursed me in my sore distress   i prayed yet every day i thought   i loved my children less   and every week and every day   my flock it seemed to melt away    they dwindled sir sad sight to see   from ten to five from five to three   a lamb a weather and a ewe   and then at last from three to two   and of my fifty yesterday   i had but only one   and here it lies upon my arm   alas and i have none   today i fetched it from the rock   it is the last of all my flock     lines    left upon a seat in a yewtree which stands near the   lake of esthwaite on a desolate part of the shore   yet commanding a beautiful prospect    nay traveller rest this lonely yewtree stands   far from all human dwelling what if here   no sparkling rivulet spread the verdant herb   what if these barren boughs

who he was   that piled these stones and with the mossy sod   first covered oer and taught this aged tree   with its dark arms to form a circling bower   i well rememberhe was one who owned   no common soul in youth by science nursed   and led by nature into a wild scene   of lofty hopes he to the world went forth   a favored being knowing no desire   which genius did not hallow gainst the taint   of dissolute tongues and jealousy and hate   and scorn against all enemies prepared   all but neglect the world for so it thought   owed him no service he was like a plant   fair to the sun the darling of the winds   but hung with fruit which no one that passed by   regarded and his spirit damped at once   with indignation did he turn away   and with the food of pride sustained his soul   in solitudestranger these gloomy boughs   had charms for him and here he loved to sit   his only visitants a straggling sheep   the stonechat or the glancing sandpiper   and on these barren rocks with juniper   and heath and thistle thinly sprinkled oer   fixing his downcast eye he many an hour   a morbid pleasure nourished tracing here   an emblem of his own unfruitful life   and lifting up his head he then would gaze   on the more distant scene how lovely tis   thou seest and he would gaze till it became   far lovelier and his heart could not sustain   the beauty still more beauteous nor that time   when nature had subdued him to herself   would he forget those beings to whose minds   warm from the labours of benevolence   the world and man himself appeared a scene   of kindred loveliness then he would sigh   with mournful joy to think that others felt   what he must never feel and so lost man   on visionary views would fancy feed   till his eye streamed with tears in this

in dramatic blank verse          but that entrance mother  fostermother    can no one hear it is a perilous tale  maria    no one  fostermother          my husbands father told it me   poor old leoniangels rest his soul   he was a woodman and could fell and saw   with lusty arm you know that huge round beam   which props the hanging wall of the old chapel   beneath that tree while yet it was a tree   he found a baby wrapt in mosses lined   with thistle beards and such small locks of wool   as hang on brambles well he brought him home   and reared him at the then lord velez cost   and so the babe grew up a pretty boy   a pretty boy but most unteachable   and never learnt a prayer nor told a bead   but knew the names of birds and mocked their notes   and whistled as he were a bird himself   and all the autumn twas his only play   to get the seeds of wild flowers and to plant them   with earth and water on the stumps of trees   a friar who gathered simples in the wood   a greyhaired manhe loved this little boy   the boy loved himand when the friar taught him   he soon could write with the pen and from that time   lived chiefly at the convent or the castle   so he became a very learned youth   but oh poor wretchhe read and read and read   till his brain turnedand ere his twentieth year   he had unlawful thoughts of many things   and though he prayed he never loved to pray   with holy men nor in a holy place   but yet his speech it was so soft and sweet   the late lord velez neer was wearied with him   and once as by the north side of the chapel   they stood together chained in deep discourse   the earth heaved under them with such a groan   that the wall tottered and had wellnigh fallen   right on their heads my lord was sorely frightened   a fever seized him and he made confession   of all the heretical and lawless talk   which brought this judgment so the youth was seized   and cast into that cell my husbands father   sobbed like a childit almost broke his heart   and once as he was working in the cellar   he heard a voice distinctly twas the youths   who sang a doleful song about green fields   how sweet it were on lake or wild savannah   to hunt for food and be a naked man   and wander up and down at liberty   leoni doted on the youth and now   his love grew desperate and defying death   he made that cunning entrance i described   and the young man escaped  maria                             tis a sweet tale   and what became of him  fostermother                            he went on shipboard   with those bold voyagers who made discovery   of golden lands leonis younger brother   went likewise and when he returned to spain   he told leoni that the poor mad youth   soon after they arrived in that new world   in spite of his dissuasion seized a boat   and all alone set sail by silent moonlight   up a great river great as any sea   and neer was heard of more but tis supposed   he lived and died among the savage men     goody blake  harry gill   a true story    oh whats the matter whats the matter   what ist that ails young harry gill   that evermore his teeth they chatter   chatter chatter chatter still   of waistcoats harry has no lack   good duffle grey and flannel fine   he has a blanket on his back   and coats enough to smother nine    in march december and in july   tis all the same with harry gill   the neighbours tell and tell you truly   his teeth they chatter chatter still   at night at morning and at noon   tis all the same with harry gill   beneath the sun beneath the moon   his teeth they chatter chatter still    young harry was a lusty drover   and who so stout of limb as he   his cheeks were red as ruddy clover   his voice was like the voice of three   auld goody blake was old and poor   ill fed she was and thinly clad   and any man who passd her door   might see how poor a hut she had    all day she spun in her poor dwelling   and then her three hours work at night   alas twas hardly worth the telling   it would not pay for candlelight   this woman dwelt in dorsetshire   her hut was on a cold hillside   and in that country coals are dear   for they come far by wind and tide    by the same fire to boil their pottage   two poor old dames as i have known   will often live in one small cottage   but she poor woman dwelt alone   twas well enough when summer came   the long warm lightsome summerday   then at her door the canty dame   would sit as any linnet gay    but when the ice our streams did fetter   oh then how her old bones would shake   you would have said if you had met her   twas a hard time for goody blake   her evenings then were dull and dead   sad case it was as you may think   for very cold to go to bed   and then for cold not sleep a wink    oh joy for her wheneer in winter   the winds at night had made a rout   and scatterd many a lusty splinter   and many a rotten bough about   yet never had she well or sick   as every man who knew her says   a pile before hand wood or stick   enough to warm her for three days    now when the frost was past enduring   and made her poor old bones to ache   could any thing be more alluring   than an old hedge to goody blake   and now and then it must be said   when her old bones were cold and chill   she left her fire or left her bed   to seek the hedge of harry gill    now harry he had long suspected   this trespass of old goody blake   and vowd that she should be detected   and he on her would vengeance take   and oft from his warm fire hed go   and to the fields his road would take   and there at night in frost and snow   he watchd to seize old goody blake    and once behind a rick of barley   thus looking out did harry stand   the moon was full and shining clearly   and crisp with frost the stubble land he hears a noisehes all awake   againon tiptoe down the hill   he softly creepstis goody blake   shes at the hedge of harry gill    right glad was he when he beheld her   stick after stick did goody pull   he stood behind a bush of elder   till she had filled her apron full   when with her load she turned about   the byeroad back again to take   he started forward with a shout   and sprang upon poor goody blake    and fiercely by the arm he took her   and by the arm he held her fast   and fiercely by the arm he shook her   and cried ive caught you then at last   then goody who had nothing said   her bundle from her lap let fall   and kneeling on the sticks she prayd   to god that is the judge of all    she prayd her witherd hand uprearing   while harry held her by the arm   god who art never out of hearing   o may he never more be warm   the cold cold moon above her head   thus on her knees did goody pray   young harry heard what she had said   and icycold he turned away    he went complaining all the morrow   that he was cold and very chill   his face was gloom his heart was sorrow   alas that day for harry gill   that day he wore a ridingcoat   but not a whit the warmer he   another was on thursday brought   and ere the sabbath he had three    twas all in vain a useless matter   and blankets were about him pinnd   yet still his jaws and teeth they clatter   like a loose casement in the wind   and harrys flesh it fell away   and all who see him say tis plain   that live as long as live he may   he never will be warm again    no word to any man he utters   abed or up to young or old   but ever to himself he mutters   poor harry gill is very cold   abed or up by night or day   his teeth they chatter chatter still   now think ye farmers all i pray   of goody blake and harry gill     the thorn    i    there is a thorn it looks so old   in truth youd find it hard to say   how it could ever have been young   it looks so old and grey   not higher than a two years child   it stands erect this aged thorn   no leaves it has no thorny points   it is a mass of knotted joints   a wretched thing forlorn   it stands erect and like a stone   with lichens it is overgrown     ii    like rock or stone it is oergrown   with lichens to the very top   and hung with heavy tufts of moss   a melancholy crop   up from the earth these mosses creep   and this poor thorn they clasp it round   so close youd say that they were bent   with plain and manifest intent   to drag it to the ground   and all had joind in one endeavour   to bury this poor thorn for ever     iii    high on a mountains highest ridge   where oft the stormy winter gale   cuts like a scythe while through the clouds   it sweeps from vale to vale   not five yards from the mountainpath   this thorn you on your left espy   and to the left three yards beyond   you see a little muddy pond   of water never dry   ive measured it from side to side   tis three feet long and two feet wide     iv    and close beside this aged thorn   there is a fresh and lovely sight   a beauteous heap a hill of moss   just half a foot in height   all lovely colours there you see   all colours that were ever seen   and mossy network too is there   as if by hand of lady fair   the work had woven been   and cups the darlings of the eye   so deep is their vermillion dye     v    ah me what lovely tints are there   of olive green and scarlet bright   in spikes in branches and in stars   green red and pearly white   this heap of earth oergrown with moss   which close beside the thorn you see   so fresh in all its beauteous dyes   is like an infants grave in size   as like as like can be   but never never any where   an infants grave was half so fair     vi    now would you see this aged thorn   this pond and beauteous hill of moss   you must take care and chuse your time   the mountain when to cross   for oft there sits between the heap   thats like an infants grave in size   and that same pond of which i spoke   a woman in a scarlet cloak   and to herself she cries   oh misery oh misery   oh woe is me oh misery     vii    at all times of the day and night   this wretched woman thither goes   and she is known to every star   and every wind that blows   and there beside the thorn she sits   when the blue daylights in the skies   and when the whirlwinds on the hill   or frosty air is keen and still   and to herself she cries   oh misery oh misery   oh woe is me oh misery     viii    now wherefore thus by day and night   in rain in tempest and in snow   thus to the dreary mountaintop   does this poor woman go   and why sits she beside the thorn   when the blue daylights in the sky   or when the whirlwinds on the hill   or frosty air is keen and still   and wherefore does she cry   oh wherefore wherefore tell me why   does she repeat that doleful cry     ix    i cannot tell i wish i could   for the true reason no one knows   but if youd gladly view the spot   the spot to which she goes   the heap thats like an infants grave   the pondand thorn so old and grey   pass by her doortis seldom shut   and if you see her in her hut   then to the spot away   i never heard of such as dare   approach the spot when she is there     x    but wherefore to the mountaintop   can this unhappy woman go   whatever star is in the skies   whatever wind may blow   nay rack your braintis all in vain   ill tell you every thing i know   but to the thorn and to the pond   which is a little step beyond   i wish that you would go   perhaps when you are at the place   you something of her tale may trace     xi    ill give you the best help i can   before you up the mountain go   up to the dreary mountaintop   ill tell you all i know   tis now some two and twenty years   since she her name is martha ray   gave with a maidens true good will   her company to stephen hill   and she was blithe and gay   and she was happy happy still   wheneer she thought of stephen hill     xii    and they had fixd the weddingday   the morning that must wed them both   but stephen to another maid   had sworn another oath   and with this other maid to church   unthinking stephen went   poor martha on that woful day   a cruel cruel fire they say   into her bones was sent   it dried her body like a cinder   and almost turnd her brain to tinder     xii    they say full six months after this   while yet the summer leaves were green   she to the mountaintop would go   and there was often seen   tis said a child was in her womb   as now to any eye was plain   she was with child and she was mad   yet often she was sober sad   from her exceeding pain   oh me ten thousand times id rather   that he had died that cruel father     xiv    sad case for such a brain to hold   communion with a stirring child   sad case as you may think for one   who had a brain so wild   last christmas when we talked of this   old farmer simpson did maintain   that in her womb the infant wrought   about its mothers heart and brought   her senses back again   and when at last her time drew near   her looks were calm her senses clear     xv    no more i know i wish i did   and i would tell it all to you   for what became of this poor child   theres none that ever knew   and if a child was born or no   theres no one that could ever tell   and if twas born alive or dead   theres no one knows as i have said   but some remember well   that martha ray about this time   would up the mountain often climb     xvi    and all that winter when at night   the wind blew from the mountainpeak   twas worth your while though in the dark   the churchyard path to seek   for many a time and oft were heard   cries coming from the mountainhead   some plainly living voices were   and others ive heard many swear   were voices of the dead   i cannot think whateer they say   they had to do with martha ray     xvii    but that she goes to this old thorn   the thorn which ive described to you   and there sits in a scarlet cloak   i will be sworn is true   for one day with my telescope   to view the ocean wide and bright   when to this country first i came   ere i had heard of marthas name   i climbed the mountains height   a storm came on and i could see   no object higher than my knee     xviii    twas mist and rain and storm and rain   no screen no fence could i discover   and then the wind in faith it was   a wind full ten times over   hooked around i thought i saw   a jutting crag and off i ran   headforemost through the driving rain   the shelter of the crag to gain   and as i am a man   instead of jutting crag i found   a woman seated on the ground     xix    i did not speaki saw her face   in truth it was enough for me   i turned about and heard her cry   o misery o misery   and there she sits until the moon   through half the clear blue sky will go   and when the little breezes make   the waters of the pond to shake   as all the country know   she shudders and you hear her cry   oh misery oh misery     xx    but whats the thorn and whats the pond   and whats the hill of moss to her   and whats the creeping breeze that comes   the little pond to stir   i cannot tell but some will say   she hanged her baby on the tree   some say she drowned it in the pond   which is a little step beyond   but all and each agree   the little babe was buried there   beneath that hill of moss so fair     xxi    ive heard the moss is spotted red   with drops of that poor infants blood   but kill a newborn infant thus   i do not think she could   some say if to the pond you go   and fix on it a steady view   the shadow of a babe you trace   a baby and a babys face   and that it looks at you   wheneer you look on it tis plain   the baby looks at you again     xxii    and some had sworn an oath that she   should be to public justice brought   and for the little infants bones   with spades they would have sought   but then the beauteous bill of moss   before their eyes began to stir   and for full fifty yards around   the grass it shook upon the ground   but all do still aver   the little babe is buried there   beneath that hill of moss so fair     xxiii    i cannot tell how this may be   but plain it is the thorn is bound   with heavy tufts of moss that strive   to drag it to the ground   and this i know full many a time   when she was on the mountain high   by day and in the silent night   when all the stars shone clear and bright   that i have heard her cry   oh misery oh misery   o woe is me oh misery       we are seven    a simple child dear brother jim   that lightly draws its breath   and feels its life in every limb   what should it know of death    i met a little cottage girl   she was eight years old she said   her hair was thick with many a curl   that clusterd round her head    she had a rustic woodland air   and she was wildly clad   her eyes were fair and very fair   her beauty made me glad    sisters and brothers little maid   how many may you be   how many seven in all she said   and wondering looked at me    and where are they i pray you tell   she answered seven are we   and two of us at conway dwell   and two are gone to sea    two of us in the churchyard lie   my sister and my brother   and in the churchyard cottage i   dwell near them with my mother    you say that two at conway dwell   and two are gone to sea   yet you are seven i pray you tell   sweet maid how this may be    then did the little maid reply   seven boys and girls are we   two of us in the churchyard lie   beneath the churchyard tree    you run about my little maid   your limbs they are alive   if two are in the churchyard laid   then ye are only five    their graves are green they may be seen   the little maid replied   twelve steps or more from my mothers door   and they are side by side    my stockings there i often knit   my kerchief there i hem   and there upon the ground i sit   i sit and sing to them    and often after sunset sir   when it is light and fair   i take my little porringer   and eat my supper there    the first that died was little jane   in bed she moaning lay   till god released her of her pain   and then she went away    so in the churchyard she was laid   and all the summer dry   together round her grave we played   my brother john and i    and when the ground was white with snow   and i could run and slide   my brother john was forced to go   and he lies by her side    how many are you then said i   if they two are in heaven   the little maiden did reply   o master we are seven    but they are dead those two are dead   their spirits are in heaven   twas throwing words away for still   the little maid would have her will   and said nay we are seven     anecdote for fathers    shewing how the practice of lying may be taught    i have a boy of five years old   his face is fair and fresh to see   his limbs are cast in beautys mould   and dearly he loves me    one morn we strolld on our dry walk   our quiet house all full in view   and held such intermitted talk   as we are wont to do    my thoughts on former pleasures ran   i thought of kilves delightful shore   my pleasant home when spring began   a long long year before    a day it was when i could bear   to think and think and think again   with so much happiness to spare   i could not feel a pain    my boy was by my side so slim   and graceful in his rustic dress   and oftentimes i talked to him   in very idleness    the young lambs ran a pretty race   the morning sun shone bright and warm   kilve said i was a pleasant place   and so is liswyn farm    my little boy which like you more   i said and took him by the arm   our home by kilves delightful shore   or here at liswyn farm    and tell me had you rather be   i said and heldhim by the arm   at kilves smooth shore by the green sea   or here at liswyn farm    in careless mood he looked at me   while still i held him by the arm   and said at kilve id rather be   than here at liswyn farm    now little edward say why so   my little edward tell me why   i cannot tell i do not know   why this is strange said i    for here are woods and green hills warm   there surely must some reason be   why you would change sweet liswyn farm   for kilve by the green sea    at this my boy hung down his head   he blushd with shame nor made reply   and five times to the child i said   why edward tell me why    his head he raisedthere was in sight   it caught his eye he saw it plain   upon the housetop glittering bright   a broad and gilded vane    then did the boy his tongue unlock   and thus to me he made reply   at kilve there was no weathercock   and thats the reason why    oh dearest dearest boy my heart   for better lore would seldom yearn   could i but teach the hundredth part   of what from thee i learn     lines   written at a small distance from my house and sent by   my little boy to the person to whom they are addressed    it is the first mild day of march   each minute sweeter than before   the redbreast sings from the tall larch   that stands beside our door    there is a blessing in the air   which seems a sense of joy to yield   to the bare trees and mountains bare   and grass in the green field    my sister tis a wish of mine   now that our morning meal is done   make haste your morning task resign   come forth and feel the sun    edward will come with you and pray   put on with speed your woodland dress   and bring no book for this one day   well give to idleness    no joyless forms shall regulate   our living calendar   we from today my friend will date   the opening of the year    love now an universal birth   from heart to heart is stealing   from earth to man from man to earth   it is the hour of feeling    one moment now may give us more   than fifty years of reason   our minds shall drink at every pore   the spirit of the season    some silent laws our hearts may make   which they shall long obey   we for the year to come may take   our temper from today    and from the blessed power that rolls   about below above   well frame the measure of our souls   they shall be tuned to love    then come my sister i come i pray   with speed put on your woodland dress   and bring no book for this one day   well give to idleness     the female vagrant    by derwents side my fathers cottage stood   the woman thus her artless story told   one field a flock and what the neighbouring flood   supplied to him were more than mines of gold   light was my sleep my days in transport rolld   with thoughtless joy i stretchd along the shore   my fathers nets or from the mountain fold   saw on the distant lake his twinkling oar   or watchd his lazy boat still lessning more and more    my father was a good and pious man   an honest man by honest parents bred   and i believe that soon as i began   to lisp he made me kneel beside my bed   and in his hearing there my prayers i said   and afterwards by my good father taught   i read and loved the books in which i read   for books in every neighbouring house i sought   and nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought    can i forget what charms did once adorn   my garden stored with pease and mint and thyme   and rose and lilly for the sabbath morn   the sabbath bells and their delightful chime   the gambols and wild freaks at shearing time   my hens rich nest through long grass scarce espied   the cowslipgathering at mays dewy prime   the swans that when i sought the waterside   from far to meet me came spreading their snowy pride    the staff i yet remember which upbore   the bending body of my active sire   his seat beneath the honeyed sycamore   when the bees hummed and chair by winter fire   when marketmorning came the neat attire   with which though bent on haste myself i deckd   my watchful dog whose starts of furious ire   when stranger passed so often i have checkd   the redbreast known for years which at my casement peckd    the suns of twenty summers danced along   ah little marked how fast they rolled away   then rose a stately hall our woods among   and cottage after cottage owned its sway   no joy to see a neighbouring house or stray   through pastures not his own the master took   my father dared his greedy wish gainsay   he loved his old hereditary nook   and ill could i the thought of such sad parting brook    but when he had refused the proffered gold   to cruel injuries he became a prey   sore traversed in whateer he bought and sold   his troubles grew upon him day by day   till all his substance fell into decay   his little range of water was denied 3   all but the bed where his old body lay   all all was seized and weeping side by side   we sought a home where we uninjured might abide  footnote 3 several of the lakes in the north of england are let out to different fishermen in parcels marked out by imaginary lines drawn from rock to rock    can i forget that miserable hour   when from the last hilltop my sire surveyed   peering above the trees the steeple tower   that on his marriageday sweet music made   till then he hoped his bones might there be laid   close by my mother in their native bowers   bidding me trust in god he stood and prayed   i could not praythrough tears that fell in showers   glimmerd our dearloved home alas no longer ours    there was a youth whom i had loved so long   that when i loved him not i cannot say   mid the green mountains many and many a song   we two had sung like gladsome birds in may   when we began to tire of childish play   we seemed still more and more to prize each other   we talked of marriage and our marriage day   and i in truth did love him like a brother   for never could i hope to meet with such another    his father said that to a distant town   he must repair to ply the artists trade   what tears of bitter grief till then unknown   what tender vows our last sad kiss delayed   to him we turnedwe had no other aid   like one revived upon his neck i wept   and her whom he had loved in joy he said   he well could love in grief his faith he kept   and in a quiet home once more my father slept    four years each day with daily bread was blest   by constant toil and constant prayer supplied   three lovely infants lay upon my breast   and often viewing their sweet smiles i sighed   and knew not why my happy father died   when sad distress reduced the childrens meal   thrice happy that from him the grave did hide   the empty loom cold hearth and silent wheel   and tears that flowed for ills which patience could not heal    twas a hard change an evil time was come   we had no hope and no relief could gain   but soon with proud parade the noisy drum   beat round to sweep the streets of want and pain   my husbands arms now only served to strain   me and his children hungering in his view   in such dismay my prayers and tears were vain   to join those miserable men he flew   and now to the seacoast with numbers more we drew    there foul neglect for months and months we bore   nor yet the crowded fleet its anchor stirred   green fields before us and our native shore   by fever from polluted air incurred   ravage was made for which no knell was heard   fondly we wished and wished away nor knew   mid that long sickness and those hopes deferrd   that happier days we never more must view   the parting signal streamed at last the land withdrew    but from delay the summer calms were past   on as we drove the equinoctial deep   ran mountainshigh before the howling blast   we gazed with terror on the gloomy sleep   of them that perished in the whirlwinds sweep   untaught that soon such anguish must ensue   our hopes such harvest of affliction reap   that we the mercy of the waves should rue   we readied the western world a poor devoted crew    oh i dreadful price of being to resign   all that is dear in being better far   in wants most lonely cave till death to pine   unseen unheard unwatched by any star   or in the streets and walks where proud men are   better our dying bodies to obtrude   than doglike wading at the heels of war   protract a curst existence with the brood   that lap their very nourishment their brothers blood    the pains and plagues that on our heads came down   disease and famine agony and fear   in wood or wilderness in camp or town   it would thy brain unsettle even to hear   all perishedall in one remorseless year   husband and children one by one by sword   and ravenous plague all perished every tear   dried up despairing desolate on board   a british ship i waked as from a trance restored    peaceful as some immeasurable plain   by the first beams of dawning light impressd   in the calm sunshine slept the glittering main   the very ocean has its hour of rest   that comes not to the human mourners breast   remote from man and storms of mortal care   a heavenly silence did the waves invest   i looked and looked along the silent air   until it seemed to bring a joy to my despair    ah how unlike those late terrific sleeps   and groans that rage of racking famine spoke   the unburied dead that lay in festering heaps   the breathing pestilence that rose like smoke   the shriek that from the distant battle broke   the mines dire earthquake and the pallid host   driven by the bombs incessant thunderstroke   to loathsome vaults where heartsick anguish tossd   hope died and fear itself in agony was lost    yet does that burst of woe congeal my frame   when the dark streets appeared to heave and gape   while like a sea the storming army came   and fire from hell reared his gigantic shape   and murder by the ghastly gleam and rape   seized their joint prey the mother and the child   but from these crazing thoughts my brain escape   for weeks the balmy air breathed soft and mild   and on the gliding vessel heaven and ocean smiled    some mighty gulph of separation past   i seemed transported to another world   a thought resigned with pain when from the mast   the impatient mariner the sail unfurld   and whistling called the wind that hardly curled   the silent sea from the sweet thoughts of home   and from all hope i was forever hurled   for mefarthest from earthly port to roam   was best could i but shun the spot where man might       come    and oft robbd of my perfect mind i thought   at last my feet a restingplace had found   here will i weep in peace so fancy wrought   roaming the illimitable waters round   here watch of every human friend disowned   all day my ready tomb the oceanflood   to break my dream the vessel reached its bound   and homeless near a thousand homes i stood   and near a thousand tables pined and wanted food    by grief enfeebled was i turned adrift   helpless as sailor cast on desert rock   nor morsel to my mouth that day did lift   nor dared my hand at any door to knock   i lay where with his drowsy mates the cock   from the cross timber of an outhouse hung   how dismal tolled that night the city clock   at morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung   nor to the beggars language could i frame my tongue    so passed another day and so the third   then did i try in vain the crowds resort   in deep despair by frightful wishes stirrd   near the seaside i reached a ruined fort   there pains which nature could no more support   with blindness linked did on my vitals fall   dizzy my brain with interruption short   of hideous sense i sunk nor step could crawl   and thence was borne away to neighbouring hospital    recovery came with food but still my brain   was weak nor of the past had memory   i heard my neighbours in their beds complain   of many things which never troubled me   of feet still bustling round with busy glee   of looks where common kindness had no part   of service done with careless cruelty   fretting the fever round the languid heart   and groans which as they said would make a dead man start    these things just served to stir the torpid sense   nor pain nor pity in my bosom raised   memory though slow returned with strength and thence   dismissed again on open day i gazed   at houses men and common light amazed   the lanes i sought and as the sun retired   came where beneath the trees a faggot blazed   the wild brood saw me weep my fate enquired   and gave me food and rest more welcome more desired    my heart is touched to think that men like these   the rude earths tenants were my first relief   how kindly did they paint their vagrant ease   and their long holiday that feared not grief   for all belonged to all and each was chief   no plough their sinews strained on grating road   no wain they drove and yet the yellow sheaf   in every vale for their delight was stowed   for them in natures meads the milky udder flowed    semblance with straw and panniered ass they made   of potters wandering on from door to door   but life of happier sort to me pourtrayed   and other joys my fancy to allure   the bagpipe dinning on the midnight moor   in barn uplighted and companions boon   well met from far with revelry secure   in depth of forest glade when jocund june   rolled fast along the sky his warm and genial moon    but ill it suited me in journey dark   oer moor and mountain midnight theft to hatch   to charm the surly housedogs faithful bark   or hang on tiptoe at the lifted latch   the gloomy lantern and the dim blue match   the black disguise the warning whistle shrill   and ear still busy on its nightly watch   were not for me brought up in nothing ill   besides on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still    what could i do unaided and unblest   poor father gone was every friend of thine   and kindred of dead husband are at best   small help and after marriage such as mine   with little kindness would to me incline   ill was i then for toil or service fit   with tears whose course no effort could confine   by highway side forgetful would i sit   whole hours my idle arms in moping sorrow knit    i lived upon the mercy of the fields   and oft of cruelty the sky accused   on hazard or what general bounty yields   now coldly given now utterly refused   the fields i for my bed have often used   but what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth   is that i have my inner self abused   foregone the home delight of constant truth   and clear and open soul so prized in fearless youth    three years a wanderer often have i viewd   in tears the sun towards that country tend   where my poor heart lost all its fortitude   and now across this moor my steps i bend   oh tell me whitherfor no earthly friend   have ishe ceased and weeping turned away   as if because her tale was at an end   she weptbecause she had no more to say   of that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay     the dungeon    and this place our forefathers made for man   this is the process of our love and wisdom   to each poor brother who offends against us   most innocent perhapsand what if guilty   is this the only cure merciful god   each pore and natural outlet shrivelld up   by ignorance and parching poverty   his energies roll back upon his heart   and stagnate and corrupt till changed to poison   they break out on him like a loathsome plague spot   then we call in our pamperd mountebanks   and this is their best cure uncomforted    and friendless solitude groaning and tears   and savage faces at the clanking hour   seen through the steams and vapour of his dungeon   by the lamps dismal twilight so he lies   circled with evil till his very soul   unmoulds its essence hopelessly deformed   by sights of ever more deformity    with other ministrations thou o nature   healest thy wandering and distempered child   thou pourest on him thy soft influences   thy sunny hues fair forms and breathing sheets   thy melodies of woods and winds and waters   till he relent and can no more endure   to be a jarring and a dissonant thing   amid this general dance and minstrelsy   but bursting into tears wins back his way   his angry spirit healed and harmonized   by the benignant touch of love and beauty     simon lee the old huntsman    with an incident in which he was concerned    in the sweet shire of cardigan   not far from pleasant ivorhall   an old man dwells a little man   ive heard he once was tall   of years he has upon his back   no doubt a burthen weighty   he says he is three score and ten   but others say hes eighty    a long blue liverycoat has he   thats fair behind and fair before   yet meet him where you will you see   at once that he is poor   full five and twenty years he lived   a running huntsman merry   and though he has but one eye left   his cheek is like a cherry    no man like him the horn could sound   and no man was so full of glee   to say the least four counties round   had heard of simon lee   his masters dead and no one now   dwells in the hall of ivor   men dogs and horses all are dead   he is the sole survivor    his hunting feats have him bereft   of his right eye as you may see   and then what limbs those feats have left   to poor old simon lee   he has no son he has no child   his wife an aged woman   lives with him near the waterfall   upon the village common    and he is lean and he is sick   his dwindled bodys half awry   his ancles they are swoln and thick   his legs are thin and dry   when he was young he little knew   of husbandry or tillage   and now hes forced to work though weak   the weakest in the village    he all the country could outrun   could leave both man and horse behind   and often ere the race was done   he reeled and was stoneblind   and still theres something in the world   at which his heart rejoices   for when the chiming bounds are out   he dearly loves their voices    old ruth works out of doors with him   and does what simon cannot do   for she not over stout of limb   is stouter of the two   and though you with your utmost skill   from labour could not wean them   alas tis very little all   which they can do between them    beside their mossgrown hut of clay   not twenty paces from the door   a scrap of land they have but they   are poorest of the poor   this scrap of land he from the heath   enclosed when he was stronger   but what avails the land to them   which they can till no longer    few months of life has he in store   as he to you willtell   for still the more he works the more   his poor old ancles swell   my gentle reader i perceive   how patiently youve waited   and im afraid that you expect   some tale will be related    o reader had you in your mind   such stores as silent thought can bring   o gentle reader you would find   a tale in every thing   what more i have to say is short   i hope youll kindly take it   it is no tale but should you think   perhaps a tale youll make it    one summerday i chanced to see   this old man doing all he could   about the root of an old tree   a stump of rotten wood   the mattock totterd in his hand   so vain was his endeavour   that at the root of the old tree   he might have worked for ever    youve overtasked good simon lee   give me your tool to him i said   and at the word right gladly he   received my profferd aid   i struck and with a single blow   the tangled root i severd   at which the poor old man so long   and vainly had endeavoured    the tears into his eyes were brought   and thanks and praises seemed to run   so fast out of his heart i thought   they never would have done   ive heard of hearts unkind kind deeds   with coldness still returning   alas the gratitude of men   has oftner left me mourning     lines    written in early spring    i heard a thousand blended notes   while in a grove i sate reclined   in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts   bring sad thoughts to the mind    to her fair works did nature link   the human soul that through me ran   and much it grievd my heart to think   what man has made of man    through primrose tufts in that sweet bower   the periwinkle traild its wreathes   and tis my faith that every flower   enjoys the air it breathes    the birds around me hoppd and playd   their thoughts i cannot measure   but the least motion which they made   it seemd a thrill of pleasure    the budding twigs spread out their fan   to catch the breezy air   and i must think do all i can   that there was pleasure there    if i these thoughts may not prevent   if such be of my creed the plan   have i not reason to lament   what man has made of man     the nightingale   written in april 1798    no cloud no relique of the sunken day   distinguishes the west no long thin slip   of sullen light no obscure trembling hues   come we will rest on this old mossy bridge   you see the glimmer of the stream beneath   but hear no murmuring it flows silently   oer its soft bed of verdure all is still   a balmy night and tho the stars be dim   yet let us think upon the vernal showers   that gladden the green earth and we shall find   a pleasure in the dimness of the stars    and hark the nightingale begins its song   most musical most melancholy 4 bird   a melancholy bird o idle thought   in nature there is nothing melancholy   but some night wandering man whose heart was piercd   with the remembrance of a grievous wrong   or slow distemper or neglected love   and so poor wretch filld all things with himself   and made all gentle sounds tell back the tale   of his own sorrows he and such as he   first named these notes a melancholy strain   and many a poet echoes the conceit   poet who hath been building up the rhyme  footnote 4 most musical most melancholy this passage in milton possesses an excellence far superior to that of mere description it is spoken in the character of the melancholy man and has therefore a dramatic propriety the author makes this remark to rescue himself from the charge of having alluded with levity to a line in milton a charge than which none could be more painful to him except perhaps that of having ridiculed his bible    when he had better far have stretchd his limbs   beside a brook in mossy forestdell   by sun or moonlight to the influxes   of shapes and sounds and shifting elements   surrendering his whole spirit of his song   and of his fame forgetful so his fame   should share in natures immortality   a venerable thing and so his song   should make all nature lovelier and itself   be lovd like naturebut twill not be so   and youths and maidens most poetical   who lose the deepning twilights of the spring   in ballrooms and hot theatres they still   full of meek sympathy must heave their sighs   oer philomelas pitypleading strains   my friend and my friends sister we have learnt   a different lore we may not thus profane   natures sweet voices always full of love   and joyance tis the merry nightingale    that crowds and hurries and precipitates   with fast thick warble his delicious notes   as he were fearful that an april night   would be too short for him to utter forth   hi lovechant and disburthen his full soul   of all its music and i know a grove   of large extent hard by a castle huge   which the great lord inhabits not and so   this grove is wild with tangling underwood   and the trim walks are broken up and grass   thin grass and kingcups grow within the paths   but never elsewhere in one place i knew   so many nightingales and far and near   in wood and thicket over the wide grove   they answer and provoke each others songs   with skirmish and capricious passagings   and murmurs musical and swift jug jug   and one low piping sound more sweet than all   stirring the air with such an harmony   that should you close your eyes you might almost   forget it was not day                           a most gentle maid   who dwelleth in her hospitable home   hard by the castle and at latest eve   even like a lady vowd and dedicate   to something more than nature in the grove   glides thro the pathways she knows all their notes   that gentle maid and oft a moments space   what time the moon was lost behind a cloud   hath heard a pause of silence till the moon   emerging hath awakend earth and sky   with one sensation and those wakeful birds   have all burst forth in choral minstrelsy   at if one quick and sudden gale had swept   an hundred airy harps and she hath watchd   many a nightingale perch giddily   on blosmy twig still swinging from the breeze   and to that motion tune his wanton song   like tipsy joy that reels with tossing head    farewell o warbler till tomorrow eve   and you my friends farewell a short farewell   we have been loitering long and pleasantly   and now for our dear homesthat strain again   full fain it would delay memy dear babe   who capable of no articulate sound   mars all things with his imitative lisp   how he would place his hand beside his ear   his little hand the small forefinger up   and bid us listen and i deem it wise   to make him natures playmate he knows well   the evening star and once when he awoke   in most distressful mood some inward pain   had made up that strange thing an infants dream   i hurried with him to our orchard plot   and he beholds the moon and hushd at once   suspends his sobs and laughs most silently   while his fair eyes that swam with undropt tears   did glitter in the yellow moonbeam  well   it is a fathers tale but if that heaven   should give me life his childhood shall grow up   familiar with these songs that with the night   he may associate joy once more farewell   sweet nightingale once more my friends farewell     lines   written when sailing in a boat at evening    how rich the wave in front imprest   with evening twilights summer hues   while facing thus the crimson west   the boat her silent path pursues   and see how dark the backward stream   a little moment past so smiling   and still perhaps with faithless gleam   some other loiterer beguiling    such views the youthful bard allure   but heedless of the following gloom   he deems their colours shall endure   till peace go with him to the tomb   and let him nurse his fond deceit   and what if he must die in sorrow   who would not cherish dreams so sweet   though grief and pain may come tomorrow     lines   written near richmond upon the thames    glide gently thus for ever glide   o thames that other bards may see   as lovely visions by thy side   as now fair river come to me   oh glide fair stream for ever so   thy quiet soul on all bestowing   till all our minds for ever flow   as thy deep waters now are flowing    vain thought yet be as now thou art   that in thy waters may be seen   the image of a poets heart   how bright how solemn how serene   such as did once the poet bless   who pouring here a later ditty   could find no refuge from distress   but in the milder grief of pity    remembrance as we float along   for him suspend the dashing oar   and pray that never child of song   may know his freezing sorrows more   how calm how still the only sound   the dripping of the oar suspended   the evening darkness gathers round   by virtues holiest powers attended 5  footnote

bettys face with joy oerflows   proud of herself and proud of him   she sees him in his travelling trim   how quietly her johnny goes    the silence of her idiot boy   what hopes it sends to bettys heart   hes at the guideposthe turns right   she watches till hes out of sight   and betty will not then depart    burr burrnow johnnys lips they burr   as loud as any mill or near it   meek as a lamb the pony moves   and johnny makes the noise he loves   and betty listens glad to hear it    away she hies to susan gale   and johnnys in a merry tune   the owlets hoot the owlets purr   and johnnys lips they burr burr burr   and on he goes beneath the moon    his steed and he right well agree   for of this pony theres a rumour   that should he lose his eyes and ears   and should he live a thousand years   he never will be out of humour    but then he is a horse that thinks   and when he thinks his pace is slack   now though he knows poor johnny well   yet for his life he cannot tell   what he has got upon his back    so through the moonlight lanes they go   and far into the moonlight dale   and by the church and oer the down   to bring a doctor from the town   to comfort poor old susan gale    and betty now at susans side   is in the middle of her story   what comfort johnny soon will bring   with many a most diverting thing   of johnnys wit and johnnys glory    and bettys still at susans side   by this time shes not quite so flurried   demure with porringer and plate   she sits as if in susans fate   her life and soul were buried    but betty poor good woman she   you plainly in her face may read it   could lend out of that moments store   five years of happiness or more   to any that might need it    but yet i guess that now and then   with betty all was not so well   and to the road she turns her ears   and thence full many a sound she hears   which she to susan will not tell    poor susan moans poor susan groans   as sure as theres a moon in heaven   cries betty hell be back again   theyll both be here tis almost ten   theyll both be here before eleven    poor susan moans poor susan groans   the clock gives warning for eleven   tis on the strokeif johnnys near   quoth betty he will soon be here   as sure as theres a moon in heaven    the clock is on the stroke of twelve   and johnny is not yet in sight   the moons in heaven as betty sees   but betty is not quite at ease   and susan has a dreadful night    and betty half an hour ago   on johnny vile reflections cast   a little idle sauntering thing   with other names an endless string   but now that time is gone and past    and bettys drooping at the heart   that happy time all past and gone   how can it be he is so late   the doctor he has made him wait   susan theyll both be here anon    and susans growing worse and worse   and bettys in a sad quandary   and then theres nobody to say   if she must go or she must stay   shes in a sad quandary    the clock is on the stroke of one   but neither doctor nor his guide   appear along the moonlight road   theres neither horse nor man abroad   and bettys still at susans side    and susan she begins to fear   of sad mischances not a few   that johnny may perhaps be drownd   or lost perhaps and never found   which they must both for ever rue    she prefaced half a hint of this   with god forbid it should be true   at the first word that susan said   cried betty rising from the bed   susan id gladly stay with you    i must be gone i must away   consider johnnys but halfwise   susan we must take care of him   if he is hurt in life or limb   oh god forbid poor susan cries    what can i do says betty going   what can i do to ease your pain   good susan tell me and ill stay   i fear youre in a dreadful way   but i shall soon be back again    nay betty go good betty go   theres nothing that can ease my pain   then off she hies but with a prayer   that god poor susans life would spare   till she comes back again    so through the moonlight lane she goes   and far into the moonlight dale   and how she ran and how she walked   and all that to herself she talked   would surely be a tedious tale    in high and low above below   in great and small in round and square   in tree and tower was johnny seen   in bush and brake in black and green   twas johnny johnny every where    shes past the bridge thats in the dale   and now the thought torments her sore   johnny perhaps his horse forsook   to hunt the moon thats in the brook   and never will be heard of more    and now shes high upon the down   alone amid a prospect wide   theres neither johnny nor his horse   among the fern or in the gorse   theres neither doctor nor his guide    oh saints what is become of him   perhaps hes climbed into an oak   where he will stay till he is dead   or sadly he has been misled   and joined the wandering gypseyfolk    or him that wicked ponys carried   to the dark cave the goblins hall   or in the castle hes pursuing   among the ghosts his own undoing   or playing with the waterfall    at poor old susan then she railed   while to the town she posts away   if susan had not been so ill   alas i should have had him still   my johnny till my dying day    poor betty in this sad distemper   the doctors self would hardly spare   unworthy things she talked and wild   even he of cattle the most mild   the pony had his share    and now shes got into the town   and to the doctors door she hies   tis silence all on every side   the town so long the town so wide   is silent as the skies    and now shes at the doctors door   she lifts the knocker rap rap rap   the doctor at the casement shews   his glimmering eyes that peep and doze   and one hand rubs his old nightcap    oh doctor doctor wheres my johnny   im here what ist you want with me   oh sir you know im betty foy   and i have lost my poor dear boy   you know himhim you often see    hes not so wise as some folks be   the devil take his wisdom said   the doctor looking somewhat grim   what woman should i know of him   and grumbling he went back to bed    o woe is me o woe is me   here will i die here will i die   i thought to find my johnny here   but he is neither far nor near   oh what a wretched mother i    she stops she stands she looks about   which way to turn she cannot tell   poor betty it would ease her pain   if she had heart to knock again   the clock strikes threea dismal knell    then up along the town she hies   no wonder if her senses fail   this piteous news so much it shockd her   she quite forgot to send the doctor   to comfort poor old susan gale    and now shes high upon the down   and she can see a mile of road   oh cruel im almost threescore   such night as this was neer before   theres not a single soul abroad    she listens but she cannot hear   the foot of horse the voice of man   the streams with softest sound are flowing   the grass you almost hear it growing   you hear it now if eer you can    the owlets through the long blue night   are shouting to each other still   fond lovers yet not quite hob nob   they lengthen out the tremulous sob   that echoes far from hill to hill    poor betty now has lost all hope   her thoughts are bent on deadly sin   a greengrown pond she just has passd   and from the brink she hurries fast   lest she should drown herself therein    and now she sits her down and weeps   such tears she never shed before   oh dear dear pony my sweet joy   oh carry back my idiot boy   and we will neer oerload thee more    a thought it come into her head   the pony he is mild and good   and we have always used him well   perhaps hes gone along the dell   and carried johnny to the wood    then up she springs as if on wings   she thinks no more of deadly sin   if betty fifty ponds should see   the last of all her thoughts would be   to drown herself therein    oh reader now that i might tell   what johnny and his horse are doing   what theyve been doing all this time   oh could i put it into rhyme   a most delightful tale pursuing    perhaps and no unlikely thought   he with his pony now doth roam   the cliffs and peaks so high that are   to lay his hands upon a star   and in his pocket bring it home    perhaps hes turned himself about   his face unto his horses tail   and still and mute in wonder lost   all like a silent horseman ghost   he travels on along the vale    and now perhaps hes hunting sheep   a fierce and dreadful hunter he   yon valley thats so trim and green   in five months time should he be seen   a desart wilderness will be    perhaps with head and heels on fire   and like the very soul of evil   hes galloping away away   and so hell gallop on for aye   the bane of all that dread the devil    i to the muses have been bound   these fourteen years by strong indentures   oh gentle muses let me tell   but half of what to him befel   for sure he met with strange adventures    oh gentle muses is this kind   why will ye thus my suit repel   why of your further aid bereave me   and can ye thus unfriended leave me   ye muses whom i love so well    whos yon that near the waterfall   which thunders down with headlong force   beneath the moon yet shining fair   as careless as if nothing were   sits upright on a feeding horse    unto his horse thats feeding free   he seems i think the rein to give   of moon or stars he takes no heed   of such we in romances read   tis johnny johnny as i live    and thats the very pony too   where is she where is betty foy   she hardly can sustain her fears   the roaring waterfall she hears   and cannot find her idiot boy    your ponys worth his weight in gold   then calm your terrors betty foy   shes coming from among the trees   and now all full in view she sees   him whom she loves her idiot boy    and betty sees the pony too   why stand you thus good betty foy   it is no goblin tis no ghost   tis he whom you so long have lost   he whom you love your idiot boy    she looks againher arms are up   she screamsshe cannot move for joy   she darts as with a torrents force   she almost has oerturned the horse   and fast she holds her idiot boy    and johnny burrs and laughs aloud   whether in cunning or in joy   i cannot tell but while he laughs   betty a drunken pleasure quaffs   to hear again her idiot boy    and now shes at the ponys tail   and now shes at the ponys head   on that side now and now on this   and almost stifled with her bliss   a few sad tears does betty shed    she kisses oer and oer again   him whom she loves her idiot boy   shes happy here shes happy there   she is uneasy every where   her limbs are all alive with joy    she pats the pony where or when   she knows not happy betty foy   the little pony glad may be   but he is milder far than she   you hardly can perceive his joy    oh johnny never mind the doctor   youve done your best and that is all   she took the reins when this was said   and gently turned the ponys head   from the loud waterfall    by this the stars were almost gone   the moon was setting on the hill   so pale you scarcely looked at her   the little birds began to stir   though yet their tongues were still    the pony betty and her boy   wind slowly through the woody dale   and who is she betimes abroad   that hobbles up the steep rough road   who is it but old susan gale    long susan lay deep lost in thought   and many dreadful fears beset her   both for her messenger and nurse   and as her mind grew worse and worse   her body it grew better    she turned she tossd herself in bed   on all sides doubts and terrors met her   point after point did she discuss   and while her mind was fighting thus   her body still grew better    alas what is become of them   these fears can never be endured   ill to the woodthe word scarce said   did susan rise up from her bed   as if by magic cured    away she posts up hill and down   and to the wood at length is come   she spies her friends she shouts a greeting   oh me it is a merry meeting   as ever was in christendom    the owls have hardly sung their last   while our four travellers homeward wend   the owls have hooted all night long   and with the owls began my song   and with the owls must end    for while they all were travelling home   cried betty tell us johnny do   where all this long night you have been   what you have heard what you have seen   and johnny mind you tell us true    now johnny all night long had heard   the owls in tuneful concert strive   no doubt too he the moon had seen   for in the moonlight he had been   from eight oclock till five    and thus to bettys question he   made answer like a traveller bold   his very words i give to you   the cocks did crow towhoo towhoo   and the sun did shine so cold   thus answered johnny in his glory   and that was all his travels story     love    all thoughts all passions all delights   whatever stirs this mortal frame   all are but ministers of love     and feed his sacred flame    oft in my waking dreams do i   live oer again that happy hour   when midway on the mount i lay     beside the ruind tower    the moonshine stealing oer the scene   had blended with the lights of eve   and she was there my hope my joy     my own dear genevieve    she leand against the armed man   the statue of the armed knight   she stood and listend to my harp     amid the lingring light    few sorrows hath she of her own   my hope my joy my genevieve   she loves me best wheneer i sing     the songs that make her grieve    i playd a soft and doleful air   i sang an old and moving story   an old rude song that fitted well     the ruin wild and hoary    she listend with a flitting blush   with downcast eyes and modest grace   for well she knew i could not choose     but gaze upon her face    i told her of the knight that wore   upon his shield a burning brand   and that for ten long years he wood     the lady of the land    i told her how he pind and ah   the low the deep the pleading tone   with which i sang anothers love     interpreted my own    she listend with a flitting blush   with downcast eyes and modest grace   and she forgave me that i gazd     too fondly on her face    but when i told the cruel scorn   which crazd this bold and lovely knight   and that be crossd the mountain woods     nor rested day nor night    that sometimes from the savage den   and sometimes from the darksome shade   and sometimes starting up at once     in green and sunny glade    there came and lookd him in the face   an angel beautiful and bright   and that he knew it was a fiend     this miserable knight    and that unknowing what he did   he leapt amid a murdrous band   and savd from outrage worse than death     the lady of the land    and how she wept and claspd his knees   and how she tended him in vain   and ever strove to expiate     the scorn that crazd his brain    and that she nursd him in a cave   and how his madness went away   when on the yellow forest leaves     a dying man he lay    his dying wordsbut when i reachd   that tenderest strain of all the ditty   my faltring voice and pausing harp     disturbd her soul with pity    all impulses of soul and sense   had thrilld my guileless genevieve   the music and the doleful tale     the rich and balmy eve    and hopes and fears that kindle hope   an undistinguishable throng   and gentle wishes long subdued     subdued and cherishd long    she wept with pity and delight   she blushd with love and maiden shame   and like the murmur of a dream     i heard her breathe my name    her bosom heavdshe steppd aside   as conscious of my look she steppd   then suddenly with timorous eye     she fled to me and wept    she half inclosed me with her arms   she pressd me with a meek embrace   and bending back her head lookd up     and gazd upon my face    twas partly love and partly fear   and partly twas a bashful art   that i might rather feel than see     the swelling of her heart    i calmd her tears and she was calm   and told her love with virgin pride   and so i won my genevieve     my bright and beauteous bride     the mad mother    her eyes are wild her head is bare   the sun has burnt her coalblack hair   her eyebrows have a rusty stain   and she came far from over the main   she has a baby on her arm   or else she were alone   and underneath the haystack warm   and on the greenwood stone   she talked and sung the woods among   and it was in the english tongue    sweet babe they say that i am mad   but nay my heart is far too glad   and i am happy when i sing   full many a sad and doleful thing   then lovely baby do not fear   i pray thee have no fear of me   but safe as in a cradle here   my lovely baby thou shalt be   to thee i know too much i owe   i cannot work thee any woe    a fire was once within my brain   and in my head a dull dull pain   and fiendish faces one two three   hung at my breasts and pulled at me   but then there came a sight of joy   it came at once to do me good   i waked and saw my little boy   my little boy of flesh and blood   oh joy for me that sight to see   for he was here and only he    suck little babe oh suck again   it

waves below   when oer the searocks edge we go   the high crag cannot work me harm   nor leaping torrents when they howl   the babe i carry on my arm   he saves for me my precious soul   then happy

and there my babe well live for aye     the ancient mariner   a poets reverie  argument  how a ship having first sailed to the equator was driven by storms to the cold country towards the south pole how the ancient mariner cruelly and in contempt of the laws of hospitality killed a seabird and how he was followed by many and strange judgements and in what manner he came back to his own country     the ancient mariner  a poets reverie  i    it is an ancient mariner     and he stoppeth one of three   by thy long grey beard and thy glittering eye     now wherefore stoppest me    the bridegrooms doors are opend wide     and i am next of kin   the guests are met the feast is set     mayst hear the merry din    but still he holds the wedding guest     there was a ship quoth he   nay if thoust got a laughsome tale     mariner come with me    he holds him with his skinny hand     quoth he there was a ship   now get thee hence thou greybeard loon     or my staff shall make thee skip    he holds him with his glittering eye     the wedding guest stood still   and listens like a three years child     the mariner hath his will    the weddingguest sate on a stone     he cannot chuse but hear   and thus spake on that ancient man     the brighteyed mariner    the ship was cheerd the harbour cleard     merrily did we drop   below the kirk below the hill     below the lighthouse top    the sun came up upon the left     out of the sea came he   and he shone bright and on the right     went down into the sea    higher and higher every day     till over the mast at noon   the weddingguest here beat his breast     for he heard the loud bassoon    the bride hath pacd into the hall     red as a rose is she   nodding their heads before her goes     the merry minstralsy    the weddingguest he beat his breast     yet he cannot chuse but hear   and thus spake on that ancient man     the brighteyed mariner    but now the northwind came more fierce     there came a tempest strong   and southward still for days and weeks     like chaff we drove along    and now there came both mist and snow     and it grew wondrous cold   and ice masthigh came floating by     as green as emerald    and thro the drifts the snowy clifts     did send a dismal sheen   nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken     the ice was all between    the ice was here the ice was there     the ice was all around   it crackd and growld and roard and howld     a wild and ceaseless sound    at length did cross an albatross     thorough the fog it came   as if it had been a christian soul     we haild it in gods name    the mariners gave it biscuitworms     and round and round it flew   the ice did split with a thunderfit     the helmsman steerd us thro    and a good south wind sprung up behind     the albatross did follow   and every day for food or play     came to the mariners hollo    in mist or cloud on mast or shroud     it perchd for vespers nine   whiles all the night thro fogsmoke white     glimmerd the white moonshine    god save thee ancient mariner     from the fiends that plague thee thus   why lookst thou sowith my cross bow     i shot the albatross   ii    the sun now rose upon the right     out of the sea came he   still hid in mist and on the left     went down into the sea    and the good south wind still blew behind     but no sweet bird did follow   nor any day for food or play     came to the mariners hollo    and i had done an hellish thing     and it would work em woe   for all averrd i had killd the bird     that made the breeze to blow    nor dim nor red like an angels head     the glorious sun uprist   then all averrd i had killd the bird     that brought the fog and mist    twas right said they such birds to slay     that bring the fog and mist    the breezes blew the white foam flew     the furrow followd free   we were the first that ever burst     into that silent sea    down dropt the breeze the sails dropt down     twas sad as sad could be   and we did speak only to break     the silence of the sea    all in a hot and copper sky     the bloody sun at noon   right up above the mast did stand     no bigger than the moon    day after day day after day     we stuck nor breath nor motion   as idle as a painted ship     upon a painted ocean    water water every where     and all the boards did shrink   water water every where     nor any drop to drink    the very deeps did rot o christ     that ever this should be   yea slimy things did crawl with legs     upon the slimy sea    about about in reel and rout     the deathfires dancd at night   the water like a witchs oils     burnt green and blue and white    and some in dreams assured were     of the spirit that plagued us so   nine fathom deep he had followd us     from the land of mist and snow    and every tongue thro utter drouth     was witherd at the root   we could not speak no more than if     we had been choked with soot    ah weladay what evil looks     had i from old and young   instead of the cross the albatross     about my neck was hung   iii    so past a weary time each throat     was parchd and glazd each eye   when looking westward i beheld     a something in the sky    at first it seemd a little speck     and then it seemd a mist   it movd and movd and took at last     a certain shape i wist    a speck a mist a shape i wist     and still it neard and neard   and as if it dodgd a watersprite     it plungd and tackd and veerd    with throat unslackd with black lips bakd     we could nor laugh nor wail   thro utter drouth all dumb we stood   till i bit my arm and suckd the blood     and cryd a sail a sail    with throat unslackd with black lips bakd     agape they heard me call   gramercy they for joy did grin   and all at once their breath drew in     as they were drinking all    see see i cryd she tacks no more     hither to work us weal   without a breeze without a tide     she steddies with upright keel    the western wave was all a flame     the day was well nigh done   almost upon the western wave     rested the broad bright sun   when that strange shape drove suddenly     betwixt us and the sun    and strait the sun was fleckd with bars     heavens mother send us grace   as if thro a dungeon grate he peerd     with broad and burning face    alas thought i and my heart beat loud     how fast she nears and nears   are those her sails that glance in the sun     like restless gossameres    are those her ribs thro which the sun     did peer as thro a grate   and are those two all all her crew     that woman and her mate    his bones were black with many a crack     all black and bare i ween   jetblack and bare save where with rust   of mouldy damps and charnel crust     they were patchd with purple and green    her lips were red her looks were free     her locks were yellow as gold   her skin was as white as leprosy   and she was far liker death than he     her flesh made the still air cold    the naked hulk alongside came     and the twain were playing dice   the game is done ive won ive won     quoth she and whistled thrice    a gust of wind sterte up behind     and whistled thro his bones   thro the holes of his eyes and the hole of his mouth     halfwhistles and halfgroans    with never a whisper in the sea     off darts the spectreship   while clombe above the eastern bar   the horned moon with one bright star     almost between the tips    one after one by the horned moon     listen o stranger to me   each turnd his face with a ghastly pang     and cursd me with his ee    four times fifty living men     with never a sigh or groan   with heavy thump a lifeless lump     they droppd down one by one    their souls did from their bodies fly     they fled to bliss or woe   and every soul it passd me by     like the whiz of my crossbow   iv    i fear thee ancient mariner     i fear thy skinny hand   and thou art long and lank and brown     as is the ribbd seasand    i fear thee and thy glittering eye     and thy skinny hand so brown   fear not fear not thou wedding guest     this body dropt not down    alone alone all all alone     alone on the wide wide sea   and christ would take no pity on     my soul in agony    the many men so beautiful     and they all dead did lie   and a million million slimy things     livd onand so did i    i lookd upon the rotting sea     and drew my eyes away   i lookd upon the ghastly deck     and there the dead men lay    i lookd to heaven and tryd to pray     but or ever a prayer had gusht   a wicked whisper came and made     my heart as dry as dust    i closd my lids and kept them close     till the balls like pulses beat   for the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky   lay like a load on my weary eye     and the dead were at my feet    the cold sweat melted from their limbs     nor rot nor reek did they   the look with which they lookd on me     had never passd away    an orphans curse would drag to hell     a spirit from on high   but o more horrible than that     is the curse in a dead mans eye   seven days seven nights i saw that curse     and yet i could not die    the moving moon went up the sky     and no where did abide   softly she was going up     and a star or two beside    her beams bemockd the sultry main     like april hoarfrost spread   but where the ships huge shadow lay   the charmed water burnt alway     a still and awful red    beyond the shadow of the ship     i watchd the watersnakes   they movd in tracks of shining white   and when they reard the elfish light     fell off in hoary flakes    within the shadow of the ship     i watchd their rich attire   blue glossy green and velvet black   they coild and swam and every track     was a flash of golden fire    o happy living things no tongue     their beauty might declare   a spring of love gusht from my heart     and i blessd them unaware   sure my kind saint took pity on me     and i blessd them unaware    the selfsame moment i could pray     and from my neck so free   the albatross fell off and sank     like lead into the sea   v    o sleep it is a gentle thing     belovd from pole to pole   to maryqueen the praise be given   she sent the gentle sleep from heaven     that slid into my soul    the silly buckets on the deck     that had so long remaind   i dreamt that they were filld with dew     and when i awoke it raind    my lips were wet my throat was cold     my garments all were dank   sure i had drunken in my dreams     and still my body drank    i movd and could not feel my limbs     i was so light almost   i thought that i had died in sleep     and was a blessed ghost    and soon i heard a roaring wind     it did not come anear   but with its sound it shook the sails     that were so thin and sere    the upper air burst into life     and a hundred fireflags sheen   to and fro they were hurried about   and to and fro and in and out     the wan stars dancd between    and the coming wind did roar more loud     and the sails did sigh like sedge   and the rain pourd down from one black cloud     the moon was at its edge    the thick black cloud was cleft and still     the moon was at its side   like waters shot from some high crag   the lightning fell with never a jag     a river steep and wide    the loud wind never reachd the ship     yet now the ship movd on   beneath the lightning and the moon     the dead men gave a groan    they groand they stirrd they all uprose     nor spake nor movd their eyes   it had been strange even in a dream     to have seen those dead men rise    the helmsman steerd the ship movd on     yet never a breeze upblew   the mariners all gan work the ropes     where they were wont to do   they raisd their limbs like lifeless tools     we were a ghastly crew    the body of my brothers son     stood by me knee to knee   the body and i pulld at one rope     but he said nought to me    i fear thee ancient mariner     be calm thou wedding guest   twas not those souls that fled in pain   which to their corses came again     but a troop of spirits blest    for when it dawndthey droppd their arms     and clusterd round the mast   sweet sounds rose slowly thro their mouths     and from their bodies passd    around around flew each sweet sound     then darted to the sun   slowly the sounds came back again     now mixd now one by one    sometimes a dropping from the sky     i heard the skylark sing   sometimes all little birds that are   how they seemd to fill the sea and air     with their sweet jargoning    and now twas like all instruments     now like a lonely flute   and now it is an angels song     that makes the heavens be mute    it ceasd yet still the sails made on     a pleasant noise till noon   a noise like of a hidden brook     in the leafy month of june   that to the sleeping woods all night     singeth a quiet tune    till noon we silently saild on     yet never a breeze did breathe   slowly and smoothly went the ship     movd onward from beneath    under the keel nine fathom deep     from the land of mist and snow   the spirit slid and it was he     that made the ship to go   the sails at noon left off their tune     and the ship stood still also    the sun right up above the mast     had fixd her to the ocean   but in a minute she gan stir     with a short uneasy motion   backwards and forwards half her length     with a short uneasy motion    then like a pawing horse let go     she made a sudden bound   it flung the blood into my head     and i fell into a swound    how long in that same fit i lay     i have not to declare   but ere my living life returnd   i heard and in my soul discernd     two voices in the air    is it he quoth one is this the man     by him who died on cross   with his cruel bow he layd full low     the harmless albatross    the spirit who bideth by himself     in the land of mist and snow   he lovd the bird that lovd the man     who shot him with his bow    the other was a softer voice     as soft as honeydew   quoth he the man hath penance done     and penance more will do   vi    first voice    but tell me tell me speak again     thy soft response renewing   what makes that ship drive on so fast     what is the ocean doing    second voice    still as a slave before his lord     the ocean hath no blast   his great bright eye most silently     up to the moon is cast    if he may know which way to go     for she guides him smooth or grim   see brother see how graciously     she looketh down on him    first voice    but why drives on that ship so fast     without or wave or wind    second voice    the air is cut away before     and closes from behind    fly brother fly more high more high     or we shall be belated   for slow and slow that ship will go     when the mariners trance is abated    i woke and we were sailing on     as in a gentle weather   twas night calm night the moon was high     the dead men stood together    all stood together on the deck     for a charneldungeon fitter   all fixd on me their stony eyes     that in the moon did glitter    the pang the curse with which they died     had never passd away   i could not draw my eyes from theirs     nor turn them up to pray    and now this spell was snapt once more     i viewd the ocean green   and lookd far forth yet little saw     of what had else been seen    like one that on a lonesome road     doth walk in fear and dread   and having once turnd round walks on     and turns no more his head   because he knows a frightful fiend     doth close behind him tread    but soon there breathd a wind on me     nor sound nor motion made   its path was not upon the sea     in ripple or in shade    it raisd my hair it fannd my cheek     like a meadowgale of spring   it mingled strangely with my fears     yet it felt like a welcoming    swiftly swiftly flew the ship     yet she saild softly too   sweetly sweetly blew the breeze     on me alone it blew    o dream of joy is this indeed     the lighthouse top i see   is this the hill is this the kirk     is this mine own countrée    we drifted oer the harbourbar     and i with sobs did pray   o let me be awake my god     or let me sleep alway    the harbourbay was clear as glass     so smoothly it was strewn   and on the bay the moonlight lay     and the shadow of the moon    the rock shone bright the kirk no less     that stands above the rock   the moonlight steepd in silentness     the steady weathercock    and the bay was white with silent light     till rising from the same   full many shapes that shadows were     in crimson colours came    a little distance from the prow     those crimson shadows were   i turnd my eyes upon the deck     o christ what saw i there    each corse lay flat lifeless and flat     and by the holy rood   a man all light a seraphman     on every corse there stood    this seraphband each wavd his hand     it was a heavenly sight   they stood as signals to the land     each one a lovely light    this seraphband each wavd his hand     no voice did they impart   no voice but o the silence sank     like music on my heart    but soon i heard the dash of oars     i heard the pilots cheer   my head was turnd perforce away     and i saw a boat appear    the pilot and the pilots boy     i heard them coming fast   dear lord in heaven it was a joy     the dead men could not blast    i saw a thirdi heard his voice     it is the hermit good   he singeth loud his godly hymns     that he makes in the wood   hell shrive my soul hell wash away     the albatrosss blood   vii    this hermit good lives in that wood     which slopes down to the sea   how loudly his sweet voice he rears   he loves to talk with mariners     that come from a far countrée    he kneels at morn and noon and eve     he hath a cushion plump   it is the moss that wholly hides     the rotted old oakstump    the skiffboat nerd i heard them talk     why this is strange i trow   where are those lights so many and fair     that signal made but now    strange by my faith the hermit said     and they answerd not our cheer   the planks look warpd and see those sails     how thin they are and sere   i never saw aught like to them     unless perchance it were    the skeletons of leaves that lag     my forest brook along   when the ivytod is heavy with snow   and the owlet whoops to the wolf below     that eats the shewolfs young    dear lord it has a fiendish look     the pilot made reply   i am afeardpush on push on     said the hermit cheerily    the boat came closer to the ship     but i nor spake nor stirrd   the boat came close beneath the ship     and strait a sound was heard    under the water it rumbled on     still louder and more dread   it reachd the ship it split the bay     the ship went down like lead    stunnd by that loud and dreadful sound     which sky and ocean smote   like one that hath been seven days drownd     my body lay afloat   but swift as dreams myself i found     within the pilots boat    upon the whirl where sank the ship     the boat spun round and round   and all was still save that the hill     was telling of the sound    i movd my lips the pilot shriekd     and fell down in a fit   the holy hermit raisd his eyes     and prayd where he did sit    i took the oars the pilots boy     who now doth crazy go   laughd loud and long and all the while     his eyes went to and fro   ha ha quoth hefull plain i see     the devil knows how to row    and now all in mine own countrée     i stood on the firm land   the hermit steppd forth from the boat     and scarcely he could stand    o shrieve me shrieve me holy man     the hermit crossd his brow   say quick quoth he i bid thee say     what manner man art thou    forthwith this frame of mind was wrenchd     with a woeful agony   which forcd me to begin my tale     and then it left me free    since then at an uncertain hour     that agency returns   and till my ghastly tale is told     this heart within me burns    i pass like night from land to land     i have strange power of speech   the moment that his face i see   i know the man that must hear me     to him my tale i teach    what loud uproar bursts from that door     the weddingguests are there   but in the gardenbower the bride     and bridemaids singing are   and hark the little vesperbell     which biddeth me to prayer    o weddingguest this soul hath been     alone on a wide wide sea   so lonely twas that god himself     scarce seemed there to be    o sweeter than the marriagefeast     tis sweeter far to me   to walk together to the kirk     with a goodly company    to walk together to the kirk     and all together pray   while each to his great father bends   old men and babes and loving friends     and youths and maidens gay    farewell farewell but this i tell     to thee thou weddingguest   he prayeth well who loveth well     both man and bird and beast    he prayeth best who loveth best     all things both great and small   for the dear god who loveth us     he made and loveth all    the mariner whose eye is bright     whose beard with age is hoar   is gone and now the weddingguest     turnd from the bridegrooms door    he went like one that hath been stunnd     and is of sense forlorn   a sadder and a wiser man     he rose the morrow morn     lines   written a few miles above tintern abbey an revisiting the banks of   the wye during a tour   july 13 1798    five years have passed five summers with the length   of five long winters and again i hear   these waters rolling from their mountainsprings   with a sweet inland murmur 6once again   do i behold these steep and lofty cliffs   which on a wild secluded scene impress   thoughts of more deep seclusion and connect   the landscape with the quiet of the sky  footnote 6 the river is not affacted by the tides a few miles above tintern    the day is come when i again repose   here under this dark sycamore and view   these plots of cottageground these orchardtufts   which at this season with their unripe fruits   among the woods and copses lose themselves   nor with their green and simple hue disturb   the wild green landscape once again i see   these hedgerows hardly hedgerows little lines   of sportive wood run wild these pastoral farms   green to the very door and wreathes of smoke   sent up in silence from among the trees   with some uncertain notice as might seem   of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods   or of some hermits cave where by his fire   the hermit sits alone                           though absent long   these forms of beauty have not been to me   as is a landscape to a blind mans eye   but oft in lonely rooms and mid the din   of towns and cities i have owed to them   in hours of wariness sensations sweet   felt in the blood and felt along the heart   and passing even into my purer mind    with tranquil restorationfeelings too   of unremembered pleasure such perhaps   as may have had no trivial influence   on that best portion of a good mans life   his little nameless unremembered acts   of kindness and of love nor less i trust   to them i may have owed another gift   of aspect more sublime that blessed mood   in which the burthen of the mystery   in which the heavy and the weary weight   of all this unintelligible world   is lightendthat serene and blessed mood   in which the affections gently lead us on   until the breath of this corporeal frame   and even the motion of our human blood   almost suspended we are laid asleep   in body and become a living soul   while with an eye made quiet by the power   of harmony and the deep power of joy   we see into the life of things                                    if this   be but a vain belief yet oh how oft   in darkness and amid the many shapes   of joyless daylight when the fretful stir   unprofitable and the fever of the world   have hung upon the beatings of my heart   how oft in spirit have i turned to thee   o sylvan wye thou wanderer through the woods   how often has my spirit turned to thee    and now with gleams of halfextinguishd thought   with many recognitions dim and faint   and somewhat of a sad perplexity   the picture of the mind revives again   while here i stand not only with the sense   of present pleasure but with pleasing thoughts   that in this moment there is life and food   for future years and so i dare to hope   though changed no doubt from what i was when first   i came among these hills when like a roe   i bounded oer the mountains by the sides   of the deep rivers and the lonely streams   wherever nature led more like a man   flying from something that he dreads than one   who sought the thing he loved for nature then   the coarser pleasures of my boyish days   and their glad animal movements all gone by   to me was all in alli cannot paint   what then i was the sounding cataract   haunted me like a passion the tall rock   the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood   their colours and their forms were then to me   an appetite a feeling and a love   that had no need of a remoter charm   by thought supplied or any interest   unborrowed from the eyethat time is past   and all its aching joys are now no more   and all its dizzy raptures not for this   faint i nor mourn nor murmur other gifts   have followed for such loss i would believe   abundant recompence for i have learned   to look on nature not as in the hour   of thoughtless youth but hearing oftentimes   the still sad music of humanity   nor harsh nor grating though of ample power   to chasten and subdue and i have felt   a presence that disturbs me with the joy   of elevated thoughts a sense sublime   of something far more deeply interfused   whose dwelling is the light of setting suns   and the round ocean and the living air   and the blue sky and in the mind of man   a motion and a spirit that impels   all thinking things all objects of all thought   and rolls through all things therefore am i still   a lover of the meadows and the woods   and mountains and of all that we behold   from this green earth of all the mighty world   of eye and ear both what they half create 7   and what perceive well pleased to recognize   in nature and the language of the sense   the anchor of my purest thoughts the nurse   the guide the guardian of my heart and soul   of all my moral being  footnote 7 this line has a close resemblance to an admirable line of young the exact expression of which i cannot recollect                           nor perchance   if i were not thus taught should i the more   suffer my genial spirits to decay   for thou art with me here upon the banks   of this fair river thou my dearest friend   my dear dear friend and in thy voice i catch   the language of my former heart and read   my former pleasures in the shooting lights   of thy wild eyes oh yet a little while   may i behold in thee what i was once   my dear dear sister and this prayer i make   knowing that nature never did betray   the heart that loved her tis her privilege   through all the years of this our life to lead   from joy to joy for she can so inform   the mind that is within us so impress   with quietness and beauty and so feed   with lofty thoughts that neither evil tongues   rash judgments nor the sneers of selfish men   nor greetings where no kindness is nor all   the dreary intercourse of daily life   shall eer prevail against us or disturb   our chearful faith that all which we behold   is full of blessings therefore let the moon   shine on thee in thy solitary walk   and let the misty mountain winds be free   to blow against thee and in after years   when these wild ecstasies shall be matured   into a sober pleasure when thy mind   shall be a mansion for all lovely forms   thy memory be as a dwellingplace   for all sweet sounds and harmonies oh then   if solitude or fear or pain or grief   should be thy portion with what healing thoughts   of tender joy wilt thou remember me   and these my exhortations nor perchance   if i should be where i no more can hear   thy voice nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams   of past existence wilt thou then forget   that on the banks of this delightful stream   we stood together and that i so long   a worshipper of nature hither came   unwearied in that service rather say   with warmer love oh with far deeper zeal   of holier love nor wilt thou then forget   that after many wanderings many years   of absence these steep woods and lofty cliffs   and this green pastoral landscape were to me   more dear both for themselves and for thy sake        notes  note to the thornthis poem ought to have been preceded by an introductory poem which i have been prevented from writing by never having felt myself in a mood when it was probable that i should write it wellthe character which i have here introduced speaking is sufficiently common the reader will perhaps have a general notion of it if he has ever known a man a captain of a small trading vessel for example who being past the middle age of life had retired upon an annuity or small independent income to some village or country town of which he was not a native or in which he had not been accustomed to live such men having little to do become credulous and talkative from indolence and from the same cause and other predisposing causes by which it is probable that such men may have been affected they are prone to superstition on which account it appeared to me proper to select a character like this to exhibit some of the general laws by which superstition acts upon the mind superstitious men are almost always men of slow faculties and deep feelings their minds are not loose but adhesive they have a reasonable share of imagination by which word i mean the faculty which produces impressive effects out of simple elements but they are utterly destitute of fancy the power by which pleasure and surprize are excited by sudden varieties of situation and by accumulated imagery  it was my wish in this poem to shew the manner in which such men cleave to the same ideas and to follow the turns of passion always different yet not palpably different by which their conversation is swayed i had two objects to attain first to represent a picture which should not be unimpressive yet consistent with the character that should describe it secondly while i adhered to the style in which such persons describe to take care that words which in their minds are impregnated with passion should likewise convey passion to readers who are not accustomed to sympathize with men feeling in that manner or using such language it seemed to me that this might be done by calling in the assistance of lyrical and rapid metre it was necessary that the poem to be natural should in reality move slowly yet i hoped that by the aid of the metre to those who should at all enter into the spirit of the poem it would appear to move quickly the reader will have the kindness to excuse this note as i am sensible that an introductory poem is necessary to give this poem its full effect  upon this occasion i will request permission to add a few words closely connected with the thorn and many other poems in these volumes there is a numerous class of readers who imagine that the same words cannot be repeated without tautology this is a great error virtual tautology is much oftener produced by using different words when the meaning is exactly the same words a poets words more particularly ought to be weighed in the balance of feeling and not measured by the space which they occupy upon paper for the reader cannot be too often reminded that poetry is passion it is the history or science of feelings now every man must know that an attempt is rarely made to communicate impassioned feelings without something of an accompanying consciousness of the inadequateness of our own powers or the deficiencies of language during such efforts there will be a craving in the mind and as long as it is unsatisfied the speaker will cling to the same words or words of the same character there are also various other reasons why repetition and apparent tautology are frequently beauties of the highest kind among the chief of these reasons is the interest which the mind attaches to words not only as symbols of the passion but as things active and efficient which are of themselves part of the passion and further from a spirit of fondness exultation and gratitude the mind luxuriates in the repetition of words which appear successfully to communicate its feelings the truth of these remarks might be shewn by innumerable passages from the bible and from the impassioned poetry of every nation     awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song    arise barak and lead thy captivity captive thou son of abinoam    at her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet be bowed   he fell where he bowed there he fell down dead    why is his chariot so long in coming why tarry the wheels of his   chariotjudges chap 5th verses 12th 27th and part of 28th       see also the whole of that tumultuous and wonderful poem  note to the ancient mariner p 155i cannot refuse myself the gratification of informing such readers as may have been pleased with this poem or with any part of it that they owe their pleasure in some sort to me as the author was himself very desirous that it should be suppressed this wish had arisen from a consciousness of the defects of the poem and from a knowledge that many persons had been much displeased with it the poem of my friend has indeed great defects first that the principal person has no distinct character either in his profession of mariner or as a human being who having been long under the controul of supernatural impressions might be supposed himself to partake of something supernatural secondly that he does not act but is continually acted upon thirdly that the events having no necessary connection do not produce each other and lastly that the imagery is somewhat too laboriously accumulated yet the poem contains many delicate touches of passion and indeed the passion is every where true to nature a great number of the stanzas present beautiful images and are expressed with unusual felicity of language and the versification though the metre is itself unfit for long poems is harmonious and artfully varied exhibiting the utmost powers of that metre and every variety of which it is capable it therefore appeared to me that these several merits the first of which namely that of the passion is of the highest kind gave to the poem a value which is not often possessed by better poems on this account i requested of my friend to permit me to republish it  note to the poem on revisiting the wye p 201i have not ventured to call this poem an ode but it was written with a hope that in the transitions and the impassioned music of the versification would be found the principal requisites of that species of composition  end of vol i
