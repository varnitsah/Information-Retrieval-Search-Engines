treasure    to him who waits    he also serves    the moment of victory    the headhunter    no story    the higher pragmatism    bestseller    rus in urbe    a poor rule      the rose of dixie   when the rose of dixie magazine was started by a stock company in toombs city georgia there was never but one candidate for its chief editorial position in the minds of its owners col aquila telfair was the man for the place by all the rights of learning family reputation and southern traditions he was its foreordained fit and logical editor so a committee of the patriotic georgia citizens who had subscribed the founding fund of 100000 called upon colonel telfair at his residence cedar heights fearful lest the enterprise and the south should suffer by his possible refusal  the colonel received them in his great library where he spent most of his days the library had descended to him from his father it contained ten thousand volumes some of which had been published as late as the year 1861 when the deputation arrived colonel telfair was seated at his massive whitepine centretable reading burtons anatomy of melancholy he arose and shook hands punctiliously with each member of the committee if you were familiar with the rose of dixie you will remember the colonels portrait which appeared in it from time to time you could not forget the long carefully brushed white hair the hooked highbridged nose slightly twisted to the left the keen eyes under the still black eyebrows the classic mouth beneath the drooping white mustache slightly frazzled at the ends  the committee solicitously offered him the position of managing editor humbly presenting an outline of the field that the publication was designed to cover and mentioning a comfortable salary the colonels lands were growing poorer each year and were much cut up by red gullies besides the honor was not one to be refused  in a fortyminute speech of acceptance colonel telfair gave an outline of english literature from chaucer to macaulay refought the battle of chancellorsville and said that god helping him he would so conduct the rose of dixie that its fragrance and beauty would permeate the entire world hurling back into the teeth of the northern minions their belief that no genius or good could exist in the brains and hearts of the people whose property they had destroyed and whose rights they had curtailed  offices for the magazine were partitioned off and furnished in the second floor of the first national bank building and it was for the colonel to cause the rose of dixie to blossom and flourish or to wilt in the balmy air of the land of flowers  the staff of assistants and contributors that editorcolonel telfair drew about him was a peach it was a whole crate of georgia peaches the first assistant editor tolliver lee fairfax had had a father killed during picketts charge the second assistant keats unthank was the nephew of one of morgans raiders the book reviewer jackson rockingham had been the youngest soldier in the confederate army having appeared on the field of battle with a sword in one hand and a milkbottle in the other the art editor roncesvalles sykes was a third cousin to a nephew of jefferson davis miss lavinia terhune the colonels stenographer and typewriter had an aunt who had once been kissed by stonewall jackson tommy webster the head officeboy got his job by having recited father ryans poems complete at the commencement exercises of the toombs city high school the girls who wrapped and addressed the magazines were members of old southern families in reduced circumstances the cashier was a scrub named hawkins from ann arbor michigan who had recommendations and a bond from a guarantee company filed with the owners even georgia stock companies sometimes realize that it takes live ones to bury the dead  well sir if you believe me the rose of dixie blossomed five times before anybody heard of it except the people who buy their hooks and eyes in toombs city then hawkins climbed off his stool and told on em to the stock company even in ann arbor he had been used to having his business propositions heard of at least as far away as detroit so an advertising manager was engagedbeauregard fitzhugh banks a young man in a lavender necktie whose grandfather had been the exalted high pillowslip of the kuklux klan  in spite of which the rose of dixie kept coming out every month although in every issue it ran photos of either the taj mahal or the luxembourg gardens or carmencita or la follette a certain number of people bought it and subscribed for it as a boom for it editorcolonel telfair ran three different views of andrew jacksons old home the hermitage a fullpage engraving of the second battle of manassas entitled lee to the rear and a fivethousandword biography of belle boyd in the same number the subscription list that month advanced 118 also there were poems in the same issue by leonina vashti haricot penname related to the haricots of charleston south carolina and bill thompson nephew of one of the stockholders and an article from a special society correspondent describing a teaparty given by the swell boston and english set where a lot of tea was spilled overboard by some of the guests masquerading as indians  one day a person whose breath would easily cloud a mirror he was so much alive entered the office of the rose of dixie he was a man about the size of a realestate agent with a selftied tie and a manner that he must have borrowed conjointly from w j bryan hackenschmidt and hetty green he was shown into the editorcolonels pons asinorum colonel telfair rose and began a prince albert bow  im thacker said the intruder taking the editors chairt t thacker of new york  he dribbled hastily upon the colonels desk some cards a bulky manila envelope and a letter from the owners of the rose of dixie this letter introduced mr thacker and politely requested colonel telfair to give him a conference and whatever information about the magazine he might desire  ive been corresponding with the secretary of the magazine owners for some time said thacker briskly im a practical magazine man myself and a circulation booster as good as any if i do say it ill guarantee an increase of anywhere from ten thousand to a hundred thousand a year for any publication that isnt printed in a dead language ive had my eye on the rose of dixie ever since it started i know every end of the business from editing to setting up the classified ads now ive come down here to put a good bunch of money in the magazine if i can see my way clear it ought to be made to pay the secretary tells me its losing money i dont see why a magazine in the south if its properly handled shouldnt get a good circulation in the north too  colonel telfair leaned back in his chair and polished his goldrimmed glasses  mr thacker said he courteously but firmly the rose of dixie is a publication devoted to the fostering and the voicing of southern genius its watchword which you may have seen on the cover is of for and by the south  but you wouldnt object to a northern circulation would you asked thacker  i suppose said the editorcolonel that it is customary to open the circulation lists to all i do not know i have nothing to do with the business affairs of the magazine i was called upon to assume editorial control of it and i have devoted to its conduct such poor literary talents as i may possess and whatever store of erudition i may have acquired  sure said thacker but a dollar is a dollar anywhere north south or westwhether youre buying codfish goober peas or rocky ford cantaloupes now ive been looking over your november number i see one here on your desk you dont mind running over it with me  well your leading article is all right a good writeup of the cottonbelt with plenty of photographs is a winner any time new york is always interested in the cotton crop and this sensational account of the hatfieldmccoy feud by a schoolmate of a niece of the governor of kentucky isnt such a bad idea it happened so long ago that most people have forgotten it now heres a poem three pages long called the tyrants foot by lorella lascelles ive pawed around a good deal over manuscripts but i never saw her name on a rejection slip  miss lascelles said the editor is one of our most widely recognized southern poetesses she is closely related to the alabama lascelles family and made with her own hands the silken confederate banner that was presented to the governor of that state at his inauguration  but why persisted thacker is the poem illustrated with a view of the m  o railroad freight depot at tuscaloosa  the illustration said the colonel with dignity shows a corner of the fence surrounding the old homestead where miss lascelles was born  all right said thacker i read the poem but i couldnt tell whether it was about the depot of the battle of bull run now heres a short story called rosies temptation by fosdyke piggott its rotten what is a piggott anyway  mr piggott said the editor is a brother of the principal stockholder of the magazine  alls right with the worldpiggott passes said thacker well this article on arctic exploration and the one on tarpon fishing might go but how about this writeup of the atlanta new orleans nashville and savannah breweries it seems to consist mainly of statistics about their output and the quality of their beer whats the chip over the bug  if i understand your figurative language answered colonel telfair it is this the article you refer to was handed to me by the owners of the magazine with instructions to publish it the literary quality of it did not appeal to me but in a measure i feel impelled to conform in certain matters to the wishes of the gentlemen who are interested in the financial side of the rose  i see said thacker next we have two pages of selections from lalla rookh by thomas moore now what federal prison did moore escape from or whats the name of the ffv family that he carries as a handicap  moore was an irish poet who died in 1852 said colonel telfair pityingly he is a classic i have been thinking of reprinting his translation of anacreon serially in the magazine  look out for the copyright laws said thacker flippantly whos bessie belleclair who contributes the essay on the newly completed waterworks plant in milledgeville  the name sir said colonel telfair is the nom de guerre of miss elvira simpkins i have not the honor of knowing the lady but her contribution was sent to us by congressman brower of her native state congressman browers mother was related to the polks of tennessee  now see here colonel said thacker throwing down the magazine this wont do you cant successfully run a magazine for one particular section of the country youve got to make a universal appeal look how the northern publications have catered to the south and encouraged the southern writers and youve got to go far and wide for your contributors youve got to buy stuff according to its quality without any regard to the pedigree of the author now ill bet a quart of ink that this southern parlor organ youve been running has never played a note that originated above mason  hamlins line am i right  i have carefully and conscientiously rejected all contributions from that section of the countryif i understand your figurative language aright replied the colonel  all right now ill show you something  thacker reached for his thick manila envelope and dumped a mass of typewritten manuscript on the editors desk  heres some truck said he that i paid cash for and brought along with me  one by one he folded back the manuscripts and showed their first pages to the colonel  here are four short stories by four of the highest priced authors in the united statesthree of em living in new york and one commuting theres a special article on viennabred society by tom vampson heres an italian serial by captain jacknoits the other crawford here are three separate exposés of city governments by sniffings and heres a dandy entitled what women carry in dresssuit casesa chicago newspaper woman hired herself out for five years as a ladys maid to get that information and heres a synopsis of preceding chapters of hall caines new serial to appear next june and heres a couple of pounds of vers de société that i got at a rate from the clever magazines thats the stuff that people everywhere want and now heres a writeup with photographs at the ages of four twelve twentytwo and thirty of george b mcclellan its a prognostication hes bound to be elected mayor of new york itll make a big hit all over the country he  i beg your pardon said colonel telfair stiffening in his chair what was the name  oh i see said thacker with half a grin yes hes a son of the general well pass that manuscript up but if youll excuse me colonel its a magazine were trying to make go offnot the first gun at fort sumter now heres a thing thats bound to get next to you its an original poem by james whitcomb riley j w himself you know what that means to a magazine i wont tell you what i had to pay for that poem but ill tell you thisriley can make more money writing with a fountainpen than you or i can with one that lets the ink run ill read you the last two stanzas     pa lays around n loafs all day       n reads and makes us leave him be    he lets me do just like i please       n when im bad he laughs at me    n when i holler loud n say       bad words n then begin to tease    the cat n pa just smiles mas mad       n gives me jesse crost her knees          i always wondered why that wuz          i guess its cause             pa never does     n after all the lights are out       im sorry bout it so i creep    out of my trundle bed to mas       n say i love her a whole heap    n kiss her n i hug her tight       n its too dark to see her eyes    but every time i do i know       she cries n cries n cries n cries          i always wondered why that wuz          i guess its cause             pa never does  thats the stuff continued thacker what do you think of that  i am not unfamiliar with the works of mr riley said the colonel deliberately i believe he lives in indiana for the last ten years i have been somewhat of a literary recluse and am familiar with nearly all the books in the cedar heights library i am also of the opinion that a magazine should contain a certain amount of poetry many of the sweetest singers of the south have already contributed to the pages of the rose of dixie i myself have thought of translating from the original for publication in its pages the works of the great italian poet tasso have you ever drunk from the fountain of this immortal poets lines mr thacker  not even a demitasso said thacker now lets come to the point colonel telfair ive already invested some money in this as a flyer that bunch of manuscripts cost me 4000 my object was to try a number of them in the next issuei believe you make up less than a month aheadand see what effect it has on the circulation i believe that by printing the best stuff we can get in the north south east or west we can make the magazine go you have there the letter from the owning company asking you to cooperate with me in the plan lets chuck out some of this slush that youve been publishing just because the writers are related to the skoopdoodles of skoopdoodle county are you with me  as long as i continue to be the editor of the rose said colonel telfair with dignity i shall be its editor but i desire also to conform to the wishes of its owners if i can do so conscientiously  thats the talk said thacker briskly now how much of this stuff ive brought can we get into the january number we want to begin right away  there is yet space in the january number said the editor for about eight thousand words roughly estimated  great said thacker it isnt much but itll give the readers some change from goobers governors and gettysburg ill leave the selection of the stuff i brought to fill the space to you as its all good ive got to run back to new york and ill be down again in a couple of weeks  colonel telfair slowly swung his eyeglasses by their broad black ribbon  the space in the january number that i referred to said he measuredly has been held open purposely pending a decision that i have not yet made a short time ago a contribution was submitted to the rose of dixie that is one of the most remarkable literary efforts that has ever come under my observation none but a master mind and talent could have produced it it would just fill the space that i have reserved for its possible use  thacker looked anxious  what kind of stuff is it he asked eight thousand words sounds suspicious the oldest families must have been collaborating is there going to be another secession  the author of the article continued the colonel ignoring thackers allusions is a writer of some reputation he has also distinguished himself in other ways i do not feel at liberty to reveal to you his nameat least not until i have decided whether or not to accept his contribution  well said thacker nervously is it a continued story or an account of the unveiling of the new town pump in whitmire south carolina or a revised list of general lees bodyservants or what  you are disposed to be facetious said colonel telfair calmly the article is from the pen of a thinker a philosopher a lover of mankind a student and a rhetorician of high degree  it must have been written by a syndicate said thacker but honestly colonel you want to go slow i dont know of any eightthousandword single doses of written matter that are read by anybody these days except supreme court briefs and reports of murder trials you havent by any accident gotten hold of a copy of one of daniel websters speeches have you  colonel telfair swung a little in his chair and looked steadily from under his bushy eyebrows at the magazine promoter  mr thacker he said gravely i am willing to segregate the somewhat crude expression of your sense of humor from the solicitude that your business investments undoubtedly have conferred upon you but i must ask you to cease your jibes and derogatory comments upon the south and the southern people they sir will not be tolerated in the office of the rose of dixie for one moment and before you proceed with more of your covert insinuations that i the editor of this magazine am not a competent judge of the merits of the matter submitted to its consideration i beg that you will first present some evidence or proof that you are my superior in any way shape or form relative to the question in hand  oh come colonel said thacker goodnaturedly i didnt do anything like that to you it sounds like an indictment by the fourth assistant attorneygeneral lets get back to business whats this 8000 to 1 shot about  the article said colonel telfair acknowledging the apology by a slight bow covers a wide area of knowledge it takes up theories and questions that have puzzled the world for centuries and disposes of them logically and concisely one by one it holds up to view the evils of the world points out the way of eradicating them and then conscientiously and in detail commends the good there is hardly a phase of human life that it does not discuss wisely calmly and equitably the great policies of governments the duties of private citizens the obligations of home life law ethics moralityall these important subjects are handled with a calm wisdom and confidence that i must confess has captured my admiration  it must be a crackerjack said thacker impressed  it is a great contribution to the worlds wisdom said the colonel the only doubt remaining in my mind as to the tremendous advantage it would be to us to give it publication in the rose of dixie is that i have not yet sufficient information about the author to give his work publicity in our magazine  i thought you said he is a distinguished man said thacker  he is replied the colonel both in literary and in other more diversified and extraneous fields but i am extremely careful about the matter that i accept for publication my contributors are people of unquestionable repute and connections which fact can be verified at any time as i said i am holding this article until i can acquire more information about its author i do not know whether i will publish it or not if i decide against it i shall be much pleased mr thacker to substitute the matter that you are leaving with me in its place  thacker was somewhat at sea  i dont seem to gather said he much about the gist of this inspired piece of literature it sounds more like a dark horse than pegasus to me  it is a human document said the coloneleditor confidently from a man of great accomplishments who in my opinion has obtained a stronger grasp on the world and its outcomes than that of any man living today  thacker rose to his feet excitedly  say he said it isnt possible that youve cornered john d rockefellers memoirs is it dont tell me that all at once  no sir said colonel telfair i am speaking of mentality and literature not of the less worthy intricacies of trade  well whats the trouble about running the article asked thacker a little impatiently if the mans well known and has got the stuff  colonel telfair sighed  mr thacker said he for once i have been tempted nothing has yet appeared in the rose of dixie that has not been from the pen of one of its sons or daughters i know little about the author of this article except that he has acquired prominence in a section of the country that has always been inimical to my heart and mind but i recognize his genius and as i have told you i have instituted an investigation of his personality perhaps it will be futile but i shall pursue the inquiry until that is finished i must leave open the question of filling the vacant space in our january number  thacker arose to leave  all right colonel he said as cordially as he could you use your own judgment if youve really got a scoop or something that will make em sit up run it instead of my stuff ill drop in again in about two weeks good luck  colonel telfair and the magazine promoter shook hands  returning a fortnight later thacker dropped off a very rocky pullman at toombs city he found the january number of the magazine made up and the forms closed  the vacant space that had been yawning for type was filled by an article that was headed thus                       second message to congress                              written for                           the rose of dixie                                   by                      a member of the wellknown                      bulloch family of georgia                              t roosevelt       the third ingredient   the socalled vallambrosa apartmenthouse is not an apartmenthouse it is composed of two oldfashioned brownstonefront residences welded into one the parlor floor of one side is gay with the wraps and headgear of a modiste the other is lugubrious with the sophistical promises and grisly display of a painless dentist you may have a room there for two dollars a week or you may have one for twenty dollars among the vallambrosas roomers are stenographers musicians brokers shopgirls spacerate writers art students wiretappers and other people who lean far over the banisterrail when the doorbell rings  this treatise shall have to do with but two of the vallambrosians though meaning no disrespect to the others  at six oclock one afternoon hetty pepper came back to her thirdfloor rear 350 room in the vallambrosa with her nose and chin more sharply pointed than usual to be discharged from the department store where you have been working four years and with only fifteen cents in your purse does have a tendency to make your features appear more finely chiselled  and now for hettys thumbnail biography while she climbs the two flights of stairs  she walked into the biggest store one morning four years before with seventyfive other girls applying for a job behind the waist department counter the phalanx of wageearners formed a bewildering scene of beauty carrying a total mass of blond hair sufficient to have justified the horseback gallops of a hundred lady godivas  the capable cooleyed impersonal young baldheaded man whose task it was to engage six of the contestants was aware of a feeling of suffocation as if he were drowning in a sea of frangipanni while white clouds handembroidered floated about him and then a sail hove in sight hetty pepper homely of countenance with small contemptuous green eyes and chocolatecolored hair dressed in a suit of plain burlap and a commonsense hat stood before him with every one of her twentynine years of life unmistakably in sight  youre on shouted the baldheaded young man and was saved and that is how hetty came to be employed in the biggest store the story of her rise to an eightdollaraweek salary is the combined stories of hercules joan of arc una job and littleredridinghood you shall not learn from me the salary that was paid her as a beginner there is a sentiment growing about such things and i want no millionaire storeproprietors climbing the fireescape of my tenementhouse to throw dynamite bombs into my skylight boudoir  the story of hettys discharge from the biggest store is so nearly a repetition of her engagement as to be monotonous  in each department of the store there is an omniscient omnipresent and omnivorous person carrying always a mileage book and a red necktie and referred to as a buyer the destinies of the girls in his department who live on see bureau of victual statisticsso much per week are in his hands  this particular buyer was a capable cooleyed impersonal young baldheaded man as he walked along the aisles of his department he seemed to be sailing on a sea of frangipanni while white clouds machineembroidered floated around him too many sweets bring surfeit he looked upon hetty peppers homely countenance emerald eyes and chocolatecolored hair as a welcome oasis of green in a desert of cloying beauty in a quiet angle of a counter he pinched her arm kindly three inches above the elbow she slapped him three feet away with one good blow of her muscular and not especially lilywhite right so now you know why hetty pepper came to leave the biggest store at thirty minutes notice with one dime and a nickel in her purse  this mornings quotations list the price of rib beef at six cents per butchers pound but on the day that hetty was released by the b s the price was seven and onehalf cents that fact is what makes this story possible otherwise the extra four cents would have  but the plot of nearly all the good stories in the world is concerned with shorts who were unable to cover so you can find no fault with this one  hetty mounted with her rib beef to her 350 thirdfloor back one hot savory beefstew for supper a nights good sleep and she would be fit in the morning to apply again for the tasks of hercules joan of arc una job and littleredridinghood  in her room she got the graniteware stewpan out of the 2x4foot chinaeri mean earthenware closet and began to dig down in a ratsnest of paper bags for the potatoes and onions she came out with her nose and chin just a little sharper pointed  there was neither a potato nor an onion now what kind of a beefstew can you make out of simply beef you can make oystersoup without oysters turtlesoup without turtles coffeecake without coffee but you cant make beefstew without potatoes and onions  but rib beef alone in an emergency can make an ordinary pine door look like a wroughtiron gamblinghouse portal to the wolf with salt and pepper and a tablespoonful of flour first well stirred in a little cold water twill servetis not so deep as a lobster à la newburg nor so wide as a church festival doughnut but twill serve  hetty took her stewpan to the rear of the thirdfloor hall according to the advertisements of the vallambrosa there was running water to be found there between you and me and the watermeter it only ambled or walked through the faucets but technicalities have no place here there was also a sink where housekeeping roomers often met to dump their coffee grounds and glare at one anothers kimonos  at this sink hetty found a girl with heavy goldbrown artistic hair and plaintive eyes washing two large irish potatoes hetty knew the vallambrosa as well as any one not owning double hextramagnifying eyes could compass its mysteries the kimonos were her encyclopedia her whos what her clearinghouse of news of goers and comers from a rosepink kimono edged with nile green she had learned that the girl with the potatoes was a miniaturepainter living in a kind of atticor studio as they prefer to call iton the top floor hetty was not certain in her mind what a miniature was but it certainly wasnt a house because housepainters although they wear splashy overalls and poke ladders in your face on the street are known to indulge in a riotous profusion of food at home  the potato girl was quite slim and small and handled her potatoes as an old bachelor uncle handles a baby who is cutting teeth she had a dull shoemakers knife in her right hand and she had begun to peel one of the potatoes with it  hetty addressed her in the punctiliously formal tone of one who intends to be cheerfully familiar with you in the second round  beg pardon she said for butting into whats not my business but if you peel them potatoes you lose out theyre new bermudas you want to scrape em lemme show you  she took a potato and the knife and began to demonstrate  oh thank you breathed the artist i didnt know and i did hate to see the thick peeling go it seemed such a waste but i thought they always had to be peeled when youve got only potatoes to eat the peelings count you know  say kid said hetty staying her knife you aint up against it too are you  the miniature artist smiled starvedly  i suppose i am artor at least the way i interpret itdoesnt seem to be much in demand i have only these potatoes for my dinner but they arent so bad boiled and hot with a little butter and salt  child said hetty letting a brief smile soften her rigid features fate has sent me and you together ive had it handed to me in the neck too but ive got a chunk of meat in my room as big as a lapdog and ive done everything to get potatoes except pray for em lets me and you bunch our commissary departments and make a stew of em well cook it in my room if we only had an onion to go in it say kid you havent got a couple of pennies thatve slipped down into the lining of your last winters sealskin have you i could step down to the corner and get one at old giuseppes stand a stew without an onion is worsen a matinée without candy  you may call me cecilia said the artist no i spent my last penny three days ago  then well have to cut the onion out instead of slicing it in said hetty id ask the janitress for one but i dont want em hep just yet to the fact that im pounding the asphalt for another job but i wish we did have an onion  in the shopgirls room the two began to prepare their supper cecilias part was to sit on the couch helplessly and beg to be allowed to do something in the voice of a cooing ringdove hetty prepared the rib beef putting it in cold salted water in the stewpan and setting it on the oneburner gasstove  i wish we had an onion said hetty as she scraped the two potatoes  on the wall opposite the couch was pinned a flaming gorgeous advertising picture of one of the new ferryboats of the p u f f railroad that had been built to cut down the time between los angeles and new york city oneeighth of a minute  hetty turning her head during her continuous monologue saw tears running from her guests eyes as she gazed on the idealized presentment of the speeding foamgirdled transport  why say cecilia kid said hetty poising her knife is it as bad art as that i aint a critic but i thought it kind of brightened up the room of course a manicurepainter could tell it was a bum picture in a minute ill take it down if you say so i wish to the holy saint potluck we had an onion  but the miniature miniaturepainter had tumbled down sobbing with her nose indenting the hardwoven drapery of the couch something was here deeper than the artistic temperament offended at crude lithography  hetty knew she had accepted her rôle long ago how scant the words with which we try to describe a single quality of a human being when we reach the abstract we are lost the nearer to nature that the babbling of our lips comes the better do we understand figuratively let us say some people are bosoms some are hands some are heads some are muscles some are feet some are backs for burdens  hetty was a shoulder hers was a sharp sinewy shoulder but all her life people had laid their heads upon it metaphorically or actually and had left there all or half their troubles looking at life anatomically which is as good a way as any she was preordained to be a shoulder there were few truer collarbones anywhere than hers  hetty was only thirtythree and she had not yet outlived the little pang that visited her whenever the head of youth and beauty leaned upon her for consolation but one glance in her mirror always served as an instantaneous painkiller so she gave one pale look into the crinkly old lookingglass on the wall above the gasstove turned down the flame a little lower from the bubbling beef and potatoes went over to the couch and lifted cecilias head to its confessional  go on and tell me honey she said i know now that it aint art thats worrying you you met him on a ferryboat didnt you go on cecilia kid and tell youryour aunt hetty about it  but youth and melancholy must first spend the surplus of sighs and tears that waft and float the barque of romance to its harbor in the delectable isles presently through the stringy tendons that formed the bars of the confessional the penitentor was it the glorified communicant of the sacred flametold her story without art or illumination  it was only three days ago i was coming back on the ferry from jersey city old mr schrum an art dealer told me of a rich man in newark who wanted a miniature of his daughter painted i went to see him and showed him some of my work when i told him the price would be fifty dollars he laughed at me like a hyena he said an enlarged crayon twenty times the size would cost him only eight dollars  i had just enough money to buy my ferry ticket back to new york i felt as if i didnt want to live another day i must have looked as i felt for i saw him on the row of seats opposite me looking at me as if he understood he was nicelooking but oh above everything else he looked kind when one is tired or unhappy or hopeless kindness counts more than anything else  when i got so miserable that i couldnt fight against it any longer i got up and walked slowly out the rear door of the ferryboat cabin no one was there and i slipped quickly over the rail and dropped into the water oh friend hetty it was cold cold  for just one moment i wished i was back in the old vallambrosa starving and hoping and then i got numb and didnt care and then i felt that somebody else was in the water close by me holding me up he had followed me and jumped in to save me  somebody threw a thing like a big white doughnut at us and he made me put my arms through the hole then the ferryboat backed and they pulled us on board oh hetty i was so ashamed of my wickedness in trying to drown myself and besides my hair had all tumbled down and was sopping wet and i was such a sight  and then some men in blue clothes came around and he gave them his card and i heard him tell them he had seen me drop my purse on the edge of the boat outside the rail and in leaning over to get it i had fallen overboard and then i remembered having read in the papers that people who try to kill themselves are locked up in cells with people who try to kill other people and i was afraid  but some ladies on the boat took me downstairs to the furnaceroom and got me nearly dry and did up my hair when the boat landed he came and put me in a cab he was all dripping himself but laughed as if he thought it was all a joke he begged me but i wouldnt tell him my name nor where i lived i was so ashamed  you were a fool child said hetty kindly wait till i turn the light up a bit i wish to heaven we had an onion  then he raised his hat went on cecilia and said very well but ill find you anyhow im going to claim my rights of salvage then he gave money to the cabdriver and told him to take me where i wanted to go and walked away what is salvage hetty  the edge of a piece of goods that aint hemmed said the shopgirl you must have looked pretty well frazzled out to the little hero boy  its been three days moaned the miniaturepainter and he hasnt found me yet  extend the time said hetty this is a big town think of how many girls he might have to see soaked in water with their hair down before he would recognize you the stews getting on finebut oh for an onion id even use a piece of garlic if i had it  the beef and potatoes bubbled merrily exhaling a mouthwatering savor that yet lacked something leaving a hunger on the palate a haunting wistful desire for some lost and needful ingredient  i came near drowning in that awful river said cecilia shuddering  it ought to have more water in it said hetty the stew i mean ill go get some at the sink  it smells good said the artist  that nasty old north river objected hetty it smells to me like soap factories and wet setterdogsoh you mean the stew well i wish we had an onion for it did he look like he had money  first he looked kind said cecilia im sure he was rich but that matters so little when he drew out his billfolder to pay the cabman you couldnt help seeing hundreds and thousands of dollars in it and i looked over the cab doors and saw him leave the ferry station in a motorcar and the chauffeur gave him his bearskin to put on for he was sopping wet and it was only three days ago  what a fool said hetty shortly  oh the chauffeur wasnt wet breathed cecilia and he drove the car away very nicely  i mean you said hetty for not giving him your address  i never give my address to chauffeurs said cecilia haughtily  i wish we had one said hetty disconsolately  what for  for the stew of courseoh i mean an onion  hetty took a pitcher and started to the sink at the end of the hall  a young man came down the stairs from above just as she was opposite the lower step he was decently dressed but pale and haggard his eyes were dull with the stress of some burden of physical or mental woe in his hand he bore an oniona pink smooth solid shining onion as large around as a ninetyeightcent alarmclock  hetty stopped so did the young man there was something joan of arcish herculean and unaish in the look and pose of the shopladyshe had cast off the rôles of job and littleredridinghood the young man stopped at the foot of the stairs and coughed distractedly he felt marooned held up attacked assailed levied upon sacked assessed panhandled browbeaten though he knew not why it was the look in hettys eyes that did it in them he saw the jolly roger fly to the masthead and an able seaman with a dirk between his teeth scurry up the ratlines and nail it there but as yet he did not know that the cargo he carried was the thing that had caused him to be so nearly blown out of the water without even a parley  beg your pardon said hetty as sweetly as her dilute acetic acid tones permitted but did you find that onion on the stairs there was a hole in the paper bag and ive just come out to look for it  the young man coughed for half a minute the interval may have given him the courage to defend his own property also he clutched his pungent prize greedily and with a show of spirit faced his grim waylayer  no he said huskily i didnt find it on the stairs it was given to me by jack bevens on the top floor if you dont believe it ask him ill wait until you do  i know about bevens said hetty sourly he writes books and things up there for the paperandrags man we can hear the postman guy him all over the house when he brings them thick envelopes back saydo you live in the vallambrosa  i do not said the young man i come to see bevens sometimes hes my friend i live two blocks west  what are you going to do with the onionbegging your pardon said hetty  im going to eat it  raw  yes as soon as i get home  havent you got anything else to eat with it  the young man considered briefly  no he confessed theres not another scrap of anything in my diggings to eat i think old jack is pretty hard up for grub in his shack too he hated to give up the onion but i worried him into parting with it  man said hetty fixing him with her worldsapient eyes and laying a bony but impressive finger on his sleeve youve known trouble too havent you  lots said the onion owner promptly but this onion is my own property honestly come by if you will excuse me i must be going  listen said hetty paling a little with anxiety raw onion is a mighty poor diet and so is a beefstew without one now if youre jack bevens friend i guess youre nearly right theres a little ladya friend of minein my room there at the end of the hall both of us are out of luck and we had just potatoes and meat between us theyre stewing now but it aint got any soul theres something lacking to it theres certain things in life that are naturally intended to fit and belong together one is pink cheesecloth and green roses and one is ham and eggs and one is irish and trouble and the other one is beef and potatoes with onions and still another one is people who are up against it and other people in the same fix  the young man went into a protracted paroxysm of coughing with one hand he hugged his onion to his bosom  no doubt no doubt said he at length but as i said i must be going because  hetty clutched his sleeve firmly  dont be a dago little brother dont eat raw onions chip it in toward the dinner and line yourself inside with the best stew you ever licked a spoon over must two ladies knock a young gentleman down and drag him inside for the honor of dining with em no harm shall befall you little brother loosen up and fall into line  the young mans pale face relaxed into a grin  believe ill go you he said brightening if my onion is good as a credential ill accept the invitation gladly  its good as that but better as seasoning said hetty you come and stand outside the door till i ask my lady friend if she has any objections and dont run away with that letter of recommendation before i come out  hetty went into her room and closed the door the young man waited outside  cecilia kid said the shopgirl oiling the sharp saw of her voice as well as she could theres an onion outside with a young man attached ive asked him in to dinner you aint going to kick are you  oh dear said cecilia sitting up and patting her artistic hair she cast a mournful glance at the ferryboat poster on the wall  nit said hetty it aint him youre up against real life now i believe you said your hero friend had money and automobiles this is a poor skeezicks thats got nothing to eat but an onion but hes easyspoken and not a freshy i imagine hes been a gentleman hes so low down now and we need the onion shall i bring him in ill guarantee his behavior  hetty dear sighed cecilia im so hungry what difference does it make whether hes a prince or a burglar i dont care bring him in if hes got anything to eat with him  hetty went back into the hall the onion man was gone her heart missed a beat and a gray look settled over her face except on her nose and cheekbones and then the tides of life flowed in again for she saw him leaning out of the front window at the other end of the hall she hurried there he was shouting to some one below the noise of the street overpowered the sound of her footsteps she looked down over his shoulder saw whom he was speaking to and heard his words he pulled himself in from the windowsill and saw her standing over him  hettys eyes bored into him like two steel gimlets  dont lie to me she said calmly what were you going to do with that onion  the young man suppressed a cough and faced her resolutely his manner was that of one who had been bearded sufficiently  i was going to eat it said he with emphatic slowness just as i told you before  and you have nothing else to eat at home  not a thing  what kind of work do you do  i am not working at anything just now  then why said hetty with her voice set on its sharpest edge do you lean out of windows and give orders to chauffeurs in green automobiles in the street below  the young man flushed and his dull eyes began to sparkle  because madam said he in accelerando tones i pay the chauffeurs wages and i own the automobileand also this onionthis onion madam  he flourished the onion within an inch of hettys nose the shoplady did not retreat a hairsbreadth  then why do you eat onions she said with biting contempt and nothing else  i never said i did retorted the young man heatedly i said i had nothing else to eat where i live i am not a delicatessen storekeeper  then why pursued hetty inflexibly were you going to eat a raw onion  my mother said the young man always made me eat one for a cold pardon my referring to a physical infirmity but you may have noticed that i have a very very severe cold i was going to eat the onion and go to bed i wonder why i am standing here and apologizing to you for it  how did you catch this cold went on hetty suspiciously  the young man seemed to have arrived at some extreme height of feeling there were two modes of descent open to hima burst of rage or a surrender to the ridiculous he chose wisely and the empty hall echoed his hoarse laughter  youre a dandy said he and i dont blame you for being careful i dont mind telling you i got wet i was on a north river ferry a few days ago when a girl jumped overboard of course i  hetty extended her hand interrupting his story  give me the onion she said  the young man set his jaw a trifle harder  give me the onion she repeated  he grinned and laid it in her hand  then hettys infrequent grim melancholy smile showed itself she took the young mans arm and pointed with her other hand to the door of her room  little brother she said go in there the little fool you fished out of the river is there waiting for you go on in ill give you three minutes before i come potatoes is in there waiting go on in onions  after he had tapped at the door and entered hetty began to peel and wash the onion at the sink she gave a gray look at the gray roofs outside and the smile on her face vanished by little jerks and twitches  but its us she said grimly to herself its us that furnished the beef     the hiding of black bill   a lank strong redfaced man with a wellington beak and small fiery eyes tempered by flaxen lashes sat on the station platform at los pinos swinging his legs to and fro at his side sat another man fat melancholy and seedy who seemed to be his friend they had the appearance of men to whom life had appeared as a reversible coatseamy on both sides  aint seen you in about four years ham said the seedy man which way you been travelling  texas said the redfaced man it was too cold in alaska for me and i found it warm in texas ill tell you about one hot spell i went through there  one morning i steps off the international at a watertank and lets it go on without me twas a ranch country and fuller of spitehouses than new york city only out there they build em twenty miles away so you cant smell what theyve got for dinner instead of running em up two inches from their neighbors windows  there wasnt any roads in sight so i footed it cross country the grass was shoetop deep and the mesquite timber looked just like a peach orchard it was so much like a gentlemans private estate that every minute you expected a kennelful of bulldogs to run out and bite you but i must have walked twenty miles before i came in sight of a ranchhouse it was a little one about as big as an elevatedrailroad station  there was a little man in a white shirt and brown overalls and a pink handkerchief around his neck rolling cigarettes under a tree in front of the door  greetings says i any refreshment welcome emoluments or even work for a comparative stranger  oh come in says he in a refined tone sit down on that stool please i didnt hear your horse coming  he isnt near enough yet says i i walked i dont want to be a burden but i wonder if you have three or four gallons of water handy  you do look pretty dusty says he but our bathing arrangements  its a drink i want says i never mind the dust thats on the outside  he gets me a dipper of water out of a red jar hanging up and then goes on  do you want work  for a time says i this is a rather quiet section of the country isnt it  it is says he sometimesso i have been toldone sees no human being pass for weeks at a time ive been here only a month i bought the ranch from an old settler who wanted to move farther west  it suits me says i quiet and retirement are good for a man sometimes and i need a job i can tend bar salt mines lecture float stock do a little middleweight slugging and play the piano  can you herd sheep asks the little ranchman  do you mean have i heard sheep says i  can you herd emtake charge of a flock of em says he  oh says i now i understand you mean chase em around and bark at em like collie dogs well i might says i ive never exactly done any sheepherding but ive often seen em from car windows masticating daisies and they dont look dangerous  im short a herder says the ranchman you never can depend on the mexicans ive only got two flocks you may take out my bunch of muttonsthere are only eight hundred of emin the morning if you like the pay is twelve dollars a month and your rations furnished you camp in a tent on the prairie with your sheep you do your own cooking but wood and water are brought to your camp its an easy job  im on says i ill take the job even if i have to garland my brow and hold on to a crook and wear a looseeffect and play on a pipe like the shepherds do in pictures  so the next morning the little ranchman helps me drive the flock of muttons from the corral to about two miles out and let em graze on a little hillside on the prairie he gives me a lot of instructions about not letting bunches of them stray off from the herd and driving em down to a waterhole to drink at noon  ill bring out your tent and camping outfit and rations in the buckboard before night says he  fine says i and dont forget the rations nor the camping outfit and be sure to bring the tent your names zollicoffer aint it  my name says he is henry ogden  all right mr ogden says i mine is mr percival saint clair  i herded sheep for five days on the rancho chiquito and then the wool entered my soul that getting next to nature certainly got next to me i was lonesomer than crusoes goat ive seen a lot of persons more entertaining as companions than those sheep were id drive em to the corral and pen em every evening and then cook my cornbread and mutton and coffee and lie down in a tent the size of a tablecloth and listen to the coyotes and whippoorwills singing around the camp  the fifth evening after i had corralled my costly but uncongenial muttons i walked over to the ranchhouse and stepped in the door  mr ogden says i you and me have got to get sociable sheep are all very well to dot the landscape and furnish eightdollar cotton suitings for man but for tabletalk and fireside companions they rank along with fiveoclock teazers if youve got a deck of cards or a parcheesi outfit or a game of authors get em out and lets get on a mental basis ive got to do something in an intellectual line if its only to knock somebodys brains out  this henry ogden was a peculiar kind of ranchman he wore fingerrings and a big gold watch and careful neckties and his face was calm and his nosespectacles was kept very shiny i saw once in muscogee an outlaw hung for murdering six men who was a dead ringer for him but i knew a preacher in arkansas that you would have taken to be his brother i didnt care much for him either way what i wanted was some fellowship and communion with holy saints or lost sinnersanything sheepless would do  well saint clair says he laying down the book he was reading i guess it must be pretty lonesome for you at first and i dont deny that its monotonous for me are you sure you corralled your sheep so they wont stray out  theyre shut up as tight as the jury of a millionaire murderer says i and ill be back with them long before theyll need their trained nurse  so ogden digs up a deck of cards and we play casino after five days and nights of my sheepcamp it was like a toot on broadway when i caught big casino i felt as excited as if i had made a million in trinity and when h o loosened up a little and told the story about the lady in the pullman car i laughed for five minutes  that showed what a comparative thing life is a man may see so much that hed be bored to turn his head to look at a 3000000 fire or joe weber or the adriatic sea but let him herd sheep for a spell and youll see him splitting his ribs laughing at curfew shall not ring tonight or really enjoying himself playing cards with ladies  byandby ogden gets out a decanter of bourbon and then there is a total eclipse of sheep  do you remember reading in the papers about a month ago says he about a train holdup on the m k  t the express agent was shot through the shoulder and about 15000 in currency taken and its said that only one man did the job  seems to me i do says i but such things happen so often they dont linger long in the human texas mind did they overtake overhaul seize or lay hands upon the despoiler  he escaped says ogden and i was just reading in a paper today that the officers have tracked him down into this part of the country it seems the bills the robber got were all the first issue of currency to the second national bank of espinosa city and so theyve followed the trail where theyve been spent and it leads this way  ogden pours out some more bourbon and shoves me the bottle  i imagine says i after ingurgitating another modicum of the royal booze that it wouldnt be at all a disingenuous idea for a train robber to run down into this part of the country to hide for a spell a sheepranch now says i would be the finest kind of a place whod ever expect to find such a desperate character among these songbirds and muttons and wild flowers and by the way says i kind of looking h ogden over was there any description mentioned of this singlehanded terror was his lineaments or height and thickness or teeth fillings or style of habiliments set forth in print  why no says ogden they say nobody got a good sight of him because he wore a mask but they know it was a trainrobber called black bill because he always works alone and because he dropped a handkerchief in the expresscar that had his name on it  all right says i i approve of black bills retreat to the sheepranges i guess they wont find him  theres one thousand dollars reward for his capture says ogden  i dont need that kind of money says i looking mr sheepman straight in the eye the twelve dollars a month you pay me is enough i need a rest and i can save up until i get enough to pay my fare to texarkana where my widowed mother lives if black bill i goes on looking significantly at ogden was to have come down this waysay a month agoand bought a little sheepranch and  stop says ogden getting out of his chair and looking pretty vicious do you mean to insinuate  nothing says i no insinuations im stating a hypodermical case i say if black bill had come down here and bought a sheepranch and hired me to littleboyblue em and treated me square and friendly as youve done hed never have anything to fear from me a man is a man regardless of any complications he may have with sheep or railroad trains now you know where i stand  ogden looks black as campcoffee for nine seconds and then he laughs amused  youll do saint clair says he if i was black bill i wouldnt be afraid to trust you lets have a game or two of sevenup tonight that is if you dont mind playing with a trainrobber  ive told you says i my oral sentiments and theres no strings to em  while i was shuffling after the first hand i asks ogden as if the idea was a kind of a casualty where he was from  oh says he from the mississippi valley  thats a nice little place says i ive often stopped over there but didnt you find the sheets a little damp and the food poor now i hail says i from the pacific slope ever put up there  too draughty says ogden but if youre ever in the middle west just mention my name and youll get footwarmers and dripped coffee  well says i i wasnt exactly fishing for your private telephone number and the middle name of your aunt that carried off the cumberland presbyterian minister it dont matter i just want you to know you are safe in the hands of your shepherd now dont play hearts on spades and dont get nervous  still harping says ogden laughing again dont you suppose that if i was black bill and thought you suspected me id put a winchester bullet into you and stop my nervousness if i had any  not any says i a man whos got the nerve to hold up a train singlehanded wouldnt do a trick like that ive knocked about enough to know that them are the kind of men who put a value on a friend not that i can claim being a friend of yours mr ogden says i being only your sheepherder but under more expeditious circumstances we might have been  forget the sheep temporarily i beg says ogden and cut for deal  about four days afterward while my muttons was nooning on the waterhole and i deep in the interstices of making a pot of coffee up rides softly on the grass a mysterious person in the garb of the being he wished to represent he was dressed somewhere between a kansas city detective buffalo bill and the town dogcatcher of baton rouge his chin and eye wasnt molded on fighting lines so i knew he was only a scout  herdin sheep he asks me  well says i to a man of your evident gumptional endowments i wouldnt have the nerve to state that i am engaged in decorating old bronzes or oiling bicycle sprockets  you dont talk or look like a sheepherder to me says he  but you talk like what you look like to me says i  and then he asks me who i was working for and i shows him rancho chiquito two miles away in the shadow of a low hill and he tells me hes a deputy sheriff  theres a trainrobber called black bill supposed to be somewhere in these parts says the scout hes been traced as far as san antonio and maybe farther have you seen or heard of any strangers around here during the past month  i have not says i except a report of one over at the mexican quarters of loomis ranch on the frio  what do you know about him asks the deputy  hes three days old says i  what kind of a looking man is the man you work for he asks does old george ramey own this place yet hes run sheep here for the last ten years but never had no success  the old man has sold out and gone west i tells him another sheepfancier bought him out about a month ago  what kind of a looking man is he asks the deputy again  oh says i a big fat kind of a dutchman with long whiskers and blue specs i dont think he knows a sheep from a groundsquirrel i guess old george soaked him pretty well on the deal says i  after indulging himself in a lot more noncommunicative information and twothirds of my dinner the deputy rides away  that night i mentions the matter to ogden  theyre drawing the tendrils of the octopus around black bill says i and then i told him about the deputy sheriff and how id described him to the deputy and what the deputy said about the matter  oh well says ogden lets dont borrow any of black bills troubles weve a few of our own get the bourbon out of the cupboard and well drink to his healthunless says he with his little cackling laugh youre prejudiced against trainrobbers  ill drink says i to any man whos a friend to a friend and i believe that black bill i goes on would be that so heres to black bill and may he have good luck  and both of us drank  about two weeks later comes shearingtime the sheep had to be driven up to the ranch and a lot of frowzyheaded mexicans would snip the fur off of them with backaction scissors so the afternoon before the barbers were to come i hustled my underdone muttons over the hill across the dell down by the winding brook and up to the ranchhouse where i penned em in a corral and bade em my nightly adieus  i went from there to the ranchhouse i find h ogden esquire lying asleep on his little cot bed i guess he had been overcome by antiinsomnia or diswakefulness or some of the diseases peculiar to the sheep business his mouth and vest were open and he breathed like a secondhand bicycle pump i looked at him and gave vent to just a few musings imperial cæsar says i asleep in such a way might shut his mouth and keep the wind away  a man asleep is certainly a sight to make angels weep what good is all his brain muscle backing nerve influence and family connections hes at the mercy of his enemies and more so of his friends and hes about as beautiful as a cabhorse leaning against the metropolitan opera house at 1230 am dreaming of the plains of arabia now a woman asleep you regard as different no matter how she looks you know its better for all hands for her to be that way  well i took a drink of bourbon and one for ogden and started in to be comfortable while he was taking his nap he had some books on his table on indigenous subjects such as japan and drainage and physical cultureand some tobacco which seemed more to the point  after id smoked a few and listened to the sartorial breathing of h o i happened to look out the window toward the shearingpens where there was a kind of a road coming up from a kind of a road across a kind of a creek farther away  i saw five men riding up to the house all of em carried guns across their saddles and among em was the deputy that had talked to me at my camp  they rode up careful in open formation with their guns ready i set apart with my eye the one i opinionated to be the boss muckraker of this lawandorder cavalry  goodevening gents says i wont you light and tie your horses  the boss rides up close and swings his gun over till the opening in it seems to cover my whole front elevation  dont you move your hands none says he till you and me indulge in a adequate amount of necessary conversation  i will not says i i am no deafmute and therefore will not have to disobey your injunctions in replying  we are on the lookout says he for black bill the man that held up the katy for 15000 in may we are searching the ranches and everybody on em what is your name and what do you do on this ranch  captain says i percival saint clair is my occupation and my name is sheepherder ive got my flock of vealsno muttonspenned here tonight the shearers are coming tomorrow to give them a haircutwith baaarum i suppose  wheres the boss of this ranch the captain of the gang asks me  wait just a minute capn says i wasnt there a kind of a reward offered for the capture of this desperate character you have referred to in your preamble  theres a thousand dollars reward offered says the captain but its for his capture and conviction there dont seem to be no provision made for an informer  it looks like it might rain in a day or so says i in a tired way looking up at the cerulean blue sky  if you know anything about the locality disposition or secretiveness of this here black bill says he in a severe dialect you are amiable to the law in not reporting it  i heard a fencerider say says i in a desultory kind of voice that a mexican told a cowboy named jake over at pidgins store on the nueces that he heard that black bill had been seen in matamoras by a sheepmans cousin two weeks ago  tell you what ill do tight mouth says the captain after looking me over for bargains if you put us on so we can scoop black bill ill pay you a hundred dollars out of my ownout of our ownpockets thats liberal says he you aint entitled to anything now what do you say  cash down now i asks  the captain has a sort of discussion with his helpmates and they all produce the contents of their pockets for analysis out of the general results they figured up 10230 in cash and 31 worth of plug tobacco  come nearer capitan meeo says i and listen he so did  i am mighty poor and low down in the world says i i am working for twelve dollars a month trying to keep a lot of animals together whose only thought seems to be to get asunder although says i i regard myself as some better than the state of south dakota its a comedown to a man who has heretofore regarded sheep only in the form of chops im pretty far reduced in the world on account of foiled ambitions and rum and a kind of cocktail they make along the p r r all the way from scranton to cincinnatidry gin french vermouth one squeeze of a lime and a good dash of orange bitters if youre ever up that way dont fail to let one try you and again says i i have never yet went back on a friend ive stayed by em when they had plenty and when adversitys overtaken me ive never forsook em  but i goes on this is not exactly the case of a friend twelve dollars a month is only bowingacquaintance money and i do not consider brown beans and cornbread the food of friendship i am a poor man says i and i have a widowed mother in texarkana you will find black bill says i lying asleep in this house on a cot in the room to your right hes the man you want as i know from his words and conversation he was in a way a friend i explains and if i was the man i once was the entire product of the mines of gondola would not have tempted me to betray him but says i every week half of the beans was wormy and not nigh enough wood in camp  better go in careful gentlemen says i he seems impatient at times and when you think of his late professional pursuits one would look for abrupt actions if he was come upon sudden  so the whole posse unmounts and ties their horses and unlimbers their ammunition and equipments and tiptoes into the house and i follows like delilah when she set the philip steins on to samson  the leader of the posse shakes ogden and wakes him up and then he jumps up and two more of the rewardhunters grab him ogden was mighty tough with all his slimness and he gives em as neat a singlefooted tussle against odds as i ever see  what does this mean he says after they had him down  youre scooped in mr black bill says the captain thats all  its an outrage says h ogden madder yet  it was says the peaceandgoodwill man the katy wasnt bothering you and theres a law against monkeying with express packages  and he sits on h ogdens stomach and goes through his pockets symptomatically and careful  ill make you perspire for this says ogden perspiring some himself i can prove who i am  so can i says the captain as he draws from h ogdens inside coatpocket a handful of new bills of the second national bank of espinosa city your regular engraved tuesdaysandfridays visitingcard wouldnt have a louder voice in proclaiming your indemnity than this here currency you can get up now and prepare to go with us and expatriate your sins  h ogden gets up and fixes his necktie he says no more after they have taken the money off of him  a wellgreased idea says the sheriff captain admiring to slip off down here and buy a little sheepranch where the hand of man is seldom heard it was the slickest hideout i ever see says the captain  so one of the men goes to the shearingpen and hunts up the other herder a mexican they call john sallies and he saddles ogdens horse and the sheriffs all ride up close around him with their guns in hand ready to take their prisoner to town  before starting ogden puts the ranch in john sallies hands and gives him orders about the shearing and where to graze the sheep just as if he intended to be back in a few days and a couple of hours afterward one percival saint clair an exsheepherder of the rancho chiquito might have been seen with a hundred and nine dollarswages and bloodmoneyin his pocket riding south on another horse belonging to said ranch  the redfaced man paused and listened the whistle of a coming freighttrain sounded far away among the low hills  the fat seedy man at his side sniffed and shook his frowzy head slowly and disparagingly  what is it snipy asked the other got the blues again  no i aint said the seedy one sniffing again but i dont like your talk you and me have been friends off and on for fifteen year and i never yet knew or heard of you giving anybody up to the lawnot no one and here was a man whose saleratus you had et and at whose table you had played games of cardsif casino can be so called and yet you inform him to the law and take money for it it never was like you i say  this h ogden resumed the redfaced man through a lawyer proved himself free by alibis and other legal terminalities as i so heard afterward he never suffered no harm he did me favors and i hated to hand him over  how about the bills they found in his pocket asked the seedy man  i put em there said the redfaced man while he was asleep when i saw the posse riding up i was black bill look out snipy here she comes well board her on the bumpers when she takes water at the tank     schools and schools   i   old jerome warren lived in a hundredthousanddollar house at 35 east fiftysoforth street he was a downtown broker so rich that he could afford to walkfor his healtha few blocks in the direction of his office every morning and then call a cab  he had an adopted son the son of an old friend named gilbertcyril scott could play him nicelywho was becoming a successful painter as fast as he could squeeze the paint out of his tubes another member of the household was barbara ross a stepniece man is born to trouble so as old jerome had no family of his own he took up the burdens of others  gilbert and barbara got along swimmingly there was a tacit and tactical understanding all round that the two would stand up under a floral bell some high noon and promise the minister to keep old jeromes money in a state of high commotion but at this point complications must be introduced  thirty years before when old jerome was young jerome there was a brother of his named dick dick went west to seek his or somebody elses fortune nothing was heard of him until one day old jerome had a letter from his brother it was badly written on ruled paper that smelled of salt bacon and coffeegrounds the writing was asthmatic and the spelling st vitusy  it appeared that instead of dick having forced fortune to stand and deliver he had been held up himself and made to give hostages to the enemy that is as his letter disclosed he was on the point of pegging out with a complication of disorders that even whiskey had failed to check all that his thirty years of prospecting had netted him was one daughter nineteen years old as per invoice whom he was shipping east charges prepaid for jerome to clothe feed educate comfort and cherish for the rest of her natural life or until matrimony should them part  old jerome was a boardwalk everybody knows that the world is supported by the shoulders of atlas and that atlas stands on a railfence and that the railfence is built on a turtles back now the turtle has to stand on something and that is a boardwalk made of men like old jerome  i do not know whether immortality shall accrue to man but if not so i would like to know when men like old jerome get what is due them  they met nevada warren at the station she was a little girl deeply sunburned and wholesomely goodlooking with a manner that was frankly unsophisticated yet one that not even a cigardrummer would intrude upon without thinking twice looking at her somehow you would expect to see her in a short skirt and leather leggings shooting glass balls or taming mustangs but in her plain white waist and black skirt she sent you guessing again with an easy exhibition of strength she swung along a heavy valise which the uniformed porters tried in vain to wrest from her  i am sure we shall be the best of friends said barbara pecking at the firm sunburned cheek  i hope so said nevada  dear little niece said old jerome you are as welcome to my home as if it were your fathers own  thanks said nevada  and i am going to call you cousin said gilbert with his charming smile  take the valise please said nevada it weighs a million pounds its got samples from six of dads old mines in it she explained to barbara i calculate theyd assay about nine cents to the thousand tons but i promised him to bring them along   ii   it is a common custom to refer to the usual complication between one man and two ladies or one lady and two men or a lady and a man and a nobleman orwell any of those problemsas the triangle but they are never unqualified triangles they are always isoscelesnever equilateral so upon the coming of nevada warren she and gilbert and barbara ross lined up into such a figurative triangle and of that triangle barbara formed the hypotenuse  one morning old jerome was lingering long after breakfast over the dullest morning paper in the city before setting forth to his downtown flytrap he had become quite fond of nevada finding in her much of his dead brothers quiet independence and unsuspicious frankness  a maid brought in a note for miss nevada warren  a messengerboy delivered it at the door please she said hes waiting for an answer  nevada who was whistling a spanish waltz between her teeth and watching the carriages and autos roll by in the street took the envelope she knew it was from gilbert before she opened it by the little gold palette in the upper lefthand corner  after tearing it open she pored over the contents for a while absorbedly then with a serious face she went and stood at her uncles elbow  uncle jerome gilbert is a nice boy isnt he  why bless the child said old jerome crackling his paper loudly of course he is i raised him myself  he wouldnt write anything to anybody that wasnt exactlyi mean that everybody couldnt know and read would he  id just like to see him try it said uncle tearing a handful from his newspaper why what  read this note he just sent me uncle and see if you think its all right and proper you see i dont know much about city people and their ways  old jerome threw his paper down and set both his feet upon it he took gilberts note and fiercely perused it twice and then a third time  why child said he you had me almost excited although i was sure of that boy hes a duplicate of his father and he was a giltedged diamond he only asks if you and barbara will be ready at four oclock this afternoon for an automobile drive over to long island i dont see anything to criticise in it except the stationery i always did hate that shade of blue  would it be all right to go asked nevada eagerly  yes yes yes child of course why not still it pleases me to see you so careful and candid go by all means  i didnt know said nevada demurely i thought id ask you couldnt you go with us uncle  i no no no no ive ridden once in a car that boy was driving never again but its entirely proper for you and barbara to go yes yes but i will not no no no no  nevada flew to the door and said to the maid  you bet well go ill answer for miss barbara tell the boy to say to mr warren you bet well go  nevada called old jerome pardon me my dear but wouldnt it be as well to send him a note in reply just a line would do  no i wont bother about that said nevada gayly gilbert will understandhe always does i never rode in an automobile in my life but ive paddled a canoe down little devil river through the lost horse cañon and if its any livelier than that id like to know   iii   two months are supposed to have elapsed  barbara sat in the study of the hundredthousanddollar house it was a good place for her many places are provided in the world where men and women may repair for the purpose of extricating themselves from divers difficulties there are cloisters wailingplaces wateringplaces confessionals hermitages lawyers offices beauty parlors airships and studies and the greatest of these are studies  it usually takes a hypotenuse a long time to discover that it is the longest side of a triangle but its a long line that has no turning  barbara was alone uncle jerome and nevada had gone to the theatre barbara had not cared to go she wanted to stay at home and study in the study if you miss were a stunning new york girl and saw every day that a brown ingenuous western witch was getting hobbles and a lasso on the young man you wanted for yourself you too would lose taste for the oxidizedsilver setting of a musical comedy  barbara sat by the quarteredoak library table her right arm rested upon the table and her dextral fingers nervously manipulated a sealed letter the letter was addressed to nevada warren and in the upper lefthand corner of the envelope was gilberts little gold palette it had been delivered at nine oclock after nevada had left  barbara would have given her pearl necklace to know what the letter contained but she could not open and read it by the aid of steam or a penhandle or a hairpin or any of the generally approved methods because her position in society forbade such an act she had tried to read some of the lines of the letter by holding the envelope up to a strong light and pressing it hard against the paper but gilbert had too good a taste in stationery to make that possible  at eleventhirty the theatregoers returned it was a delicious winter night even so far as from the cab to the door they were powdered thickly with the big flakes downpouring diagonally from the east old jerome growled goodnaturedly about villainous cab service and blockaded streets nevada colored like a rose with sapphire eyes babbled of the stormy nights in the mountains around dads cabin during all these wintry apostrophes barbara cold at heart sawed woodthe only appropriate thing she could think of to do  old jerome went immediately upstairs to hotwaterbottles and quinine nevada fluttered into the study the only cheerfully lighted room subsided into an armchair and while at the interminable task of unbuttoning her elbow gloves gave oral testimony as to the demerits of the show  yes i think mr fields is really amusingsometimes said barbara here is a letter for you dear that came by special delivery just after you had gone  who is it from asked nevada tugging at a button  well really said barbara with a smile i can only guess the envelope has that queer little thing in one corner that gilbert calls a palette but which looks to me rather like a gilt heart on a schoolgirls valentine  i wonder what hes writing to me about remarked nevada listlessly  were all alike said barbara all women we try to find out what is in a letter by studying the postmark as a last resort we use scissors and read it from the bottom upward here it is  she made a motion as if to toss the letter across the table to nevada  great catamounts exclaimed nevada these centrefire buttons are a nuisance id rather wear buckskins oh barbara please shuck the hide off that letter and read it itll be midnight before i get these gloves off  why dear you dont want me to open gilberts letter to you its for you and you wouldnt wish any one else to read it of course  nevada raised her steady calm sapphire eyes from her gloves  nobody writes me anything that everybody mightnt read she said go on barbara maybe gilbert wants us to go out in his car again tomorrow  curiosity can do more things than kill a cat and if emotions well recognized as feminine are inimical to feline life then jealousy would soon leave the whole world catless barbara opened the letter with an indulgent slightly bored air  well dear said she ill read it if you want me to  she slit the envelope and read the missive with swifttravelling eyes read it again and cast a quick shrewd glance at nevada who for the time seemed to consider gloves as the world of her interest and letters from rising artists as no more than messages from mars  for a quarter of a minute barbara looked at nevada with a strange steadfastness and then a smile so small that it widened her mouth only the sixteenth part of an inch and narrowed her eyes no more than a twentieth flashed like an inspired thought across her face  since the beginning no woman has been a mystery to another woman swift as light travels each penetrates the heart and mind of another sifts her sisters words of their cunningest disguises reads her most hidden desires and plucks the sophistry from her wiliest talk like hairs from a comb twiddling them sardonically between her thumb and fingers before letting them float away on the breezes of fundamental doubt long ago eves son rang the doorbell of the family residence in paradise park bearing a strange lady on his arm whom he introduced eve took her daughterinlaw aside and lifted a classic eyebrow  the land of nod said the bride languidly flirting the leaf of a palm i suppose youve been there of course  not lately said eve absolutely unstaggered dont you think the applesauce they serve over there is execrable i rather like that mulberryleaf tunic effect dear but of course the real fig goods are not to be had over there come over behind this lilacbush while the gentlemen split a celery tonic i think the caterpillarholes have made your dress open a little in the back  so then and thereaccording to the recordswas the alliance formed by the only two whoswho ladies in the world then it was agreed that woman should forever remain as clear as a pane of glassthough glass was yet to be discoveredto other women and that she should palm herself off on man as a mystery  barbara seemed to hesitate  really nevada she said with a little show of embarrassment you shouldnt have insisted on my opening this iim sure it wasnt meant for any one else to know  nevada forgot her gloves for a moment  then read it aloud she said since youve already read it whats the difference if mr warren has written to me something that any one else oughtnt to know that is all the more reason why everybody should know it  well said barbara this is what it says dearest nevadacome to my studio at twelve oclock tonight do not fail barbara rose and dropped the note in nevadas lap im awfully sorry she said that i knew it isnt like gilbert there must be some mistake just consider that i am ignorant of it will you dear i must go upstairs now i have such a headache im sure i dont understand the note perhaps gilbert has been dining too well and will explain good night   iv   nevada tiptoed to the hall and heard barbaras door close upstairs the bronze clock in the study told the hour of twelve was fifteen minutes away she ran swiftly to the front door and let herself out into the snowstorm gilbert warrens studio was six squares away  by aerial ferry the white silent forces of the storm attacked the city from beyond the sullen east river already the snow lay a foot deep on the pavements the drifts heaping themselves like scalingladders against the walls of the besieged town the avenue was as quiet as a street in pompeii cabs now and then skimmed past like whitewinged gulls over a moonlit ocean and less frequent motorcarssustaining the comparisonhissed through the foaming waves like submarine boats on their jocund perilous journeys  nevada plunged like a winddriven stormpetrel on her way she looked up at the ragged sierras of cloudcapped buildings that rose above the streets shaded by the night lights and the congealed vapors to gray drab ashen lavender dun and cerulean tints they were so like the wintry mountains of her western home that she felt a satisfaction such as the hundredthousanddollar house had seldom brought her  a policeman caused her to waver on a corner just by his eye and weight  hello mabel said he kind of late for you to be out aint it  ii am just going to the drug store said nevada hurrying past him  the excuse serves as a passport for the most sophisticated does it prove that woman never progresses or that she sprang from adams rib fullfledged in intellect and wiles  turning eastward the direct blast cut down nevadas speed onehalf she made zigzag tracks in the snow but she was as tough as a piñon sapling and bowed to it as gracefully suddenly the studiobuilding loomed before her a familiar landmark like a cliff above some wellremembered cañon the haunt of business and its hostile neighbor art was darkened and silent the elevator stopped at ten  up eight flights of stygian stairs nevada climbed and rapped firmly at the door numbered 89 she had been there many times before with barbara and uncle jerome  gilbert opened the door he had a crayon pencil in one hand a green shade over his eyes and a pipe in his mouth the pipe dropped to the floor  am i late asked nevada i came as quick as i could uncle and me were at the theatre this evening here i am gilbert  gilbert did a pygmalionandgalatea act he changed from a statue of stupefaction to a young man with a problem to tackle he admitted nevada got a whiskbroom and began to brush the snow from her clothes a great lamp with a green shade hung over an easel where the artist had been sketching in crayon  you wanted me said nevada simply and i came you said so in your letter what did you send for me for  you read my letter inquired gilbert sparring for wind  barbara read it to me i saw it afterward it said come to my studio at twelve tonight and do not fail i thought you were sick of course but you dont seem to be  aha said gilbert irrelevantly ill tell you why i asked you to come nevada i want you to marry me immediatelytonight whats a little snowstorm will you do it  you might have noticed that i would long ago said nevada and im rather stuck on the snowstorm idea myself i surely would hate one of these flowery church noonweddings gilbert i didnt know you had grit enough to propose it this way lets shock emits our funeral aint it  you bet said gilbert where did i hear that expression he added to himself wait a minute nevada i want to do a little phoning  he shut himself in a little dressingroom and called upon the lightnings of the heavenscondensed into unromantic numbers and districts  that you jack you confounded sleepyhead yes wake up this is meor ioh bother the difference in grammar im going to be married right away yes wake up your sisterdont answer me back bring her along tooyou must remind agnes of the time i saved her from drowning in lake ronkonkomai know its caddish to refer to it but she must come with you yes nevada is here waiting weve been engaged quite a while some opposition among the relatives you know and we have to pull it off this way were waiting here for you dont let agnes outtalk youbring her you will good old boy ill order a carriage to call for you doublequick time confound you jack youre all right  gilbert returned to the room where nevada waited  my old friend jack peyton and his sister were to have been here at a quarter to twelve he explained but jack is so confoundedly slow ive just phoned them to hurry theyll be here in a few minutes im the happiest man in the world nevada what did you do with the letter i sent you today  ive got it cinched here said nevada pulling it out from beneath her operacloak  gilbert drew the letter from the envelope and looked it over carefully then he looked at nevada thoughtfully  didnt you think it rather queer that i should ask you to come to my studio at midnight he asked  why no said nevada rounding her eyes not if you needed me out west when a pal sends you a hurry callaint that what you say herewe get there first and talk about it after the row is over and its usually snowing there too when things happen so i didnt mind  gilbert rushed into another room and came back burdened with overcoats warranted to turn wind rain or snow  put this raincoat on he said holding it for her we have a quarter of a mile to go old jack and his sister will be here in a few minutes he began to struggle into a heavy coat oh nevada he said just look at the headlines on the front page of that evening paper on the table will you its about your section of the west and i know it will interest you  he waited a full minute pretending to find trouble in the getting on of his overcoat and then turned nevada had not moved she was looking at him with strange and pensive directness her cheeks had a flush on them beyond the color that had been contributed by the wind and snow but her eyes were steady  i was going to tell you she said anyhow before youbefore webeforewell before anything dad never gave me a day of schooling i never learned to read or write a darned word now if  pounding their uncertain way upstairs the feet of jack the somnolent and agnes the grateful were heard   v   when mr and mrs gilbert warren were spinning softly homeward in a closed carriage after the ceremony gilbert said  nevada would you really like to know what i wrote you in the letter that you received tonight  fire away said his bride  word for word said gilbert it was this my dear miss warrenyou were right about the flower it was a hydrangea and not a lilac  all right said nevada but lets forget it the jokes on barbara anyway     thimble thimble   these are the directions for finding the office of carteret  carteret mill supplies and leather belting  you follow the broadway trail down until you pass the crosstown line the bread line and the dead line and come to the big cañons of the moneygrubber tribe then you turn to the left to the right dodge a pushcart and the tongue of a twoton fourhorse dray and hop skip and jump to a granite ledge on the side of a twentyonestory synthetic mountain of stone and iron in the twelfth story is the office of carteret  carteret the factory where they make the mill supplies and leather belting is in brooklyn those commoditiesto say nothing of brooklynnot being of interest to you let us hold the incidents within the confines of a oneact onescene play thereby lessening the toil of the reader and the expenditure of the publisher so if you have the courage to face four pages of type and carteret  carterets office boy percival you shall sit on a varnished chair in the inner office and peep at the little comedy of the old nigger man the huntingcase watch and the openfaced questionmostly borrowed from the late mr frank stockton as you will conclude  first biography but pared to the quick must intervene i am for the inverted sugarcoated quinine pillthe bitter on the outside  the carterets were or was columbia college professors please rule an old virginia family long time ago the gentlemen of the family had worn lace ruffles and carried tinless foils and owned plantations and had slaves to burn but the war had greatly reduced their holdings of course you can perceive at once that this flavor has been shoplifted from mr f hopkinson smith in spite of the et after carter well anyhow  in digging up the carteret history i shall not take you farther back than the year 1620 the two original american carterets came over in that year but by different means of transportation one brother named john came in the mayflower and became a pilgrim father youve seen his picture on the covers of the thanksgiving magazines hunting turkeys in the deep snow with a blunderbuss blandford carteret the other brother crossed the pond in his own brigantine landed on the virginia coast and became an ffv john became distinguished for piety and shrewdness in business blandford for his pride juleps marksmanship and vast slavecultivated plantations  then came the civil war i must condense this historical interpolation stonewall jackson was shot lee surrendered grant toured the world cotton went to nine cents old crow whiskey and jim crow cars were invented the seventyninth massachusetts volunteers returned to the ninetyseventh alabama zouaves the battle flag of lundys lane which they bought at a secondhand store in chelsea kept by a man named skzchnzski georgia sent the president a sixtypound watermelonand that brings us up to the time when the story begins my but that was sparring for an opening i really must brush op on my aristotle  the yankee carterets went into business in new york long before the war their house as far as leather belting and mill supplies was concerned was as musty and arrogant and solid as one of those old east india teaimporting concerns that you read about in dickens there were some rumors of a war behind its counters but not enough to affect the business  during and after the war blandford carteret ffv lost his plantations juleps marksmanship and life he bequeathed little more than his pride to his surviving family so it came to pass that blandford carteret the fifth aged fifteen was invited by the leatherandmillsupplies branch of that name to come north and learn business instead of hunting foxes and boasting of the glory of his fathers on the reduced acres of his impoverished family the boy jumped at the chance and at the age of twentyfive sat in the office of the firm equal partner with john the fifth of the blunderbussandturkey branch here the story begins again  the young men were about the same age smooth of face alert easy of manner and with an air that promised mental and physical quickness they were razored blueserged strawhatted and pearl stickpinned like other young new yorkers who might be millionaires or bill clerks  one afternoon at four oclock in the private office of the firm blandford carteret opened a letter that a clerk had just brought to his desk after reading it he chuckled audibly for nearly a minute john looked around from his desk inquiringly  its from mother said blandford ill read you the funny part of it she tells me all the neighborhood news first of course and then cautions me against getting my feet wet and musical comedies after that come vital statistics about calves and pigs and an estimate of the wheat crop and now ill quote some  and what do you think old uncle jake who was seventysix last wednesday must go travelling nothing would do but he must go to new york and see his young marster blandford old as he is he has a deal of common sense so ive let him go i couldnt refuse himhe seemed to have concentrated all his hopes and desires into this one adventure into the wide world you know he was born on the plantation and has never been ten miles away from it in his life and he was your fathers body servant during the war and has been always a faithful vassal and servant of the family he has often seen the gold watchthe watch that was your fathers and your fathers fathers i told him it was to be yours and he begged me to allow him to take it to you and to put it into your hands himself  so he has it carefully enclosed in a buckskin case and is bringing it to you with all the pride and importance of a kings messenger i gave him money for the round trip and for a two weeks stay in the city i wish you would see to it that he gets comfortable quartersjake wont need much looking afterhes able to take care of himself but i have read in the papers that african bishops and colored potentates generally have much trouble in obtaining food and lodging in the yankee metropolis that may be all right but i dont see why the best hotel there shouldnt take jake in still i suppose its a rule  i gave him full directions about finding you and packed his valise myself you wont have to bother with him but i do hope youll see that he is made comfortable take the watch that he brings youits almost a decoration it has been worn by true carterets and there isnt a stain upon it nor a false movement of the wheels bringing it to you is the crowning joy of old jakes life i wanted him to have that little outing and that happiness before it is too late you have often heard us talk about how jake pretty badly wounded himself crawled through the reddened grass at chancellorsville to where your father lay with the bullet in his dear heart and took the watch from his pocket to keep it from the yanks  so my son when the old man comes consider him as a frail but worthy messenger from the oldtime life and home  you have been so long away from home and so long among the people that we have always regarded as aliens that im not sure that jake will know you when he sees you but jake has a keen perception and i rather believe that he will know a virginia carteret at sight i cant conceive that even ten years in yankeeland could change a boy of mine anyhow im sure you will know jake i put eighteen collars in his valise if he should have to buy others he wears a number 15½ please see that he gets the right ones he will be no trouble to you at all  if you are not too busy id like for you to find him a place to board where they have whitemeal cornbread and try to keep him from taking his shoes off in your office or on the street his right foot swells a little and he likes to be comfortable  if you can spare the time count his handkerchiefs when they come back from the wash i bought him a dozen new ones before he left he should be there about the time this letter reaches you i told him to go straight to your office when he arrives  as soon as blandford had finished the reading of this something happened as there should happen in stories and must happen on the stage  percival the office boy with his air of despising the worlds output of mill supplies and leather belting came in to announce that a colored gentleman was outside to see mr blandford carteret  bring him in said blandford rising  john carteret swung around in his chair and said to percival ask him to wait a few minutes outside well let you know when to bring him in  then he turned to his cousin with one of those broad slow smiles that was an inheritance of all the carterets and said  bland ive always had a consuming curiosity to understand the differences that you haughty southerners believe to exist between you all and the people of the north of course i know that you consider yourselves made out of finer clay and look upon adam as only a collateral branch of your ancestry but i dont know why i never could understand the differences between us  well john said blandford laughing what you dont understand about it is just the difference of course i suppose it was the feudal way in which we lived that gave us our lordly baronial airs and feeling of superiority  but you are not feudal now went on john since we licked you and stole your cotton and mules youve had to go to work just as we damyankees as you call us have always been doing and youre just as proud and exclusive and upperclassy as you were before the war so it wasnt your money that caused it  maybe it was the climate said blandford lightly or maybe our negroes spoiled us ill call old jake in now ill be glad to see the old villain again  wait just a moment said john ive got a little theory i want to test you and i are pretty much alike in our general appearance old jake hasnt seen you since you were fifteen lets have him in and play fair and see which of us gets the watch the old darky surely ought to be able to pick out his young marster without any trouble the alleged aristocratic superiority of a reb ought to be visible to him at once he couldnt make the mistake of handing over the timepiece to a yankee of course the loser buys the dinner this evening and two dozen 15½ collars for jake is it a go  blandford agreed heartily percival was summoned and told to usher the colored gentleman in  uncle jake stepped inside the private office cautiously he was a little old man as black as soot wrinkled and bald except for a fringe of white wool cut decorously short that ran over his ears and around his head there was nothing of the stage uncle about him his black suit nearly fitted him his shoes shone and his straw hat was banded with a gaudy ribbon in his right hand he carried something carefully concealed by his closed fingers  uncle jake stopped a few steps from the door two young men sat in their revolving deskchairs ten feet apart and looked at him in friendly silence his gaze slowly shifted many times from one to the other he felt sure that he was in the presence of one at least of the revered family among whose fortunes his life had begun and was to end  one had the pleasing but haughty carteret air the other had the unmistakable straight long family nose both had the keen black eyes horizontal brows and thin smiling lips that had distinguished both the carteret of the mayflower and him of the brigantine old jake had thought that he could have picked out his young master instantly from a thousand northerners but he found himself in difficulties the best he could do was to use strategy  howdy marse blandfordhowdy suh he said looking midway between the two young men  howdy uncle jake they both answered pleasantly and in unison sit down have you brought the watch  uncle jake chose a hardbottom chair at a respectful distance sat on the edge of it and laid his hat carefully on the floor the watch in its buckskin case he gripped tightly he had not risked his life on the battlefield to rescue that watch from his old marsters foes to hand it over again to the enemy without a struggle  yes suh i got it in my hand suh im gwine give it to you right away in jus a minute old missus told me to put it in young marse blandfords hand and tell him to wear it for the family pride and honor it was a mighty longsome trip for an old nigger man to maketen thousand miles it must be back to old viginia suh youve growed mightily young marster i wouldnt have reconnized you but for yo powerful resemblance to old marster  with admirable diplomacy the old man kept his eyes roaming in the space between the two men his words might have been addressed to either though neither wicked nor perverse he was seeking for a sign  blandford and john exchanged winks  i reckon you done got you mas letter went on uncle jake she said she was gwine to write to you bout my comin along up this erway  yes yes uncle jake said john briskly my cousin and i have just been notified to expect you we are both carterets you know  although one of us said blandford was born and raised in the north  so if you will hand over the watch said john  my cousin and i said blandford  will then see to it said john  that comfortable quarters are found for you said blandford  with creditable ingenuity old jake set up a cackling highpitched protracted laugh he beat his knee picked up his hat and bent the brim in an apparent paroxysm of humorous appreciation the seizure afforded him a mask behind which he could roll his eyes impartially between above and beyond his two tormentors  i sees what he chuckled after a while you genlemen is tryin to have fun with the po old nigger but you cant fool old jake i knowed you marse blandford the minute i sot eyes on you you was a po skimpy little boy no mo than about foteen when you lef home to come noth but i knowed you the minute i sot eyes on you you is the mawtal image of old marster the other genleman resembles you mightily suh but you cant fool old jake on a member of the old viginia family no suh  at exactly the same time both carterets smiled and extended a hand for the watch  uncle jakes wrinkled black face lost the expression of amusement to which he had vainly twisted it he knew that he was being teased and that it made little real difference as far as its safety went into which of those outstretched hands he placed the family treasure but it seemed to him that not only his own pride and loyalty but much of the virginia carterets was at stake he had heard down south during the war about that other branch of the family that lived in the north and fought on the yuther side and it had always grieved him he had followed his old marsters fortunes from stately luxury through war to almost poverty and now with the last relic and reminder of him blessed by old missus and intrusted implicitly to his care he had come ten thousand miles as it seemed to deliver it into the hands of the one who was to wear it and wind it and cherish it and listen to it tick off the unsullied hours that marked the lives of the carteretsof virginia  his experience and conception of the yankees had been an impression of tyrantslowdown common trashin blue laying waste with fire and sword he had seen the smoke of many burning homesteads almost as grand as carteret hall ascending to the drowsy southern skies and now he was face to face with one of themand he could not distinguish him from his young marster whom he had come to find and bestow upon him the emblem of his kingshipeven as the arm clothed in white samite mystic wonderful laid excalibur in the right hand of arthur he saw before him two young men easy kind courteous welcoming either of whom might have been the one he sought troubled bewildered sorely grieved at his weakness of judgment old jake abandoned his loyal subterfuges his right hand sweated against the buckskin cover of the watch he was deeply humiliated and chastened seriously now his prominent yellowwhite eyes closely scanned the two young men at the end of his scrutiny he was conscious of but one difference between them one wore a narrow black tie with a white pearl stickpin the others fourinhand was a narrow blue one pinned with a black pearl  and then to old jakes relief there came a sudden distraction drama knocked at the door with imperious knuckles and forced comedy to the wings and drama peeped with a smiling but set face over the footlights  percival the hater of mill supplies brought in a card which he handed with the manner of one bearing a cartel to bluetie  olivia de ormond read bluetie from the card he looked inquiringly at his cousin  why not have her in said blacktie and bring matters to a conclusion  uncle jake said one of the young men would you mind taking that chair over there in the corner for a while a lady is coming inon some business well take up your case afterward  the lady whom percival ushered in was young and petulantly decidedly freshly consciously and intentionally pretty she was dressed with such expensive plainness that she made you consider lace and ruffles as mere tatters and rags but one great ostrich plume that she wore would have marked her anywhere in the army of beauty as the wearer of the merry helmet of navarre  miss de ormond accepted the swivel chair at blueties desk then the gentlemen drew leatherupholstered seats conveniently near and spoke of the weather  yes said she i noticed it was warmer but i mustnt take up too much of your time during business hours that is she continued unless we talk business  she addressed her words to bluetie with a charming smile  very well said he you dont mind my cousin being present do you we are generally rather confidential with each otherespecially in business matters  oh no caroled miss de ormond id rather he did hear he knows all about it anyhow in fact hes quite a material witness because he was present when youwhen it happened i thought you might want to talk things over beforewell before any action is taken as i believe the lawyers say  have you anything in the way of a proposition to make asked blacktie  miss de ormond looked reflectively at the neat toe of one of her dull kidpumps  i had a proposal made to me she said if the proposal sticks it cuts out the proposition lets have that settled first  well as far as began bluetie  excuse me cousin interrupted blacktie if you dont mind my cutting in and then he turned with a goodnatured air toward the lady  now lets recapitulate a bit he said cheerfully all three of us besides other mutual acquaintances have been out on a good many larks together  im afraid ill have to call the birds by another name said miss de ormond  all right responded blacktie with unimpaired cheerfulness suppose we say squabs when we talk about the proposal and larks when we discuss the proposition you have a quick mind miss de ormond two months ago some halfdozen of us went in a motorcar for a days run into the country we stopped at a roadhouse for dinner my cousin proposed marriage to you then and there he was influenced to do so of course by the beauty and charm which no one can deny that you possess  i wish i had you for a press agent mr carteret said the beauty with a dazzling smile  you are on the stage miss de ormond went on blacktie you have had doubtless many admirers and perhaps other proposals you must remember too that we were a party of merrymakers on that occasion there were a good many corks pulled that the proposal of marriage was made to you by my cousin we cannot deny but hasnt it been your experience that by common consent such things lose their seriousness when viewed in the next days sunlight isnt there something of a code among good sportsi use the word in its best sensethat wipes out each day the follies of the evening previous  oh yes said miss de ormond i know that very well and ive always played up to it but as you seem to be conducting the casewith the silent consent of the defendantill tell you something more ive got letters from him repeating the proposal and theyre signed too  i understand said blacktie gravely whats your price for the letters  im not a cheap one said miss de ormond but i had decided to make you a rate you both belong to a swell family well if i am on the stage nobody can say a word against me truthfully and the money is only a secondary consideration it isnt the money i was after ii believed himandand i liked him  she cast a soft entrancing glance at bluetie from under her long eyelashes  and the price went on blacktie inexorably  ten thousand dollars said the lady sweetly  or  or the fulfillment of the engagement to marry  i think it is time interrupted bluetie for me to be allowed to say a word or two you and i cousin belong to a family that has held its head pretty high you have been brought up in a section of the country very different from the one where our branch of the family lived yet both of us are carterets even if some of our ways and theories differ you remember it is a tradition of the family that no carteret ever failed in chivalry to a lady or failed to keep his word when it was given  then bluetie with frank decision showing on his countenance turned to miss de ormond  olivia said he on what date will you marry me  before she could answer blacktie again interposed  it is a long journey said he from plymouth rock to norfolk bay between the two points we find the changes that nearly three centuries have brought in that time the old order has changed we no longer burn witches or torture slaves and today we neither spread our cloaks on the mud for ladies to walk over nor treat them to the duckingstool it is the age of common sense adjustment and proportion all of usladies gentlemen women men northerners southerners lords caitiffs actors hardwaredrummers senators hodcarriers and politiciansare coming to a better understanding chivalry is one of our words that changes its meaning every day family pride is a thing of many constructionsit may show itself by maintaining a motheaten arrogance in a cobwebbed colonial mansion or by the prompt paying of ones debts  now i suppose youve had enough of my monologue ive learned something of business and a little of life and i somehow believe cousin that our greatgreatgrandfathers the original carterets would indorse my view of this matter  blacktie wheeled around to his desk wrote in a checkbook and tore out the check the sharp rasp of the perforated leaf making the only sound in the room he laid the check within easy reach of miss de ormonds hand  business is business said he we live in a business age there is my personal check for 10000 what do you say miss de ormondwill it he orange blossoms or cash  miss de ormond picked up the cheek carelessly folded it indifferently and stuffed it into her glove  oh thisll do she said calmly i just thought id call and put it up to you i guess you people are all right but a girl has feelings you know ive heard one of you was a southerneri wonder which one of you it is  she arose smiled sweetly and walked to the door there with a flash of white teeth and a dip of the heavy plume she disappeared  both of the cousins had forgotten uncle jake for the time but now they heard the shuffling of his shoes as he came across the rug toward them from his seat in the corner  young marster he said take yo watch  and without hesitation he laid the ancient timepiece in the hand of its rightful owner     supply and demand   finch keeps a hatscleanedbyelectricitywhileyouwait establishment nine feet by twelve in third avenue once a customer you are always his i do not know his secret process but every four days your hat needs to be cleaned again  finch is a leathern sallow slowfooted man between twenty and forty you would say he had been brought up a bushelman in essex street when business is slack he likes to talk so i had my hat cleaned even oftener than it deserved hoping finch might let me into some of the secrets of the sweatshops  one afternoon i dropped in and found finch alone he began to anoint my headpiece de panama with his mysterious fluid that attracted dust and dirt like a magnet  they say the indians weave em under water said i for a leader  dont you believe it said finch no indian or white man could stay under water that long say do you pay much attention to politics i see in the paper something about a law theyve passed called the law of supply and demand  i explained to him as well as i could that the reference was to a politicoeconomical law and not to a legal statute  i didnt know said finch i heard a good deal about it a year or so ago but in a onesided way  yes said i political orators use it a great deal in fact they never give it a rest i suppose you heard some of those carttail fellows spouting on the subject over here on the east side  i heard it from a king said finchthe white king of a tribe of indians in south america  i was interested but not surprised the big city is like a mothers knee to many who have strayed far and found the roads rough beneath their uncertain feet at dusk they come home and sit upon the doorstep i know a piano player in a cheap café who has shot lions in africa a bellboy who fought in the british army against the zulus an expressdriver whose left arm had been cracked like a lobsters claw for a stewpot of patagonian cannibals when the boat of his rescuers hove in sight so a hatcleaner who had been a friend of a king did not oppress me  a new band asked finch with his dry barren smile  yes said i and half an inch wider i had had a new band five days before  i meets a man one night said finch beginning his storya man brown as snuff with money in every pocket eating schweinerknuckel in schlagels that was two years ago when i was a hosecart driver for no 98 his discourse runs to the subject of gold he says that certain mountains in a country down south that he calls gaudymala is full of it he says the indians wash it out of the streams in plural quantities  oh geronimo says i indians theres no indians in the south i tell him except elks maccabees and the buyers for the fall drygoods trade the indians are all on the reservations says i  im telling you this with reservations says he they aint buffalo bill indians theyre squattier and more pedigreed they call em inkers and aspics and they was old inhabitants when mazuma was king of mexico they wash the gold out of the mountain streams says the brown man and fill quills with it and then they empty em into red jars till they are full and then they pack it in buckskin sacks of one arroba eachan arroba is twentyfive poundsand store it in a stone house with an engraving of a idol with marcelled hair playing a flute over the door  how do they work off this unearth increment i asks  they dont says the man its a case of ill fares the land with the great deal of velocity where wealth accumulates and there aint any reciprocity  after this man and me got through our conversation which left him dry of information i shook hands with him and told him i was sorry i couldnt believe him and a month afterward i landed on the coast of this gaudymala with 1300 that i had been saving up for five years i thought i knew what indians liked and i fixed myself accordingly i loaded down four packmules with red woollen blankets wroughtiron pails jewelled sidecombs for the ladies glass necklaces and safetyrazors i hired a black mozo who was supposed to be a muledriver and an interpreter too it turned out that he could interpret mules all right but he drove the english language much too hard his name sounded like a yale key when you push it in wrong side up but i called him mcclintock which was close to the noise  well this gold village was forty miles up in the mountains and it took us nine days to find it but one afternoon mcclintock led the other mules and myself over a rawhide bridge stretched across a precipice five thousand feet deep it seemed to me the hoofs of the beasts drummed on it just like before george m cohan makes his first entrance on the stage  this village was built of mud and stone and had no streets some few yellowandbrown persons popped their heads outofdoors looking about like welsh rabbits with worcester sauce on em out of the biggest house that had a kind of a porch around it steps a big white man red as a beet in color dressed in fine tanned deerskin clothes with a gold chain around his neck smoking a cigar ive seen united states senators of his style of features and build also headwaiters and cops  he walks up and takes a look at us while mcclintock disembarks and begins to interpret to the lead mule while he smokes a cigarette  hello buttinsky says the fine man to me how did you get in the game i didnt see you buy any chips who gave you the keys of the city  im a poor traveller says i especially muleback youll excuse me do you run a hack line or only a bluff  segregate yourself from your pseudoequine quadruped says he and come inside  he raises a finger and a villager runs up  this man will take care of your outfit says he and ill take care of you  he leads me into the biggest house and sets out the chairs and a kind of a drink the color of milk it was the finest room i ever saw the stone walls was hung all over with silk shawls and there was red and yellow rugs on the floor and jars of red pottery and angora goat skins and enough bamboo furniture to misfurnish half a dozen seaside cottages  in the first place says the man you want to know who i am im sole lessee and proprietor of this tribe of indians they call me the grand yacuma which is to say king or main finger of the bunch ive got more power here than a chargé daffaires a charge of dynamite and a charge account at tiffanys combined in fact im the big stick with as many extra knots on it as there is on the record run of the lusitania oh i read the papers now and then says he now lets hear your entitlements he goes on and the meeting will be open  well says i i am known as one w d finch occupation capitalist address 541 east thirtysecond  new york chips in the noble grand i know says he grinning it aint the first time youve seen it go down on the blotter i can tell by the way you hand it out well explain capitalist  i tells this boss plain what i come for and how i come to came  golddust says he looking as puzzled as a baby thats got a feather stuck on its molasses finger thats funny this aint a goldmining country and you invested all your capital on a strangers story well well these indians of minethey are the last of the tribe of pechesare simple as children they know nothing of the purchasing power of gold im afraid youve been imposed on says he  maybe so says i but it sounded pretty straight to me  w d says the king all of a sudden ill give you a square deal it aint often i get to talk to a white man and ill give you a show for your money it may be these constituents of mine have a few grains of golddust hid away in their clothes tomorrow you may get out these goods youve brought up and see if you can make any sales now im going to introduce myself unofficially my name is shanepatrick shane i own this tribe of peche indians by right of conquestsingle handed and unafraid i drifted up here four years ago and won em by my size and complexion and nerve i learned their language in six weeksits easy you simply emit a string of consonants as long as your breath holds out and then point at what youre asking for  i conquered em spectacularly goes on king shane and then i went at em with economical politics law sleightofhand and a kind of new england ethics and parsimony every sunday or as near as i can guess at it i preach to em in the councilhouse im the council on the law of supply and demand i praise supply and knock demand i use the same text every time you wouldnt think w d says shane that i had poetry in me would you  well says i i wouldnt know whether to call it poetry or not  tennyson says shane furnishes the poetic gospel i preach i always considered him the boss poet heres the way the text goes      for not to admire if a man could learn it were more    than to walk all day like a sultan of old in a garden of spice   you see i teach em to cut out demandthat supply is the main thing i teach em not to desire anything beyond their simplest needs a little mutton a little cocoa and a little fruit brought up from the coastthats all they want to make em happy ive got em well trained they make their own clothes and hats out of a vegetable fibre and straw and theyre a contented lot its a great thing winds up shane to have made a people happy by the incultivation of such simple institutions  well the next day with the kings permission i has the mcclintock open up a couple of sacks of my goods in the little plaza of the village the indians swarmed around by the hundred and looked the bargaincounter over i shook red blankets at em flashed fingerrings and earbobs tried pearl necklaces and sidecombs on the women and a line of red hosiery on the men twas no use they looked on like hungry graven images but i never made a sale i asked mcclintock what was the trouble mac yawned three or four times rolled a cigarette made one or two confidential side remarks to a mule and then condescended to inform me that the people had no money  just then up strolls king patrick big and red and royal as usual with the gold chain over his chest and his cigar in front of him  hows business w d he asks  fine says i its a bargainday rush ive got one more line of goods to offer before i shut up shop ill try em with safetyrazors ive got two gross that i bought at a fire sale  shane laughs till some kind of mameluke or private secretary he carries with him has to hold him up  o my sainted aunt jerusha says he aint you one of the babes in the goods w d dont you know that no indians ever shave they pull out their whiskers instead  well says i thats just what these razors would do for emthey wouldnt have any kick coming if they used em once  shane went away and i could hear him laughing a block if there had been any block  tell em says i to mcclintock it aint money i wanttell em ill take golddust tell em ill allow em sixteen dollars an ounce for it in trade thats what im out forthe dust  mac interprets and youd have thought a squadron of cops had charged the crowd to disperse it every uncles nephew and aunts niece of em faded away inside of two minutes  at the royal palace that night me and the king talked it over  theyve got the dust hid out somewhere says i or they wouldnt have been so sensitive about it  they havent says shane whats this gag youve got about gold you been reading edward allen poe they aint got any gold  they put it in quills says i and then they empty it in jars and then into sacks of twentyfive pounds each i got it straight  w d says shane laughing and chewing his cigar i dont often see a white man and i feel like putting you on i dont think youll get away from here alive anyhow so im going to tell you come over here  he draws aside a silk fibre curtain in a corner of the room and shows me a pile of buckskin sacks  forty of em says shane one arroba in each one in round numbers 220000 worth of golddust you see there its all mine it belongs to the grand yacuma they bring it all to me two hundred and twenty thousand dollarsthink of that you glassbead peddler says shaneand all mine  little good it does you says i contemptuously and hatefully and so you are the government depository of this gang of moneyless moneymakers dont you pay enough interest on it to enable one of your depositors to buy an augusta maine pullman carbon diamond worth 200 for 485  listen says patrick shane with the sweat coming out on his brow im confidant with you as you have somehow enlisted my regards did you ever he says feel the avoirdupois power of goldnot the troy weight of it but the sixteenouncestothepound force of it  never says i i never take in any bad money  shane drops down on the floor and throws his arms over the sacks of golddust  i love it says he i want to feel the touch of it day and night its my pleasure in life i come in this room and im a king and a rich man ill be a millionaire in another year the piles getting bigger every month ive got the whole tribe washing out the sands in the creeks im the happiest man in the world w d i just want to be near this gold and know its mine and its increasing every day now you know says he why my indians wouldnt buy your goods they cant they bring all the dust to me im their king ive taught em not to desire or admire you might as well shut up shop  ill tell you what you are says i youre a plain contemptible miser you preach supply and you forget demand now supply i goes on is never anything but supply on the contrary says i demand is a much broader syllogism and assertion demand includes the rights of our women and children and charity and friendship and even a little begging on the street corners theyve both got to harmonize equally and ive got a few things up my commercial sleeve yet says i that may jostle your preconceived ideas of politics and economy  the next morning i had mcclintock bring up another muleload of goods to the plaza and open it up the people gathered around the same as before  i got out the finest line of necklaces bracelets haircombs and earrings that i carried and had the women put em on and then i played trumps  out of my last pack i opened up a half gross of handmirrors with solid tinfoil backs and passed em around among the ladies that was the first introduction of lookingglasses among the peche indians  shane walks by with his big laugh  business looking up any he asks  its looking at itself right now says i  byandby a kind of a murmur goes through the crowd the women had looked into the magic crystal and seen that they were beautiful and was confiding the secret to the men the men seemed to be urging the lack of money and the hard times just before the election but their excuses didnt go  then was my time  i called mcclintock away from an animated conversation with his mules and told him to do some interpreting  tell em says i that golddust will buy for them these befitting ornaments for kings and queens of the earth tell em the yellow sand they wash out of the waters for the high sanctified yacomay and chop suey of the tribe will buy the precious jewels and charms that will make them beautiful and preserve and pickle them from evil spirits tell em the pittsburgh banks are paying four per cent interest on deposits by mail while this getrichfrequently custodian of the public funds aint even paying attention keep telling em mac says i to let the golddust family do their work talk to em like a born antibryanite says i remind em that tom watsons gone back to georgia says i  mcclintock waves his hand affectionately at one of his mules and then hurls a few stickfuls of minion type at the mob of shoppers  a guttapercha indian man with a lady hanging on his arm with three strings of my fishscale jewelry and imitation marble beads around her neck stands up on a block of stone and makes a talk that sounds like a man shaking dice in a box to fill aces and sixes  he says says mcclintock that the people not know that golddust will buy their things the women very mad the grand yacuma tell them it no good but for keep to make bad spirits keep away  you cant keep bad spirits away from money says i  they say goes on mcclintock the yacuma fool them they raise plenty row  going going says i golddust or cash takes the entire stock the dust weighed before you and taken at sixteen dollars the ouncethe highest price on the gaudymala coast  then the crowd disperses all of a sudden and i dont know whats up mac and me packs away the handmirrors and jewelry they had handed back to us and we had the mules back to the corral they had set apart for our garage  while we was there we hear great noises of shouting and down across the plaza runs patrick shane hotfoot with his clothes ripped half off and scratches on his face like a cat had fought him hard for every one of its lives  theyre looting the treasury w d he sings out theyre going to kill me and you too unlimber a couple of mules at once well have to make a getaway in a couple of minutes  theyve found out says i the truth about the law of supply and demand  its the women mostly says the king and they used to admire me so  they hadnt seen lookingglasses then says i  theyve got knives and hatchets says shane hurry  take that roan mule says i you and your law of supply ill ride the dun for hes two knots per hour the faster the roan has a stiff knee but he may make it says i if youd included reciprocity in your political platform i might have given you the dun says i  shane and mcclintock and me mounted our mules and rode across the rawhide bridge just as the peches reached the other side and began firing stones and long knives at us we cut the thongs that held up our end of the bridge and headed for the coast    a tall bulky policeman came into finchs shop at that moment and leaned an elbow on the showcase finch nodded at him friendly  i heard down at caseys said the cop in rumbling husky tones that there was going to be a picnic of the hatcleaners union over at bergen beach sunday is that right  sure said finch therell be a dandy time  gimme five tickets said the cop throwing a fivedollar bill on the showcase  why said finch aint you going it a little too  go to h said the cop you got em to sell aint you somebodys got to buy em wish i could go along  i was glad to see finch so well thought of in his neighborhood  and then in came a wee girl of seven with dirty face and pure blue eyes and a smutched and insufficient dress  mamma says she recited shrilly that you must give me eighty cents for the grocer and nineteen for the milkman and five cents for me to buy hokeypokey withbut she didnt say that the elf concluded with a hopeful but honest grin  finch shelled out the money counting it twice but i noticed that the total sum that the small girl received was one dollar and four cents  thats the right kind of a law remarked finch as he carefully broke some of the stitches of my hatband so that it would assuredly come off within a few daysthe law of supply and demand but theyve both got to work together ill bet he went on with his dry smile shell get jelly beans with that nickelshe likes em whats supply if theres no demand for it  what ever became of the king i asked curiously  oh i might have told you said finch that was shane came in and bought the tickets he came back with me and hes on the force now     buried treasure   there are many kinds of fools now will everybody please sit still until they are called upon specifically to rise  i had been every kind of fool except one i had expended my patrimony pretended my matrimony played poker lawntennis and bucketshopsparted soon with my money in many ways but there remained one rule of the wearer of cap and bells that i had not played that was the seeker after buried treasure to few does the delectable furor come but of all the wouldbe followers in the hoofprints of king midas none has found a pursuit so rich in pleasurable promise  but going back from my theme a whileas lame pens must doi was a fool of the sentimental sort i saw may martha mangum and was hers she was eighteen the color of the white ivory keys of a new piano beautiful and possessed by the exquisite solemnity and pathetic witchery of an unsophisticated angel doomed to live in a small dull texas prairietown she had a spirit and charm that could have enabled her to pluck rubies like raspberries from the crown of belgium or any other sporty kingdom but she did not know it and i did not paint the picture for her  you see i wanted may martha mangum for to have and to hold i wanted her to abide with me and put my slippers and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings  may marthas father was a man hidden behind whiskers and spectacles he lived for bugs and butterflies and all insects that fly or crawl or buzz or get down your back or in the butter he was an etymologist or words to that effect he spent his life seining the air for flying fish of the junebug order and then sticking pins through em and calling em names  he and may martha were the whole family he prized her highly as a fine specimen of the racibus humanus because she saw that he had food at times and put his clothes on right side before and kept his alcoholbottles filled scientists they say are apt to be absentminded  there was another besides myself who thought may martha mangum one to be desired that was goodloe banks a young man just home from college he had all the attainments to be found in bookslatin greek philosophy and especially the higher branches of mathematics and logic  if it hadnt been for his habit of pouring out this information and learning on every one that he addressed id have liked him pretty well but even as it was he and i were you would have thought great pals  we got together every time we could because each of us wanted to pump the other for whatever straws we could to find which way the wind blew from the heart of may martha mangumrather a mixed metaphor goodloe banks would never have been guilty of that that is the way of rivals  you might say that goodloe ran to books manners culture rowing intellect and clothes i would have put you in mind more of baseball and fridaynight debating societiesby way of cultureand maybe of a good horseback rider  but in our talks together and in our visits and conversation with may martha neither goodloe banks nor i could find out which one of us she preferred may martha was a naturalborn noncommittal and knew in her cradle how to keep people guessing  as i said old man mangum was absentminded after a long time he found out one daya little butterfly must have told himthat two young men were trying to throw a net over the head of the young person a daughter or some such technical appendage who looked after his comforts  i never knew scientists could rise to such occasions old mangum orally labelled and classified goodloe and myself easily among the lowest orders of the vertebrates and in english too without going any further into latin than the simple references to orgetorix rex helvetiiwhich is as far as i ever went myself and he told us that if he ever caught us around his house again he would add us to his collection  goodloe banks and i remained away five days expecting the storm to subside when we dared to call at the house again may martha mangum and her father were gone gone the house they had rented was closed their little store of goods and chattels was gone also  and not a word of farewell to either of us from may marthanot a white fluttering note pinned to the hawthornbush not a chalkmark on the gatepost nor a postcard in the postoffice to give us a clew  for two months goodloe banks and iseparatelytried every scheme we could think of to track the runaways we used our friendship and influence with the ticketagent with liverystable men railroad conductors and our one lone lorn constable but without results  then we became better friends and worse enemies than ever we forgathered in the back room of snyders saloon every afternoon after work and played dominoes and laid conversational traps to find out from each other if anything had been discovered that is the way of rivals  now goodloe banks had a sarcastic way of displaying his own learning and putting me in the class that was reading poor jane ray her bird is dead she cannot play well i rather liked goodloe and i had a contempt for his college learning and i was always regarded as goodnatured so i kept my temper and i was trying to find out if he knew anything about may martha so i endured his society  in talking things over one afternoon he said to me  suppose you do find her ed whereby would you profit miss mangum has a mind perhaps it is yet uncultured but she is destined for higher things than you could give her i have talked with no one who seemed to appreciate more the enchantment of the ancient poets and writers and the modern cults that have assimilated and expended their philosophy of life dont you think you are wasting your time looking for her  my idea said i of a happy home is an eightroom house in a grove of liveoaks by the side of a charco on a texas prairie a piano i went on with an automatic player in the sittingroom three thousand head of cattle under fence for a starter a buckboard and ponies always hitched at a post for the missusand may martha mangum to spend the profits of the ranch as she pleases and to abide with me and put my slippers and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings that said i is what is to be and a figa dried smyrna dagostand figfor your curriculums cults and philosophy  she is meant for higher things repeated goodloe banks  whatever she is meant for i answered just now she is out of pocket and i shall find her as soon as i can without aid of the colleges  the game is blocked said goodloe putting down a domino and we had the beer  shortly after that a young farmer whom i knew came into town and brought me a folded blue paper he said his grandfather had just died i concealed a tear and he went on to say that the old man had jealously guarded this paper for twenty years he left it to his family as part of his estate the rest of which consisted of two mules and a hypotenuse of nonarable land  the sheet of paper was of the old blue kind used during the rebellion of the abolitionists against the secessionists it was dated june 14 1863 and it described the hidingplace of ten burroloads of gold and silver coin valued at three hundred thousand dollars old rundlegrandfather of his grandson samwas given the information by a spanish priest who was in on the treasureburying and who died many years beforeno afterwardin old rundles house old rundle wrote it down from dictation  why didnt your father look this up i asked young rundle  he went blind before he could do so he replied  why didnt you hunt for it yourself i asked  well said he ive only known about the paper for ten years first there was the spring ploughin to do and then choppin the weeds out of the corn and then come takin fodder and mighty soon winter was on us it seemed to run along that way year after year  that sounded perfectly reasonable to me so i took it up with young lee rundle at once  the directions on the paper were simple the whole burro cavalcade laden with the treasure started from an old spanish mission in dolores county they travelled due south by the compass until they reached the alamito river they forded this and buried the treasure on the top of a little mountain shaped like a packsaddle standing in a row between two higher ones a heap of stones marked the place of the buried treasure all the party except the spanish priest were killed by indians a few days later the secret was a monopoly it looked good to me  lee rundle suggested that we rig out a camping outfit hire a surveyor to run out the line from the spanish mission and then spend the three hundred thousand dollars seeing the sights in fort worth but without being highly educated i knew a way to save time and expense  we went to the state landoffice and had a practical what they call a working sketch made of all the surveys of land from the old mission to the alamito river on this map i drew a line due southward to the river the length of lines of each survey and section of land was accurately given on the sketch by these we found the point on the river and had a connection made with it and an important wellidentified corner of the los animos fiveleague surveya grant made by king philip of spain  by doing this we did not need to have the line run out by a surveyor it was a great saving of expense and time  so lee rundle and i fitted out a twohorse wagon team with all the accessories and drove a hundred and fortynine miles to chico the nearest town to the point we wished to reach there we picked up a deputy county surveyor he found the corner of the los animos survey for us ran out the five thousand seven hundred and twenty varas west that our sketch called for laid a stone on the spot had coffee and bacon and caught the mailstage back to chico  i was pretty sure we would get that three hundred thousand dollars lee rundles was to be only onethird because i was paying all the expenses with that two hundred thousand dollars i knew i could find may martha mangum if she was on earth and with it i could flutter the butterflies in old man mangums dovecot too if i could find that treasure  but lee and i established camp across the river were a dozen little mountains densely covered by cedarbrakes but not one shaped like a packsaddle that did not deter us appearances are deceptive a packsaddle like beauty may exist only in the eye of the beholder  i and the grandson of the treasure examined those cedarcovered hills with the care of a lady hunting for the wicked flea we explored every side top circumference mean elevation angle slope and concavity of every one for two miles up and down the river we spent four days doing so then we hitched up the roan and the dun and hauled the remains of the coffee and bacon the one hundred and fortynine miles back to concho city  lee rundle chewed much tobacco on the return trip i was busy driving because i was in a hurry  as shortly as could be after our empty return goodloe banks and i forgathered in the back room of snyders saloon to play dominoes and fish for information i told goodloe about my expedition after the buried treasure  if i could have found that three hundred thousand dollars i said to him i could have scoured and sifted the surface of the earth to find may martha mangum  she is meant for higher things said goodloe i shall find her myself but tell me how you went about discovering the spot where this unearthed increment was imprudently buried  i told him in the smallest detail i showed him the draughtsmans sketch with the distances marked plainly upon it  after glancing over it in a masterly way he leaned back in his chair and bestowed upon me an explosion of sardonic superior collegiate laughter  well you are a fool jim he said when he could speak  its your play said i patiently fingering my doublesix  twenty said goodloe making two crosses on the table with his chalk  why am i a fool i asked buried treasure has been found before in many places  because said he in calculating the point on the river where your line would strike you neglected to allow for the variation the variation there would be nine degrees west let me have your pencil  goodloe banks figured rapidly on the back of an envelope  the distance from north to south of the line run from the spanish mission said he is exactly twentytwo miles it was run by a pocketcompass according to your story allowing for the variation the point on the alamito river where you should have searched for your treasure is exactly six miles and nine hundred and fortyfive varas farther west than the place you hit upon oh what a fool you are jim  what is this variation that you speak of i asked i thought figures never lied  the variation of the magnetic compass said goodloe from the true meridian  he smiled in his superior way and then i saw come out in his face the singular eager consuming cupidity of the seeker after buried treasure  sometimes he said with the air of the oracle these old traditions of hidden money are not without foundation suppose you let me look over that paper describing the location perhaps together we might  the result was that goodloe banks and i rivals in love became companions in adventure we went to chico by stage from huntersburg the nearest railroad town in chico we hired a team drawing a covered springwagon and camping paraphernalia we had the same surveyor run out our distance as revised by goodloe and his variations and then dismissed him and sent him on his homeward road  it was night when we arrived i fed the horses and made a fire near the bank of the river and cooked supper goodloe would have helped but his education had not fitted him for practical things  but while i worked he cheered me with the expression of great thoughts handed down from the dead ones of old he quoted some translations from the greek at much length  anacreon he explained that was a favorite passage with miss mangumas i recited it  she is meant for higher things said i repeating his phrase  can there be anything higher asked goodloe than to dwell in the society of the classics to live in the atmosphere of learning and culture you have often decried education what of your wasted efforts through your ignorance of simple mathematics how soon would you have found your treasure if my knowledge had not shown you your error  well take a look at those hills across the river first said i and see what we find i am still doubtful about variations i have been brought up to believe that the needle is true to the pole  the next morning was a bright june one we were up early and had breakfast goodloe was charmed he recitedkeats i think it was and kelly or shelleywhile i broiled the bacon we were getting ready to cross the river which was little more than a shallow creek there and explore the many sharppeaked cedarcovered hills on the other side  my good ulysses said goodloe slapping me on the shoulder while i was washing the tin breakfastplates let me see the enchanted document once more i believe it gives directions for climbing the hill shaped like a packsaddle i never saw a packsaddle what is it like jim  score one against culture said i ill know it when i see it  goodloe was looking at old rundles document when he ripped out a most uncollegiate swearword  come here he said holding the paper up against the sunlight look at that he said laying his finger against it  on the blue papera thing i had never noticed beforei saw stand out in white letters the word and figures malvern 1898  what about it i asked  its the watermark said goodloe the paper was manufactured in 1898 the writing on the paper is dated 1863 this is a palpable fraud  oh i dont know said i the rundles are pretty reliable plain uneducated country people maybe the paper manufacturers tried to perpetrate a swindle  and then goodloe banks went as wild as his education permitted he dropped the glasses off his nose and glared at me  ive often told you you were a fool he said you have let yourself be imposed upon by a clodhopper and you have imposed upon me  how i asked have i imposed upon you  by your ignorance said he twice i have discovered serious flaws in your plans that a commonschool education should have enabled you to avoid and he continued i have been put to expense that i could ill afford in pursuing this swindling quest i am done with it  i rose and pointed a large pewter spoon at him fresh from the dishwater  goodloe banks i said i care not one parboiled navy bean for your education i always barely tolerated it in any one and i despised it in you what has your learning done for you it is a curse to yourself and a bore to your friends away i saidaway with your watermarks and variations they are nothing to me they shall not deflect me from the quest  i pointed with my spoon across the river to a small mountain shaped like a packsaddle  i am going to search that mountain i went on for the treasure decide now whether you are in it or not if you wish to let a watermark or a variation shake your soul you are no true adventurer decide  a white cloud of dust began to rise far down the river road it was the mailwagon from hesperus to chico goodloe flagged it  i am done with the swindle said he sourly no one but a fool would pay any attention to that paper now well you always were a fool jim i leave you to your fate  he gathered his personal traps climbed into the mailwagon adjusted his glasses nervously and flew away in a cloud of dust  after i had washed the dishes and staked the horses on new grass i crossed the shallow river and made my way slowly through the cedarbrakes up to the top of the hill shaped like a packsaddle  it was a wonderful june day never in my life had i seen so many birds so many butterflies dragonflies grasshoppers and such winged and stinged beasts of the air and fields  i investigated the hill shaped like a packsaddle from base to summit i found an absolute absence of signs relating to buried treasure there was no pile of stones no ancient blazes on the trees none of the evidences of the three hundred thousand dollars as set forth in the document of old man rundle  i came down the hill in the cool of the afternoon suddenly out of the cedarbrake i stepped into a beautiful green valley where a tributary small stream ran into the alamito river    and there i was startled to see what i took to be a wild man with unkempt beard and ragged hair pursuing a giant butterfly with brilliant wings  perhaps he is an escaped madman i thought and wondered how he had strayed so far from seats of education and learning  and then i took a few more steps and saw a vinecovered cottage near the small stream and in a little grassy glade i saw may martha mangum plucking wild flowers  she straightened up and looked at me for the first time since i knew her i saw her facewhich was the color of the white keys of a new pianoturn pink i walked toward her without a word she let the gathered flowers trickle slowly from her hand to the grass  i knew you would come jim she said clearly father wouldnt let me write but i knew you would come  what followed you may guessthere was my wagon and team just across the river    ive often wondered what good too much education is to a man if he cant use it for himself if all the benefits of it are to go to others where does it come in  for may martha mangum abides with me there is an eightroom house in a liveoak grove and a piano with an automatic player and a good start toward the three thousand head of cattle is under fence  and when i ride home at night my pipe and slippers are put away in places where they cannot be found  but who cares for that who careswho cares     to him who waits   the hermit of the hudson was hustling about his cave with unusual animation  the cave was on or in the top of a little spur of the catskills that had strayed down to the rivers edge and not having a ferry ticket had to stop there the bijou mountains were densely wooded and were infested by ferocious squirrels and woodpeckers that forever menaced the summer transients like a badly sewn strip of white braid a macadamized road ran between the green skirt of the hills and the foamy lace of the rivers edge a dim path wound from the comfortable road up a rocky height to the hermits cave one mile upstream was the viewpoint inn to which summer folk from the city came leaving cool electricfanned apartments that they might be driven about in burning sunshine shrieking in gasoline launches by spindlelegged modreds bearing the blankest of shields  train your lorgnette upon the hermit and let your eye receive the personal touch that shall endear you to the hero  a man of forty judging him fairly with long hair curling at the ends dramatic eyes and a forked brown beard like those that were imposed upon the west some years ago by selfappointed divine healers who succeeded the grasshopper crop his outward vesture appeared to be kind of gunnysacking cut and made into a garment that would have made the fortune of a london tailor his long wellshaped fingers delicate nose and poise of manner raised him high above the class of hermits who fear water and bury money in oystercans in their caves in spots indicated by rude crosses chipped in the stone wall above  the hermits home was not altogether a cave the cave was an addition to the hermitage which was a rude hut made of poles daubed with clay and covered with the best quality of rustproof zinc roofing  in the house proper there were stone slabs for seats a rustic bookcase made of unplaned poplar planks and a table formed of a wooden slab laid across two upright pieces of granitesomething between the furniture of a druid temple and that of a broadway beefsteak dungeon hung against the walls were skins of wild animals purchased in the vicinity of eighth street and university place new york  the rear of the cabin merged into the cave there the hermit cooked his meals on a rude stone hearth with infinite patience and an old axe he had chopped natural shelves in the rocky walls on them stood his stores of flour bacon lard talcumpowder kerosene bakingpowder sodamint tablets pepper salt and olivocremo emulsion for chaps and roughness of the hands and face  the hermit had hermited there for ten years he was an asset of the viewpoint inn to its guests he was second in interest only to the mysterious echo in the haunted glen and the lovers leap beat him only a few inches flatfooted he was known far but not very wide on account of the topography as a scholar of brilliant intellect who had forsworn the world because he had been jilted in a love affair every saturday night the viewpoint inn sent to him surreptitiously a basket of provisions he never left the immediate outskirts of his hermitage guests of the inn who visited him said his store of knowledge wit and scintillating philosophy were simply wonderful you know  that summer the viewpoint inn was crowded with guests so on saturday nights there were extra cans of tomatoes and sirloin steak instead of rounds in the hermits basket  now you have the material allegations in the case so make way for romance  evidently the hermit expected a visitor he carefully combed his long hair and parted his apostolic beard when the ninetyeightcent alarmclock on a stone shelf announced the hour of five he picked up his gunnysacking skirts brushed them carefully gathered an oaken staff and strolled slowly into the thick woods that surrounded the hermitage  he had not long to wait up the faint pathway slippery with its carpet of pineneedles toiled beatrix youngest and fairest of the famous trenholme sisters she was all in blue from hat to canvas pumps varying in tint from the shade of the tinkle of a bluebell at daybreak on a spring saturday to the deep hue of a monday morning at nine when the washerwoman has failed to show up  beatrix dug her cerulean parasol deep into the pineneedles and sighed the hermit on the q t removed a grass burr from the ankle of one sandalled foot with the big toe of his other one she bluedand almost starched and ironed himwith her cobalt eyes  it must be so nice she said in little tremulous gasps to be a hermit and have ladies climb mountains to talk to you  the hermit folded his arms and leaned against a tree beatrix with a sigh settled down upon the mat of pineneedles like a bluebird upon her nest the hermit followed suit drawing his feet rather awkwardly under his gunnysacking  it must be nice to be a mountain said he with ponderous lightness and have angels in blue climb up you instead of flying over you  mamma had neuralgia said beatrix and went to bed or i couldnt have come its dreadfully hot at that horrid old inn but we hadnt the money to go anywhere else this summer  last night said the hermit i climbed to the top of that big rock above us i could see the lights of the inn and hear a strain or two of the music when the wind was right i imagined you moving gracefully in the arms of others to the dreamy music of the waltz amid the fragrance of flowers think how lonely i must have been  the youngest handsomest and poorest of the famous trenholme sisters sighed  you havent quite hit it she said plaintively i was moving gracefully at the arms of another mamma had one of her periodical attacks of rheumatism in both elbows and shoulders and i had to rub them for an hour with that horrid old liniment i hope you didnt think that smelled like flowers you know there were some west point boys and a yacht load of young men from the city at last evenings weekly dance ive known mamma to sit by an open window for three hours with onehalf of her registering 85 degrees and the other half frostbitten and never sneeze once but just let a bunch of ineligibles come around where i am and shell begin to swell at the knuckles and shriek with pain and i have to take her to her room and rub her arms to see mamma dressed youd be surprised to know the number of square inches of surface there are to her arms i think it must be delightful to be a hermit thatcassockor gabardine isnt itthat you wear is so becoming do you make itor themof course you must have changesyourself and what a blessed relief it must be to wear sandals instead of shoes think how we must sufferno matter how small i buy my shoes they always pinch my toes oh why cant there be lady hermits too  the beautifulest and most adolescent trenholme sister extended two slender blue ankles that ended in two enormous bluesilk bows that almost concealed two fairy oxfords also of one of the fortyseven shades of blue the hermit as if impelled by a kind of reflextelepathic action drew his bare toes farther beneath his gunnysacking  i have heard about the romance of your life said miss trenholme softly they have it printed on the back of the menu card at the inn was she very beautiful and charming  on the bills of fare muttered the hermit but what do i care for the worlds babble yes she was of the highest and grandest type then he continued then i thought the world could never contain another equal to her so i forsook it and repaired to this mountain fastness to spend the remainder of my life aloneto devote and dedicate my remaining years to her memory  its grand said miss trenholme absolutely grand i think a hermits life is the ideal one no billcollectors calling no dressing for dinnerhow id like to be one but theres no such luck for me if i dont marry this season i honestly believe mamma will force me into settlement work or trimming hats it isnt because im getting old or ugly but we havent enough money left to butt in at any of the swell places any more and i dont want to marryunless its somebody i like thats why id like to be a hermit hermits dont ever marry do they  hundreds of em said the hermit when theyve found the right one  but theyre hermits said the youngest and beautifulest because theyve lost the right one arent they  because they think they have answered the recluse fatuously wisdom comes to one in a mountain cave as well as to one in the world of swells as i believe they are called in the argot  when one of the swells brings it to them said miss trenholme and my folks are swells thats the trouble but there are so many swells at the seashore in the summertime that we hardly amount to more than ripples so weve had to put all our money into river and harbor appropriations we were all girls you know there were four of us im the only surviving one the others have been married off all to money mamma is so proud of my sisters they send her the loveliest penwipers and art calendars every christmas im the only one on the market now im forbidden to look at any one who hasnt money  but began the hermit  but oh said the beautifulest of course hermits have great pots of gold and doubloons buried somewhere near three great oaktrees they all have  i have not said the hermit regretfully  im so sorry said miss trenholme i always thought they had i think i must go now  oh beyond question she was the beautifulest  fair lady began the hermit  i am beatrix trenholmesome call me trix she said you must come to the inn to see me  i havent been a stonesthrow from my cave in ten years said the hermit  you must come to see me there she repeated any evening except thursday  the hermit smiled weakly  goodbye she said gathering the folds of her paleblue skirt i shall expect you but not on thursday evening remember  what an interest it would give to the future menu cards of the viewpoint inn to have these printed lines added to them only once during the more than ten years of his lonely existence did the mountain hermit leave his famous cave that was when he was irresistibly drawn to the inn by the fascinations of miss beatrix trenholme youngest and most beautiful of the celebrated trenholme sisters whose brilliant marriage to  aye to whom  the hermit walked back to the hermitage at the door stood bob binkley his old friend and companion of the days before he had renounced the worldbob himself arrayed like the orchids of the greenhouse in the summer mans polychromatic garbbob the millionaire with his fat firm smooth shrewd face his diamond rings sparkling fobchain and pleated bosom he was two years older than the hermit and looked five years younger  youre hamp ellison in spite of those whiskers and that goingaway bathrobe he shouted i read about you on the bill of fare at the inn theyve run your biography in between the cheese and not responsible for coats and umbrellas what d you do it for hamp and ten years toogee whilikins  youre just the same said the hermit come in and sit down sit on that limestone rock over there its softer than the granite  i cant understand it old man said binkley i can see how you could give up a woman for ten years but not ten years for a woman of course i know why you did it everybody does edith carr she jilted four or five besides you but you were the only one who took to a hole in the ground the others had recourse to whiskey the klondike politics and that similia similibus cure but sayhamp edith carr was just about the finest woman in the worldhightoned and proud and noble and playing her ideals to win at all kinds of odds she certainly was a crackerjack  after i renounced the world said the hermit i never heard of her again  she married me said binkley  the hermit leaned against the wooden walls of his antecave and wriggled his toes  i know how you feel about it said binkley what else could she do there were her four sisters and her mother and old man carryou remember how he put all the money he had into dirigible balloons well everything was coming down and nothing going up with em as you might say well i know edith as well as you doalthough i married her i was worth a million then but ive run it up since to between five and six it wasnt me she wanted as much aswell it was about like this she had that bunch on her hands and they had to be taken care of edith married me two months after you did the groundsquirrel act i thought she liked me too at the time  and now inquired the recluse  were better friends than ever now she got a divorce from me two years ago just incompatibility i didnt put in any defence well well well hamp this is certainly a funny dugout youve built here but you always were a hero of fiction seems like youd have been the very one to strike ediths fancy maybe you didbut its the bankroll that catches em my boyyour caves and whiskers wont do it honestly hamp dont you think youve been a darned fool  the hermit smiled behind his tangled beard he was and always had been so superior to the crude and mercenary binkley that even his vulgarities could not anger him moreover his studies and meditations in his retreat had raised him far above the little vanities of the world his little mountainside had been almost an olympus over the edge of which he saw smiling the bolts hurled in the valleys of man below had his ten years of renunciation of thought of devotion to an ideal of living scorn of a sordid world been in vain up from the world had come to him the youngest and beautifulestfairer than edithone and threeseventh times lovelier than the sevenyearsserved rachel so the hermit smiled in his beard  when binkley had relieved the hermitage from the blot of his presence and the first faint star showed above the pines the hermit got the can of bakingpowder from his cupboard he still smiled behind his beard  there was a slight rustle in the doorway there stood edith carr with all the added beauty and stateliness and noble bearing that ten years had brought her  she was never one to chatter she looked at the hermit with her large thinking dark eyes the hermit stood still surprised into a pose as motionless as her own only his subconscious sense of the fitness of things caused him to turn the bakingpowder can slowly in his hands until its red label was hidden against his bosom  i am stopping at the inn said edith in low but clear tones i heard of you there i told myself that i must see you i want to ask your forgiveness i sold my happiness for money there were others to be provided forbut that does not excuse me i just wanted to see you and ask your forgiveness you have lived here ten years they tell me cherishing my memory i was blind hampton i could not see then that all the money in the world cannot weigh in the scales against a faithful heart ifbut it is too late now of course  her assertion was a question clothed as best it could be in a loving womans pride but through the thin disguise the hermit saw easily that his lady had come back to himif he chose he had won a golden crownif it pleased him to take it the reward of his decade of faithfulness was ready for his handif he desired to stretch it forth  for the space of one minute the old enchantment shone upon him with a reflected radiance and then by turns he felt the manly sensations of indignation at having been discarded and of repugnance at having beenas it weresought again and last of allhow strange that it should have come at lastthe paleblue vision of the beautifulest of the trenholme sisters illuminated his minds eye and left him without a waver  it is too late he said in deep tones pressing the bakingpowder can against his heart  once she turned after she had gone slowly twenty yards down the path the hermit had begun to twist the lid off his can but he hid it again under his sacking robe he could see her great eyes shining sadly through the twilight but he stood inflexible in the doorway of his shack and made no sign    just as the moon rose on thursday evening the hermit was seized by the worldmadness  up from the inn fainter than the horns of elfland came now and then a few bars of music played by the casino band the hudson was broadened by the night into an illimitable seathose lights dimly seen on its opposite shore were not beacons for prosaic trolleylines but lowset stars millions of miles away the waters in front of the inn were gay with firefliesor were they motorboats smelling of gasoline and oil once the hermit had known these things and had sported with amaryllis in the shade of the redandwhitestriped awnings but for ten years he had turned a heedless ear to these faroff echoes of a frivolous world but tonight there was something wrong  the casino band was playing a waltza waltz what a fool he had been to tear deliberately ten years of his life from the calendar of existence for one who had given him up for the false joys that wealthtum ti tum ti tum tihow did that waltz go butthose years had not been sacrificedhad they not brought him the star and pearl of all the world the youngest and beautifulest of  but do not come on thursday evening she had insisted perhaps by now she would be moving slowly and gracefully to the strains of that waltz held closely by westpointers or city commuters while he who had read in her eyes things that had recompensed him for ten lost years of life moped like some wild animal in its mountain den why should  damn it said the hermit suddenly ill do it  he threw down his marcus aurelius and threw off his gunnysack toga he dragged a dustcovered trunk from a corner of the cave and with difficulty wrenched open its lid  candles he had in plenty and the cave was soon aglow clothesten years old in cutscissors razors hats shoes all his discarded attire and belongings were dragged ruthlessly from their renunciatory rest and strewn about in painful disorder  a pair of scissors soon reduced his beard sufficiently for the dulled razors to perform approximately their office cutting his own hair was beyond the hermits skill so he only combed and brushed it backward as smoothly as he could charity forbids us to consider the heartburnings and exertions of one so long removed from haberdashery and society  at the last the hermit went to an inner corner of his cave and began to dig in the soft earth with a long iron spoon out of the cavity he thus made he drew a tin can and out of the can three thousand dollars in bills tightly rolled and wrapped in oiled silk he was a real hermit as this may assure you  you may take a brief look at him as he hastens down the little mountainside a long wrinkled black frockcoat reached to his calves white duck trousers unacquainted with the tailors goose a pink shirt white standing collar with brilliant blue butterfly tie and buttoned congress gaiters but think sir and madamten years from beneath a narrowbrimmed straw hat with a striped band flowed his hair seeing him with all your shrewdness you could not have guessed him you would have said that he played hamletor the tubaor pinochleyou would never have laid your hand on your heart and said he is a hermit who lived ten years in a cave for love of one ladyto win another  the dancing pavilion extended above the waters of the river gay lanterns and frosted electric globes shed a soft glamour within it a hundred ladies and gentlemen from the inn and summer cottages flitted in and about it to the left of the dusty roadway down which the hermit had tramped were the inn and grillroom something seemed to be on there too the windows were brilliantly lighted and music was playingmusic different from the twosteps and waltzes of the casino band  a negro man wearing a white jacket came through the iron gate with its immense granite posts and wroughtiron lampholders  what is going on here tonight asked the hermit  well sah said the servitor dey is having de reglar thursdayevenin dance in de casino and in de grillroom deres a beefsteak dinner sah  the hermit glanced up at the inn on the hillside whence burst suddenly a triumphant strain of splendid harmony  and up there said he they are playing mendelssohnwhat is going on up there  up in de inn said the dusky one dey is a weddin goin on mr binkley a mighty rich man am marryin miss trenholme sahde young lady who am quite de belle of de place sah     he also serves    if i could have a thousand yearsjust one little thousand yearsmore of life i might in that time draw near enough to true romance to touch the hem of her robe  up from ships men come and from waste places and forest and road and garret and cellar to maunder to me in strangely distributed words of the things they have seen and considered the recording of their tales is no more than a matter of ears and fingers there are only two fates i dreaddeafness and writers cramp the hand is yet steady let the ear bear the blame if these printed words be not in the order they were delivered to me by hunky magee true campfollower of fortune  biography shall claim you but an instanti first knew hunky when he was headwaiter at chubbs little beefsteak restaurant and café on third avenue there was only one waiter besides  then successively i caromed against him in the little streets of the big city after his trip to alaska his voyage as cook with a treasureseeking expedition to the caribbean and his failure as a pearlfisher in the arkansas river between these dashes into the land of adventure he usually came back to chubbs for a while chubbs was a port for him when gales blew too high but when you dined there and hunky went for your steak you never knew whether he would come to anchor in the kitchen or in the malayan archipelago you wouldnt care for his descriptionhe was soft of voice and hard of face and rarely had to use more than one eye to quell any approach to a disturbance among chubbs customers  one night i found hunky standing at a corner of twentythird street and third avenue after an absence of several months in ten minutes we had a little round table between us in a quiet corner and my ears began to get busy i leave out my sly ruses and feints to draw hunkys wordofmouth blowsit all came to something like this  speaking of the next election said hunky did you ever know much about indians no i dont mean the cooper beadle cigarstore or laughing water kindi mean the modern indianthe kind that takes greek prizes in colleges and scalps the halfback on the other side in football games the kind that eats macaroons and tea in the afternoons with the daughter of the professor of biology and fills up on grasshoppers and fried rattlesnake when they get back to the ancestral wickiup  well they aint so bad i like em better than most foreigners that have come over in the last few hundred years one thing about the indian is this when he mixes with the white race he swaps all his own vices for them of the palefacesand he retains all his own virtues well his virtues are enough to call out the reserves whenever he lets em loose but the imported foreigners adopt our virtues and keep their own vicesand its going to take our whole standing army some day to police that gang  but let me tell you about the trip i took to mexico with high jack snakefeeder a cherokee twice removed a graduate of a pennsylvania college and the latest thing in pointedtoed rubberheeled patent kid moccasins and madras huntingshirt with turnedback cuffs he was a friend of mine i met him in tahlequah when i was out there during the land boom and we got thick he had got all there was out of colleges and had come back to lead his people out of egypt he was a man of firstclass style and wrote essays and had been invited to visit rich guys houses in boston and such places  there was a cherokee girl in muscogee that high jack was foolish about he took me to see her a few times her name was florence blue featherbut you want to clear your mind of all ideas of squaws with noserings and army blankets this young lady was whiter than you are and better educated than i ever was you couldnt have told her from any of the girls shopping in the swell third avenue stores i liked her so well that i got to calling on her now and then when high jack wasnt along which is the way of friends in such matters she was educated at the muscogee college and was making a specialty oflets seeethyes ethnology thats the art that goes back and traces the descent of different races of people leading up from jellyfish through monkeys and to the obriens high jack had took up that line too and had read papers about it before all kinds of riotous assemblieschautauquas and choctaws and chowderparties and such having a mutual taste for musty information like that was what made em like each other i suppose but i dont know what they call congeniality of tastes aint always it now when miss blue feather and me was talking together i listened to her affidavits about the first families of the land of nod being cousins german well if the germans dont nod who does to the moundbuilders of ohio with incomprehension and respect and when id tell her about the bowery and coney island and sing her a few songs that id heard the jamaica niggers sing at their church lawnparties she didnt look much less interested than she did when high jack would tell her that he had a pipe that the first inhabitants of america originally arrived here on stilts after a freshet at tenafly new jersey  but i was going to tell you more about high jack  about six months ago i get a letter from him saying hed been commissioned by the minority report bureau of ethnology at washington to go down to mexico and translate some excavations or dig up the meaning of some shorthand notes on some ruinsor something of that sort and if id go along he could squeeze the price into the expense account  well id been holding a napkin over my arm at chubbs about long enough then so i wired high jack yes and he sent me a ticket and i met him in washington and he had a lot of news to tell me first of all was that florence blue feather had suddenly disappeared from her home and environments  run away i asked  vanished says high jack disappeared like your shadow when the sun goes under a cloud she was seen on the street and then she turned a corner and nobody ever seen her afterward the whole community turned out to look for her but we never found a clew  thats badthats bad says i she was a mighty nice girl and as smart as you find em  high jack seemed to take it hard i guess he must have esteemed miss blue feather quite highly i could see that hed referred the matter to the whiskeyjug that was his weak pointand many another mans ive noticed that when a man loses a girl he generally takes to drink either just before or just after it happens  from washington we railroaded it to new orleans and there took a tramp steamer bound for belize and a gale pounded us all down the caribbean and nearly wrecked us on the yucatan coast opposite a little town without a harbor called boca de coacoyula suppose the ship had run against that name in the dark  better fifty years of europe than a cyclone in the bay says high jack snakefeeder so we get the captain to send us ashore in a dory when the squall seemed to cease from squalling  we will find ruins here or make em says high the government doesnt care which we do an appropriation is an appropriation  boca de coacoyula was a dead town them biblical towns we read abouttired and siphonafter they was destroyed they must have looked like fortysecond street and broadway compared to this boca place it still claimed 1300 inhabitants as estimated and engraved on the stone courthouse by the censustaker in 1597 the citizens were a mixture of indians and other indians but some of em was lightcolored which i was surprised to see the town was huddled up on the shore with woods so thick around it that a subpoenaserver couldnt have reached a monkey ten yards away with the papers we wondered what kept it from being annexed to kansas but we soon found out that it was major bing  major bing was the ointment around the fly he had the cochineal sarsaparilla logwood annatto hemp and all other dyewoods and pure food adulteration concessions cornered he had fivesixths of the boca de thingamajiggers working for him on shares it was a beautiful graft we used to brag about morgan and e h and others of our wisest when i was in the provincesbut now no more that peninsula has got our little country turned into a submarine without even the observation tower showing  major bings idea was this he had the population go forth into the forest and gather these products when they brought em in he gave em onefifth for their trouble sometimes theyd strike and demand a sixth the major always gave in to em  the major had a bungalow so close on the sea that the nineinch tide seeped through the cracks in the kitchen floor me and him and high jack snakefeeder sat on the porch and drank rum from noon till midnight he said he had piled up 300000 in new orleans banks and high and me could stay with him forever if we would but high jack happened to think of the united states and began to talk ethnology  ruins says major bing the woods are full of em i dont know how far they date back but they was here before i came  high jack asks what form of worship the citizens of that locality are addicted to  why says the major rubbing his nose i cant hardly say i imagine its infidel or aztec or nonconformist or something like that theres a church herea methodist or some other kindwith a parson named skidder he claims to have converted the people to christianity he and me dont assimilate except on state occasions i imagine they worship some kind of gods or idols yet but skidder says he has em in the fold  a few days later high jack and me prowling around strikes a plain path into the forest and follows it a good four miles then a branch turns to the left we go a mile maybe down that and run up against the finest ruin you ever sawsolid stone with trees and vines and underbrush all growing up against it and in it and through it all over it was chiselled carvings of funny beasts and people that would have been arrested if theyd ever come out in vaudeville that way we approached it from the rear  high jack had been drinking too much rum ever since we landed in boca you know how an indian isthe palefaces fixed his clock when they introduced him to firewater hed brought a quart along with him  hunky says he well explore the ancient temple it may be that the storm that landed us here was propitious the minority report bureau of ethnology says he may yet profit by the vagaries of wind and tide  we went in the rear door of the bum edifice we struck a kind of alcove without bath there was a granite davenport and a stone washstand without any soap or exit for the water and some hardwood pegs drove into holes in the wall and that was all to go out of that furnished apartment into a harlem hall bedroom would make you feel like getting back home from an amateur violoncello solo at an east side settlement house  while high was examining some hieroglyphics on the wall that the stonemasons must have made when their tools slipped i stepped into the front room that was at least thirty by fifty feet stone floor six little windows like square portholes that didnt let much light in  i looked back over my shoulder and sees high jacks face three feet away  high says i of all the  and then i noticed he looked funny and i turned around  hed taken off his clothes to the waist and he didnt seem to hear me i touched him and came near beating it high jack had turned to stone i had been drinking some rum myself  ossified i says to him loudly i knew what would happen if you kept it up  and then high jack comes in from the alcove when he hears me conversing with nobody and we have a look at mr snakefeeder no 2 its a stone idol or god or revised statute or something and it looks as much like high jack as one green pea looks like itself its got exactly his face and size and color but its steadier on its pins it stands on a kind of rostrum or pedestal and you can see its been there ten million years  hes a cousin of mine sings high and then he turns solemn  hunky he says putting one hand on my shoulder and one on the statues im in the holy temple of my ancestors  well if looks goes for anything says i youve struck a twin stand side by side with buddy and lets see if theres any difference  there wasnt you know an indian can keep his face as still as an iron dogs when he wants to so when high jack froze his features you couldnt have told him from the other one  theres some letters says i on his nobs pedestal but i cant make em out the alphabet of this country seems to be composed of sometimes a e i o and u but generally zs ls and ts  high jacks ethnology gets the upper hand of his rum for a minute and he investigates the inscription  hunky says he this is a statue of tlotopaxl one of the most powerful gods of the ancient aztecs  glad to know him says i but in his present condition he reminds me of the joke shakespeare got off on julius cæsar we might say about your friend      imperious whatshisname dead and turned to stone      no use to write or call him on the phone   hunky says high jack snakefeeder looking at me funny do you believe in reincarnation  it sounds to me says i like either a cleanup of the slaughterhouses or a new kind of boston pink i dont know  i believe says he that i am the reincarnation of tlotopaxl my researches have convinced me that the cherokees of all the north american tribes can boast of the straightest descent from the proud aztec race that says he was a favorite theory of mine and florence blue feathers and shewhat if she  high jack grabs my arm and walls his eyes at me just then he looked more like his eminent coindian murderer crazy horse  well says i what if she what if she what if she youre drunk says i impersonating idols and believing inwhat was itrecarnalization lets have a drink says i its as spooky here as a brooklyn artificiallimb factory at midnight with the gas turned down  just then i heard somebody coming and i dragged high jack into the bedless bedchamber there was peepholes bored through the wall so we could see the whole front part of the temple major bing told me afterward that the ancient priests in charge used to rubber through them at the congregation  in a few minutes an old indian woman came in with a big oval earthen dish full of grub she set it on a square block of stone in front of the graven image and laid down and walloped her face on the floor a few times and then took a walk for herself  high jack and me was hungry so we came out and looked it over there was goat steaks and fried ricecakes and plantains and cassava and broiled landcrabs and mangoesnothing like what you get at chubbs  we ate heartyand had another round of rum  it must be old tecumsehsor whatever you call himbirthday says i or do they feed him every day i thought gods only drank vanilla on mount catawampus  then some more native parties in short kimonos that showed their aboriginees punctured the nearhorizon and me and high had to skip back into father axletrees private boudoir they came by ones twos and threes and left all sorts of offeringsthere was enough grub for binghams nine gods of war with plenty left over for the peace conference at the hague they brought jars of honey and bunches of bananas and bottles of wine and stacks of tortillas and beautiful shawls worth one hundred dollars apiece that the indian women weave of a kind of vegetable fibre like silk all of em got down and wriggled on the floor in front of that hardfinish god and then sneaked off through the woods again  i wonder who gets this rakeoff remarks high jack  oh says i theres priests or deputy idols or a committee of disarrangements somewhere in the woods on the job wherever you find a god youll find somebody waiting to take charge of the burnt offerings  and then we took another swig of rum and walked out to the parlor front door to cool off for it was as hot inside as a summer camp on the palisades  and while we stood there in the breeze we looks down the path and sees a young lady approaching the blasted ruin she was barefooted and had on a white robe and carried a wreath of white flowers in her hand when she got nearer we saw she had a long blue feather stuck through her black hair and when she got nearer still me and high jack snakefeeder grabbed each other to keep from tumbling down on the floor for the girls face was as much like florence blue feathers as his was like old king toxicologys  and then was when high jacks booze drowned his system of ethnology he dragged me inside back of the statue and says  lay hold of it hunky well pack it into the other room i felt it all the time says he im the reconsideration of the god locomotorataxia and florence blue feather was my bride a thousand years ago she has come to seek me in the temple where i used to reign  all right says i theres no use arguing against the rum question you take his feet  we lifted the threehundredpound stone god and carried him into the back room of the caféthe temple i meanand leaned him against the wall it was more work than bouncing three live ones from an allnight broadway joint on newyears eve  then high jack ran out and brought in a couple of them indian silk shawls and began to undress himself  oh figs says i is it thus strong drink is an adder and subtractor too is it the heat or the call of the wild thats got you  but high jack is too full of exaltation and canejuice to reply he stops the disrobing business just short of the manhattan beach rules and then winds them redandwhite shawls around him and goes out and stands on the pedestal as steady as any platinum deity you ever saw and i looks through a peekhole to see what he is up to  in a few minutes in comes the girl with the flower wreath danged if i wasnt knocked a little silly when she got close she looked so exactly much like florence blue feather i wonder says i to myself if she has been reincarcerated too if i could see says i to myself whether she has a mole on her left but the next minute i thought she looked oneeighth of a shade darker than florence but she looked good at that and high jack hadnt drunk all the rum that had been drank  the girl went up within ten feet of the bum idol and got down and massaged her nose with the floor like the rest did then she went nearer and laid the flower wreath on the block of stone at high jacks feet rummy as i was i thought it was kind of nice of her to think of offering flowers instead of household and kitchen provisions even a stone god ought to appreciate a little sentiment like that on top of the fancy groceries they had piled up in front of him  and then high jack steps down from his pedestal quiet and mentions a few words that sounded just like the hieroglyphics carved on the walls of the ruin the girl gives a little jump backward and her eyes fly open as big as doughnuts but she dont beat it  why didnt she ill tell you why i think why it dont seem to a girl so supernatural unlikely strange and startling that a stone god should come to life for her if he was to do it for one of them snubnosed brown girls on the other side of the woods now it would be differentbut her ill bet she said to herself well goodness me youve been a long time getting on your job ive half a mind not to speak to you  but she and high jack holds hands and walks away out of the temple together by the time id had time to take another drink and enter upon the scene they was twenty yards away going up the path in the woods that the girl had come down with the natural scenery already in place it was just like a play to watch emshe looking up at him and him giving her back the best that an indian can hand out in the way of a googoo eye but there wasnt anything in that recarnification and revulsion to tintype for me  hey injun i yells out to high jack weve got a boardbill due in town and youre leaving me without a cent brace up and cut out the neapolitan fishermaiden and lets go back home  but on the two goes without looking once back until as you might say the forest swallowed em up and i never saw or heard of high jack snakefeeder from that day to this i dont know if the cherokees came from the aspics but if they did one of em went back  all i could do was to hustle back to that boca place and panhandle major bing he detached himself from enough of his winnings to buy me a ticket home and im back again on the job at chubbs sir and im going to hold it steady come round and youll find the steaks as good as ever  i wondered what hunky magee thought about his own story so i asked him if he had any theories about reincarnation and transmogrification and such mysteries as he had touched upon  nothing like that said hunky positively what ailed high jack was too much booze and education theyll do an indian up every time  but what about miss blue feather i persisted  say said hunky with a grin that little lady that stole high jack certainly did give me a jar when i first took a look at her but it was only for a minute you remember i told you high jack said that miss florence blue feather disappeared from home about a year ago well where she landed four days later was in as neat a fiveroom flat on east twentythird street as you ever walked sideways throughand shes been mrs magee ever since     the moment of victory   ben granger is a war veteran aged twentyninewhich should enable you to guess the war he is also principal merchant and postmaster of cadiz a little town over which the breezes from the gulf of mexico perpetually blow  ben helped to hurl the don from his stronghold in the greater antilles and then hiking across half the world he marched as a corporalusher up and down the blazing tropic aisles of the openair college in which the filipino was schooled now with his bayonet beaten into a cheeseslicer he rallies his corporals guard of cronies in the shade of his wellwhittled porch instead of in the matted jungles of mindanao always have his interest and choice been for deeds rather than for words but the consideration and digestion of motives is not beyond him as this story which is his will attest  what is it he asked me one moonlit eve as we sat among his boxes and barrels that generally makes men go through dangers and fire and trouble and starvation and battle and such recourses what does a man do it for why does he try to outdo his fellowhumans and be braver and stronger and more daring and showy than even his best friends are whats his game what does he expect to get out of it he dont do it just for the fresh air and exercise what would you say now bill that an ordinary man expects generally speaking for his efforts along the line of ambition and extraordinary hustling in the marketplaces forums shootinggalleries lyceums battlefields links cinderpaths and arenas of the civilized and vice versa places of the world  well ben said i with judicial seriousness i think we might safely limit the number of motives of a man who seeks fame to threeto ambition which is a desire for popular applause to avarice which looks to the material side of success and to love of some woman whom he either possesses or desires to possess  ben pondered over my words while a mockingbird on the top of a mesquite by the porch trilled a dozen bars  i reckon said he that your diagnosis about covers the case according to the rules laid down in the copybooks and historical readers but what i had in my mind was the case of willie robbins a person i used to know ill tell you about him before i close up the store if you dont mind listening  willie was one of our social set up in san augustine i was clerking there then for brady  murchison wholesale drygoods and ranch supplies willie and i belonged to the same german club and athletic association and military company he played the triangle in our serenading and quartet crowd that used to ring the welkin three nights a week somewhere in town  willie jibed with his name considerable he weighed about as much as a hundred pounds of veal in his summer suitings and he had a whereismary expression on his features so plain that you could almost see the wool growing on him  and yet you couldnt fence him away from the girls with barbed wire you know that kind of young fellowsa kind of a mixture of fools and angelsthey rush in and fear to tread at the same time but they never fail to tread when they get the chance he was always on hand when a joyful occasion was had as the morning paper would say looking as happy as a king full and at the same time as uncomfortable as a raw oyster served with sweet pickles he danced like he had hind hobbles on and he had a vocabulary of about three hundred and fifty words that he made stretch over four germans a week and plagiarized from to get him through two icecream suppers and a sundaynight call he seemed to me to be a sort of a mixture of maltese kitten sensitive plant and a member of a stranded two orphans company  ill give you an estimate of his physiological and pictorial makeup and then ill stick spurs into the sides of my narrative  willie inclined to the caucasian in his coloring and manner of style his hair was opalescent and his conversation fragmentary his eyes were the same blue shade as the china dogs on the righthand corner of your aunt ellens mantelpiece he took things as they came and i never felt any hostility against him i let him live and so did others  but what does this willie do but coax his heart out of his boots and lose it to myra allison the liveliest brightest keenest smartest and prettiest girl in san augustine i tell you she had the blackest eyes the shiniest curls and the most tantalizingoh no youre offi wasnt a victim i might have been but i knew better i kept out joe granberry was it from the start he had everybody else beat a couple of leagues and thence east to a stake and mound but anyhow myra was a ninepound fullmerino fallclip fleece sacked and loaded on a fourhorse team for san antone  one night there was an icecream sociable at mrs colonel spraggins in san augustine we fellows had a big room upstairs opened up for us to put our hats and things in and to comb our hair and put on the clean collars we brought along inside the sweatbands of our hatsin short a room to fix up in just like they have everywhere at hightoned doings a little farther down the hall was the girls room which they used to powder up in and so forth downstairs wethat is the san augustine social cotillion and merrymakers clubhad a stretcher put down in the parlor where our dance was going on  willie robbins and me happened to be up in ourcloakroom i believe we called itwhen myra allison skipped through the hall on her way downstairs from the girls room willie was standing before the mirror deeply interested in smoothing down the blond grassplot on his head which seemed to give him lots of trouble myra was always full of life and devilment she stopped and stuck her head in our door she certainly was goodlooking but i knew how joe granberry stood with her so did willie but he kept on baaaing after her and following her around he had a system of persistence that didnt coincide with pale hair and light eyes  hello willie says myra what are you doing to yourself in the glass  im trying to look fly says willie  well you never could be fly says myra with her special laugh which was the provokingest sound i ever heard except the rattle of an empty canteen against my saddlehorn  i looked around at willie after myra had gone he had a kind of a lilywhite look on him which seemed to show that her remark had as you might say disrupted his soul i never noticed anything in what she said that sounded particularly destructive to a mans ideas of selfconsciousness but he was set back to an extent you could scarcely imagine  after we went downstairs with our clean collars on willie never went near myra again that night after all he seemed to be a diluted kind of a skimmilk sort of a chap and i never wondered that joe granberry beat him out  the next day the battleship maine was blown up and then pretty soon somebodyi reckon it was joe bailey or ben tillman or maybe the governmentdeclared war against spain  well everybody south of mason  hamlins line knew that the north by itself couldnt whip a whole country the size of spain so the yankees commenced to holler for help and the johnny rebs answered the call were coming father william a hundred thousand strongand then some was the way they sang it and the old party lines drawn by shermans march and the kuklux and ninecent cotton and the jim crow streetcar ordinances faded away we became one undivided country with no north very little east a goodsized chunk of west and a south that loomed up as big as the first foreign label on a new eightdollar suitcase  of course the dogs of war werent a complete pack without a yelp from the san augustine rifles company d of the fourteenth texas regiment our company was among the first to land in cuba and strike terror into the hearts of the foe im not going to give you a history of the war im just dragging it in to fill out my story about willie robbins just as the republican party dragged it in to help out the election in 1898  if anybody ever had heroitis it was that willie robbins from the minute he set foot on the soil of the tyrants of castile he seemed to engulf danger as a cat laps up cream he certainly astonished every man in our company from the captain up youd have expected him to gravitate naturally to the job of an orderly to the colonel or typewriter in the commissarybut not any he created the part of the flaxenhaired boy hero who lives and gets back home with the goods instead of dying with an important despatch in his hands at his colonels feet  our company got into a section of cuban scenery where one of the messiest and most unsung portions of the campaign occurred we were out every day capering around in the bushes and having little skirmishes with the spanish troops that looked more like kind of tiredout feuds than anything else the war was a joke to us and of no interest to them we never could see it any other way than as a howling farcecomedy that the san augustine rifles were actually fighting to uphold the stars and stripes and the blamed little señors didnt get enough pay to make them care whether they were patriots or traitors now and then somebody would get killed it seemed like a waste of life to me i was at coney island when i went to new york once and one of them downhill skidding apparatuses they call rollercoasters flew the track and killed a man in a brown sacksuit whenever the spaniards shot one of our men it struck me as just about as unnecessary and regrettable as that was  but im dropping willie robbins out of the conversation  he was out for bloodshed laurels ambition medals recommendations and all other forms of military glory and he didnt seem to be afraid of any of the recognized forms of military danger such as spaniards cannonballs canned beef gunpowder or nepotism he went forth with his pallid hair and chinablue eyes and ate up spaniards like you would sardines à la canopy wars and rumbles of wars never flustered him he would stand guardduty mosquitoes hardtack treat and fire with equally perfect unanimity no blondes in history ever come in comparison distance of him except the jack of diamonds and queen catherine of russia  i remember one time a little caballard of spanish men sauntered out from behind a patch of sugarcane and shot bob turner the first sergeant of our company while we were eating dinner as required by the army regulations we fellows went through the usual tactics of falling into line saluting the enemy and loading and firing kneeling  that wasnt the texas way of scrapping but being a very important addendum and annex to the regular army the san augustine rifles had to conform to the redtape system of getting even  by the time we had got out our uptons tactics turned to page fiftyseven said onetwothreeonetwothree a couple of times and got blank cartridges into our springfields the spanish outfit had smiled repeatedly rolled and lit cigarettes by squads and walked away contemptuously  i went straight to captain floyd and says to him sam i dont think this war is a straight game you know as well as i do that bob turner was one of the whitest fellows that ever threw a leg over a saddle and now these wirepullers in washington have fixed his clock hes politically and ostensibly dead it aint fair why should they keep this thing up if they want spain licked why dont they turn the san augustine rifles and joe seelys ranger company and a carload of west texas deputysheriffs onto these spaniards and let us exonerate them from the face of the earth i never did says i care much about fighting by the lord chesterfield ring rules im going to hand in my resignation and go home if anybody else i am personally acquainted with gets hurt in this war if you can get somebody in my place sam says i ill quit the first of next week i dont want to work in an army that dont give its help a chance never mind my wages says i let the secretary of the treasury keep em  well ben says the captain to me your allegations and estimations of the tactics of war government patriotism guardmounting and democracy are all right but ive looked into the system of international arbitration and the ethics of justifiable slaughter a little closer maybe than you have now you can hand in your resignation the first of next week if you are so minded but if you do says sam ill order a corporals guard to take you over by that limestone bluff on the creek and shoot enough lead into you to ballast a submarine airship im captain of this company and ive swore allegiance to the amalgamated states regardless of sectional secessional and congressional differences have you got any smokingtobacco winds up sam mine got wet when i swum the creek this morning  the reason i drag all this non ex parte evidence in is because willie robbins was standing there listening to us i was a second sergeant and he was a private then but among us texans and westerners there never was as much tactics and subordination as there was in the regular army we never called our captain anything but sam except when there was a lot of majorgenerals and admirals around so as to preserve the discipline  and says willie robbins to me in a sharp construction of voice much unbecoming to his light hair and previous record  you ought to be shot ben for emitting any such sentiments a man that wont fight for his country is worse than a horsethief if i was the cap id put you in the guardhouse for thirty days on round steak and tamales war says willie is great and glorious i didnt know you were a coward  im not says i if i was id knock some of the pallidness off of your marble brow im lenient with you i says just as i am with the spaniards because you have always reminded me of something with mushrooms on the side why you little lady of shalott says i you underdone leader of cotillions you glassy fashion and moulded form you whitepine soldier made in the cisalpine alps in germany for the late newyear trade do you know of whom you are talking to weve been in the same social circle says i and ive put up with you because you seemed so meek and selfunsatisfying i dont understand why you have so sudden taken a personal interest in chivalrousness and murder your natures undergone a complete revelation now how is it  well you wouldnt understand ben says willie giving one of his refined smiles and turning away  come back here says i catching him by the tail of his khaki coat youve made me kind of mad in spite of the aloofness in which i have heretofore held you you are out for making a success in this hero business and i believe i know what for you are doing it either because you are crazy or because you expect to catch some girl by it now if its a girl ive got something here to show you  i wouldnt have done it but i was plumb mad i pulled a san augustine paper out of my hippocket and showed him an item it was a half a column about the marriage of myra allison and joe granberry  willie laughed and i saw i hadnt touched him  oh says he everybody knew that was going to happen i heard about that a week ago and then he gave me the laugh again  all right says i then why do you so recklessly chase the bright rainbow of fame do you expect to be elected president or do you belong to a suicide club  and then captain sam interferes  you gentlemen quit jawing and go back to your quarters says he or ill have you escorted to the guardhouse now scat both of you before you go which one of you has got any chewingtobacco  were off sam says i its suppertime anyhow but what do you think of what we was talking about ive noticed you throwing out a good many grapplinghooks for this here balloon called famewhats ambition anyhow what does a man risk his life day after day for do you know of anything he gets in the end that can pay him for the trouble i want to go back home says i i dont care whether cuba sinks or swims and i dont give a pipeful of rabbit tobacco whether queen sophia christina or charlie culberson rules these fairy isles and i dont want my name on any list except the list of survivors but ive noticed you sam says i seeking the bubble notoriety in the cannons larynx a number of times now what do you do it for is it ambition business or some frecklefaced phoebe at home that you are heroing for  well ben says sam kind of hefting his sword out from between his knees as your superior officer i could courtmartial you for attempted cowardice and desertion but i wont and ill tell you why im trying for promotion and the usual honors of war and conquest a major gets more pay than a captain and i need the money  correct for you says i i can understand that your system of fameseeking is rooted in the deepest soil of patriotism but i cant comprehend says i why willie robbins whose folks at home are well off and who used to be as meek and undesirous of notice as a cat with cream on his whiskers should all at once develop into a warrior bold with the most fireeating kind of proclivities and the girl in his case seems to have been eliminated by marriage to another fellow i reckon says i its a plain case of just common ambition he wants his name maybe to go thundering down the coroners of time it must be that  well without itemizing his deeds willie sure made good as a hero he simply spent most of his time on his knees begging our captain to send him on forlorn hopes and dangerous scouting expeditions in every fight he was the first man to mix it at close quarters with the don alfonsos he got three or four bullets planted in various parts of his autonomy once he went off with a detail of eight men and captured a whole company of spanish he kept captain floyd busy writing out recommendations of his bravery to send in to headquarters and he began to accumulate medals for all kinds of thingsheroism and targetshooting and valor and tactics and uninsubordination and all the little accomplishments that look good to the third assistant secretaries of the war department  finally cap floyd got promoted to be a majorgeneral or a knight commander of the main herd or something like that he pounded around on a white horse all desecrated up with goldleaf and henfeathers and a good templars hat and wasnt allowed by the regulations to speak to us and willie robbins was made captain of our company  and maybe he didnt go after the wreath of fame then as far as i could see it was him that ended the war he got eighteen of us boysfriends of his tookilled in battles that he stirred up himself and that didnt seem to me necessary at all one night he took twelve of us and waded through a little rill about a hundred and ninety yards wide and climbed a couple of mountains and sneaked through a mile of neglected shrubbery and a couple of rockquarries and into a ryestraw village and captured a spanish general named as they said benny veedus benny seemed to me hardly worth the trouble being a blackish man without shoes or cuffs and anxious to surrender and throw himself on the commissary of his foe  but that job gave willie the big boost he wanted the san augustine news and the galveston st louis new york and kansas city papers printed his picture and columns of stuff about him old san augustine simply went crazy over its gallant son the news had an editorial tearfully begging the government to call off the regular army and the national guard and let willie carry on the rest of the war singlehanded it said that a refusal to do so would be regarded as a proof that the northern jealousy of the south was still as rampant as ever  if the war hadnt ended pretty soon i dont know to what heights of gold braid and encomiums willie would have climbed but it did there was a secession of hostilities just three days after he was appointed a colonel and got in three more medals by registered mail and shot two spaniards while they were drinking lemonade in an ambuscade  our company went back to san augustine when the war was over there wasnt anywhere else for it to go and what do you think the old town notified us in print by wire cable special delivery and a nigger named saul sent on a gray mule to san antone that they was going to give us the biggest blowout complimentary alimentary and elementary that ever disturbed the kildees on the sandflats outside of the immediate contiguity of the city  i say we but it was all meant for exprivate captain de facto and colonelelect willie robbins the town was crazy about him they notified us that the reception they were going to put up would make the mardi gras in new orleans look like an afternoon tea in bury st edmunds with a curates aunt  well the san augustine rifles got back home on schedule time everybody was at the depot giving forth rooseveltdemocratthey used to be called rebelyells there was two brassbands and the mayor and schoolgirls in white frightening the streetcar horses by throwing cherokee roses in the streets andwell maybe youve seen a celebration by a town that was inland and out of water  they wanted brevetcolonel willie to get into a carriage and be drawn by prominent citizens and some of the city aldermen to the armory but he stuck to his company and marched at the head of it up sam houston avenue the buildings on both sides was covered with flags and audiences and everybody hollered robbins or hello willie as we marched up in files of fours i never saw a illustriouserlooking human in my life than willie was he had at least seven or eight medals and diplomas and decorations on the breast of his khaki coat he was sunburnt the color of a saddle and he certainly done himself proud  they told us at the depot that the courthouse was to be illuminated at halfpast seven and there would be speeches and chiliconcarne at the palace hotel miss delphine thompson was to read an original poem by james whitcomb ryan and constable hooker had promised us a salute of nine guns from chicago that he had arrested that day  after we had disbanded in the armory willie says to me  want to walk out a piece with me  why yes says i if it aint so far that we cant hear the tumult and the shouting die away im hungry myself says i and im pining for some home grub but ill go with you  willie steered me down some side streets till we came to a little white cottage in a new lot with a twentybythirtyfoot lawn decorated with brickbats and old barrelstaves  halt and give the countersign says i to willie dont you know this dugout its the birdsnest that joe granberry built before he married myra allison what you going there for  but willie already had the gate open he walked up the brick walk to the steps and i went with him myra was sitting in a rockingchair on the porch sewing her hair was smoothed back kind of hasty and tied in a knot i never noticed till then that she had freckles joe was at one side of the porch in his shirtsleeves with no collar on and no signs of a shave trying to scrape out a hole among the brickbats and tin cans to plant a little fruittree in he looked up but never said a word and neither did myra  willie was sure dandylooking in his uniform with medals strung on his breast and his new goldhandled sword youd never have taken him for the little whiteheaded snipe that the girls used to order about and make fun of he just stood there for a minute looking at myra with a peculiar little smile on his face and then he says to her slow and kind of holding on to his words with his teeth  oh i dont know maybe i could if i tried  that was all that was said willie raised his hat and we walked away  and somehow when he said that i remembered all of a sudden the night of that dance and willie brushing his hair before the lookingglass and myra sticking her head in the door to guy him  when we got back to sam houston avenue willie says  well so long ben im going down home and get off my shoes and take a rest  you says i whats the matter with you aint the courthouse jammed with everybody in town waiting to honor the hero and two brassbands and recitations and flags and jags and grub to follow waiting for you  willie sighs  all right ben says he darned if i didnt forget all about that  and thats why i say concluded ben granger that you cant tell where ambition begins any more than you can where it is going to wind up     the headhunter   when the war between spain and george dewey was over i went to the philippine islands there i remained as bushwhacker correspondent for my paper until its managing editor notified me that an eighthundredword cablegram describing the grief of a pet carabao over the death of an infant moro was not considered by the office to be war news so i resigned and came home  on board the tradingvessel that brought me back i pondered much upon the strange things i had sensed in the weird archipelago of the yellowbrown people the manoeuvres and skirmishings of the petty war interested me not i was spellbound by the outlandish and unreadable countenance of that race that had turned its expressionless gaze upon us out of an unguessable past  particularly during my stay in mindanao had i been fascinated and attracted by that delightfully original tribe of heathen known as the headhunters those grim flinty relentless little men never seen but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their concealed presence paralleling the trail of their prey through unmapped forests across perilous mountaintops adown bottomless chasms into uninhabitable jungles always near with the invisible hand of death uplifted betraying their pursuit only by such signs as a beast or a bird or a gliding serpent might makea twig crackling in the awful sweatsoaked night a drench of dew showering from the screening foliage of a giant tree a whisper at even from the rushes of a waterlevela hint of death for every mile and every hourthey amused me greatly those little fellows of one idea  when you think of it their method is beautifully and almost hilariously effective and simple  you have your hut in which you live and carry out the destiny that was decreed for you spiked to the jamb of your bamboo doorway is a basket made of green withes plaited from time to time as vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move you you creep forth with your snickersnee and take up the silent trail back from it you come triumphant bearing the severed gory head of your victim which you deposit with pardonable pride in the basket at the side of your door it may be the head of your enemy your friend or a stranger according as competition jealousy or simple sportiveness has been your incentive to labor  in any case your reward is certain the village men in passing stop to congratulate you as your neighbor on weaker planes of life stops to admire and praise the begonias in your front yard your particular brown maid lingers with fluttering bosom casting soft tigers eyes at the evidence of your love for her you chew betelnut and listen content to the intermittent soft drip from the ends of the severed neck arteries and you show your teeth and grunt like a waterbuffalowhich is as near as you can come to laughingat the thought that the cold acephalous body of your door ornament is being spotted by wheeling vultures in the mindanaoan wilds  truly the life of the merry headhunter captivated me he had reduced art and philosophy to a simple code to take your adversarys head to basket it at the portal of your castle to see it lying there a dead thing with its cunning and stratagems and power gone is there a better way to foil his plots to refute his arguments to establish your superiority over his skill and wisdom  the ship that brought me home was captained by an erratic swede who changed his course and deposited me with genuine compassion in a small town on the pacific coast of one of the central american republics a few hundred miles south of the port to which he had engaged to convey me but i was wearied of movement and exotic fancies so i leaped contentedly upon the firm sands of the village of mojada telling myself i should be sure to find there the rest that i craved after all far better to linger there i thought lulled by the sedative plash of the waves and the rustling of palmfronds than to sit upon the horsehair sofa of my parental home in the east and there cast down by currant wine and cake and scourged by fatuous relatives drivel into the ears of gaping neighbors sad stories of the death of colonial governors    when i first saw chloe greene she was standing all in white in the doorway of her fathers tileroofed dobe house she was polishing a silver cup with a cloth and she looked like a pearl laid against black velvet she turned on me a flatteringly protracted but a wiltingly disapproving gaze and then went inside humming a light song to indicate the value she placed upon my existence  small wonder for dr stamford the most disreputable professional man between juneau and valparaiso and i were zigzagging along the turfy street tunelessly singing the words of auld lang syne to the air of muzzers little coalblack coon we had come from the ice factory which was mojadas palace of wickedness where we had been playing billiards and opening black bottles white with frost that we dragged with strings out of old sandovals icecold vats  i turned in sudden rage to dr stamford as sober as the verger of a cathedral in a moment i had become aware that we were swine cast before a pearl  you beast i said this is half your doing and the other half is the fault of this cursed country id better have gone back to sleepytown and died in a wild orgy of currant wine and buns than to have had this happen  stamford filled the empty street with his roaring laughter  you too he cried and all as quick as the popping of a cork well she does seem to strike agreeably upon the retina but dont burn your fingers all mojada will tell you that louis devoe is the man  we will see about that said i and perhaps whether he is a man as well as the man  i lost no time in meeting louis devoe that was easily accomplished for the foreign colony in mojada numbered scarce a dozen and they gathered daily at a halfdecent hotel kept by a turk where they managed to patch together the fluttering rags of country and civilization that were left them i sought devoe before i did my pearl of the doorway because i had learned a little of the game of war and knew better than to strike for a prize before testing the strength of the enemy  a sort of cold dismaysomething akin to fearfilled me when i had estimated him i found a man so perfectly poised so charming so deeply learned in the worlds rituals so full of tact courtesy and hospitality so endowed with grace and ease and a kind of careless haughty power that i almost overstepped the bounds in probing him in turning him on the spit to find the weak point that i so craved for him to have but i left him wholei had to make bitter acknowledgment to myself that louis devoe was a gentleman worthy of my best blows and i swore to give him them he was a great merchant of the country a wealthy importer and exporter all day he sat in a fastidiously appointed office surrounded by works of art and evidences of his high culture directing through glass doors and windows the affairs of his house  in person he was slender and hardly tall his small wellshaped head was covered with thick brown hair trimmed short and he wore a thick brown beard also cut close and to a fine point his manners were a pattern  before long i had become a regular and a welcome visitor at the greene home i shook my wild habits from me like a wornout cloak i trained for the conflict with the care of a prizefighter and the selfdenial of a brahmin  as for chloe greene i shall weary you with no sonnets to her eyebrow she was a splendidly feminine girl as wholesome as a november pippin and no more mysterious than a windowpane she had whimsical little theories that she had deduced from life and that fitted the maxims of epictetus like princess gowns i wonder after all if that old duffer wasnt rather wise  chloe had a father the reverend homer greene and an intermittent mother who sometimes palely presided over a twilight teapot the reverend homer was a burrlike man with a lifework he was writing a concordance to the scriptures and had arrived as far as kings being presumably a suitor for his daughters hand i was timber for his literary outpourings i had the family tree of israel drilled into my head until i used to cry aloud in my sleep and aminadab begat jay eye see and so forth until he had tackled another book i once made a calculation that the reverend homers concordance would be worked up as far as the seven vials mentioned in revelations about the third day after they were opened  louis devoe as well as i was a visitor and an intimate friend of the greenes it was there i met him the oftenest and a more agreeable man or a more accomplished i have never hated in my life  luckily or unfortunately i came to be accepted as a boy my appearance was youthful and i suppose i had that pleading and homeless air that always draws the motherliness that is in women and the cursed theories and hobbies of paterfamilias  chloe called me tommy and made sisterly fun of my attempts to woo her with devoe she was vastly more reserved he was the man of romance one to stir her imagination and deepest feelings had her fancy leaned toward him i was closer to her but standing in no glamour i had the task before me of winning her in what seems to me the american way of fightingwith cleanness and pluck and everyday devotion to break away the barriers of friendship that divided us and to take her if i could between sunrise and dark abetted by neither moonlight nor music nor foreign wiles  chloe gave no sign of bestowing her blithe affections upon either of us but one day she let out to me an inkling of what she preferred in a man it was tremendously interesting to me but not illuminating as to its application i had been tormenting her for the dozenth time with the statement and catalogue of my sentiments toward her  tommy said she i dont want a man to show his love for me by leading an army against another country and blowing people off the earth with cannons  if you mean that the opposite way i answered as they say women do ill see what i can do the papers are full of this diplomatic row in russia my people know some big people in washington who are right next to the army people and i could get an artillery commission and  im not that way interrupted chloe i mean what i say it isnt the big things that are done in the world tommy that count with a woman when the knights were riding abroad in their armor to slay dragons many a stayathome page won a lonesome ladys hand by being on the spot to pick up her glove and be quick with her cloak when the wind blew the man i am to like best whoever he shall be must show his love in little ways he must never forget after hearing it once that i do not like to have any one walk at my left side that i detest brightcolored neckties that i prefer to sit with my back to a light that i like candied violets that i must not be talked to when i am looking at the moonlight shining on water and that i very very often long for dates stuffed with english walnuts  frivolity i said with a frown any welltrained servant would be equal to such details  and he must remember went on chloe to remind me of what i want when i do not know myself what i want  youre rising in the scale i said what you seem to need is a firstclass clairvoyant  and if i say that i am dying to hear a beethoven sonata and stamp my foot when i say it he must know by that that what my soul craves is salted almonds and he will have them ready in his pocket  now said i i am at a loss i do not know whether your souls affinity is to be an impresario or a fancy grocer  chloe turned her pearly smile upon me  take less than half of what i said as a jest she went on and dont think too lightly of the little things boy be a paladin if you must but dont let it show on you most women are only very big children and most men are only very little ones please us dont try to overpower us when we want a hero we can make one out of even a plain grocer the third time he catches our handkerchief before it falls to the ground  that evening i was taken down with pernicious fever that is a kind of coast fever with improvements and highgeared attachments your temperature goes up among the threes and fours and remains there laughing scornfully and feverishly at the cinchona trees and the coaltar derivatives pernicious fever is a case for a simple mathematician instead of a doctor it is merely this formula vitality  the desire to live  the duration of the fever  the result  i took to my bed in the tworoomed thatched hut where i had been comfortably established and sent for a gallon of rum that was not for myself drunk stamford was the best doctor between the andes and the pacific he came sat at my bedside and drank himself into condition  my boy said he my lilywhite and reformed romeo medicine will do you no good but i will give you quinine which being bitter will arouse in you hatred and angertwo stimulants that will add ten per cent to your chances you are as strong as a caribou calf and you will get well if the fever doesnt get in a knockout blow when youre off your guard  for two weeks i lay on my back feeling like a hindoo widow on a burning ghat old atasca an untrained indian nurse sat near the door like a petrified statue of whatstheuse attending to her duties which were mainly to see that time went by without slipping a cog sometimes i would fancy myself back in the philippines or at worse times sliding off the horsehair sofa in sleepytown  one afternoon i ordered atasca to vamose and got up and dressed carefully i took my temperature which i was pleased to find 104 i paid almost dainty attention to my dress choosing solicitously a necktie of a dull and subdued hue the mirror showed that i was looking little the worse from my illness the fever gave brightness to my eyes and color to my face and while i looked at my reflection my color went and came again as i thought of chloe greene and the millions of eons that had passed since id seen her and of louis devoe and the time he had gained on me  i went straight to her house i seemed to float rather than walk i hardly felt the ground under my feet i thought pernicious fever must be a great boon to make one feel so strong  i found chloe and louis devoe sitting under the awning in front of the house she jumped up and met me with a double handshake  im glad glad glad to see you out again she cried every word a pearl strung on the string of her sentence you are well tommyor better of course i wanted to come to see you but they wouldnt let me  oh yes said i carelessly it was nothing merely a little fever i am out again as you see  we three sat there and talked for half an hour or so then chloe looked out yearningly and almost piteously across the ocean i could see in her seablue eyes some deep and intense desire devoe curse him saw it too  what is it we asked in unison  cocoanutpudding said chloe pathetically ive wanted someoh so badly for two days its got beyond a wish its an obsession  the cocoanut season is over said devoe in that voice of his that gave thrilling interest to his most commonplace words i hardly think one could be found in mojada the natives never use them except when they are green and the milk is fresh they sell all the ripe ones to the fruiterers  wouldnt a broiled lobster or a welsh rabbit do as well i remarked with the engaging idiocy of a perniciousfever convalescent  chloe came as near to pouting as a sweet disposition and a perfect profile would allow her to come  the reverend homer poked his erminelined face through the doorway and added a concordance to the conversation  sometimes said he old campos keeps the dried nuts in his little store on the hill but it would be far better my daughter to restrain unusual desires and partake thankfully of the daily dishes that the lord has set before us  stuff said i  how was that asked the reverend homer sharply  i say its tough said i to drop into the vernacular that miss greene should be deprived of the food she desiresa simple thing like kalsominepudding perhaps i continued solicitously some pickled walnuts or a fricassee of hungarian butternuts would do as well  every one looked at me with a slight exhibition of curiosity  louis devoe arose and made his adieus i watched him until he had sauntered slowly and grandiosely to the corner around which he turned to reach his great warehouse and store chloe made her excuses and went inside for a few minutes to attend to some detail affecting the sevenoclock dinner she was a passed mistress in housekeeping i had tasted her puddings and bread with beatitude  when all had gone i turned casually and saw a basket made of plaited green withes hanging by a nail outside the doorjamb with a rush that made my hot temples throb there came vividly to my mind recollections of the headhuntersthose grim flinty relentless little men never seen but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their concealed presence    from time to time as vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move him one creeps forth with his snickersnee and takes up the silent trail    back he comes triumphant bearing the severed gory head of his victim    his particular brown or white maid lingers with fluttering bosom casting soft tigers eyes at the evidence of his love for her  i stole softly from the house and returned to my hut from its supporting nails in the wall i took a machete as heavy as a butchers cleaver and sharper than a safetyrazor and then i chuckled softly to myself and set out to the fastidiously appointed private office of monsieur louis devoe usurper to the hand of the pearl of the pacific  he was never slow at thinking he gave one look at my face and another at the weapon in my hand as i entered his door and then he seemed to fade from my sight i ran to the back door kicked it open and saw him running like a deer up the road toward the wood that began two hundred yards away i was after him with a shout i remember hearing children and women screaming and seeing them flying from the road  he was fleet but i was stronger a mile and i had almost come up with him he doubled cunningly and dashed into a brake that extended into a small cañon i crashed through this after him and in five minutes had him cornered in an angle of insurmountable cliffs there his instinct of selfpreservation steadied him as it will steady even animals at bay he turned to me quite calm with a ghastly smile  oh rayburn he said with such an awful effort at ease that i was impolite enough to laugh rudely in his face oh rayburn said he come lets have done with this nonsense of course i know its the fever and youre not yourself but collect yourself mangive me that ridiculous weapon now and lets go back and talk it over  i will go back said i carrying your head with me we will see how charmingly it can discourse when it lies in the basket at her door  come said he persuasively i think better of you than to suppose that you try this sort of thing as a joke but even the vagaries of a fevercrazed lunatic come some time to a limit what is this talk about heads and baskets get yourself together and throw away that absurd canechopper what would miss greene think of you he ended with the silky cajolery that one would use toward a fretful child  listen said i at last you have struck upon the right note what would she think of me listen i repeated  there are women i said who look upon horsehair sofas and currant wine as dross to them even the calculated modulation of your welltrimmed talk sounds like the dropping of rotten plums from a tree in the night they are the maidens who walk back and forth in the villages scorning the emptiness of the baskets at the doors of the young men who would win them  one such as they i said is waiting only a fool would try to win a woman by drooling like a braggart in her doorway or by waiting upon her whims like a footman they are all daughters of herodias and to gain their hearts one must lay the heads of his enemies before them with his own hands now bend your neck louis devoe do not be a coward as well as a chatterer at a ladys teatable  there there said devoe falteringly you know me dont you rayburn  oh yes i said i know you i know you i know you but the basket is empty the old men of the village and the young men and both the dark maidens and the ones who are as fair as pearls walk back and forth and see its emptiness will you kneel now or must we have a scuffle it is not like you to make things go roughly and with bad form but the basket is waiting for your head  with that he went to pieces i had to catch him as he tried to scamper past me like a scared rabbit i stretched him out and got a foot on his chest but he squirmed like a worm although i appealed repeatedly to his sense of propriety and the duty he owed to himself as a gentleman not to make a row  but at last he gave me the chance and i swung the machete  it was not hard work he flopped like a chicken during the six or seven blows that it took to sever his head but finally he lay still and i tied his head in my handkerchief the eyes opened and shut thrice while i walked a hundred yards i was red to my feet with the drip but what did that matter with delight i felt under my hands the crisp touch of his short thick brown hair and closetrimmed beard  i reached the house of the greenes and dumped the head of louis devoe into the basket that still hung by the nail in the doorjamb i sat in a chair under the awning and waited the sun was within two hours of setting chloe came out and looked surprised  where have you been tommy she asked you were gone when i came out  look in the basket i said rising to my feet she looked and gave a little screamof delight i was pleased to note  oh tommy she said it was just what i wanted you to do its leaking a little but that doesnt matter wasnt i telling you its the little things that count and you remembered  little things she held the ensanguined head of louis devoe in her white apron tiny streams of red widened on her apron and dripped upon the floor her face was bright and tender  little things indeed i thought again the headhunters are right these are the things that women like you to do for them  chloe came close to me there was no one in sight she looked tip at me with seablue eyes that said things they had never said before  you think of me she said you are the man i was describing you think of the little things and they are what make the world worth living in the man for me must consider my little wishes and make me happy in small ways he must bring me little red peaches in december if i wish for them and then i will love him till june i will have no knight in armor slaying his rival or killing dragons for me you please me very well tommy  i stooped and kissed her then a moisture broke out on my forehead and i began to feel weak i saw the red stains vanish from chloes apron and the head of louis devoe turn to a brown dried cocoanut  there will be cocoanutpudding for dinner tommy boy said chloe gayly and you must come i must go in for a little while  she vanished in a delightful flutter  dr stamford tramped up hurriedly he seized my pulse as though it were his own property that i had escaped with  you are the biggest fool outside of any asylum he said angrily why did you leave your bed and the idiotic things youve been doingand no wonder with your pulse going like a sledgehammer  name some of them said i  devoe sent for me said stamford he saw you from his window go to old campos store chase him up the hill with his own yardstick and then come back and make off with his biggest cocoanut  its the little things that count after all said i  its your little bed that counts with you just now said the doctor you come with me at once or ill throw up the case youre as loony as a loon  so i got no cocoanutpudding that evening but i conceived a distrust as to the value of the method of the headhunters perhaps for many centuries the maidens of the villages may have been looking wistfully at the heads in the baskets at the doorways longing for other and lesser trophies     no story   to avoid having this book hurled into corner of the room by the suspicious reader i will assert in time that this is not a newspaper story you will encounter no shirtsleeved omniscient city editor no prodigy cub reporter just off the farm no scoop no storyno anything  but if you will concede me the setting of the first scene in the reporters room of the morning beacon i will repay the favor by keeping strictly my promises set forth above  i was doing spacework on the beacon hoping to be put on a salary some one had cleared with a rake or a shovel a small space for me at the end of a long table piled high with exchanges congressional records and old files there i did my work i wrote whatever the city whispered or roared or chuckled to me on my diligent wanderings about its streets my income was not regular  one day tripp came in and leaned on my table tripp was something in the mechanical departmenti think he had something to do with the pictures for he smelled of photographers supplies and his hands were always stained and cut up with acids he was about twentyfive and looked forty half of his face was covered with short curly red whiskers that looked like a doormat with the welcome left off he was pale and unhealthy and miserable and fawning and an assiduous borrower of sums ranging from twentyfive cents to a dollar one dollar was his limit he knew the extent of his credit as well as the chemical national bank knows the amount of h2o that collateral will show on analysis when he sat on my table he held one hand with the other to keep both from shaking whiskey he had a spurious air of lightness and bravado about him that deceived no one but was useful in his borrowing because it was so pitifully and perceptibly assumed  this day i had coaxed from the cashier five shining silver dollars as a grumbling advance on a story that the sunday editor had reluctantly accepted so if i was not feeling at peace with the world at least an armistice had been declared and i was beginning with ardor to write a description of the brooklyn bridge by moonlight  well tripp said i looking up at him rather impatiently how goes it he was looking today more miserable more cringing and haggard and downtrodden than i had ever seen him he was at that stage of misery where he drew your pity so fully that you longed to kick him  have you got a dollar asked tripp with his most fawning look and his doglike eyes that blinked in the narrow space between his highgrowing matted beard and his lowgrowing matted hair  i have said i and again i said i have more loudly and inhospitably and four besides and i had hard work corkscrewing them out of old atkinson i can tell you and i drew them i continued to meet a wanta hiatusa demanda needan exigencya requirement of exactly five dollars  i was driven to emphasis by the premonition that i was to lose one of the dollars on the spot  i dont want to borrow any said tripp and i breathed again i thought youd like to get put onto a good story he went on ive got a rattling fine one for you you ought to make it run a column at least itll make a dandy if you work it up right itll probably cost you a dollar or two to get the stuff i dont want anything out of it myself  i became placated the proposition showed that tripp appreciated past favors although he did not return them if he had been wise enough to strike me for a quarter then he would have got it  what is the story i asked poising my pencil with a finely calculated editorial air  ill tell you said tripp its a girl a beauty one of the howlingest amsdens junes you ever saw rosebuds covered with dew violets in their mossy bedand truck like that shes lived on long island twenty years and never saw new york city before i ran against her on thirtyfourth street shed just got in on the east river ferry i tell you shes a beauty that would take the hydrogen out of all the peroxides in the world she stopped me on the street and asked me where she could find george brown asked me where she could find george brown in new york city what do you think of that  i talked to her and found that she was going to marry a young farmer named doddhiram doddnext week but it seems that george brown still holds the championship in her youthful fancy george had greased his cowhide boots some years ago and came to the city to make his fortune but he forgot to remember to show up again at greenburg and hiram got in as secondbest choice but when it comes to the scratch adaher names ada lowerysaddles a nag and rides eight miles to the railroad station and catches the 645 am train for the city looking for george you knowyou understand about women george wasnt there so she wanted him  well you know i couldnt leave her loose in wolftownonthehudson i suppose she thought the first person she inquired of would say george brownwhy yeslemme seehes a short man with lightblue eyes aint he oh yesyoull find george on one hundred and twentyfifth street right next to the grocery hes billclerk in a saddleandharness store thats about how innocent and beautiful she is you know those little long island waterfront villages like greenburga couple of duckfarms for sport and clams and about nine summer visitors for industries thats the kind of a place she comes from but sayyou ought to see her  what could i do i dont know what money looks like in the morning and shed paid her last cent of pocketmoney for her railroad ticket except a quarter which she had squandered on gumdrops she was eating them out of a paper bag i took her to a boardinghouse on thirtysecond street where i used to live and hocked her shes in soak for a dollar thats old mother mcginnis price per day ill show you the house  what words are these tripp said i i thought you said you had a story every ferryboat that crosses the east river brings or takes away girls from long island  the premature lines on tripps face grew deeper he frowned seriously from his tangle of hair he separated his hands and emphasized his answer with one shaking forefinger  cant you see he said what a rattling fine story it would make you could do it fine all about the romance you know and describe the girl and put a lot of stuff in it about true love and sling in a few stickfuls of funny businessjoshing the long islanders about being green and wellyou know how to do it you ought to get fifteen dollars out of it anyhow and itll cost you only about four dollars youll make a clear profit of eleven  how will it cost me four dollars i asked suspiciously  one dollar to mrs mcginnis tripp answered promptly and two dollars to pay the girls fare back home  and the fourth dimension i inquired making a rapid mental calculation  one dollar to me said tripp for whiskey are you on  i smiled enigmatically and spread my elbows as if to begin writing again but this grim abject specious subservient burrlike wreck of a man would not be shaken off his forehead suddenly became shiningly moist  dont you see he said with a sort of desperate calmness that this girl has got to be sent home todaynot tonight nor tomorrow but today i cant do anything for her you know im the janitor and corresponding secretary of the downandout club i thought you could make a newspaper story out of it and win out a piece of money on general results but anyhow dont you see that shes got to get back home before night  and then i began to feel that dull leaden souldepressing sensation known as the sense of duty why should that sense fall upon one as a weight and a burden i knew that i was doomed that day to give up the bulk of my store of hardwrung coin to the relief of this ada lowery but i swore to myself that tripps whiskey dollar would not be forthcoming he might play knighterrant at my expense but he would indulge in no wassail afterward commemorating my weakness and gullibility in a kind of chilly anger i put on my coat and hat  tripp submissive cringing vainly endeavoring to please conducted me via the streetcars to the human pawnshop of mother mcginnis i paid the fares it seemed that the collodionscented don quixote and the smallest minted coin were strangers  tripp pulled the bell at the door of the mouldy redbrick boardinghouse at its faint tinkle he paled and crouched as a rabbit makes ready to spring away at the sound of a huntingdog i guessed what a life he had led terrorhaunted by the coming footsteps of landladies  give me one of the dollarsquick he said  the door opened six inches mother mcginnis stood there with white eyesthey were white i sayand a yellow face holding together at her throat with one hand a dingy pink flannel dressingsack tripp thrust the dollar through the space without a word and it bought us entry  shes in the parlor said the mcginnis turning the back of her sack upon us  in the dim parlor a girl sat at the cracked marble centretable weeping comfortably and eating gumdrops she was a flawless beauty crying had only made her brilliant eyes brighter when she crunched a gumdrop you thought only of the poetry of motion and envied the senseless confection eve at the age of five minutes must have been a ringer for miss ada lowery at nineteen or twenty i was introduced and a gumdrop suffered neglect while she conveyed to me a naïve interest such as a puppy dog a prize winner might bestow upon a crawling beetle or a frog  tripp took his stand by the table with the fingers of one hand spread upon it as an attorney or a master of ceremonies might have stood but he looked the master of nothing his faded coat was buttoned high as if it sought to be charitable to deficiencies of tie and linen  i thought of a scotch terrier at the sight of his shifty eyes in the glade between his tangled hair and beard for one ignoble moment i felt ashamed of having been introduced as his friend in the presence of so much beauty in distress but evidently tripp meant to conduct the ceremonies whatever they might be i thought i detected in his actions and pose an intention of foisting the situation upon me as material for a newspaper story in a lingering hope of extracting from me his whiskey dollar  my friend i shuddered mr chalmers said tripp will tell you miss lowery the same that i did hes a reporter and he can hand out the talk better than i can thats why i brought him with me o tripp wasnt it the silvertongued orator you wanted hes wise to a lot of things and hell tell you now whats best to do  i stood on one foot as it were as i sat in my rickety chair  whyermiss lowery i began secretly enraged at tripps awkward opening i am at your service of course buteras i havent been apprized of the circumstances of the case ier  oh said miss lowery beaming for a moment it aint as bad as thatthere aint any circumstances its the first time ive ever been in new york except once when i was five years old and i had no idea it was such a big town and i met mrmr snip on the street and asked him about a friend of mine and he brought me here and asked me to wait  i advise you miss lowery said tripp to tell mr chalmers all hes a friend of mine i was getting used to it by this time and hell give you the right tip  why certainly said miss ada chewing a gumdrop toward me there aint anything to tell except thatwell everythings fixed for me to marry hiram dodd next thursday evening hi has got two hundred acres of land with a lot of shorefront and one of the best truckfarms on the island but this morning i had my horse saddled uphes a white horse named dancerand i rode over to the station i told em at home i was going to spend the day with susie adams it was a story i guess but i dont care and i came to new york on the train and i met mrmr flip on the street and asked him if he knew where i could find gg  now miss lowery broke in tripp loudly and with much bad taste i thought as she hesitated with her word you like this young man hiram dodd dont you hes all right and good to you aint he  of course i like him said miss lowery emphatically his all right and of course hes good to me so is everybody  i could have sworn it myself throughout miss ada lowerys life all men would be to good to her they would strive contrive struggle and compete to hold umbrellas over her hat check her trunk pick up her handkerchief and buy for her soda at the fountain  but went on miss lowery last night i got to thinking about ggeorge and i  down went the bright gold head upon dimpled clasped hands on the table such a beautiful april storm unrestrainedly she sobbed i wished i could have comforted her but i was not george and i was glad i was not hiramand yet i was sorry too  byandby the shower passed she straightened up brave and halfway smiling she would have made a splendid wife for crying only made her eyes more bright and tender she took a gumdrop and began her story  i guess im a terrible hayseed she said between her little gulps and sighs but i cant help it ggeorge brown and i were sweethearts since he was eight and i was five when he was nineteenthat was four years agohe left greenburg and went to the city he said he was going to be a policeman or a railroad president or something and then he was coming back for me but i never heard from him any more and iiliked him  another flow of tears seemed imminent but tripp hurled himself into the crevasse and dammed it confound him i could see his game he was trying to make a story of it for his sordid ends and profit  go on mr chalmers said he and tell the lady whats the proper caper thats what i told heryoud hand it to her straight spiel up  i coughed and tried to feel less wrathful toward tripp i saw my duty cunningly i had been inveigled but i was securely trapped tripps first dictum to me had been just and correct the young lady must be sent back to greenburg that day she must be argued with convinced assured instructed ticketed and returned without delay i hated hiram and despised george but duty must be done noblesse oblige and only five silver dollars are not strictly romantic compatibles but sometimes they can be made to jibe it was mine to be sir oracle and then pay the freight so i assumed an air that mingled solomons with that of the general passenger agent of the long island railroad  miss lowery said i as impressively as i could life is rather a queer proposition after all there was a familiar sound to these words after i had spoken them and i hoped miss lowery had never heard mr cohans song those whom we first love we seldom wed our earlier romances tinged with the magic radiance of youth often fail to materialize the last three words sounded somewhat trite when they struck the air but those fondly cherished dreams i went on may cast a pleasant afterglow on our future lives however impracticable and vague they may have been but life is full of realities as well as visions and dreams one cannot live on memories may i ask miss lowery if you think you could pass a happythat is a contented and harmonious life with mrerdoddif in other ways than romantic recollections he seems toerfill the bill as i might say  oh his all right answered miss lowery yes i could get along with him fine hes promised me an automobile and a motorboat but somehow when it got so close to the time i was to marry him i couldnt help wishingwell just thinking about george something must have happened to him or hed have written on the day he left he and me got a hammer and a chisel and cut a dime into two pieces i took one piece and he took the other and we promised to be true to each other and always keep the pieces till we saw each other again ive got mine at home now in a ringbox in the top drawer of my dresser i guess i was silly to come up here looking for him i never realized what a big place it is  and then tripp joined in with a little grating laugh that he had still trying to drag in a little story or drama to earn the miserable dollar that he craved  oh the boys from the country forget a lot when they come to the city and learn something i guess george maybe is on the bum or got roped in by some other girl or maybe gone to the dogs on account of whiskey or the races you listen to mr chalmers and go back home and youll be all right  but now the time was come for action for the hands of the clock were moving close to noon frowning upon tripp i argued gently and philosophically with miss lowery delicately convincing her of the importance of returning home at once and i impressed upon her the truth that it would not be absolutely necessary to her future happiness that she mention to hi the wonders or the fact of her visit to the city that had swallowed up the unlucky george  she said she had left her horse unfortunate rosinante tied to a tree near the railroad station tripp and i gave her instructions to mount the patient steed as soon as she arrived and ride home as fast as possible there she was to recount the exciting adventure of a day spent with susie adams she could fix susiei was sure of that and all would be well  and then being susceptible to the barbed arrows of beauty i warmed to the adventure the three of us hurried to the ferry and there i found the price of a ticket to greenburg to be but a dollar and eighty cents i bought one and a red red rose with the twenty cents for miss lowery we saw her aboard her ferryboat and stood watching her wave her handkerchief at us until it was the tiniest white patch imaginable and then tripp and i faced each other brought back to earth left dry and desolate in the shade of the sombre verities of life  the spell wrought by beauty and romance was dwindling i looked at tripp and almost sneered he looked more careworn contemptible and disreputable than ever i fingered the two silver dollars remaining in my pocket and looked at him with the halfclosed eyelids of contempt he mustered up an imitation of resistance  cant you get a story out of it he asked huskily some sort of a story even if you have to fake part of it  not a line said i i can fancy the look on grimes face if i should try to put over any slush like this but weve helped the little lady out and thatll have to be our only reward  im sorry said tripp almost inaudibly im sorry youre out your money now it seemed to me like a find of a big story you know that is a sort of thing that would write up pretty well  lets try to forget it said i with a praiseworthy attempt at gayety and take the next car cross town  i steeled myself against his unexpressed but palpable desire he should not coax cajole or wring from me the dollar he craved i had had enough of that wildgoose chase  tripp feebly unbuttoned his coat of the faded pattern and glossy seams to reach for something that had once been a handkerchief deep down in some obscure and cavernous pocket as he did so i caught the shine of a cheap silverplated watchchain across his vest and something dangling from it caused me to stretch forth my hand and seize it curiously it was the half of a silver dime that had been cut in halves with a chisel  what i said looking at him keenly  oh yes he responded dully george brown alias tripp whats the use  barring the w c t u id like to know if anybody disapproves of my having produced promptly from my pocket tripps whiskey dollar and unhesitatingly laying it in his hand     the higher pragmatism   i   where to go for wisdom has become a question of serious import the ancients are discredited plato is boilerplate aristotle is

tencent magazine lying on a bench in a little city park anyhow that was the amount he asked me for when i sat on the bench next to him he was a musty dingy and tattered magazine with some queer stories bound in him i was sure he turned out to be a scrapbook  i am a newspaper reporter i said to him to try him i have been detailed to write up some of the experiences of the unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in this park may i ask you to what you attribute your downfall in  i was interrupted by a laugh from my purchasea laugh so rusty and unpractised that i was sure it had been his first for many a day  oh no no said he you aint a reporter reporters dont talk that way they pretend to be one of us and say theyve just got in on the blind baggage from st louis i can tell a reporter on sight us park bums get to be fine judges of human nature we sit here all day and watch the people go by i can size up anybody who walks past my bench in a way that would surprise you  well i said go on and tell me how do you size me up  i should say said the student of human nature with unpardonable hesitation that you was say in the contracting businessor maybe worked in a storeor was a signpainter you stopped in the park to finish your cigar and thought youd get a little free monologue out of me still you might be a plasterer or a lawyerits getting kind of dark you see and your wife wont let you smoke at home  i frowned gloomily  but judging again went on the reader of men id say you aint got a wife  no said i rising restlessly no no no i aint but i will have by the arrows of cupid that is if  my voice must have trailed away and muffled itself in uncertainty and despair  i see you have a story yourself said the dusty vagrantimpudently it seemed to me suppose you take your dime back and spin your yarn for me im interested myself in the ups and downs of unfortunate ones who spend their evenings in the park  somehow that amused me i looked at the frowsy derelict with more interest i did have a story why not tell it to him i had told none of my friends i had always been a reserved and bottledup man it was psychical timidity or sensitivenessperhaps both and i smiled to myself in wonder when i felt an impulse to confide in this stranger and vagabond  jack said i  mack said he  mack said i ill tell you  do you want the dime back in advance said he  i handed him a dollar  the dime said i was the price of listening to your story  right on the point of the jaw said he go on  and then incredible as it may seem to the lovers in the world who confide their sorrows only to the night wind and the gibbous moon i laid bare my secret to that wreck of all things that you would have supposed to be in sympathy with love  i told him of the days and weeks and months that i had spent in adoring mildred telfair i spoke of my despair my grievous days and wakeful nights my dwindling hopes and distress of mind i even pictured to this nightprowler her beauty and dignity the great sway she had in society and the magnificence of her life as the elder daughter of an ancient race whose pride overbalanced the dollars of the citys millionaires  why dont you cop the lady out asked mack bringing me down to earth and dialect again  i explained to him that my worth was so small my income so minute and my fears so large that i hadnt the courage to speak to her of my worship i told him that in her presence i could only blush and stammer and that she looked upon me with a wonderful maddening smile of amusement  she kind of moves in the professional class dont she asked mack  the telfair family i began haughtily  i mean professional beauty said my hearer  she is greatly and widely admired i answered cautiously  any sisters  one  you know any more girls  why several i answered and a few others  say said mack tell me one thingcan you hand out the dope to other girls can you chin em and make matinée eyes at em and squeeze em you know what i mean youre just shy when it comes to this particular damethe professional beautyaint that right  in a way you have outlined the situation with approximate truth i admitted  i thought so said mack grimly now that reminds me of my own case ill tell you about it  i was indignant but concealed it what was this loafers case or anybodys case compared with mine besides i had given him a dollar and ten cents  feel my muscle said my companion suddenly flexing his biceps i did so mechanically the fellows in gyms are always asking you to do that his arm was as hard as castiron  four years ago said mack i could lick any man in new york outside of the professional ring your case and mine is just the same i come from the west sidebetween thirtieth and fourteenthi wont give the number on the door i was a scrapper when i was ten and when i was twenty no amateur in the city could stand up four rounds with me s a fact you know bill mccarty no he managed the smokers for some of them swell clubs well i knocked out everything bill brought up before me i was a middleweight but could train down to a welter when necessary i boxed all over the west side at bouts and benefits and private entertainments and was never put out once  but say the first time i put my foot in the ring with a professional i was no more than a canned lobster i dunno how it wasi seemed to lose heart i guess i got too much imagination there was a formality and publicness about it that kind of weakened my nerve i never won a fight in the ring lightweights and all kinds of scrubs used to sign up with my manager and then walk up and tap me on the wrist and see me fall the minute i seen the crowd and a lot of gents in evening clothes down in front and seen a professional come inside the ropes i got as weak as gingerale  of course it wasnt long till i couldnt get no backers and i didnt have any more chances to fight a professionalor many amateurs either but lemme tell youi was as good as most men inside the ring or out it was just that dumb dead feeling i had when i was up against a regular that always done me up  well sir after i had got out of the business i got a mighty grouch on i used to go round town licking private citizens and all kinds of unprofessionals just to please myself id lick cops in dark streets and carconductors and cabdrivers and draymen whenever i could start a row with em it didnt make any difference how big they were or how much science they had i got away with em if id only just have had the confidence in the ring that i had beating up the best men outside of it id be wearing black pearls and heliotrope silk socks today  one evening i was walking along near the bowery thinking about things when along comes a slummingparty about six or seven they was all in swallowtails and these silk hats that dont shine one of the gang kind of shoves me off the sidewalk i hadnt had a scrap in three days and i just says delighted and hits him back of the ear  well we had it that johnnie put up as decent a little fight as youd want to see in the moving pictures it was on a side street and no cops around the other guy had a lot of science but it only took me about six minutes to lay him out  some of the swallowtails dragged him up against some steps and began to fan him another one of em comes over to me and says  young man do you know what youve done  oh beat it says i ive done nothing but a little punchingbag work take freddy back to yale and tell him to quit studying sociology on the wrong side of the sidewalk  my good fellow says he i dont know who you are but id like to youve knocked out reddy burns the champion middleweight of the world he came to new york yesterday to try to get a match on with jim jeffries if you  but when i come out of my faint i was laying on the floor in a drugstore saturated with aromatic spirits of ammonia if id known that was reddy burns id have got down in the gutter and crawled past him instead of handing him one like i did why if id ever been in a ring and seen him climbing over the ropes id have been all to the salvolatile  so thats what imagination does concluded mack and as i said your case and mine is simultaneous youll never win out you cant go up against the professionals i tell you its a park bench for yours in this romance business  mack the pessimist laughed harshly  im afraid i dont see the parallel i said coldly i have only a very slight acquaintance with the prizering  the derelict touched my sleeve with his forefinger for emphasis as he explained his parable  every man said he with some dignity has got his lamps on something that looks good to him with you its this dame that youre afraid to say your say to with me it was to win out in the ring well youll lose just like i did  why do you think i shall lose i asked warmly  cause said he youre afraid to go in the ring you dassent stand up before a professional your case and mine is just the same youre a amateur and that means that youd better keep outside of the ropes  well i must be going i said rising and looking with elaborate care at my watch  when i was twenty feet away the parkbencher called to me  much obliged for the dollar he said and for the dime but youll never get er youre in the amateur class  serves you right i said to myself for hobnobbing with a tramp his impudence  but as i walked his words seemed to repeat themselves over and over again in my brain i think i even grew angry at the man  ill show him i finally said aloud ill show him that i can fight reddy burns tooeven knowing who he is  i hurried to a telephonebooth and rang up the telfair residence  a soft sweet voice answered didnt i know that voice my hand holding the receiver shook  is that you said i employing the foolish words that form the vocabulary of every talker through the telephone  yes this is i came back the answer in the low clearcut tones that are an inheritance of the telfairs who is it please  its me said i less ungrammatically than egotistically its me and ive got a few things that i want to say to you right now and immediately and straight to the point  dear me said the voice oh its you mr arden  i wondered if any accent on the first word was intended mildred was fine at saying things that you had to study out afterward  yes said i i hope so and now to come down to brass tacks i thought that rather a vernacularism if there is such a word as soon as i had said it but i didnt stop to apologize you know of course that i love you and that i have been in that idiotic state for a long time i dont want any more foolishness about itthat is i mean i want an answer from you right now will you marry me or not hold the wire please keep out central hello hello will you or will you not  that was just the uppercut for reddy burns chin the answer came back  why phil dear of course i will i didnt know that youthat is you never saidoh come up to the house pleasei cant say what i want to over the phone you are so importunate but please come up to the house wont you  would i  i rang the bell of the telfair house violently some sort of a human came to the door and shooed me into the drawingroom  oh well said i to myself looking at the ceiling any one can learn from any one that was a pretty good philosophy of macks anyhow he didnt take advantage of his experience but i get the benefit of it if you want to get into the professional class youve got to  i stopped thinking then some one was coming down the stairs my knees began to shake i knew then how mack had felt when a professional began to climb over the ropes  i looked around foolishly for a door or a window by which i might escape if it had been any other girl approaching i mightnt have  but just then the door opened and bess mildreds younger sister came in id never seen her look so much like a glorified angel she walked straight tip to me andand  id never noticed before what perfectly wonderful eyes and hair elizabeth telfair had  phil she said in the telfair sweet thrilling tones why didnt you tell me about it before i thought it was sister you wanted all the time until you telephoned to me a few minutes ago  i suppose mack and i always will be hopeless amateurs but as the thing has turned out in my case im mighty glad of it     bestseller   i   one day last summer i went to pittsburghwell i had to go there on business  my chaircar was profitably well filled with people of the kind one usually sees on chaircars most of them were ladies in brownsilk dresses cut with square yokes with lace insertion and dotted veils who refused to have the windows raised then there was the usual number of men who looked as if they might be in almost any business and going almost anywhere some students of human nature can look at a man in a pullman and tell you where he is from his occupation and his stations in life both flag and social but i never could the only way i can correctly judge a fellowtraveller is when the train is held up by robbers or when he reaches at the same time i do for the last towel in the dressingroom of the sleeper  the porter came and brushed the collection of soot on the windowsill off to the left knee of my trousers i removed it with an air of apology the temperature was eightyeight one of the dottedveiled ladies demanded the closing of two more ventilators and spoke loudly of interlaken i leaned back idly in chair no 7 and looked with the tepidest curiosity at the small black baldspotted head just visible above the back of no 9  suddenly no 9 hurled a book to the floor between his chair and the window and looking i saw that it was the roselady and trevelyan one of the bestselling novels of the present day and then the critic or philistine whichever he was veered his chair toward the window and i knew him at once for john a pescud of pittsburgh travelling salesman for a plateglass companyan old acquaintance whom i had not seen in two years  in two minutes we were faced had shaken hands and had finished with such topics as rain prosperity health residence and destination politics might have followed next but i was not so illfated  i wish you might know john a pescud he is of the stuff that heroes are not often lucky enough to be made of he is a small man with a wide smile and an eye that seems to be fixed upon that little red spot on the end of your nose i never saw him wear but one kind of necktie and he believes in cuffholders and buttonshoes he is as hard and true as anything ever turned out by the cambria steel works and he believes that as soon as pittsburgh makes smokeconsumers compulsory st peter will come down and sit at the foot of smithfield street and let somebody else attend to the gate up in the branch heaven he believes that our plateglass is the most important commodity in the world and that when a man is in his home town he ought to be decent and lawabiding  during my acquaintance with him in the city of diurnal night i had never known his views on life romance literature and ethics we had browsed during our meetings on local topics and then parted after chateau margaux irish stew flannelcakes cottagepudding and coffee hey therewith milk separate now i was to get more of his ideas by way of facts he told me that business had picked up since the party conventions and that he was going to get off at coketown   ii   say said pescud stirring his discarded book with the toe of his right shoe did you ever read one of these bestsellers i mean the kind where the hero is an american swellsometimes even from chicagowho falls in love with a royal princess from europe who is travelling under an alias and follows her to her fathers kingdom or principality i guess you have theyre all alike sometimes this goingaway masher is a washington newspaper correspondent and sometimes he is a van something from new york or a chicago wheatbroker worthy fifty millions but hes always ready to break into the king row of any foreign country that sends over their queens and princesses to try the new plush seats on the big four or the b and o there doesnt seem to be any other reason in the book for their being here  well this fellow chases the royal chairwarmer home as i said and finds out who she is he meets her on the corso or the strasse one evening and gives us ten pages of conversation she reminds him of the difference in their stations and that gives him a chance to ring in three solid pages about americas uncrowned sovereigns if youd take his remarks and set em to music and then take the music away from em theyd sound exactly like one of george cohans songs  well you know how it runs on if youve read any of emhe slaps the kings swiss bodyguards around like everything whenever they get in his way hes a great fencer too now ive known of some chicago men who were pretty notorious fences but i never heard of any fencers coming from there he stands on the first landing of the royal staircase in castle schutzenfestenstein with a gleaming rapier in his hand and makes a baltimore broil of six platoons of traitors who come to massacre the said king and then he has to fight duels with a couple of chancellors and foil a plot by four austrian archdukes to seize the kingdom for a gasolinestation  but the great scene is when his rival for the princess hand count feodor attacks him between the portcullis and the ruined chapel armed with a mitrailleuse a yataghan and a couple of siberian bloodhounds this scene is what runs the bestseller into the twentyninth edition before the publisher has had time to draw a check for the advance royalties  the american hero shucks his coat and throws it over the heads of the bloodhounds gives the mitrailleuse a slap with his mitt says yah to the yataghan and lands in kid mccoys best style on the counts left eye of course we have a neat little prizefight right then and there the countin order to make the go possibleseems to be an expert at the art of selfdefence himself and here we have the corbettsullivan fight done over into literature the book ends with the broker and the princess doing a john cecil clay cover under the lindentrees on the gorgonzola walk that winds up the lovestory plenty good enough but i notice that the book dodges the final issue even a bestseller has sense enough to shy at either leaving a chicago grain broker on the throne of lobsterpotsdam or bringing over a real princess to eat fish and potato salad in an italian chalet on michigan avenue what do you think about em  why said i i hardly know john theres a saying love levels all ranks you know  yes said pescud but these kind of lovestories are rankon the level i know something about literature even if i am in plateglass these kind of books are wrong and yet i never go into a train but what they pile em up on me no good can come out of an international clinch between the oldworld aristocracy and one of us fresh americans when people in real life marry they generally hunt up somebody in their own station a fellow usually picks out a girl that went to the same highschool and belonged to the same singingsociety that he did when young millionaires fall in love they always select the chorusgirl that likes the same kind of sauce on the lobster that he does washington newspaper correspondents always many widow ladies ten years older than themselves who keep boardinghouses no sir you cant make a novel sound right to me when it makes one of c d gibsons bright young men go abroad and turn kingdoms upside down just because hes a taft american and took a course at a gymnasium and listen how they talk too  pescud picked up the bestseller and hunted his page  listen at this said he trevelyan is chinning with the princess alwyna at the back end of the tulipgarden this is how it goes      say not so dearest and sweetest of earths fairest flowers    would i aspire you are a star set high above me in a royal    heaven i am onlymyself yet i am a man and i have a heart    to do and dare i have no title save that of an uncrowned    sovereign but i have an arm and a sword that yet might free    schutzenfestenstein from the plots of traitors   think of a chicago man packing a sword and talking about freeing anything that sounded as much like canned pork as that hed be much more likely to fight to have an import duty put on it  i think i understand you john said i you want fictionwriters to be consistent with their scenes and characters they shouldnt mix turkish pashas with vermont farmers or english dukes with long island clamdiggers or italian countesses with montana cowboys or cincinnati brewery agents with the rajahs of india  or plain business men with aristocracy high above em added pescud it dont jibe people are divided into classes whether we admit it or not and its everybodys impulse to stick to their own class they do it too i dont see why people go to work and buy hundreds of thousands of books like that you dont see or hear of any such didoes and capers in real life   iii   well john said i i havent read a bestseller in a long time maybe ive had notions about them somewhat like yours but tell me more about yourself getting along all right with the company  bully said pescud brightening at once ive had my salary raised twice since i saw you and i get a commission too ive bought a neat slice of real estate out in the east end and have run up a house on it next year the firm is going to sell me some shares of stock oh im in on the line of general prosperity no matter whos elected  met your affinity yet john i asked  oh i didnt tell you about that did i said pescud with a broader grin  oho i said so youve taken time enough off from your plateglass to have a romance  no no said john no romancenothing like that but ill tell you about it  i was on the southbound going to cincinnati about eighteen months ago when i saw across the aisle the finestlooking girl id ever laid eyes on nothing spectacular you know but just the sort you want for keeps well i never was up to the flirtation business either handkerchief automobile postagestamp or doorstep and she wasnt the kind to start anything she read a book and minded her business which was to make the world prettier and better just by residing on it i kept on looking out of the side doors of my eyes and finally the proposition got out of the pullman class into a case of a cottage with a lawn and vines running over the porch i never thought of speaking to her but i let the plateglass business go to smash for a while  she changed cars at cincinnati and took a sleeper to louisville over the l and n there she bought another ticket and went on through shelbyville frankfort and lexington along there i began to have a hard time keeping up with her the trains came along when they pleased and didnt seem to be going anywhere in particular except to keep on the track and the right of way as much as possible then they began to stop at junctions instead of towns and at last they stopped altogether ill bet pinkerton would outbid the plateglass people for my services any time if they knew how i managed to shadow that young lady i contrived to keep out of her sight as much as i could but i never lost track of her  the last station she got off at was away down in virginia about six in the afternoon there were about fifty houses and four hundred niggers in sight the rest was red mud mules and speckled hounds  a tall old man with a smooth face and white hair looking as proud as julius cæsar and roscoe conkling on the same postcard was there to meet her his clothes were frazzled but i didnt notice that till later he took her little satchel and they started over the plankwalks and went up a road along the hill i kept along a piece behind em trying to look like i was hunting a garnet ring in the sand that my sister had lost at a picnic the previous saturday  they went in a gate on top of the hill it nearly took my breath away when i looked up up there in the biggest grove i ever saw was a tremendous house with round white pillars about a thousand feet high and the yard was so full of rosebushes and boxbushes and lilacs that you couldnt have seen the house if it hadnt been as big as the capitol at washington  heres where i have to trail says i to myself i thought before that she seemed to be in moderate circumstances at least this must be the governors mansion or the agricultural building of a new worlds fair anyhow id better go back to the village and get posted by the postmaster or drug the druggist for some information  in the village i found a pine hotel called the bay view house the only excuse for the name was a bay horse grazing in the front yard i set my samplecase down and tried to be ostensible i told the landlord i was taking orders for plateglass  i dont want no plates says he but i do need another glass molassespitcher  byandby i got him down to local gossip and answering questions  why says he i thought everybody knowed who lived in the big white house on the hill its colonel allyn the biggest man and the finest quality in virginia or anywhere else theyre the oldest family in the state that was his daughter that got off the train shes been up to illinois to see her aunt who is sick  i registered at the hotel and on the third day i caught the young lady walking in the front yard down next to the paling fence i stopped and raised my hatthere wasnt any other way  excuse me says i can you tell me where mr hinkle lives  she looks at me as cool as if i was the man come to see about the weeding of the garden but i thought i saw just a slight twinkle of fun in her eyes  no one of that name lives in birchton says she that is she goes on as far as i know is the gentleman you are seeking white  well that tickled me no kidding says i im not looking for smoke even if i do come from pittsburgh  you are quite a distance from home says she  id have gone a thousand miles farther says i  not if you hadnt waked up when the train started in shelbyville says she and then she turned almost as red as one of the roses on the bushes in the yard i remembered i had dropped off to sleep on a bench in the shelbyville station waiting to see which train she took and only just managed to wake up in time  and then i told her why i had come as respectful and earnest as i could and i told her everything about myself and what i was making and how that all i asked was just to get acquainted with her and try to get her to like me  she smiles a little and blushes some but her eyes never get mixed up they look straight at whatever shes talking to  i never had any one talk like this to me before mr pescud says she what did you say your name isjohn  john a says i  and you came mighty near missing the train at powhatan junction too says she with a laugh that sounded as good as a mileagebook to me  how did you know i asked  men are very clumsy said she i knew you were on every train i thought you were going to speak to me and im glad you didnt  then we had more talk and at last a kind of proud serious look came on her face and she turned and pointed a finger at the big house  the allyns says she have lived in elmcroft for a hundred years we are a proud family look at that mansion it has fifty rooms see the pillars and porches and balconies the ceilings in the receptionrooms and the ballroom are twentyeight feet high my father is a lineal descendant of belted earls  i belted one of em once in the duquesne hotel in pittsburgh says i and he didnt offer to resent it he was there dividing his attentions between monongahela whiskey and heiresses and he got fresh  of course she goes on my father wouldnt allow a drummer to set his foot in elmcroft if he knew that i was talking to one over the fence he would lock me in my room  would you let me come there says i would you talk to me if i was to call for i goes on if you said i might come and see you the earls might be belted or suspendered or pinned up with safetypins as far as i am concerned  i must not talk to you she says because we have not been introduced it is not exactly proper so i will say goodbye mr  say the name says i you havent forgotten it  pescud says she a little mad  the rest of the name i demands cool as could be  john says she  johnwhat i says  john a says she with her head high are you through now  im coming to see the belted earl tomorrow i says  hell feed you to his foxhounds says she laughing  if he does itll improve their running says i im something of a hunter myself  i must be going in now says she i oughtnt to have spoken to you at all i hope youll have a pleasant trip back to minneapolisor pittsburgh was it goodbye  goodnight says i and it wasnt minneapolis whats your name first please  she hesitated then she pulled a leaf off a bush and said  my name is jessie says she  goodnight miss allyn says i  the next morning at eleven sharp i rang the doorbell of that worlds fair main building after about threequarters of an hour an old nigger man about eighty showed up and asked what i wanted i gave him my business card and said i wanted to see the colonel he showed me in  say did you ever crack open a wormy english walnut thats what that house was like there wasnt enough furniture in it to fill an eightdollar flat some old horsehair lounges and threelegged chairs and some framed ancestors on the walls were all that met the eye but when colonel allyn comes in the place seemed to light up you could almost hear a band playing and see a bunch of oldtimers in wigs and white stockings dancing a quadrille it was the style of him although he had on the same shabby clothes i saw him wear at the station  for about nine seconds he had me rattled and i came mighty near getting cold feet and trying to sell him some plateglass but i got my nerve back pretty quick he asked me to sit down and i told him everything i told him how i followed his daughter from cincinnati and what i did it for and all about my salary and prospects and explained to him my little code of livingto be always decent and right in your home town and when youre on the road never take more than four glasses of beer a day or play higher than a twentyfivecent limit at first i thought he was going to throw me out of the window but i kept on talking pretty soon i got a chance to tell him that story about the western congressman who had lost his pocketbook and the grass widowyou remember that story well that got him to laughing and ill bet that was the first laugh those ancestors and horsehair sofas had heard in many a day  we talked two hours i told him everything i knew and then he began to ask questions and i told him the rest all i asked of him was to give me a chance if i couldnt make a hit with the little lady id clear out and not bother any more at last he says  there was a sir courtenay pescud in the time of charles i if i remember rightly  if there was says i he cant claim kin with our bunch weve always lived in and around pittsburgh ive got an uncle in the realestate business and one in trouble somewhere out in kansas you can inquire about any of the rest of us from anybody in old smoky town and get satisfactory replies did you ever run across that story about the captain of the whaler who tried to make a sailor say his prayers says i  it occurs to me that i have never been so fortunate says the colonel  so i told it to him laugh i was wishing to myself that he was a customer what a bill of glass id sell him and then he says  the relating of anecdotes and humorous occurrences has always seemed to me mr pescud to be a particularly agreeable way of promoting and perpetuating amenities between friends with your permission i will relate to you a foxhunting story with which i was personally connected and which may furnish you some amusement  so he tells it it takes forty minutes by the watch did i laugh well say when i got my face straight he calls in old pete the superannuated darky and sends him down to the hotel to bring up my valise it was elmcroft for me while i was in the town  two evenings later i got a chance to speak a word with miss jessie alone on the porch while the colonel was thinking up another story  its going to be a fine evening says i  hes coming says she hes going to tell you this time the story about the old negro and the green watermelons it always comes after the one about the yankees and the game rooster there was another time she goes on that you nearly got leftit was at pulaski city  yes says i i remember my foot slipped as i was jumping on the step and i nearly tumbled off  i know says she andand ii was afraid you had john a i was afraid you had  and then she skips into the house through one of the big windows   iv   coketown droned the porter making his way through the slowing car  pescud gathered his hat and baggage with the leisurely promptness of an old traveller  i married her a year ago said john i told you i built a house in the east end the beltedi mean the colonelis there too i find him waiting at the gate whenever i get back from a trip to hear any new story i might have picked up on the road  i glanced out of the window coketown was nothing more than a ragged hillside dotted with a score of black dismal huts propped up against dreary mounds of slag and clinkers it rained in slanting torrents too and the rills foamed and splashed down through the black mud to the railroadtracks  you wont sell much plateglass here john said i why do you get off at this endotheworld  why said pescud the other day i took jessie for a little trip to philadelphia and coming back she thought she saw some petunias in a pot in one of those windows over there just like some she used to raise down in the old virginia home so i thought id drop off here for the night and see if i could dig up some of the cuttings or blossoms for her here we are goodnight old man i gave you the address come out and see us when you have time  the train moved forward one of the dotted brown ladies insisted on having windows raised now that the rain beat against them the porter came along with his mysterious wand and began to light the car  i glanced downward and saw the bestseller i picked it up and set it carefully farther along on the floor of the car where the raindrops would not fall upon it and then suddenly i smiled and seemed to see that life has no geographical metes and bounds  goodluck to you trevelyan i said and may you get the petunias for your princess     rus in urbe   considering men in relation to money there are three kinds whom i dislike men who have more money than they can spend men who have more money than they do spend and men who spend more money than they have of the three varieties i believe i have the least liking for the first but as a man i liked spencer grenville north pretty well although he had something like two or ten or thirty millions ive forgotten exactly how many  i did not leave town that summer i usually went down to a village on the south shore of long island the place was surrounded by duckfarms and the ducks and dogs and whippoorwills and rusty windmills made so much noise that i could sleep as peacefully as if i were in my own flat six doors from the elevated railroad in new york but that summer i did not go remember that one of my friends asked me why i did not i replied  because old man new york is the finest summer resort in the world you have heard that phrase before but that is what i told him  i was pressagent that year for binkly  bing the theatrical managers and producers of course you know what a pressagent is well he is not that is the secret of being one  binkly was touring france in his new c  n williamson car and bing had gone to scotland to learn curling which he seemed to associate in his mind with hot tongs rather than with ice before they left they gave me june and july on salary for my vacation which act was in accord with their large spirit of liberality but i remained in new york which i had decided was the finest summer resort in  but i said that before  on july the 10th north came to town from his camp in the adirondacks try to imagine a camp with sixteen rooms plumbing eiderdown quilts a butler a garage solid silver plate and a longdistance telephone of course it was in the woodsif mr pinchot wants to preserve the forests let him give every citizen two or ten or thirty million dollars and the trees will all gather around the summer camps as the birnam woods came to dunsinane and be preserved  north came to see me in my three rooms and bath extra charge for light when used extravagantly or all night he slapped me on the back i would rather have my shins kicked any day and greeted me with outdoor obstreperousness and revolting good spirits he was insolently brown and healthylooking and offensively well dressed  just ran down for a few days said he to sign some papers and stuff like that my lawyer wired me to come well you indolent cockney what are you doing in town i took a chance and telephoned and they said you were here whats the matter with that utopia on long island where you used to take your typewriter and your villainous temper every summer anything wrong with theerswans werent they that used to sing on the farms at night  ducks said i the songs of swans are for luckier ears they swim and curve their necks in artificial lakes on the estates of the wealthy to delight the eyes of the favorites of fortune  also in central park said north to delight the eyes of immigrants and bummers ive seen em there lots of times but why are you in the city so late in the summer  new york city i began to recite is the finest sum  no you dont said north emphatically you dont spring that old one on me i know you know better man you ought to have gone up with us this summer the prestons are there and tom volney and the monroes and lulu stanford and the miss kennedy and her aunt that you liked so well  i never liked miss kennedys aunt i said  i didnt say you did said north we are having the greatest time weve ever had the pickerel and trout are so ravenous that i believe they would swallow your hook with a montana coppermine prospectus fastened on it and weve a couple of electric launches and ill tell you what we do every night or twowe tow a rowboat behind each one with a big phonograph and a boy to change the discs in em on the water and twenty yards behind you they are not so bad and there are passably good roads through the woods where we go motoring i shipped two cars up there and the pinecliff inn is only three miles away you know the pinecliff some good people are there this season and we run over to the dances twice a week cant you go back with me for a week old man  i laughed northy said iif i may be so familiar with a millionaire because i hate both the names spencer and grenvilleyour invitation is meant kindly butthe city in the summertime for me here while the bourgeoisie is away i can live as nero lived barring thank heaven the fiddlingwhile the city burns at ninety in the shade the tropics and the zones wait upon me like handmaidens i sit under florida palms and eat pomegranates while boreas himself electrically conjured up blows upon me his arctic breath as for trout you know yourself that jean at maurices cooks them better than any one else in the world  be advised said north my chef has pinched the blue ribbon from the lot he lays some slices of bacon inside the trout wraps it all in cornhusksthe husks of green corn you knowburies them in hot ashes and covers them with live coals we build fires on the bank of the lake and have fish suppers  i know said i and the servants bring down tables and chairs and damask cloths and you eat with silver forks i know the kind of camps that you millionaires have and there are champagne pails set about disgracing the wild flowers and no doubt madame tetrazzini to sing in the boat pavilion after the trout  oh no said north concernedly we were never as bad as that we did have a variety troupe up from the city three or four nights but they werent stars by as far as light can travel in the same length of time i always like a few home comforts even when im roughing it but dont tell me you prefer to stay in the city during summer i dont believe it if you do why did you spend your summers there for the last four years even sneaking away from town on a night train and refusing to tell your friends where this arcadian village was  because said i they might have followed me and discovered it but since then i have learned that amaryllis has come to town the coolest things the freshest the brightest the choicest are to be found in the city if youve nothing on hand this evening i will show you  im free said north and i have my light car outside i suppose since youve been converted to the town that your idea of rural sport is to have a little whirl between bicycle cops in central park and then a mug of sticky ale in some stuffy rathskeller under a fan that cant stir up as many revolutions in a week as nicaragua can in a day  well begin with the spin through the park anyhow i said i was choking with the hot stale air of my little apartment and i wanted that breath of the cool to brace me for the task of proving to my friend that new york was the greatestand so forth  where can you find air any fresher or purer than this i asked as we sped into centrals boskiest dell  air said north contemptuously do you call this airthis muggy vapor smelling of garbage and gasoline smoke man i wish you could get one sniff of the real adirondack article in the pine woods at daylight  i have heard of it said i but for fragrance and tang and a joy in the nostrils i would not give one puff of sea breeze across the bay down on my little boat dock on long island for ten of your turpentinescented tornadoes  then why asked north a little curiously dont you go there instead of staying cooped up in this greater bakery  because said i doggedly i have discovered that new york is the greatest summer  dont say that again interrupted north unless youve actually got a job as general passenger agent of the subway you cant really believe it  i went to some trouble to try to prove my theory to my friend the weather bureau and the season had conspired to make the argument worthy of an able advocate  the city seemed stretched on a broiler directly above the furnaces of avernus there was a kind of tepid gayety afoot and awheel in the boulevards mainly evinced by languid men strolling about in straw hats and evening clothes and rows of idle taxicabs with their flags up looking like a blockaded fourth of july procession the hotels kept up a specious brilliancy and hospitable outlook but inside one saw vast empty caverns and the footrails at the bars gleamed brightly from long disacquaintance with the soleleather of customers in the crosstown streets the steps of the old brownstone houses were swarming with stoopers that motley race hailing from skylight room and basement bringing out their straw doorstep mats to sit and fill the air with strange noises and opinions  north and i dined on the top of a hotel and here for a few minutes i thought i had made a score an east wind almost cool blew across the roofless roof a capable orchestra concealed in a bower of wistaria played with sufficient judgment to make the art of music probable and the art of conversation possible  some ladies in reproachless summer gowns at other tables gave animation and color to the scene and an excellent dinner mainly from the refrigerator seemed to successfully back my judgment as to summer resorts but north grumbled all during the meal and cursed his lawyers and prated so of his confounded camp in the woods that i began to wish he would go back there and leave me in my peaceful city retreat  after dining we went to a roofgarden vaudeville that was being much praised there we found a good bill an artificially cooled atmosphere cold drinks prompt service and a gay welldressed audience north was bored  if this isnt comfortable enough for you on the hottest august night for five years i said a little sarcastically you might think about the kids down in delancey and hester streets lying out on the fireescapes with their tongues hanging out trying to get a breath of air that hasnt been fried on both sides the contrast might increase your enjoyment  dont talk socialism said north i gave five hundred dollars to the free ice fund on the first of may im contrasting these stale artificial hollow wearisome amusements with the enjoyment a man can get in the woods you should see the firs and pines do skirtdances during a storm and lie down flat and drink out of a mountain branch at the end of a days tramp after the deer thats the only way to spend a summer get out and live with nature  i agree with you absolutely said i with emphasis  for one moment i had relaxed my vigilance and had spoken my true sentiments north looked at me long and curiously  then why in the name of pan and apollo he asked have you been singing this deceitful pæan to summer in town  i suppose i looked my guilt  ha said north i see may i ask her name  annie ashton said i simply she played nannette in binkley  bings production of the silver cord she is to have a better part next season  take me to see her said north  miss ashton lived with her mother in a small hotel they were out of the west and had a little money that bridged the seasons as pressagent of binkley  bing i had tried to keep her before the public as robert james vandiver i had hoped to withdraw her for if ever one was made to keep company with said vandiver and smell the salt breeze on the south shore of long island and listen to the ducks quack in the watches of the night it was the ashton set forth above  but she had a soul above ducksabove nightingales aye even above birds of paradise she was very beautiful with quiet ways and seemed genuine she had both taste and talent for the stage and she liked to stay at home and read and make caps for her mother she was unvaryingly kind and friendly with binkley  bings pressagent since the theatre had closed she had allowed mr vandiver to call in an unofficial rôle i had often spoken to her of my friend spencer grenville north and so as it was early the first turn of the vaudeville being not yet over we left to find a telephone  miss ashton would be very glad to see mr vandiver and mr north  we found her fitting a new cap on her mother i never saw her look more charming  north made himself disagreeably entertaining he was a good talker and had a way with him besides he had two ten or thirty millions ive forgotten which i incautiously admired the mothers cap whereupon she brought out her store of a dozen or two and i took a course in edgings and frills even though annies fingers had pinked or ruched or hemmed or whatever you do to em they palled upon me and i could hear north drivelling to annie about his odious adirondack camp  two days after that i saw north in his motorcar with miss ashton and her mother on the next afternoon he dropped in on me  bobby said he this old burg isnt such a bad proposition in the summertime after all since ive keen knocking around it looks better to me there are some firstrate musical comedies and light operas on the roofs and in the outdoor gardens and if you hunt up the right places and stick to soft drinks you can keep about as cool here as you can in the country hang it when you come to think of it theres nothing much to the country anyhow you get tired and sunburned and lonesome and you have to eat any old thing that the cook dishes up to you  it makes a difference doesnt it said i  it certainly does now i found some whitebait yesterday at maurices with a new sauce that beats anything in the trout line i ever tasted  it makes a difference doesnt it i said  immense the sauce is the main thing with whitebait  it makes a difference doesnt it i asked looking him straight in the eye he understood  look here bob he said i was going to tell you i couldnt help it ill play fair with you but im going in to win she is the one particular for me  all right said i its a fair field there are no rights for you to encroach upon  on thursday afternoon miss ashton invited north and myself to have tea in her apartment he was devoted and she was more charming than usual by avoiding the subject of caps i managed to get a word or two into and out of the talk miss ashton asked me in a makeconversational tone something about the next seasons tour  oh said i i dont know about that im not going to be with binkley  bing next season  why i thought said she that they were going to put the number one road company under your charge i thought you told me so  they were said i but they wont ill tell you what im going to do im going to the south shore of long island and buy a small cottage i know there on the edge of the bay and ill buy a catboat and a rowboat and a shotgun and a yellow dog ive got money enough to do it and ill smell the salt wind all day when it blows from the sea and the pine odor when it blows from the land and of course ill write plays until i have a trunk full of em on hand  and the next thing and the biggest thing ill do will be to buy that duckfarm next door few people understand ducks i can watch em for hours they can march better than any company in the national guard and they can play follow my leader better than the entire democratic party their voices dont amount to much but i like to hear em they wake you up a dozen times a night but theres a homely sound about their quacking that is more musical to me than the cry of fresh strawberrees under your window in the morning when you want to sleep  and i went on enthusiastically do you know the value of ducks besides their beauty and intelligence and order and sweetness of voice picking their feathers gives you an unfailing and neverceasing income on a farm that i know the feathers were sold for 400 in one year think of that and the ones shipped to the market will bring in more money than that yes i am for the ducks and the salt breeze coming over the bay i think i shall get a chinaman cook and with him and the dog and the sunsets for company i shall do well no more of this dull baking senseless roaring city for me  miss ashton looked surprised north laughed  i am going to begin one of my plays tonight i said so i must be going and with that i took my departure  a few days later miss ashton telephoned to me asking me to call at four in the afternoon  i did  you have been very good to me she said hesitatingly and i thought i would tell you i am going to leave the stage  yes said i i suppose you will they usually do when theres so much money  there is no money she said or very little our money is almost gone  but i am told said i that he has something like two or ten or thirty millionsi have forgotten which  i know what you mean she said i will not pretend that i do not i am not going to marry mr north  then why are you leaving the stage i asked severely what else can you do to earn a living  she came closer to me and i can see the look in her eyes yet as she spoke  i can pick ducks she said  we sold the first years feathers for 350     a poor rule   i have always maintained and asserted time to time that woman is no mystery that man can foretell construe subdue comprehend and interpret her that she is a mystery has been foisted by herself upon credulous mankind whether i am right or wrong we shall see as harpers drawer used to say in bygone years the following good story is told of miss  mr  mr  and mr   we shall have to omit bishop x and the rev  for they do not belong  in those days paloma was a new town on the line of the southern pacific a reporter would have called it a mushroom town but it was not paloma was first and last of the toadstool variety  the train stopped there at noon for the engine to drink and for the passengers both to drink and to dine there was a new yellowpine hotel also a wool warehouse and perhaps three dozen box residences the rest was composed of tents cow ponies blackwaxy mud and mesquitetrees all bound round by a horizon paloma was an abouttobe city the houses represented faith the tents hope the twiceaday train by which you might leave creditably sustained the rôle of charity  the parisian restaurant occupied the muddiest spot in the town while it rained and the warmest when it shone it was operated owned and perpetrated by a citizen known as old man hinkle who had come out of indiana to make his fortune in this land of condensed milk and sorghum  there was a fourroom unpainted weatherboarded box house in which the family lived from the kitchen extended a shelter made of poles covered with chaparral brush under this was a table and two benches each twenty feet long the product of paloma home carpentry here was set forth the roast mutton the stewed apples boiled beans sodabiscuits puddinorpie and hot coffee of the parisian menu  ma hinkle and a subordinate known to the ears as betty but denied to the eyesight presided at the range pa hinkle himself with salamandrous thumbs served the scalding viands during rush hours a mexican youth who rolled and smoked cigarettes between courses aided him in waiting on the guests as is customary at parisian banquets i place the sweets at the end of my wordy menu  ileen hinkle  the spelling is correct for i have seen her write it no doubt she had been named by ear but she so splendidly bore the orthography that tom moore himself had he seen her would have endorsed the phonography  ileen was the daughter of the house and the first lady cashier to invade the territory south of an eastandwest line drawn through galveston and del rio she sat on a high stool in a rough pine grandstandor was it a templeunder the shelter at the door of the kitchen there was a barbedwire protection in front of her with a little arch under which you passed your money heaven knows why the barbed wire for every man who dined parisianly there would have died in her service her duties were light each meal was a dollar you put it under the arch and she took it  i set out with the intent to describe ileen hinkle to you instead i must refer you to the volume by edmund burke entitled a philosophical inquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and beautiful it is an exhaustive treatise dealing first with the primitive conceptions of beautyroundness and smoothness i think they are according to burke it is well said rotundity is a patent charm as for smoothnessthe more new wrinkles a woman acquires the smoother she becomes  ileen was a strictly vegetable compound guaranteed under the pure ambrosia and balmofgilead act of the year of the fall of adam she was a fruitstand blondestrawberries peaches cherries etc her eyes were wide apart and she possessed the calm that precedes a storm that never comes but it seems to me that words at any rate per are wasted in an effort to describe the beautiful like fancy it is engendered in the eyes there are three kinds of beautiesi was foreordained to be homiletic i can never stick to a story  the first is the frecklefaced snubnosed girl whom you like the second is maud adams the third is or are the ladies in bouguereaus paintings ileen hinkle was the fourth she was the mayoress of spotless town there were a thousand golden apples coming to her as helen of the troy laundries  the parisian restaurant was within a radius even from beyond its circumference men rode in to paloma to win her smiles they got them one mealone smileone dollar but with all her impartiality ileen seemed to favor three of her admirers above the rest according to the rules of politeness i will mention myself last  the first was an artificial product known as bryan jacksa name that had obviously met with reverses jacks was the outcome of paved cities he was a small man made of some material resembling flexible sandstone his hair was the color of a brick quaker meetinghouse his eyes were twin cranberries his mouth was like the aperture under a droplettershere sign  he knew every city from bangor to san francisco thence north to portland thence s 45 e to a given point in florida he had mastered every art trade game business profession and sport in the world had been present at or hurrying on his way to every headline event that had ever occurred between oceans since he was five years old you might open the atlas place your finger at random upon the name of a town and jacks would tell you the front names of three prominent citizens before you could close it again he spoke patronizingly and even disrespectfully of broadway beacon hill michigan euclid and fifth avenues and the st louis four courts compared with him as a cosmopolite the wandering jew would have seemed a mere hermit he had learned everything the world could teach him and he would tell you about it  i hate to be reminded of polloks course of time and so do you but every time i saw jacks i would think of the poets description of another poet by the name of g g byron who drank early deeply drankdrank draughts that common millions might have quenched then died of thirst because there was no more to drink  that fitted jacks except that instead of dying he came to paloma which was about the same thing he was a telegrapher and stationand expressagent at seventyfive dollars a month why a young man who knew everything and could do everything was content to serve in such an obscure capacity i never could understand although he let out a hint once that it was as a personal favor to the president and stockholders of the s p ry co  one more line of description and i turn jacks over to you he wore bright blue clothes yellow shoes and a bow tie made of the same cloth as his shirt  my rival no2 was bud cunningham whose services had been engaged by a ranch near paloma to assist in compelling refractory cattle to keep within the bounds of decorum and order bud was the only cowboy off the stage that i ever saw who looked like one on it he wore the sombrero the chaps and the handkerchief tied at the back of his neck  twice a week bud rode in from the val verde ranch to sup at the parisian restaurant he rode a manyhighhanded kentucky horse at a tremendously fast lope which animal he would rein up so suddenly under the big mesquite at the corner of the brush shelter that his hoofs would plough canals yards long in the loam  jacks and i were regular boarders at the restaurant of course  the front room of the hinkle house was as neat a little parlor as there was in the blackwaxy country it was all willow rockingchairs and homeknit tidies and albums and conch shells in a row and a little upright piano in one corner  here jacks and bud and ior sometimes one or two of us according to our goodluckused to sit of evenings when the tide of trade was over and visit miss hinkle  ileen was a girl of ideas she was destined for higher things if there can be anything higher than taking in dollars all day through a barbedwire wicket she had read and listened and thought her looks would have formed a career for a less ambitious girl but rising superior to mere beauty she must establish something in the nature of a salonthe only one in paloma  dont you think that shakespeare was a great writer she would ask with such a pretty little knit of her arched brows that the late ignatius donnelly himself had he seen it could scarcely have saved his bacon  ileen was of the opinion also that boston is more cultured than chicago that rosa bonheur was one of the greatest of women painters that westerners are more spontaneous and openhearted than easterners that london must be a very foggy city and that california must be quite lovely in the springtime and of many other opinions indicating a keeping up with the worlds best thought  these however were but gleaned from hearsay and evidence ileen had theories of her own one in particular she disseminated to us untiringly flattery she detested frankness and honesty of speech and action she declared were the chief mental ornaments of man and woman if ever she could like any one it would be for those qualities  im awfully weary she said one evening when we three musketeers of the mesquite were in the little parlor of having compliments on my looks paid to me i know im not beautiful  bud cunningham told me afterward that it was all he could do to keep from calling her a liar when she said that  im only a little middlewestern girl went on ileen who just wants to be simple and neat and tries to help her father make a humble living  old man hinkle was shipping a thousand silver dollars a month clear profit to a bank in san antonio  bud twisted around in his chair and bent the rim of his hat from which he could never be persuaded to separate he did not know whether she wanted what she said she wanted or what she knew she deserved many a wiser man has hesitated at deciding bud decided  whyah miss ileen beauty as you might say aint everything not sayin that you havent your share of good looks i always admired more than anything else about you the nice kind way you treat your ma and pa any one whats good to their parents and is a kind of homebody dont specially need to be too pretty  ileen gave him one of her sweetest smiles thank you mr cunningham she said i consider that one of the finest compliments ive had in a long time id so much rather hear you say that than to hear you talk about my eyes and hair im glad you believe me when i say i dont like flattery  our cue was there for us bud had made a good guess you couldnt lose jacks he chimed in next  sure thing miss ileen he said the goodlookers dont always win out now you aint bad looking of coursebut thats nixcumrous i knew a girl once in dubuque with a face like a cocoanut who could skin the cat twice on a horizontal bar without changing hands now a girl might have the california peach crop mashed to a marmalade and not be able to do that ive seenerworse lookers than you miss ileen but what i like about you is the business way youve got of doing things cool and wisethats the winning way for a girl mr hinkle told me the other day youd never taken in a lead silver dollar or a plugged one since youve been on the job now thats the stuff for a girlthats what catches me  jacks got his smile too  thank you mr jacks said ileen if you only knew how i appreciate any ones being candid and not a flatterer i get so tired of people telling me im pretty i think it is the loveliest thing to have friends who tell you the truth  then i thought i saw an expectant look on ileens face as she glanced toward me i had a wild sudden impulse to dare fate and tell her of all the beautiful handiwork of the great artificer she was the most exquisitethat she was a flawless pearl gleaming pure and serene in a setting of black mud and emerald prairiesthat she wasaa corker and as for mine i cared not if she were as cruel as a serpents tooth to her fond parents or if she couldnt tell a plugged dollar from a bridle buckle if i might sing chant praise glorify and worship her peerless and wonderful beauty  but i refrained i feared the fate of a flatterer i had witnessed her delight at the crafty and discreet words of bud and jacks no miss hinkle was not one to be beguiled by the platedsilver tongue of a flatterer so i joined the ranks of the candid and honest at once i became mendacious and didactic  in all ages miss hinkle said i in spite of the poetry and romance of each intellect in woman has been admired more than beauty even in cleopatra herself men found more charm in her queenly mind than in her looks  well i should think so said ileen ive seen pictures of her that werent so much she had an awfully long nose  if i may say so i went on you remind me of cleopatra miss ileen  why my nose isnt so long said she opening her eyes wide and touching that comely feature with a dimpled forefinger  whyeri mean said ii mean as to mental endowments  oh said she and then i got my smile just as bud and jacks had got theirs  thank every one of you she said very very sweetly for being so frank and honest with me thats the way i want you to be always just tell me plainly and truthfully what you think and well all be the best friends in the world and now because youve been so good to me and understand so well how i dislike people who do nothing but pay me exaggerated compliments ill sing and play a little for you  of course we expressed our thanks and joy but we would have been better pleased if ileen had remained in her low rockingchair face to face with us and let us gaze upon her for she was no adelina patti not even on the farewellest of the divas farewell tours she had a cooing little voice like that of a turtledove that could almost fill the parlor when the windows and doors were closed and betty was not rattling the lids of the stove in the kitchen she had a gamut that i estimate at about eight inches on the piano and her runs and trills sounded like the clothes bubbling in your grandmothers iron washpot believe that she must have been beautiful when i tell you that it sounded like music to us  ileens musical taste was catholic she would sing through a pile of sheet music on the lefthand top of the piano laying each slaughtered composition on the righthand top the next evening she would sing from right to left her favorites were mendelssohn and moody and sankey by request she always wound up with sweet violets and when the leaves begin to turn  when we left at ten oclock the three of us would go down to jacks little wooden station and sit on the platform swinging our feet and trying to pump one another for clews as to which way miss ileens inclinations seemed to lean that is the way of rivalsthey do not avoid and glower at one another they convene and converse and construestriving by the art politic to estimate the strength of the enemy  one day there came a dark horse to paloma a young lawyer who at once flaunted his shingle and himself spectacularly upon the town his name was c vincent vesey you could see at a glance that he was a recent graduate of a southwestern law school his prince albert coat light striped trousers broadbrimmed soft black hat and narrow white muslin bow tie proclaimed that more loudly than any diploma could vesey was a compound of daniel webster lord chesterfield beau brummell and little jack horner his coming boomed paloma the next day after he arrived an addition to the town was surveyed and laid off in lots  of course vesey to further his professional fortunes must mingle with the citizenry and outliers of paloma and as well as with the soldier men he was bound to seek popularity with the gay dogs of the place so jacks and bud cunningham and i came to be honored by his acquaintance  the doctrine of predestination would have been discredited had not vesey seen ileen hinkle and become fourth in the tourney magnificently he boarded at the yellow pine hotel instead of at the parisian restaurant but he came to be a formidable visitor in the hinkle parlor his competition reduced bud to an inspired increase of profanity drove jacks to an outburst of slang so weird that it sounded more horrible than the most trenchant of buds imprecations and made me dumb with gloom  for vesey had the rhetoric words flowed from him like oil from a gusher hyperbole compliment praise appreciation honeyed gallantry golden opinions eulogy and unveiled panegyric vied with one another for preeminence in his speech we had small hopes that ileen could resist his oratory and prince albert  but a day came that gave us courage  about dusk one evening i was sitting on the little gallery in front of the hinkle parlor waiting for ileen to come when i heard voices inside she had come into the room with her father and old man hinkle began to talk to her i had observed before that he was a shrewd man and not unphilosophic  ily said he i notice theres three or four young fellers that have been callin to see you regular for quite a while is there any one of em you like better than another  why pa she answered i like all of em very well i think mr cunningham and mr jacks and mr harris are very nice young men they are so frank and honest in everything they say to me i havent known mr vesey very long but i think hes a very nice young man hes so frank and honest in everything he says to me  now thats what im gittin at says old hinkle youve always been sayin you like people what tell the truth and dont go humbuggin you with compliments and bogus talk now suppose you make a test of these fellers and see which one of em will talk the straightest to you  but howll i do it pa  ill tell you how you know you sing a little bit ily you took musiclessons nearly two years in logansport it wasnt long but it was all we could afford then and your teacher said you didnt have any voice and it was a waste of money to keep on now suppose you ask the fellers what they think of your singin and see what each one of em tells you the man thatll tell you the truth about itll have a mighty lot of nerve and ll do to tie to what do you think of the plan  all right pa said ileen i think its a good idea ill try it  ileen and mr hinkle went out of the room through the inside doors unobserved i hurried down to the station jacks was at his telegraph table waiting for eight oclock to come it was buds night in town and when he rode in i repeated the conversation to them both i was loyal to my rivals as all true admirers of all ileens should be  simultaneously the three of us were smitten by an uplifting thought surely this test would eliminate vesey from the contest he with his unctuous flattery would be driven from the lists well we remembered ileens love of frankness and honestyhow she treasured truth and candor above vain compliment and blandishment  linking arms we did a grotesque dance of joy up and down the platform singing muldoon was a solid man at the top of our voices  that evening four of the willow rockingchairs were filled besides the lucky one that sustained the trim figure of miss hinkle three of us awaited with suppressed excitement the application of the test it was tried on bud first  mr cunningham said ileen with her dazzling smile after she had sung when the leaves begin to turn what do you really think of my voice frankly and honestly now as you know i want you to always be toward me  bud squirmed in his chair at his chance to show the sincerity that he knew was required of him  tell you the truth miss ileen he said earnestly you aint got much more voice than a weaseljust a little squeak you know of course we all like to hear you sing for its kind of sweet and soothin after all and you look most as mighty well sittin on the pianostool as you do faced around but as for real singini reckon you couldnt call it that  i looked closely at ileen to see if bud had overdone his frankness but her pleased smile and sweetly spoken thanks assured me that we were on the right track  and what do you think mr jacks she asked next  take it from me said jacks you aint in the prima donna class ive heard em warble in every city in the united states and i tell you your vocal output dont go otherwise youve got the grand opera bunch sent to the soap factoryin looks i mean for the high screechers generally look like mary ann on her thursday out but nix for the gargle work your epiglottis aint a real sidestepperits footwork aint good  with a merry laugh at jacks criticism ileen looked inquiringly at me  i admit that i faltered a little was there not such a thing as being too frank perhaps i even hedged a little in my verdict but i stayed with the critics  i am not skilled in scientific music miss ileen i said but frankly i cannot praise very highly the singingvoice that nature has given you it has long been a favorite comparison that a great singer sings like a bird well there are birds and birds i would say that your voice reminds me of the thrushsthroaty and not strong nor of much compass or varietybut stillersweetineritsway and er  thank you mr harris interrupted miss hinkle i knew i could depend upon your frankness and honesty  and then c vincent vesey drew back one sleeve from his snowy cuff and the water came down at lodore  my memory cannot do justice to his masterly tribute to that priceless godgiven treasuremiss hinkles voice he raved over it in terms that if they had been addressed to the morning stars when they sang together would have made that stellar choir explode in a meteoric shower of flaming selfsatisfaction  he marshalled on his white fingertips the grand opera stars of all the continents from jenny lind to emma abbott only to depreciate their endowments he spoke of larynxes of chest notes of phrasing arpeggios and other strange paraphernalia of the throaty art he admitted as though driven to a corner that jenny lind had a note or two in the high register that miss hinkle had not yet acquiredbut that was a mere matter of practice and training  and as a peroration he predictedsolemnly predicteda career in vocal art for the coming star of the southwestand one of which grand old texas may well be proud hitherto unsurpassed in the annals of musical history  when we left at ten ileen gave each of us her usual warm cordial handshake entrancing smile and invitation to call again i could not see that one was favored above or below anotherbut three of us knewwe knew  we knew that frankness and honesty had won and that the rivals now numbered three instead of four  down at the station jacks brought out a pint bottle of the proper stuff and we celebrated the downfall of a blatant interloper  four days went by without anything happening worthy of recount  on the fifth jacks and i entering the brush arbor for our supper saw the mexican youth instead of a divinity in a spotless waist and a navyblue skirt taking in the dollars through the barbedwire wicket  we rushed into the kitchen meeting pa hinkle coming out with two cups of hot coffee in his hands  wheres ileen we asked in recitative  pa hinkle was a kindly man well gents said he it was a sudden notion she took but ive got the money and i let her have her way shes gone to a corna conservatory in boston for four years for to have her voice cultivated now excuse me to pass gents for this coffees hot and my thumbs is tender  that night there were four instead of three of us sitting on the station platform and swinging our feet c vincent vesey was one of us we discussed things while dogs barked at the moon that rose as big as a fivecent piece or a flour barrel over the chaparral  and what we discussed was whether it is better to lie to a woman or to tell her the truth  and as all of us were young then we did not come to a decision
