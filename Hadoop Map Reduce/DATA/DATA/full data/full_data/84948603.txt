84948603	the ruby of kishmoor   by  howard pyle     contents  prologue  i jonathan rugg  ii the mysterious lady with the silver veil  iii the terrific encounter with the oneeyed little gentleman in black  iv the momentous adventure with the stranger with the silver earrings  v the unexpected encounter with the seacaptain with the broken nose  vi the conclusion of the adventure with the lady with the silver veil  epilogue     prologue   a very famous pirate of his day was captain robertson keitt  before embarking upon his later career of infamy he was in the beginning very well known as a reputable merchant in the island of jamaica  thence entering first of all upon the business of the african trade he presently by regular degrees became a pirate and finally ended his career as one of the most renowned freebooters of history  the remarkable adventure through which he at once reached the pinnacle of success and became in his profession the most famous figure of his day was the capture of the rajah of kishmoors great ship the sun of the east  in this vessel was the rajahs favorite queen who together with her attendants were set upon a pilgrimage to mecca  the court of this great oriental potentate was as may be readily supposed fairly aglitter with gold and jewels so that what with such personal adornments that the queen and her attendants had fetched with them besides an ample treasury for the expenses of the expedition an incredible prize of gold and jewels rewarded the freebooters for their successful adventure  among the precious stones taken in this great purchase was the splendid ruby of kishmoor  this as may be known to the reader was one of the worlds greatest gems and was unique alike both for its prodigious size and the splendor of its color  this precious jewel the rajah of kishmoor had upon a certain occasion bestowed upon his queen and at the time of her capture she wore it as the centrepiece of a sort of a coronet which encircled her forehead and brow  the seizure by the pirate of so considerable a person as that of the queen of kishmoor and of the enormous treasure that he found aboard her ship would alone have been sufficient to have established his fame  but the capture of so extraordinary a prize as that of the rubywhich was in itself worth the value of an entire oriental kingdomexalted him at once to the very highest pinnacle of renown  having achieved the capture of this incredible prize our captain scuttled the great ship and left her to sink with all on board three lascars of the crew alone escaped to bear the news of this tremendous disaster to an astounded world  as may readily be supposed it was now no longer possible for captain keitt to hope to live in such comparative obscurity as he had before enjoyed  his was now too remarkable a figure in the eyes of the world several expeditions from various parts were immediately fitted out against him and it presently became no longer compatible with his safety to remain thus clearly outlined before the eyes of the world accordingly he immediately set about seeking such security as he might now hope to find which he did the more readily since he had now and at one cast so entirely fulfilled his most sanguine expectations of goodfortune and of fame  thereafter accordingly the adventures of our captain became of a more apocryphal sort  it was known that he reached the west indies in safety for he was once seen at port royal and twice at spanish town in the island of jamaica  thereafter however he disappeared nor was it until several years later that the world heard anything concerning him  one day a certain nicholas duckworthy who had once been gunner aboard the pirate captains own ship the good fortune was arrested in the town of bristol in the very act of attempting to sell to a merchant of that place several valuable gems from a quantity which he carried with him tied up in a red bandanna handkerchief  in the confession of which duckworthy afterward delivered himself he declared that captain keitt after his great adventure having sailed from africa in safety and so reached the shores of the new world had wrecked the good fortune on a coral reef off the windward islands that he then immediately deserted the ship and together with duckworthy himself the sailingmaster who was a portuguese the captain of a brig the bloody hand a consort of keitts and a villainous rascal named hunt who occupying no precise position among the pirates was at once the instigator of and the partaker in the greatest part of captain keitts wickednesses made his way to the nearest port of safety  these five worthies at last fetched the island of jamaica bringing with them all of the jewels and some of the gold that had been captured from the sun of the east  but upon coming to a division of their booty it was presently discovered that the rajahs ruby had mysteriously disappeared from the collection of jewels to be divided  the other pirates immediately suspected their captain of having secretly purloined it and indeed so certain were they of his turpitude that they immediately set about taking means to force a confession from him  in this however they were so far unsuccessful that the captain refusing to yield to their importunities had suffered himself to die under their hands and had so carried the secret of the hidingplace of the great rubyif he possessed such a secretalong with him  duckworthy concluded his confession by declaring that in his opinion he himself the portuguese sailingmaster the captain of the bloody hand and hunt were the only ones of captain keitts crew who were now alive for that the good fortune must have broken up in a storm which immediately followed their desertion of her in which event the entire crew must inevitably have perished  it may be added that duckworthy himself was shortly hanged so that if his surmise was true there was now only three left alive of all that wicked crew that had successfully carried to its completion the greatest adventure which any pirate in the world had ever perhaps embarked upon     i jonathan rugg   you may never know what romantic aspirations may lie hidden beneath the most sedate and sober demeanor  to have observed jonathan rugg who was a tall lean loosejointed young quaker of a somewhat forbidding aspect with straight dark hair and a bony overhanging forehead set into a frown a pair of small deepset eyes and a square jaw no one would for a moment have suspected that he concealed beneath so serious an exterior any appetite for romantic adventure  nevertheless finding himself suddenly transported as it were from the quiet of so sober a town as that of philadelphia to the tropical enchantment of kingston in the island of jamaica the night brilliant with a full moon that swung in an opal sky the warm and luminous darkness replete with the mysteries of a tropical night and burdened with the odors of a land breeze he suddenly discovered himself to be overtaken with so vehement a desire for some unwonted excitement that had the opportunity presented itself he felt himself ready to embrace any adventure with the utmost eagerness no matter whither it would have conducted him  at home where he was a clerk in the countinghouse of a leading merchant by name jeremiah doolittle should such idle fancies have come to him he would have looked upon himself as little better than a fool but now that he found himself for the first time in a foreign country surrounded by such strange and unusual sights and sounds all conducive to extravagant imaginations the wish for some extraordinary and altogether unusual experience took possession of him with a singular vehemence to which he had heretofore been altogether a stranger  in the street where he stood which was of a shining whiteness and which reflected the effulgence of the moonlight with an incredible distinction he observed stretching before him long lines of white garden walls overtopped by a prodigious luxuriance of tropical foliage  in these gardens and set close to the street stood several pretentious villas and mansions the slatted blinds and curtains of the windows of which were raised to admit of the freer entrance of the cool and balmy air of the night  from within there issued forth bright lights together with the exhilarating sound of merry voices laughing and talking or perhaps a song accompanied by the tinkling music of a spinet or of a guitar  an occasional group of figures clad in light and summerlike garments and adorned with gay and startling colors passed him through the moonlight so that what with the brightness and warmth of the night together with all these unusual sights and sounds it appeared to jonathan rugg that he was rather the inhabitant of some extraordinary land of enchantment and unreality than a dweller upon that sober and solid world in which he had heretofore passed his entire existence  before continuing this narrative the reader may here be informed that our hero had come into this enchanted world as the supercargo of the ship susanna hayes of philadelphia that he had for several years proved himself so honest and industrious a servant to the merchant house of the worthy jeremiah doolittle that that benevolent man had given to his welldeserving clerk this opportunity at once of gratifying an inclination for foreign travel and of filling a position of trust that should redound to his individual profit  the susanna hayes had entered kingston harbor that afternoon and this was jonathans first night spent in those tropical latitudes whither his fancy and his imagination had so often carried him while he stood over the desk filing the accounts of invoices from foreign parts  it might be finally added that had he at all conceived how soon and to what a degree his sudden inclination for adventure was to be gratified his romantic aspirations might have been somewhat dashed at the prospect that lay before him     ii the mysterious lady with the silver veil   at that moment our hero suddenly became conscious of the fact that a small wicket in a wooden gate near which he stood had been opened and that the eyes of an otherwise concealed countenance were observing him with the utmost closeness of scrutiny  he had hardly time to become aware of this observation of his person when the gate itself was opened and there appeared before him in the moonlight the bent and crooked figure of an aged negress  she was clad in a calamanco raiment and was further adorned with a variety of gaudily colored trimmings vastly suggestive of the tropical world of which she was an inhabitant her woolly head was enveloped after the fashion of her people in the folds of a gigantic and flaming red turban constructed of an entire pockethandkerchief  her face was pockpitted to an incredible degree so that what with this deformity emphasized by the pouting of her prodigious and shapeless lips and the rolling of a pair of eyes as yellow as saffron jonathan rugg thought that he had never beheld a figure at once so extraordinary and so repulsive  it occurred to our hero that here maybe was to overtake him such an adventure as that which he had just a moment before been desiring so ardently  nor was he mistaken for the negress first looking this way and then that with an extremely wary and cunning expression and apparently having satisfied herself that the street for the moment was pretty empty of passers beckoned to him to draw nearer  when he had approached close enough to her she caught him by the sleeve and instantly drawing him into the garden beyond shut and bolted the gate with a quickness and a silence suggestive of the most extravagant secrecy  at the same moment a huge negro suddenly appeared from the shadow of the gatepost and so placed himself between jonathan and the gate that any attempt to escape would inevitably have entailed a conflict upon our heros part with the sable and giant guardian  says the negress looking very intently at our hero be you afeard buckra  why no quothed jonathan for to tell thee the truth friend though i am a man of peace being of that religious order known as the society of friends i am not so weak in person nor so timid in disposition as to warrant me in being afraid of any one indeed were i of a mind to escape i might without boasting declare my belief that i should be able to push my way past even a better man than thy large friend who stands so threateningly in front of yonder gate  at these words the negress broke into so prodigious a grin that in the moonlight it appeared as though the whole lower part of her face had been transformed into shining teeth  you be a brave buckra says she in her gibbering english  you come wid melina and melina take you to pretty lady who want you to eat supper wid her  thereupon and allowing our hero no opportunity to decline this extraordinary invitation even had he been of a mind to do so she took him by the hand and led him toward the large and imposing house which commanded the garden  indeed says jonathan to himself as he followed his sable guidehimself followed in turn by the gigantic negroindeed i am like to have my fill of adventure if anything is to be judged from such a beginning as this  nor did the interior sumptuousness of the mansion at all belie the imposing character of its exterior for entering by way of an illuminated veranda and so coming into a brilliantly lighted hallway beyond jonathan beheld himself to be surrounded by such a wealth of exquisite and wellappointed tastefulness as it had never before been his goodfortune to behold  candles of clarified wax sparkled like stars in chandeliers of crystal these in turn catching the illumination glittered in prismatic fragments with all the varied colors of the rainbow so that a mellow yet brilliant radiance filled the entire apartment polished mirrors of a spotless clearness framed in golden frames and built into the walls reflected the waxed floors the rich oriental carpets and the sumptuous paintings that hung against the ivorytinted paneling so that in appearance the beauties of the apartment were continued in bewildering vistas upon every side toward which the beholder directed his gaze  bidding our hero to be seated which he did with no small degree of embarrassment and constraint and upon the extreme edge of the gilt and satincovered chair the negress who had been his conductor left him for the time being to his own contemplation  almost before he had an opportunity to compose himself into anything more than a part of his ordinary sedateness of demeanor the silken curtains at the doorway at the other end of the apartment were suddenly divided and jonathan beheld before him a female figure displaying the most exquisite contour of mould and of proportion  she was clad entirely in white and was enveloped from head to foot in the folds of a veil of delicate silver gauze which though hiding her countenance from recognition nevertheless permitted sufficient of her beauties to be discerned to suggest the extreme elegance and loveliness of her lineaments advancing toward our hero and extending to him a tapering hand as white as alabaster the fingers encircled with a multitude of jewelled rings she addressed him thus  sir she said speaking in accents of the most silvery and musical cadence you are no doubt vastly surprised to find yourself thus unexpectedly and almost as by violence introduced into the house of one who is such an entire stranger to you as myself  but though i am unknown to you i must inform you that i am better acquainted with my visitor for my agents have been observing you ever since you landed this afternoon at the dock and they have followed you ever since until a little while ago when you stopped immediately opposite my garden gate  these agents have observed you with a closeness of scrutiny of which you are doubtless entirely unaware  they have even informed me that owing doubtless to your extreme interest in your new surroundings you have not as yet supped  knowing this and that you must now be enjoying a very hearty appetite i have to ask you if you will do me the extreme favor of sitting at table with me at a repast which you will doubtless be surprised to learn has been hastily prepared entirely in your honor  so saying and giving jonathan no time for reply she offered him her hand and with the most polite insistence conducted him into an exquisitely appointed dining room adjoining  here stood a table covered with a snowwhite cloth and embellished with silver and crystal ornaments of every description  having seated herself and having indicated to jonathan to take the chair opposite to her the two were presently served with a repast such as our hero had not thought could have existed out of the pages of certain extraordinary oriental tales which one time had fallen to his lot to read  this supper which in itself might successfully have tempted the taste of a sybarite was further enhanced by several wines and cordials which filling the room with the aroma of the sunlit grapes from which they had been expressed stimulated the appetite which without them needed no such spur  the lady who ate but sparingly herself possessed herself with patience until jonathans hunger had been appeased  when however she beheld that he weakened in his attacks upon the dessert of sweets with which the banquet was concluded she addressed him upon the business which was evidently entirely occupying her mind  sir said she you are doubtless aware that every one whether man or woman is possessed of an enemy  in my own case i must inform you that i have no less than three who to compass their ends would gladly sacrifice my life itself to their purposes  at no time am i safe from their machinations nor have i any one cried she exhibiting a great emotion to whom i may turn in my need  it was this that led me to hope to find in you a friend in my perils for having observed through my agents that you are not only honest in disposition and strong in person but that you are possessed of a considerable degree of energy and determination i am most desirous of imposing upon your goodnature a trust of which you cannot for a moment suspect the magnitude  tell me are you willing to assist a poor defenceless female in her hour of trial  indeed friend quoth jonathan with more vivacity than he usually exhibited with a lenity to which he had heretofore in his lifetime been a strangerbeing warmed into such a spirit doubtless by the generous wines of which he had partakenindeed friend if i could but see thy face it would doubtless make my decision in such a matter the more favorable since i am inclined to think from the little i can behold of it that thy appearance must be extremely comely to the eye  sir said the lady exhibiting some amusement at this unexpected sally i am you must know as god made me  sometime perhaps i may be very glad to satisfy your curiosity and exhibit to you my poor countenance such as it is  but nowand here she reverted to her more serious moodi must again put it to you are you willing to help an unprotected woman in a period of very great danger to herself  should you decline the assistance which i solicit my slaves shall conduct you to the gate through which you entered and suffer you to depart in peace  should you upon the other hand accept the trust you are to receive no reward therefor except the gratitude of one who thus appeals to you in her helplessness  for a few moments jonathan fell silent for here indeed was he entering into an adventure which infinitely surpassed any anticipation that he could have formed  he was besides of a cautious nature and was entirely disinclined to embark into any affair so obscure and tangled as that in which he now found himself becoming involved  friend said he at last i may tell thee that thy story has so far moved me as to give me every inclination to help thee in thy difficulties but i must also inform thee that i am a man of caution having never before entered into any business of this sort  therefore before giving any promise that may bind my future actions i must in common wisdom demand to know what are the conditions that thou hast in mind to impose upon me  indeed sir cried the lady with great vivacity and with more cheerful accentsas though her mind had been relieved of a burden of fear that her companion might at once have declined even a consideration of her requestindeed sir you will find that the trust which i would impose upon you is in appearance no such great matter as my words may have led you to suppose  you must know that i am possessed of a little trinket which in the hands of any one who like yourself is a stranger in these parts would possess no significance but which while in my keeping is fraught with infinite menace to me  hereupon and having so spoken she clapped her hands and an attendant immediately entered disclosing the person of the same negress who had first introduced jonathan into the strange adventure in which he now found himself involved  this creature who appeared still more deformed and repulsive in the brilliantly lighted room than she had in the moonlight carried in her hands a white napkin which she handed to her mistress  this being opened disclosed a small ivory ball of about the bigness of a lime  nodding to the negress to withdraw the lady handed him the ivory ball and jonathan took it with no small degree of curiosity and examined it carefully  it appeared to be of an exceeding antiquity and of so deep a yellow as to be almost brown in color  it was covered over with strange figures and characters of an oriental sort which appeared to our hero to be of chinese workmanship  i must tell you sir said the lady after she had permitted her guest to examine this for a while in silence that though this appears to you to be of little worth it is yet of extreme value  after all however it is nothing but a curiosity that any one who is interested in such matters might possess  what i have to ask you is this will you be willing to take this into your charge to guard it with the utmost care and fidelityyes even as the apple of your eyeduring your continuance in these parts and to return it to me in safety the day before your departure by so doing you will render me a service which you may neither understand nor comprehend but which shall make me your debtor for my entire life  by this time jonathan had pretty well composed his mind for a reply  friend said he such a matter as this is entirely out of my knowledge of business which is indeed that of a clerk in the mercantile profession  nevertheless i have every inclination to help thee though i trust thou mayest have magnified the dangers that beset thee  this appears to me to be a little trifle for such an ado nevertheless i will do as thou dost request  i will keep it in safety and will return it to thee upon this day a week hence by which time i hope to have discharged my cargo and be ready to continue my voyage to demerara  at these words the lady who had been watching him all the time with a most unaccountable eagerness burst forth into words of such heartfelt gratitude as to entirely overwhelm our hero  when her transports had been somewhat assuaged she permitted him to depart and the negress conducted him back through the garden whence she presently showed him through the gate whither he had entered and out into the street     iii the terrific encounter with the oneeyed little gentleman in black   finding himself once more in the open street jonathan rugg stood for a while in the moonlight endeavoring to compose his mind into somewhat of that sobriety that was habitual with him for indeed he was not a little excited by the unexpected incidents that had just befallen him from this effort at composure he was aroused by observing that a little gentleman clad all in black had stopped at a little distance away and was looking very intently at him  in the brightness of the moonlight our hero could see that the little gentleman possessed but a single eye and that he carried a goldheaded cane in his hand  he had hardly time to observe these particulars when the other approached him with every appearance of politeness and cordiality  sir said he surely i am not mistaken in recognizing in you the supercargo of the ship susanna hayes which arrived this afternoon at this port  indeed said jonathan thou art right friend  that is my occupation and that is whence i came  to be sure  said the little gentleman  to be sure  to be sure the susanna hayes with a cargo of indiancorn meal and from dear good friend jeremiah doolittle of philadelphia  i know your good master very wellvery well indeed  and have you never heard him speak of his friend mr abner greenway of kingston jamaica  why no replied jonathan i have no such recollection of the name nor do i know that any such name hath ever appeared upon our books  to be sure  to be sure  repeated the little gentleman briskly and with exceeding goodnature  indeed my name is not likely to have ever appeared upon his books for i am not a business correspondent but one who in times past was his extremely intimate friend  there is much i would like to ask about him and indeed i was in hopes that you would have been the bearer of a letter from him  but i have lodgings at a little distance from here so that if it is not requesting too much of you maybe you will accompany me thither so that we may talk at our leisure  i would gladly accompany you to your ship instead of urging you to come to my apartments but i must tell you i am possessed of a devil of a fever so that my physician hath forbidden me to be out of nights  indeed said jonathan whom you may have observed was of a very easy dispositionindeed i shall be very glad to accompany thee to thy lodgings  there is nothing i would like better than to serve any friend of good jeremiah doolittles  and thereupon and with great amity the two walked off together the little oneeyed gentleman in black linking his arm confidingly into that of jonathans and tapping the pavement continually with his cane as he trotted on at a great pace  he was very well acquainted with the town of which he was a citizen and so interesting was his discourse that they had gone a considerable distance before jonathan observed they were entering into a quarter darker and less frequented than that which they had quitted  tall brick houses stood upon either side between which stretched a narrow crooked roadway with a kennel running down the centre  in front of one of these housesa tall and gloomy structureour heros conductor stopped and opening the door with a key beckoned for him to enter  jonathan having complied his newfound friend led the way up a flight of steps against which jonathans feet beat noisily in the darkness and at length having ascended two stairways and having reached a landing he opened a door at the end of the passage and ushered jonathan into an apartment unlighted except for the moonshine which coming in through a partly open shutter lay in a brilliant patch of light upon the floor  his conductor having struck a light with a flint and steel our hero by the illumination of a single candle presently discovered himself to be in a bedchamber furnished with no small degree of comfort and even elegance and having every appearance of a bachelors chamber  you will pardon me said his new acquaintance if i shut these shutters and the window for that devilish fever of which i spoke is of such a sort that i must keep the night air even out from my room or else i shall be shaking the bones out of my joints and chattering the teeth out of my head by tomorrow morning  so saying he was as good as his word and not only drew the shutters to but shot the heavy iron bolt into its place  having accomplished this he bade our hero to be seated and placing before him some exceedingly superior rum together with some equally excellent tobacco they presently fell into the friendliest discourse imaginable  in the course of their talk which after awhile became exceedingly confidential jonathan confided to his new friend the circumstances of the adventure into which he had been led by the beautiful stranger and to all that he said concerning his adventure his interlocutor listened with the closest and most scrupulously riveted attention  upon my word said he when jonathan had concluded i hope that you may not have been made the victim of some foolish hoax let me see what it is she has confided to you  that i will replied jonathan  and thereupon he thrust his hand into his breechespocket and brought forth the ivory ball  no sooner did the one eye of the little gentleman in black light upon the object than a most singular and extraordinary convulsion appeared to seize upon him  had a bullet penetrated his heart he could not have started more violently nor have sat more rigidly and breathlessly staring  mastering his emotion with the utmost difficulty as jonathan replaced the ball in his pocket he drew a deep and profound breath and wiped the palm of his hand across his forehead as though arousing himself from a dream  and you he said of a sudden are i understand it a quaker do you then never carry a weapon even in such a place as this where at any moment in the dark a spanish knife may be stuck betwixt your ribs  why no said jonathan somewhat surprised that so foreign a topic should have been so suddenly introduced into the discourse i am a man of peace and not of blood  the people of the society of friends never carry weapons either of offence or defence  as jonathan concluded his reply the little gentleman suddenly arose from his chair and moved briskly around to the other side of the room our hero watching him with some surprise beheld him clap to the door and with a single movement shoot the bolt and turn the key therein the next instant he turned to jonathan a visage transformed as suddenly as though he had dropped a mask from his face  the gossiping and polite little old bachelor was there no longer but in his stead a man with a countenance convulsed with some furious and nameless passion  that ball he cried in a hoarse and raucous voice  that ivory ball  give it to me upon the instant  as he spoke he whipped out from his bosom a long keen spanish knife that in its every appearance spoke without equivocation of the most murderous possibilities  the malignant passions that distorted every lineament of the countenance of the little old gentleman in black filled our hero with such astonishment that he knew not whether he were asleep or awake but when he beheld the other advancing with the naked and shining knife in his hand his reason returned to him like a flash  leaping to his feet he lost no time in putting the table between himself and his sudden enemy  indeed friend he cried in a voice penetrated with terrorindeed friend thou hadst best keep thy distance from me for though i am a man of peace and a shunner of bloodshed i promise thee that i will not stand still to be murdered without outcry or without endeavoring to defend my life  cry as loud as you please exclaimed the other  no one is near this place to hear you  cry until you are hoarse no one in this neighborhood will stop to ask what is the matter with you  i tell you i am determined to possess myself of that ivory ball and have it i shall even though i am obliged to cut out your heart to get it  as he spoke he grinned with so extraordinary and devilish a distortion of his countenance and with such an appearance of every intention of carrying out his threat as to send the gooseflesh creeping like icy fingers up and down our heros spine with the most incredible rapidity and acuteness  nevertheless mastering his fears jonathan contrived to speak up with a pretty good appearance of spirit  indeed friend he said thou appearest to forget that i am a man of twice thy bulk and half thy years and that though thou hast a knife i am determined to defend myself to the last extremity  i am not going to give thee that which thou demandest of me and for thy sake i advise thee to open the door and let me go free as i entered or else harm may befall thee  fool cried the other hardly giving him time to end  do you then think that i have time to chatter with you while two villains are lying in wait for me perhaps at the very door blame your own self for your death  and gnashing his teeth with an indescribable menace and resting his hand upon the table he vaulted with incredible agility clean across it and upon our hero who entirely unprepared for such an extraordinary attack was flung back against the wall with an arm as strong as steel clutching his throat and a knife flashing in his very eyes with dreadful portent of instant death  with an instinct to preserve his life he caught his assailant by the wrist and bending it away from himself set every fibre of his body in a superhuman effort to guard and protect himself  the other though so much older and smaller seemed to be composed entirely of fibres of steel and in his murderous endeavors put forth a strength so extraordinary that for a moment our hero felt his heart melt within him with terror for his life  the spittal appeared to dry up within his mouth and his hair to creep and rise upon his head  with a vehement cry of despair and anguish he put forth one stupendous effort for defence and clapping his heel behind the others leg and throwing his whole weight forward he fairly tripped his antagonist backward as he stood together they fell upon the floor locked in the most desperate embrace and overturning a chair with a prodigious clatter in their descentour hero upon the top and the little gentleman in black beneath him  as they struck the floor the little man in black emitted a most piercing and terrible scream and instantly relaxing his efforts of attack fell to beating the floor with the back of his hands and drubbing with his heels upon the rug in which he had become entangled  our hero leaped to his feet and with dilating eyes and expanding brain and swimming sight stared down upon the other like one turned to a stone  he beheld instantly what had occurred and that he had without so intending killed a fellowman  the knife turned away from his own person had in their fall been plunged into the bosom of the other and he now lay quivering in the last throes of death as jonathan gazed he beheld a thin red stream trickle out from the parted and grinning lips he beheld the eyes turn inward he beheld the eyelids contract he beheld the figure stretch itself he beheld it become still in death     iv the momentous adventure with the stranger with the silver earrings   so our hero stood stunned and bedazed gazing down upon his victim like a man turned into a stone  his brain appeared to him to expand like a bubble the blood surged and bummed in his ears with every gigantic beat of his heart his vision swam and his trembling hands were bedewed with a cold and repugnant sweat  the dead figure upon the floor at his feet gazed at him with a wide glassy stare and in the confusion of his mind it appeared to jonathan that he was indeed a murderer  what monstrous thing was this that had befallen him who but a moment before had been so entirely innocent of the guilt of blood  what was he now to do in such an extremity as this with his victim lying dead at his feet a poniard in his heart  who would believe him to be guiltless of crime with such a dreadful evidence as this presented against him  how was he a stranger in a foreign land to totally defend himself against an accusing of mistaken justice  at these thoughts a developed terror gripped at his vitals and a sweat as cold as ice bedewed his entire body no he must tarry for no explanation or defense  he must immediately fly from this terrible place or else should he be discovered his doom would certainly be sealed  at that moment and in the very extremity of his apprehensions there fell of a sudden a knock upon the door sounding so loud and so startling upon the silence of the room that every shattered nerve in our heros frame tingled and thrilled in answer to it  he stood petrified scarcely so much as daring to breathe and then observing that his mouth was agape he moistened his dry and parching lips and drew his jaws together with a snap  again there fell the same loud insistent knock upon the panel followed by the imperative words open within  the wretched jonathan flung about him a glance at once of terror and of despair but there was for him no possible escape  he was shut tight in the room with his dead victim like a rat in a trap  nothing remained for him but to obey the summons from without  indeed in the very extremity of his distraction he possessed reason enough to perceive that the longer he delayed opening the door the less innocent he might hope to appear in the eyes of whoever stood without  with the uncertain and spasmodic movements of an illconstructed automaton he crossed the room and stepping very carefully over the prostrate body upon the floor and with a hesitating reluctance that he could in no degree master he unlocked unbolted and opened the door  the figure that outlined itself in the light of the candle against the blackness of the passageway without was of such a singular and foreign aspect as to fit extremely well into the extraordinary tragedy of which jonathan was at once the victim and the cause  it was that of a lean tall man with a thin yellow countenance embellished with a long black mustache and having a pair of forbidding deeply set and extremely restless black eyes  a crimson handkerchief beneath a lace cocked hat was tied tightly around the head and a pair of silver earrings which caught the light of the candle gleamed and twinkled against the inky darkness of the passageway beyond  this extraordinary being without favoring our hero with any word of apology for his intrusion immediately thrust himself forward into the room and stretching his long lean birdlike neck so as to direct his gaze over the intervening table fixed a gaping and concentrated stare upon the figure lying still and motionless in the centre of the room  vat you do dare said he with a guttural and foreign accent and thereupon without waiting for a reply came forward and knelt down beside the dead man  after thrusting his hand into the silent and shrunken bosom he presently looked up and fixed his penetrating eyes upon our heros countenance who benumbed and bedazed with his despair still stood like one enchained in the bonds of a nightmare he vas dead said the stranger and jonathan nodded his head in reply  vy you keel ze man inquired his interlocutor  indeed cried jonathan finding a voice at last but one so hoarse that he could hardly recognize it for his own i know not what to make of the affair  but indeed i do assure thee friend that i am entirely innocent of what thou seest  the stranger still kept his piercing gaze fixed upon our heros countenance and jonathan feeling that something further was demanded of him continued i am indeed a victim of a most extravagant and extraordinary adventure  this evening coming an entire stranger to this country i was introduced into the house of a beautiful female who bestowed upon me a charge that appeared to me to be at once insignificant and absurd  behold this little ivory ball said he drawing the globe from his pocket and displaying it between his thumb and finger  it is this that appears to have brought all this disaster upon me for coming from the house of the young woman the man whom thou now beholdest lying dead upon the floor induced me to come to this place  having inveigled me hither he demanded of me to give him at once this insignificant trifle  upon my refusing to do so he assaulted me with every appearance of a mad and furious inclination to deprive me of my life  at the sight of the ivory ball the stranger quickly arose from his kneeling posture and fixed upon our hero a gaze the most extraordinary that he had ever encountered  his eyes dilated like those of a cat the breath expelled itself from his bosom in so deep and profound an expiration that it appeared as though it might never return again  nor was it until jonathan had replaced the ball in his pocket that he appeared to awaken from the trance that the sight of the object had sent him into  but no sooner had the cause of this strange demeanor disappeared into our heros breechespocket than he arose as with an electric shock  in an instant he became transformed as by the touch of magic  a sudden and baleful light flamed into his eyes his face grew as red as blood and he clapped his hand to his pocket with a sudden and violent motion  ze ball he cried in a hoarse and strident voice  ze ball  give me ze ball  and upon the next instant our hero beheld the round and shining nozzle of a pistol pointed directly against his forehead  for a moment he stood as though transfixed then in the mortal peril that faced him he uttered a roar that sounded in his own ears like the outcry of a wild beast and thereupon flung himself bodily upon the other with the violence and the fury of a madman  the stranger drew the trigger and the powder flashed in the pan he dropped the weapon clattering and in an instant tried to draw another from his other pocket  before he could direct his aim however our hero had caught him by both wrists and bending his hand backward prevented the chance of any shot from taking immediate effect upon his person  then followed a struggle of extraordinary ferocity and frenzythe stranger endeavoring to free his hand and jonathan striving with all the energy of despair to prevent him from effecting his murderous purpose  in the struggle our hero became thrust against the edge of the table he felt as though his back were breaking and became conscious that in such a situation he could hope to defend himself only a few moments longer  the strangers face was pressed close to his own  his hot breath strong with the odor of garlic fanned our heros cheek while his lips distended into a ferocious and ferine grin displayed his sharp teeth shining in the candlelight  give me ze ball he said in a harsh and furious whisper  at the moment there rang in jonathans ears the sudden and astounding detonation of a pistolshot and for a moment he wondered whether he had received a mortal wound without being aware of it  then suddenly he beheld an extraordinary and dreadful transformation take place in the countenance thrust so close to his own the eyes winked several times with incredible rapidity and then rolled upward and inward the jaws gaped into a dreadful and cavernous yawn the pistol fell with a clatter to the floor and the next moment the muscles so rigid but an instant before relaxed into a limp and listless flaccidity  the joints collapsed and the entire man fell into an indistinguishable heap upon and across the dead figure stretched out upon the floor while at the same time a pungent and blinding cloud of gunpowder smoke filled the apartment  for a few moments the hands twitched convulsively the neck stretched itself to an abominable length the long lean legs slowly and gradually relaxed and every fibre of the body gradually collapsed into the lassitude of death  a spot of blood appeared and grew upon the collar at the throat and in the same degree the color ebbed from the face leaving it of a dull and leaden pallor  all these terrible and formidable changes of aspect our hero stood watching with a motionless and riveted attention and as though they were to him matters of the utmost consequence and importance and only when the last flicker of life had departed from his second victim did he lift his gaze from this terrible scene of dissolution to stare about him this way and that his eyes blinded and his breath stifled by the thick cloud of sulphurous smoke that obscured the objects about him in a pungent cloud     v the unexpected encounter with the seacaptain with the broken nose   if our hero had been distracted and bedazed by the first catastrophe that had befallen this second and even more dreadful and violent occurrence appeared to take away from him for the moment every power of thought and of sensation  all that perturbation of emotion that had before convulsed him he discovered to have disappeared and in its stead a benumbed and blinded intelligence alone remained to him  as he stood in the presence of this second death of which he had been as innocent and as unwilling an instrument as he had of the first he could observe no signs either of remorse or of horror within him  he picked up his hat which had fallen upon the floor in the first encounter and brushing away the dust with the cuff of his coat sleeve with extraordinary care adjusted the beaver upon his head with the utmost nicety  then turning still stupefied as with the fumes of some powerful drug he prepared to quit the scene of tragic terrors that had thus unexpectedly accumulated upon him  but ere he could put his design into execution his ears were startled by the sound of loud and hurried footsteps which coming from below ascended the stairs with a prodigious clatter and bustle of speed  at the landing these footsteps paused for a while and then approached more cautious and deliberate toward the room where the double tragedy had been enacted and where our hero yet stood silent and inert  all this while jonathan made no endeavor to escape but stood passive and submissive to what might occur  he felt himself the victim of circumstances over which he himself had no control gazing at the partly opened door he awaited for whatever adventure might next befall him  once again the footsteps paused this time at the very threshold and then the door was slowly pushed open from without  as our hero gazed at the aperture there presently became disclosed to his view the strong and robust figure of one who was evidently of a seafaring habit  from the gold braid upon his hat the seals dangling from the ribbon at his fob and a certain particularity of custom he was evidently one of no small consideration in his profession  he was of a strong and powerful build with a head set close to his shoulders and upon a round short bull neck  he wore a black cravat loosely tied into a knot and a red waistcoat elaborately trimmed with gold braid a leather belt with a brass buckle and hanger and huge seaboots completed a costume singularly suggestive of his occupation in life  his face was round and broad like that of a cat and a complexion stained by constant exposure to the sun and wind to a color of newly polished mahogany  but a countenance which otherwise might have been humorous in this case was rendered singularly repulsive by the fact that his nose had been broken so flat to his face that all that remained to distinguish that feature were two circular orifices where the nostrils should have been  his eyes were by no means so sinister as the rest of his visage being of a lightgray color and exceedingly vivaciouseven goodnatured in the merry restlessness of their glancealbeit they were wellnigh hidden beneath a black bush of overhanging eyebrows  when he spoke his voice was so deep and resonant that it was as though it issued from a barrel rather than from the breast of a human being  how now my hearty cried he in stentorian tones so loud that they seemed to stun the tensely drawn drums of our heros ears how now my hearty  whats todo here  who is shooting pistols at this hour of the night  then catching sight of the figures lying in a huddle upon the floor his great thick lips parted into a gape of wonder and his gray eyes rolled in his head like two balls so that what with his flat face and the round holes of his nostrils he presented an appearance which under other circumstances would have been at once ludicrous and grotesque  by the blood cried he to be sure it is murder that has happened here  not murder cried jonathan in a shrill and panting voice  not murder  it was all an accident and i am as innocent as a baby  the newcomer looked at him and then at the two figures upon the floor and then back at him again with eyes at once quizzical and cunning then his face broke into a grin that might hardly be called of drollery  accident  quoth he  by the blood dye see tis a strange accident indeed that lays two men by the heels and lets the third go without a scratch  delivering himself thus he came forward into the room and taking the last victim of jonathans adventure by the arm with as little compunction as he would have handled a sack of grain he dragged the limp and helpless figure from where it lay to the floor beside the first victim  then lifting the lighted candle he bent over the two prostrate bodies holding the illumination close to the lineaments first of one and then of the other  he looked at them very carefully for a long while with the closest and most intent scrutiny and in perfect silence  they are both as dead says he as davy jones and whoever you be i protest that you have done your business the most completest that i ever saw in all of my life  indeed cried jonathan in the same shrill and panting voice it was themselves who did it  first one of them attacked me and then the other and i did but try to keep them from murdering me this one fell on his knife and that one shot himself in his efforts to destroy me  that says the seaman you may very well tell to a drylander and maybe he will believe you but you cannot so easily pull the wool over the eyes of captain benny willitts  and what if i may be so bold as for to ask you was the reason for their attacking so harmless a man as you proclaim yourself to be  that i know not cried jonathan but i am entirely willing to tell thee all the circumstances  thou must know that i am a member of the society of friends  this day i landed here in kingston and met a young woman of very comely appearance who intrusted me with this little ivory ball which she requested me to keep for her a few days the sight of this ballin which i can detect nothing that could be likely to arouse any feelings of violenceappears to have driven these two men entirely mad so that they instantly made the most ferocious and murderous assault upon me  see wouldst thou have believed that so small a thing as this would have caused so much trouble  and as he spoke he held up to the gaze of the other the cause of the double tragedy that had befallen  but no sooner had captain willittss eyes lighted upon the ball than the most singular change passed over his countenance  the color appeared to grow dull and yellow in his ruddy cheeks his fat lips dropped apart and his eyes stared with a fixed and glassy glare  he arose to his feet and still with the expression of astonishment and wonder upon his face gazed first at our hero and then at the ivory ball in his hands as though he were deprived both of reason and of speech  at last as our hero slipped the trifle back in his pocket again the mariner slowly recovered himself though with a prodigious effort and drew a deep and profound breath as to the very bottom of his lungs  he wiped with the corner of his black silk cravat his brow upon which the sweat appeared to have gathered well messmate says he at last with a sudden change of voice you have indeed had a most wonderful adventure  then with another deep breath well by the blood  i may tell you plainly that i am no poor hand at the reading of faces  well i think you to be honest and i am inclined to believe every word you tell me  by the blood  i am prodigiously sorry for you and am inclined to help you out of your scrape  the first thing to do he continued is to get rid of these two dead men and that is an affair i believe we shall have no trouble in handling  one of them we will wrap up in the carpet here and tother we can roll into yonder bedcurtain  you shall carry the one and i the other and the harbor being at no great distance we can easily bring them thither and tumble them overboard and no one will be the wiser of what has happened  for your own safety as you may easily see you can hardly go away and leave these objects here to be found by the firstcomer and to arise up in evidence against you  this reasoning in our heros present bewildered state appeared to him to be so extremely just that he raised not the least objection to it accordingly each of the two silent voiceless victims of the evenings occurrences were wrapped into a bundle that from without appeared to be neither portentous nor terrible in appearance  thereupon jonathan shouldering the rug containing the little gentleman in black and the seacaptain doing the like for the other they presently made their way down the stairs through the darkness and so out into the street  here the seacaptain became the conductor of the expedition and leading the way down several alleys and along certain bystreetsnow and then stopping to rest for the burdens were both heavy and clumsy to carrythey both came out at last to the harbor front without any one having questioned them or having appeared to suspect them of anything wrong  at the waterside was an open wharf extending a pretty good distance out into the harbor  thither the captain led the way and jonathan followed  so they made their way out along the wharf or pier stumbling now and then over loose boards until they came at last to where the water was of a sufficient depth for their purpose  here the captain bending his shoulders shot his burden out into the dark mysterious waters and jonathan following his example did the same  each body sank with a sullen and leaden splash into the element where the casings which swathed them becoming loosened the rug and the curtain rose to the surface and drifted slowly away with the tide  as jonathan stood gazing dully at the disappearance of these last evidences of his two inadvertent murders he was suddenly and vehemently aroused by feeling a pair of arms of enormous strength flung about him from behind  in their embrace his elbows were instantly pinned tight to his side and he stood for a moment helpless and astounded while the voice of the seacaptain rumbling in his very ear exclaimed ye bloody murthering quaker ill have that ivory ball or ill have your life  these words produced the same effect upon jonathan as though a douche of cold water had suddenly been flung over him  he began instantly to struggle to free himself and that with a frantic and vehement violence begotten at once of terror and despair  so prodigious were his efforts that more than once he had nearly torn himself free but still the powerful arms of his captor held him as in a vise of iron  meantime our heros assailant made frequent though ineffectual attempts to thrust a hand into the breechespocket where the ivory ball was hidden swearing the while under his breath with a terrifying and monstrous string of oaths  at last finding himself foiled in every such attempt and losing all patience at the struggles of his victim he endeavored to lift jonathan off of his feet as though to dash him bodily upon the ground  in this he would doubtless have succeeded had he not caught his heel in the crack of a loose board of the wharf instantly they both fell violently prostrate the captain beneath and jonathan above him though still encircled in his iron embrace  our hero felt the back of his head strike violently upon the flat face of the other and he heard the captains skull sound with a terrific crack like that of a breaking egg upon some post or billet of wood against which he must have struck  in their frantic struggles they had approached extremely near the edge of the wharf so that the next instant with an enormous and thunderous splash jonathan found himself plunged into the waters of the harbor and the arms of his assailant loosened from about his body  the shock of the water brought him instantly to his senses and being a fairly good swimmer he had not the least difficulty in reaching and clutching the crosspiece of a wooden ladder that coated with slimy seamoss led from the waterlevel to the wharf above  after reaching the safety of the dry land once more jonathan gazed about him as though to discern whence the next attack might be delivered upon him  but he stood entirely alone upon the docknot another living soul was in sight  the surface of the water exhibited some commotion as though disturbed by something struggling beneath but the seacaptain who had doubtless been stunned by the tremendous crack upon his head never arose again out of the element that had engulfed him  the moonlight shone with a peaceful and resplendent illumination and excepting certain remote noises from the distant town not a sound broke the silence and the peacefulness of the balmy tropical night  the limpid water illuminated by the resplendent moonlight lapped against the wharf  all the world was calm serene and enveloped in a profound and entire repose  jonathan looked up at the round and brilliant globe of light floating in the sky above his head and wondered whether it were indeed possible that all that had befallen him was a reality and not some tremendous hallucination  then suddenly arousing himself to a renewed realization of that which had occurred he turned and ran like one possessed up along the wharf and so into the moonlit town once more     vi the conclusion of the adventure with the lady with the silver veil   nor did he check his precipitous flight until suddenly being led perhaps by some strange influence of which he was not at all the master he discovered himself to be standing before the gardengate where not more than an hour before he had first entered upon the series of monstrous adventures that had led to such tremendous conclusions  people were still passing and repassing and one of these groupsa party of young ladies and gentlemenpaused upon the opposite side of the street to observe with no small curiosity and amusement his dripping and bedraggled aspect  but only one thought and one intention possessed our heroto relieve himself as quickly as possible of that trust which he had taken up so thoughtlessly and with such monstrous results to himself and to his victims  he ran to the gate of the garden and began beating and kicking upon it with a vehemence that he could neither master nor control  he was aware that the entire neighborhood was becoming aroused for he beheld lights moving and loud voices of inquiry yet he gave not the least thought to the disturbance he was creating but continued without intermission his uproarious pounding upon the gate  at length in answer to the sound of his vehement blows the little wicket was opened and a pair of eyes appeared thereat  the next instant the gate was cast ajar very hastily and the pockpitted negress appeared  she caught him by the sleeve of his coat and drew him quickly into the garden  buckra buckra she cried  what you doing  you wake de whole town  then observing his dripping garments you been in de water  you catch de fever and shake till you die  thy mistress cried jonathan almost sobbing in the excess of his emotion take me to her upon the instant or i cannot answer for my not going entirely mad  when our hero was again introduced to the lady he found her clad in a loose and an elegant negligee infinitely becoming to her graceful figure and still covered with the veil of silver gauze that had before enveloped her  friend he cried vehemently approaching her and holding out toward her the little ivory ball take again this which thou gavest me  it has brought death to three men and i know not what terrible fate may befall me if i keep it longer in my possession  what is it you say cried she in a piercing voice  did you say it hath caused the death of three men  quick  tell me what has happened for i feel somehow a presage that you bring me news of safety and release from all my dangers  i know not what thou meanest cried jonathan still panting with agitation  but this i do know that when i went away from thee i departed an innocent man and now i come back to thee burdened with the weight of three lives which though innocent i have been instrumental in taking  explain  exclaimed the lady tapping the floor with her foot explain explain explain  that i will cried jonathan and as soon as i am able  when i left thee and went out into the street i was accosted by a little gentleman clad in black  indeed cried the lady and had he but one eye and did he carry a goldheaded cane  exactly said jonathan and he claimed acquaintance with friend jeremiah doolittle  he never knew him cried the lady vehemently and i must tell you that he was a villain named hunt who at one time was the intimate consort of the pirate keitt  he it was who plunged a deadly knife into his captains bosom and so murdered him in this very house  he himself or his agents must have been watching my gate when you went forth  i know not how that may be said jonathan but he took me to his apartment and there obtaining a knowledge of the trust thou didst burden me with he demanded it of me and upon my refusing to deliver it to him he presently fell to attacking me with a dagger  in my efforts to protect my life i inadvertently caused him to plunge the knife into his own bosom and to kill himself  and what then  cried the lady who appeared wellnigh distracted with her emotions  then said jonathan there came a strange mana foreignerwho upon his part assaulted me with a pistol with every intention of murdering me and thus obtaining possession of that same little trifle  and did he exclaimed the lady have long black mustachios and did he have silver earrings in his ears  yes said jonathan he did  that cried the lady could have been none other than captain keitts portuguese sailingmaster who must have been spying upon hunt tell me what happened next  he would have taken my life said jonathan but in the struggle that followed he shot himself accidentally with his own pistol and died at my very feet  i do not know what would have happened to me if a seacaptain had not come and proffered his assistance  a seacaptain she exclaimed and had he a flat face and a broken nose  indeed he had replied jonathan  that said the lady must have been captain keitts pirate partnercaptain willitts of the bloody hand  he was doubtless spying upon the portuguese  he induced me said jonathan to carry the two bodies down to the wharf  having inveigled me therewhere i suppose he thought no one could interferehe assaulted me and endeavored to take the ivory ball away from me  in my efforts to escape we both fell into the water and he striking his head upon the edge of the wharf was first stunned and then drowned  thank god cried the lady with a transport of fervor and clasping her jewelled hands together  at last i am free of those who have heretofore persecuted me and threatened my very life itself  you have asked to behold my face i will now show it to you  heretofore i have been obliged to keep it concealed lest recognizing me my enemies should have slain me  as she spoke she drew aside her veil and disclosed to the vision of our hero a countenance of the most extraordinary and striking beauty  her luminous eyes were like those of a jawa and set beneath exquisitely arched and pencilled brows  her forehead was like lustrous ivory and her lips like roseleaves  her hair which was as soft as the finest silk was fastened up in masses of ravishing abundance  i am said she the daughter of that unfortunate captain keitt who though weak and a pirate was not so wicked i would have you know as he has been painted  he would doubtless have been an honest man had he not been led astray by the villain hunt who so nearly compassed your own destruction  he returned to this island before his death and made me the sole heir of all that great fortune which he had gatheredperhaps not by the most honest meansin the waters of the indian ocean  but the greatest treasure of all that fortune bequeathed to me was a single jewel which you yourself have just now defended with a courage and a fidelity that i cannot sufficiently extol  it is that priceless gem known as the ruby of kishmoor  i will show it to you  hereupon she took the little ivory ball in her hand and with a turn of her beautiful wrists unscrewed a lid so nicely and cunningly adjusted that no eye could have detected where it was joined to the parent globe within was a fleece of raw silk containing an object which she presently displayed before the astonished gaze of our hero  it was a red stone of about the bigness of a plovers egg and which glowed and flamed with such an exquisite and ruddy brilliancy as to dazzle even jonathans inexperienced eyes  indeed he did not need to be informed of the priceless value of the treasure which he beheld in the rosy palm extended toward him  how long he gazed at this extraordinary jewel he knew not but he was aroused from his contemplation by the sound of the ladys voice addressing him  the three villains said she who have this day met their deserts in a violent and bloody death had by an accident obtained knowledge that this jewel was in my possession since then my life has hung upon a thread and every step that i have taken has been watched by these enemies the most cruel and relentless that it was ever the lot of any unfortunate to possess  from the mortal dangers of their machinations you have saved me exhibiting a courage and a determination that cannot be sufficiently applauded  in this you have earned my deepest admiration and regard  i would rather she cried intrust my life and my happiness to you than into the keeping of any man whom i have ever known  i cannot hope to reward you in such a way as to recompense you for the perils into which my necessities have thrust you but yetand here she hesitated as though seeking for words in which to express herselfbut yet if you are willing to accept of this jewel and all of the fortune that belongs to me together with the person of poor evaline keitt herself not only the stone and the wealth but the woman also are yours to dispose of as you see fit  our hero was so struck aback at this unexpected turn that he knew not upon the instant what reply to make  friend said he at last i thank thee extremely for thy offer and though i would not be ungracious it is yet borne in upon me to testify to thee that as to the stone itself and the fortuneof which thou speakest and of which i very well know the historyi have no inclination to receive either the one or the other both the fruits of theft rapine and murder the jewel i have myself beheld three times stained as it were with the blood of my fellowman so that it now has so little value in my sight that i would not give a peppercorn to possess it  indeed there is no inducement in the world that could persuade me to accept it or even to take it again into my hand  as to the rest of thy generous offer i have only to say that i am four months hence to be married to a very comely young woman of kensington in pennsylvania by name martha dobbs and therefore i am not at all at liberty to consider my inclinations in any other direction  having so delivered himself jonathan bowed with such ease as his stiff and awkward joints might command and thereupon withdrew from the presence of the charmer who with cheeks suffused with blushes and with eyes averted made no endeavor to detain him  so ended the only adventure of moment that ever happened to him in all his life  for thereafter he contented himself with such excitement as his mercantile profession and his extremely peaceful existence might afford     epilogue   in conclusion it may be said that when the worthy jonathan rugg was married to martha dobbs upon the following june some mysterious friend presented to the bride a rope of pearls of such considerable value that when they were realized into money our hero was enabled to enter into partnership with his former patron the worthy jeremiah doolittle and that having made such a beginning he byandby arose to become in his day one of the leading merchants of his native town of philadelphia
