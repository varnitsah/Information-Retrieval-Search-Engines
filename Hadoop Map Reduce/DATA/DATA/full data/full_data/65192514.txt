65192514	sketches of young couples     an urgent remonstrance c  to the gentlemen of england  being bachelors or widowers  the remonstrance of their faithful fellowsubject  sheweth  that her most gracious majesty victoria by the grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland queen defender of the faith did on the 23rd day of november last past declare and pronounce to her most honourable privy council her majestys most gracious intention of entering into the bonds of wedlock  that her most gracious majesty in so making known her most gracious intention to her most honourable privy council as aforesaid did use and employ the wordsit is my intention to ally myself in marriage with prince albert of saxe coburg and gotha  that the present is bissextile or leap year in which it is held and considered lawful for any lady to offer and submit proposals of marriage to any gentleman and to enforce and insist upon acceptance of the same under pain of a certain fine or penalty to wit one silk or satin dress of the first quality to be chosen by the lady and paid or owed for by the gentleman  that these and other the horrors and dangers with which the said bissextile or leap year threatens the gentlemen of england on every occasion of its periodical return have been greatly aggravated and augmented by the terms of her majestys said most gracious communication which have filled the heads of divers young ladies in this realm with certain new ideas destructive to the peace of mankind that never entered their imagination before  that a case has occurred in camberwell in which a young lady informed her papa that she intended to ally herself in marriage with mr smith of stepney and that another and a very distressing case has occurred at tottenham in which a young lady not only stated her intention of allying herself in marriage with her cousin john but taking violent possession of her said cousin actually married him  that similar outrages are of constant occurrence not only in the capital and its neighbourhood but throughout the kingdom and that unless the excited female populace be speedily checked and restrained in their lawless proceedings most deplorable results must ensue therefrom among which may be anticipated a most alarming increase in the population of the country with which no efforts of the agricultural or manufacturing interest can possibly keep pace  that there is strong reason to suspect the existence of a most extensive plot conspiracy or design secretly contrived by vast numbers of single ladies in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and now extending its ramifications in every quarter of the land the object and intent of which plainly appears to be the holding and solemnising of an enormous and unprecedented number of marriages on the day on which the nuptials of her said most gracious majesty are performed  that such plot conspiracy or design strongly savours of popery as tending to the discomfiture of the clergy of the established church by entailing upon them great mental and physical exhaustion and that such popish plots are fomented and encouraged by her majestys ministers which clearly appearsnot only from her majestys principal secretary of state for foreign affairs traitorously getting married while holding office under the crown but from mr oconnell having been heard to declare and avow that if he had a daughter to marry she should be married on the same day as her said most gracious majesty  that such arch plots conspiracies and designs besides being fraught with danger to the established church and consequently to the state cannot fail to bring ruin and bankruptcy upon a large class of her majestys subjects as a great and sudden increase in the number of married men occasioning the comparative desertion for a time of taverns hotels billiardrooms and gaminghouses will deprive the proprietors of their accustomed profits and returns  and in further proof of the depth and baseness of such designs it may be here observed that all proprietors of taverns hotels billiardrooms and gaminghouses are especially the last solemnly devoted to the protestant religion  for all these reasons and many others of no less gravity and import an urgent appeal is made to the gentlemen of england being bachelors or widowers to take immediate steps for convening a public meeting to consider of the best and surest means of averting the dangers with which they are threatened by the recurrence of bissextile or leap year and the additional sensation created among single ladies by the terms of her majestys most gracious declaration to take measures without delay for resisting the said single ladies and counteracting their evil designs and to pray her majesty to dismiss her present ministers and to summon to her councils those distinguished gentlemen in various honourable professions who by insulting on all occasions the only lady in england who can be insulted with safety have given a sufficient guarantee to her majestys loving subjects that they at least are qualified to make war with women and are already expert in the use of those weapons which are common to the lowest and most abandoned of the sex    the young couple    there is to be a wedding this morning at the corner house in the terrace  the pastrycooks people have been there halfadozen times already all day yesterday there was a great stir and bustle and they were up this morning as soon as it was light  miss emma fielding is going to be married to young mr harvey  heaven alone can tell in what bright colours this marriage is painted upon the mind of the little housemaid at number six who has hardly slept a wink all night with thinking of it and now stands on the unswept doorsteps leaning upon her broom and looking wistfully towards the enchanted house  nothing short of omniscience can divine what visions of the baker or the green grocer or the smart and most insinuating butterman are flitting across her mindwhat thoughts of how she would dress on such an occasion if she were a ladyof how she would dress if she were only a brideof how cook would dress being bridesmaid conjointly with her sister in place at fulham and how the clergyman deeming them so many ladies would be quite humbled and respectful what daydreams of hope and happinessof life being one perpetual holiday with no master and no mistress to grant or withhold itof every sunday being a sunday outof pure freedom as to curls and ringlets and no obligation to hide fine heads of hair in caps what pictures of happiness vast and immense to her but utterly ridiculous to us bewilder the brain of the little housemaid at number six all called into existence by the wedding at the corner  we smile at such things and so we should though perhaps for a better reason than commonly presents itself  it should be pleasant to us to know that there are notions of happiness so moderate and limited since upon those who entertain them happiness and lightness of heart are very easily bestowed  but the little housemaid is awakened from her reverie for forth from the door of the magical corner house there runs towards her all fluttering in smart new dress and streaming ribands her friend jane adams who comes all out of breath to redeem a solemn promise of taking her in under cover of the confusion to see the breakfast table spread forth in state andsight of sightsher young mistress ready dressed for church  and there in good truth when they have stolen upstairs on tip toe and edged themselves in at the chamberdoorthere is miss emma looking like the sweetest picter in a white chip bonnet and orange flowers and all other elegancies becoming a bride with the make shape and quality of every article of which the girl is perfectly familiar in one moment and never forgets to her dying dayand there is miss emmas mamma in tears and miss emmas papa comforting her and saying how that of course she has been long looking forward to this and how happy she ought to beand there too is miss emmas sister with her arms round her neck and the other bridesmaid all smiles and tears quieting the children who would cry more but that they are so finely dressed and yet sob for fear sister emma should be taken awayand it is all so affecting that the two servantgirls cry more than anybody and jane adams sitting down upon the stairs when they have crept away declares that her legs tremble so that she dont know what to do and that she will say for miss emma that she never had a hasty word from her and that she does hope and pray she may be happy  but jane soon comes round again and then surely there never was anything like the breakfast table glittering with plate and china and set out with flowers and sweets and longnecked bottles in the most sumptuous and dazzling manner  in the centre too is the mighty charm the cake glistening with frosted sugar and garnished beautifully  they agree that there ought to be a little cupid under one of the barleysugar temples or at least two hearts and an arrow but with this exception there is nothing to wish for and a table could not be handsomer  as they arrive at this conclusion who should come in but mr john to whom jane says that its only anne from number six and john says he knows for hes often winked his eye down the area which causes anne to blush and look confused  she is going away indeed when mr john will have it that she must drink a glass of wine and he says never mind its being early in the morning it wont hurt her  so they shut the door and pour out the wine and anne drinking lanes health and adding and heres wishing you yours mr john drinks it in a great many sipsmr john all the time making jokes appropriate to the occasion  at last mr john who has waxed bolder by degrees pleads the usage at weddings and claims the privilege of a kiss which he obtains after a great scuffle and footsteps being now heard on the stairs they disperse suddenly  by this time a carriage has driven up to convey the bride to church and anne of number six prolonging the process of cleaning her door has the satisfaction of beholding the bride and bridesmaids and the papa and mamma hurry into the same and drive rapidly off  nor is this all for soon other carriages begin to arrive with a posse of company all beautifully dressed at whom she could stand and gaze for ever but having something else to do is compelled to take one last long look and shut the streetdoor  and now the company have gone down to breakfast and tears have given place to smiles for all the corks are out of the longnecked bottles and their contents are disappearing rapidly  miss emmas papa is at the top of the table miss emmas mamma at the bottom and beside the latter are miss emma herself and her husband admitted on all hands to be the handsomest and most interesting young couple ever known  all down both sides of the table too are various young ladies beautiful to see and various young gentlemen who seem to think so and there in a post of honour is an unmarried aunt of miss emmas reported to possess unheardof riches and to have expressed vast testamentary intentions respecting her favourite niece and new nephew  this lady has been very liberal and generous already as the jewels worn by the bride abundantly testify but that is nothing to what she means to do or even to what she has done for she put herself in close communication with the dressmaker three months ago and prepared a wardrobe with some articles worked by her own hands fit for a princess  people may call her an old maid and so she may be but she is neither cross nor ugly for all that on the contrary she is very cheerful and pleasantlooking and very kind and tender hearted  which is no matter of surprise except to those who yield to popular prejudices without thinking why and will never grow wiser and never know better  of all the company though none are more pleasant to behold or better pleased with themselves than two young children who in honour of the day have seats among the guests  of these one is a little fellow of six or eight years old brother to the brideand the other a girl of the same age or something younger whom he calls his wife  the real bride and bridegroom are not more devoted than they  he all love and attention and she all blushes and fondness toying with a little bouquet which he gave her this morning and placing the scattered roseleaves in her bosom with natures own coquettishness  they have dreamt of each other in their quiet dreams these children and their little hearts have been nearly broken when the absent one has been dispraised in jest when will there come in afterlife a passion so earnest generous and true as theirs what even in its gentlest realities can have the grace and charm that hover round such fairy lovers  by this time the merriment and happiness of the feast have gained their height certain ominous looks begin to be exchanged between the bridesmaids and somehow it gets whispered about that the carriage which is to take the young couple into the country has arrived  such members of the party as are most disposed to prolong its enjoyments affect to consider this a false alarm but it turns out too true being speedily confirmed first by the retirement of the bride and a select file of intimates who are to prepare her for the journey and secondly by the withdrawal of the ladies generally  to this there ensues a particularly awkward pause in which everybody essays to be facetious and nobody succeeds at length the bridegroom makes a mysterious disappearance in obedience to some equally mysterious signal and the table is deserted  now for at least six weeks last past it has been solemnly devised and settled that the young couple should go away in secret but they no sooner appear without the door than the drawingroom windows are blocked up with ladies waving their handkerchiefs and kissing their hands and the diningroom panes with gentlemens faces beaming farewell in every queer variety of its expression the hall and steps are crowded with servants in white favours mixed up with particular friends and relations who have darted out to say goodbye and foremost in the group are the tiny lovers arm in arm thinking with fluttering hearts what happiness it would be to dash away together in that gallant coach and never part again  the bride has barely time for one hurried glance at her old home when the steps rattle the door slams the horses clatter on the pavement and they have left it far away  a knot of women servants still remain clustered in the hall whispering among themselves and there of course is anne from number six who has made another escape on some plea or other and been an admiring witness of the departure  there are two points on which anne expatiates over and over again without the smallest appearance of fatigue or intending to leave off one is that she never see in all her life such aoh such a angel of a gentleman as mr harveyand the other that she cant tell how it is but it dont seem a bit like a workaday or a sunday neitherits all so unsettled and unregular    the formal couple    the formal couple are the most prim cold immovable and unsatisfactory people on the face of the earth  their faces voices dress house furniture walk and manner are all the essence of formality unrelieved by one redeeming touch of frankness heartiness or nature  everything with the formal couple resolves itself into a matter of form  they dont call upon you on your account but their own not to see how you are but to show how they are  it is not a ceremony to do honour to you but to themselvesnot due to your position but to theirs  if one of a friends children die the formal couple are as sure and punctual in sending to the house as the undertaker if a friends family be increased the monthly nurse is not more attentive than they  the formal couple in fact joyfully seize all occasions of testifying their goodbreeding and precise observance of the little usages of society and for you who are the means to this end they care as much as a man does for the tailor who has enabled him to cut a figure or a woman for the milliner who has assisted her to a conquest  having an extensive connexion among that kind of people who make acquaintances and eschew friends the formal gentleman attends from time to time a great many funerals to which he is formally invited and to which he formally goes as returning a call for the last time  here his deportment is of the most faultless description he knows the exact pitch of voice it is proper to assume the sombre look he ought to wear the melancholy tread which should be his gait for the day  he is perfectly acquainted with all the dreary courtesies to be observed in a mourningcoach knows when to sigh and when to hide his nose in the white handkerchief and looks into the grave and shakes his head when the ceremony is concluded with the sad formality of a mute  what kind of funeral was it says the formal lady when he returns home  oh replies the formal gentleman there never was such a gross and disgusting impropriety there were no feathers no feathers cries the lady as if on wings of black feathers dead people fly to heaven and lacking them they must of necessity go elsewhere  her husband shakes his head and further adds that they had seedcake instead of plumcake and that it was all white wine  all white wine exclaims his wife  nothing but sherry and madeira says the husband  what no port  not a drop  no port no plums and no feathers  you will recollect my dear says the formal lady in a voice of stately reproof that when we first met this poor man who is now dead and gone and he took that very strange course of addressing me at dinner without being previously introduced i ventured to express my opinion that the family were quite ignorant of etiquette and very imperfectly acquainted with the decencies of life  you have now had a good opportunity of judging for yourself and all i have to say is that i trust you will never go to a funeral there again  my dear replies the formal gentleman i never will  so the informal deceased is cut in his grave and the formal couple when they tell the story of the funeral shake their heads and wonder what some peoples feelings are made of and what their notions of propriety can be  if the formal couple have a family which they sometimes have they are not children but little pale sour sharpnosed men and women and so exquisitely brought up that they might be very old dwarfs for anything that appeareth to the contrary  indeed they are so acquainted with forms and conventionalities and conduct themselves with such strict decorum that to see the little girl break a lookingglass in some wild outbreak or the little boy kick his parents would be to any visitor an unspeakable relief and consolation  the formal couple are always sticklers for what is rigidly proper and have a great readiness in detecting hidden impropriety of speech or thought which by less scrupulous people would be wholly unsuspected  thus if they pay a visit to the theatre they sit all night in a perfect agony lest anything improper or immoral should proceed from the stage and if anything should happen to be said which admits of a double construction they never fail to take it up directly and to express by their looks the great outrage which their feelings have sustained  perhaps this is their chief reason for absenting themselves almost entirely from places of public amusement  they go sometimes to the exhibition of the royal academybut that is often more shocking than the stage itself and the formal lady thinks that it really is high time mr etty was prosecuted and made a public example of  we made one at a christening party not long since where there were amongst the guests a formal couple who suffered the acutest torture from certain jokes incidental to such an occasion cut and very likely dried alsoby one of the godfathers a redfaced elderly gentleman who being highly popular with the rest of the company had it all his own way and was in great spirits  it was at suppertime that this gentleman came out in full force  we being of a grave and quiet demeanourhad been chosen to escort the formal lady downstairs and sitting beside her had a favourable opportunity of observing her emotions  we have a shrewd suspicion that in the very beginning and in the first blushliterally the first blushof the matter the formal lady had not felt quite certain whether the being present at such a ceremony and encouraging as it were the public exhibition of a baby was not an act involving some degree of indelicacy and impropriety but certain we are that when that babys health was drunk and allusions were made by a greyheaded gentleman proposing it to the time when he had dandled in his arms the young christians mothercertain we are that then the formal lady took the alarm and recoiled from the old gentleman as from a hoary profligate  still she bore it she fanned herself with an indignant air but still she bore it  a comic song was sung involving a confession from some imaginary gentleman that he had kissed a female and yet the formal lady bore it  but when at last the health of the godfather beforementioned being drunk the godfather rose to return thanks and in the course of his observations darkly hinted at babies yet unborn and even contemplated the possibility of the subject of that festival having brothers and sisters the formal lady could endure no more but bowing slightly round and sweeping haughtily past the offender left the room in tears under the protection of the formal gentleman    the loving couple    there cannot be a better practical illustration of the wise saw and ancient instance that there may be too much of a good thing than is presented by a loving couple  undoubtedly it is meet and proper that two persons joined together in holy matrimony should be loving and unquestionably it is pleasant to know and see that they are so but there is a time for all things and the couple who happen to be always in a loving state before company are wellnigh intolerable  and in taking up this position we would have it distinctly understood that we do not seek alone the sympathy of bachelors in whose objection to loving couples we recognise interested motives and personal considerations  we grant that to that unfortunate class of society there may be something very irritating tantalising and provoking in being compelled to witness those gentle endearments and chaste interchanges which to loving couples are quite the ordinary business of life  but while we recognise the natural character of the prejudice to which these unhappy men are subject we can neither receive their biassed evidence nor address ourself to their inflamed and angered minds  dispassionate experience is our only guide and in these moral essays we seek no less to reform hymeneal offenders than to hold out a timely warning to all rising couples and even to those who have not yet set forth upon their pilgrimage towards the matrimonial market  let all couples present or to come therefore profit by the example of mr and mrs leaver themselves a loving couple in the first degree  mr and mrs leaver are pronounced by mrs starling a widow lady who lost her husband when she was young and lost herself about the sametimefor by her own count she has never since grown five years olderto be a perfect model of wedded felicity  you would suppose says the romantic lady that they were lovers only just now engaged  never was such happiness  they are so tender so affectionate so attached to each other so enamoured that positively nothing can be more charming  augusta my soul says mr leaver  augustus my life replies mrs leaver  sing some little ballad darling quoth mr leaver i couldnt indeed dearest returns mrs leaver  do my dove says mr leaver  i couldnt possibly my love replies mrs leaver and its very naughty of you to ask me  naughty darling cries mr leaver  yes very naughty and very cruel returns mrs leaver for you know i have a sore throat and that to sing would give me great pain  youre a monster and i hate you  go away  mrs leaver has said go away because mr leaver has tapped her under the chin  mr leaver not doing as he is bid but on the contrary sitting down beside her mrs leaver slaps mr leaver and mr leaver in return slaps mrs leaver and it being now time for all persons present to look the other way they look the other way and hear a still small sound as of kissing at which mrs starling is thoroughly enraptured and whispers her neighbour that if all married couples were like that what a heaven this earth would be  the loving couple are at home when this occurs and maybe only three or four friends are present but unaccustomed to reserve upon this interesting point they are pretty much the same abroad indeed upon some occasions such as a picnic or a waterparty their lovingness is even more developed as we had an opportunity last summer of observing in person  there was a great waterparty made up to go to twickenham and dine and afterwards dance in an empty villa by the riverside hired expressly for the purpose  mr and mrs leaver were of the company and it was our fortune to have a seat in the same boat which was an eightoared galley manned by amateurs with a blue striped awning of the same pattern as their guernsey shirts and a dingy red flag of the same shade as the whiskers of the stroke oar a coxswain being appointed and all other matters adjusted the eight gentlemen threw themselves into strong paroxysms and pulled up with the tide stimulated by the compassionate remarks of the ladies who one and all exclaimed that it seemed an immense exertionas indeed it did  at first we raced the other boat which came alongside in gallant style but this being found an unpleasant amusement as giving rise to a great quantity of splashing and rendering the cold pies and other viands very moist it was unanimously voted down and we were suffered to shoot a head while the second boat followed ingloriously in our wake  it was at this time that we first recognised mr leaver  there were two firemenwatermen in the boat lying by until somebody was exhausted and one of them who had taken upon himself the direction of affairs was heard to cry in a gruff voice pull away number twogive it her number twotake a longer reach number twonow number two sir think youre winning a boat the greater part of the company had no doubt begun to wonder which of the striped guernseys it might be that stood in need of such encouragement when a stifled shriek from mrs leaver confirmed the doubtful and informed the ignorant and mr leaver still further disguised in a straw hat and no neckcloth was observed to be in a fearful perspiration and failing visibly  nor was the general consternation diminished at this instant by the same gentleman in the performance of an accidental aquatic feat termed catching a crab plunging suddenly backward and displaying nothing of himself to the company but two violently struggling legs  mrs leaver shrieked again several times and cried piteouslyis he dead  tell me the worst  is he dead  now a moments reflection might have convinced the loving wife that unless her husband were endowed with some most surprising powers of muscular action he never could be dead while he kicked so hard but still mrs leaver cried is he dead is he dead and still everybody else criedno no no until such time as mr leaver was replaced in a sitting posture and his oar which had been going through all kinds of wrongheaded performances on its own account was once more put in his hand by the exertions of the two firemenwatermen  mr leaver then exclaimed augustus my child come to me and mr leaver said augusta my love compose yourself i am not injured  but mrs leaver cried again more piteously than before augustus my child come to me and now the company generally who seemed to be apprehensive that if mr leaver remained where he was he might contribute more than his proper share towards the drowning of the party disinterestedly took part with mrs leaver and said he really ought to go and that he was not strong enough for such violent exercise and ought never to have undertaken it  reluctantly mr leaver went and laid himself down at mrs leavers feet and mrs leaver stooping over him said oh augustus how could you terrify me so and mr leaver said augusta my sweet i never meant to terrify you and mrs leaver said you are faint my dear and mr leaver said i am rather so my love and they were very loving indeed under mrs leavers veil until at length mr leaver came forth again and pleasantly asked if he had not heard something said about bottled stout and sandwiches  mrs starling who was one of the party was perfectly delighted with this scene and frequently murmured halfaside what a loving couple you are or how delightful it is to see man and wife so happy together  to us she was quite poetical for we are a kind of cousins observing that hearts beating in unison like that made life a paradise of sweets and that when kindred creatures were drawn together by sympathies so fine and delicate what more than mortal happiness did not our souls partake  to all this we answered certainly or very true or merely sighed as the case might be  at every new act of the loving couple the widows admiration broke out afresh and when mrs leaver would not permit mr leaver to keep his hat off lest the sun should strike to his head and give him a brain fever mrs starling actually shed tears and said it reminded her of adam and eve  the loving couple were thus loving all the way to twickenham but when we arrived there by which time the amateur crew looked very thirsty and vicious they were more playful than ever for mrs leaver threw stones at mr leaver and mr leaver ran after mrs leaver on the grass in a most innocent and enchanting manner  at dinner too mr leaver would steal mrs leavers tongue and mrs leaver would retaliate upon mr leavers fowl and when mrs leaver was going to take some lobster salad mr leaver wouldnt let her have any saying that it made her ill and she was always sorry for it afterwards which afforded mrs leaver an opportunity of pretending to be cross and showing many other prettinesses  but this was merely the smiling surface of their loves not the mighty depths of the stream down to which the company to say the truth dived rather unexpectedly from the following accident  it chanced that mr leaver took upon himself to propose the bachelors who had first originated the notion of that entertainment in doing which he affected to regret that he was no longer of their body himself and pretended grievously to lament his fallen state  this mrs leavers feelings could not brook even in jest and consequently exclaiming aloud he loves me not he loves me not she fell in a very pitiable state into the arms of mrs starling and directly becoming insensible was conveyed by that lady and her husband into another room  presently mr leaver came running back to know if there was a medical gentleman in company and as there was in what company is there not both mr leaver and the medical gentleman hurried away together  the medical gentleman was the first who returned and among his intimate friends he was observed to laugh and wink and look as unmedical as might be but when mr leaver came back he was very solemn and in answer to all inquiries shook his head and remarked that augusta was far too sensitive to be trifled withan opinion which the widow subsequently confirmed  finding that she was in no imminent peril however the rest of the party betook themselves to dancing on the green and very merry and happy they were and a vast quantity of flirtation there was the last circumstance being no doubt attributable partly to the fineness of the weather and partly to the locality which is well known to be favourable to all harmless recreations  in the bustle of the scene mr and mrs leaver stole down to the boat and disposed themselves under the awning mrs leaver reclining her head upon mr leavers shoulder and mr leaver grasping her hand with great fervour and looking in her face from time to time with a melancholy and sympathetic aspect  the widow sat apart feigning to be occupied with a book but stealthily observing them from behind her fan and the two firemenwatermen smoking their pipes on the bank hard by nudged each other and grinned in enjoyment of the joke  very few of the party missed the loving couple and the few who did heartily congratulated each other on their disappearance    the contradictory couple    one would suppose that two people who are to pass their whole lives together and must necessarily be very often alone with each other could find little pleasure in mutual contradiction and yet what is more common than a contradictory couple  the contradictory couple agree in nothing but contradiction  they return home from mrs bluebottles dinnerparty each in an opposite corner of the coach and do not exchange a syllable until they have been seated for at least twenty minutes by the fireside at home when the gentleman raising his eyes from the stove all at once breaks silence  what a very extraordinary thing it is says he that you will contradict charlotte  i contradict cries the lady but thats just like you  whats like me says the gentleman sharply  saying that i contradict you replies the lady  do you mean to say that you do not contradict me retorts the gentleman do you mean to say that you have not been contradicting me the whole of this day  do you mean to tell me now that you have not  i mean to tell you nothing of the kind replies the lady quietly when you are wrong of course i shall contradict you  during this dialogue the gentleman has been taking his brandyand water on one side of the fire and the lady with her dressingcase on the table has been curling her hair on the other  she now lets down her back hair and proceeds to brush it preserving at the same time an air of conscious rectitude and suffering virtue which is intended to exasperate the gentlemanand does so  i do believe he says taking the spoon out of his glass and tossing it on the table that of all the obstinate positive wrongheaded creatures that were ever born you are the most so charlotte  certainly certainly have it your own way pray you see how much i contradict you rejoins the lady  of course you didnt contradict me at dinnertimeoh no not you says the gentleman  yes i did says the lady  oh you did cries the gentleman you admit that  if you call that contradiction i do the lady answers and i say again edward that when i know you are wrong i will contradict you  i am not your slave  not my slave repeats the gentleman bitterly and you still mean to say that in the blackburns new house there are not more than fourteen doors including the door of the wine cellar  i mean to say retorts the lady beating time with her hairbrush on the palm of her hand that in that house there are fourteen doors and no more  well then cries the gentleman rising in despair and pacing the room with rapid strides  by g this is enough to destroy a mans intellect and drive him mad  by and by the gentleman comesto a little and passing his hand gloomily across his forehead reseats himself in his former chair there is a long silence and this time the lady begins  i appealed to mr jenkins who sat next to me on the sofa in the drawingroom during tea  morgan you mean interrupts the gentleman  i do not mean anything of the kind answers the lady now by all that is aggravating and impossible to bear cries the gentleman clenching his hands and looking upwards in agony she is going to insist upon it that morgan is jenkins  do you take me for a perfect fool exclaims the lady do you suppose i dont know the one from the other  do you suppose i dont know that the man in the blue coat was mr jenkins  jenkins in a blue coat cries the gentleman with a groan jenkins in a blue coat a man who would suffer death rather than wear anything but brown  do you dare to charge me with telling an untruth demands the lady bursting into tears  i charge you maam retorts the gentleman starting up with being a monster of contradiction a monster of aggravation aaajenkins in a blue coatwhat have i done that i should be doomed to hear such statements  expressing himself with great scorn and anguish the gentleman takes up his candle and stalks off to bed where feigning to be fast asleep when the lady comes upstairs drowned in tears murmuring lamentations over her hard fate and indistinct intentions of consulting her brothers he undergoes the secret torture of hearing her exclaim between whiles i know there are only fourteen doors in the house i know it was mr jenkins i know he had a blue coat on and i would say it as positively as i do now if they were the last words i had to speak  if the contradictory couple are blessed with children they are not the less contradictory on that account  master james and miss charlotte present themselves after dinner and being in perfect good humour and finding their parents in the same amiable state augur from these appearances half a glass of wine apiece and other extraordinary indulgences  but unfortunately master james growing talkative upon such prospects asks his mamma how tall mrs parsons is and whether she is not six feet high to which his mamma replies yes she should think she was for mrs parsons is a very tall lady indeed quite a giantess  for heavens sake charlotte cries her husband do not tell the child such preposterous nonsense  six feet high  well replies the lady surely i may be permitted to have an opinion my opinion is that she is six feet highat least six feet  now you know charlotte retorts the gentleman sternly that that is not your opinionthat you have no such ideaand that you only say this for the sake of contradiction  you are exceedingly polite his wife replies to be wrong about such a paltry question as anybodys height would be no great crime but i say again that i believe mrs parsons to be six feetmore than six feet nay i believe you know her to be full six feet and only say she is not because i say she is  this taunt disposes the gentleman to become violent but he cheeks himself and is content to mutter in a haughty tone six feetha ha  mrs parsons six feet and the lady answers yes six feet  i am sure i am glad you are amused and ill say it againsix feet  thus the subject gradually drops off and the contradiction begins to be forgotten when master james with some undefined notion of making himself agreeable and putting things to rights again unfortunately asks his mamma what the moons made of which gives her occasion to say that he had better not ask her for she is always wrong and never can be right that he only exposes her to contradiction by asking any question of her and that he had better ask his papa who is infallible and never can be wrong papa smarting under this attack gives a terrible pull at the bell and says that if the conversation is to proceed in this way the children had better be removed  removed they are after a few tears and many struggles and pa having looked at ma sideways for a minute or two with a baleful eye draws his pockethandkerchief over his face and composes himself for his afterdinner nap  the friends of the contradictory couple often deplore their frequent disputes though they rather make light of them at the same time  observing that there is no doubt they are very much attached to each other and that they never quarrel except about trifles  but neither the friends of the contradictory couple nor the contradictory couple themselves reflect that as the most stupendous objects in nature are but vast collections of minute particles so the slightest and least considered trifles make up the sum of human happiness or misery    the couple who dote upon their children    the couple who dote upon their children have usually a great many of them  six or eight at least  the children are either the healthiest in all the world or the most unfortunate in existence in either case they are equally the theme of their doting parents and equally a source of mental anguish and irritation to their doting parents friends  the couple who dote upon their children recognise no dates but those connected with their births accidents illnesses or remarkable deeds  they keep a mental almanack with a vast number of innocentsdays all in red letters  they recollect the last coronation because on that day little tom fell down the kitchen stairs the anniversary of the gunpowder plot because it was on the fifth of november that ned asked whether wooden legs were made in heaven and cocked hats grew in gardens  mrs whiffler will never cease to recollect the last day of the old year as long as she lives for it was on that day that the baby had the four red spots on its nose which they took for measles  nor christmasday for twentyone days after christmasday the twins were born nor good friday for it was on a good friday that she was frightened by the donkeycart when she was in the family way with georgiana  the movable feasts have no motion for mr and mrs whiffler but remain pinned down tight and fast to the shoulders of some small child from whom they can never be separated any more  time was made according to their creed not for slaves but for girls and boys the restless sands in his glass are but little children at play  as we have already intimated the children of this couple can know no medium  they are either prodigies of good health or prodigies of bad health whatever they are they must be prodigies  mr whiffler must have to describe at his office such excruciating agonies constantly undergone by his eldest boy as nobody elses eldest boy ever underwent or he must be able to declare that there never was a child endowed with such amazing health such an indomitable constitution and such a castiron frame as his child his children must be in some respect or other above and beyond the children of all other people  to such an extent is this feeling pushed that we were once slightly acquainted with a lady and gentleman who carried their heads so high and became so proud after their youngest child fell out of a twopairofstairs window without hurting himself much that the greater part of their friends were obliged to forego their acquaintance  but perhaps this may be an extreme case and one not justly entitled to be considered as a precedent of general application  if a friend happen to dine in a friendly way with one of these couples who dote upon their children it is nearly impossible for him to divert the conversation from their favourite topic everything reminds mr whiffler of ned or mrs whiffler of mary anne or of the time before ned was born or the time before mary anne was thought of  the slightest remark however harmless in itself will awaken slumbering recollections of the twins  it is impossible to steer clear of them  they will come uppermost let the poor man do what he may  ned has been known to be lost sight of for half an hour dick has been forgotten the name of mary anne has not been mentioned but the twins will out  nothing can keep down the twins  its a very extraordinary thing saunders says mr whiffler to the visitor butyou have seen our little babies thethe twins  the friends heart sinks within him as he answers oh yesoften  your talking of the pyramids says mr whiffler quite as a matter of course reminds me of the twins  its a very extraordinary thing about those babieswhat colour should you say their eyes were  upon my word the friend stammers i hardly know how to answerthe fact being that except as the friend does not remember to have heard of any departure from the ordinary course of nature in the instance of these twins they might have no eyes at all for aught he has observed to the contrary  you wouldnt say they were red i suppose says mr whiffler  the friend hesitates and rather thinks they are but inferring from the expression of mr whifflers face that red is not the colour smiles with some confidence and says no no very different from that  what should you say to blue says mr whiffler  the friend glances at him and observing a different expression in his face ventures to say i should say they were bluea decided blue  to be sure cries mr whiffler triumphantly i knew you would  but what should you say if i was to tell you that the boys eyes are blue and the girls hazel eh  impossible exclaims the friend not at all knowing why it should be impossible  a fact notwithstanding cries mr whiffler and let me tell you saunders thats not a common thing in twins or a circumstance thatll happen every day  in this dialogue mrs whiffler as being deeply responsible for the twins their charms and singularities has taken no share but she now relates in broken english a witticism of little dicks bearing upon the subject just discussed which delights mr whiffler beyond measure and causes him to declare that he would have sworn that was dicks if he had heard it anywhere  then he requests that mrs whiffler will tell saunders what tom said about mad bulls and mrs whiffler relating the anecdote a discussion ensues upon the different character of toms wit and dicks wit from which it appears that dicks humour is of a lively turn while toms style is the dry and caustic  this discussion being enlivened by various illustrations lasts a long time and is only stopped by mrs whiffler instructing the footman to ring the nursery bell as the children were promised that they should come down and taste the pudding  the friend turns pale when this order is given and paler still when it is followed up by a great pattering on the staircase not unlike the sound of rain upon a skylight a violent bursting open of the diningroom door and the tumultuous appearance of six small children closely succeeded by a strong nurserymaid with a twin in each arm  as the whole eight are screaming shouting or kicking some influenced by a ravenous appetite some by a horror of the stranger and some by a conflict of the two feelingsa pretty long space elapses before all their heads can be ranged round the table and anything like order restored in bringing about which happy state of things both the nurse and footman are severely scratched at length mrs whiffler is heard to say mr saunders shall i give you some pudding  a breathless silence ensues and sixteen small eyes are fixed upon the guest in expectation of his reply  a wild shout of joy proclaims that he has said no thank you spoons are waved in the air legs appear above the tablecloth in uncontrollable ecstasy and eighty short fingers dabble in damson syrup  while the pudding is being disposed of mr and mrs whiffler look on with beaming countenances and mr whiffler nudging his friend saunders begs him to take notice of toms eyes or dicks chin or neds nose or mary annes hair or emilys figure or little bobs calves or fannys mouth or carrys head as the case may be whatever the attention of mr saunders is called to mr saunders admires of course though he is rather confused about the sex of the youngest branches and looks at the wrong children turning to a girl when mr whiffler directs his attention to a boy and falling into raptures with a boy when he ought to be enchanted with a girl then the dessert comes and there is a vast deal of scrambling after fruit and sudden spirting forth of juice out of tight oranges into infant eyes and much screeching and wailing in consequence  at length it becomes time for mrs whiffler to retire and all the children are by force of arms compelled to kiss and love mr saunders before going upstairs except tom who lying on his back in the hall proclaims that mr saunders is a naughty beast and dick who having drunk his fathers wine when he was looking another way is found to be intoxicated and is carried out very limp and helpless  mr whiffler and his friend are left alone together but mr whifflers thoughts are still with his family if his family are not with him  saunders says he after a short silence if you please well drink mrs whiffler and the children  mr saunders feels this to be a reproach against himself for not proposing the same sentiment and drinks it in some confusion  ah mr whiffler sighs these children saunders make one quite an old man  mr saunders thinks that if they were his they would make him a very old man but he says nothing  and yet pursues mr whiffler what can equal domestic happiness what can equal the engaging ways of children  saunders why dont you get married now this is an embarrassing question because mr saunders has been thinking that if he had at any time entertained matrimonial designs the revelation of that day would surely have routed them for ever  i am glad however says mr whiffler that you are a bachelorglad on one account saunders a selfish one i admit will you do mrs whiffler and myself a favour  mr saunders is surprisedevidently surprised but he replies with the greatest pleasure  then will you saunders says mr whiffler in an impressive manner will you cement and consolidate our friendship by coming into the family so to speak as a godfather  i shall be proud and delighted replies mr saunders  which of the children is it really i thought they were all christened or saunders mr whiffler interposes they are all christened you are right  the fact is that mrs whiffler isin short we expect another  not a ninth cries the friend all aghast at the idea yes saunders rejoins mr whiffler solemnly a ninth  did we drink mrs whifflers health  let us drink it again saunders and wish her well over it  doctor johnson used to tell a story of a man who had but one idea which was a wrong one  the couple who dote upon their children are in the same predicament  at home or abroad at all times and in all places their thoughts are bound up in this one subject and have no sphere beyond  they relate the clever things their offspring say or do and weary every company with their prolixity and absurdity  mr whiffler takes a friend by the button at a street corner on a windy day to tell him a bon mot of his youngest boys and mrs whiffler calling to see a sick acquaintance entertains her with a cheerful account of all her own past sufferings and present expectations  in such cases the sins of the fathers indeed descend upon the children for people soon come to regard them as predestined little bores  the couple who dote upon their children cannot be said to be actuated by a general love for these engaging little people which would be a great excuse for they are apt to underrate and entertain a jealousy of any children but their own  if they examined their own hearts they would perhaps find at the bottom of all this more selflove and egotism than they think of  selflove and egotism are bad qualities of which the unrestrained exhibition though it may be sometimes amusing never fails to be wearisome and unpleasant  couples who dote upon their children therefore are best avoided    the cool couple    there is an oldfashioned weatherglass representing a house with two doorways in one of which is the figure of a gentleman in the other the figure of a lady  when the weather is to be fine the lady comes out and the gentleman goes in when wet the gentleman comes out and the lady goes in  they never seek each others society are never elevated and depressed by the same cause and have nothing in common  they are the model of a cool couple except that there is something of politeness and consideration about the behaviour of the gentleman in the weatherglass in which neither of the cool couple can be said to participate  the cool couple are seldom alone together and when they are nothing can exceed their apathy and dulness  the gentleman being for the most part drowsy and the lady silent  if they enter into conversation it is usually of an ironical or recriminatory nature thus when the gentleman has indulged in a very long yawn and settled himself more snugly in his easychair the lady will perhaps remark well i am sure charles  i hope youre comfortable  to which the gentleman replies oh yes hes quite comfortable quite  there are not many married men i hope returns the lady who seek comfort in such selfish gratifications as you do  nor many wives who seek comfort in such selfish gratifications as you do i hope retorts the gentleman  whose fault is that demands the lady  the gentleman becoming more sleepy returns no answer  whose fault is that the lady repeats  the gentleman still returning no answer she goes on to say that she believes there never was in all this world anybody so attached to her home so thoroughly domestic so unwilling to seek a moments gratification or pleasure beyond her own fireside as she  god knows that before she was married she never thought or dreamt of such a thing and she remembers that her poor papa used to say again and again almost every day of his life oh my dear louisa if you only marry a man who understands you and takes the trouble to consider your happiness and accommodate himself a very little to your disposition what a treasure he will find in you she supposes her papa knew what her disposition washe had known her long enoughhe ought to have been acquainted with it but what can she do  if her home is always dull and lonely and her husband is always absent and finds no pleasure in her society she is naturally sometimes driven seldom enough she is sure to seek a little recreation elsewhere she is not expected to pine and mope to death she hopes  then come louisa says the gentleman waking up as suddenly as he fell asleep stop at home this evening and so will i  i should be sorry to suppose charles that you took a pleasure in aggravating me replies the lady but you know as well as i do that i am particularly engaged to mrs mortimer and that it would be an act of the grossest rudeness and illbreeding after accepting a seat in her box and preventing her from inviting anybody else not to go  ah there it is says the gentleman shrugging his shoulders i knew that perfectly well  i knew you couldnt devote an evening to your own home  now all i have to say louisa is thisrecollect that i was quite willing to stay at home and that its no fault of mine we are not oftener together  with that the gentleman goes away to keep an old appointment at his club and the lady hurries off to dress for mrs mortimers and neither thinks of the other until by some odd chance they find themselves alone again  but it must not be supposed that the cool couple are habitually a quarrelsome one  quite the contrary  these differences are only occasions for a little selfexcusenothing more  in general they are as easy and careless and dispute as seldom as any common acquaintances may for it is neither worth their while to put each other out of the way nor to ruffle themselves  when they meet in society the cool couple are the bestbred people in existence  the lady is seated in a corner among a little knot of lady friends one of whom exclaims why i vow and declare there is your husband my dear  whosemine she says carelessly  ay yours and coming this way too  how very odd says the lady in a languid tone i thought he had been at dover the gentleman coming up and speaking to all the other ladies and nodding slightly to his wife it turns out that he has been at dover and has just now returned  what a strange creature you are cries his wife and what on earth brought you here i wonder  i came to look after you of course rejoins her husband  this is so pleasant a jest that the lady is mightily amused as are all the other ladies similarly situated who are within hearing and while they are enjoying it to the full the gentleman nods again turns upon his heel and saunters away  there are times however when his company is not so agreeable though equally unexpected such as when the lady has invited one or two particular friends to tea and scandal and he happens to come home in the very midst of their diversion  it is a hundred chances to one that he remains in the house half an hour but the lady is rather disturbed by the intrusion notwithstanding and reasons within herselfi am sure i never interfere with him and why should he interfere with me  it can scarcely be accidental it never happens that i have a particular reason for not wishing him to come home but he always comes  its very provoking and tiresome and i am sure when he leaves me so much alone for his own pleasure the least he could do would be to do as much for mine observing what passes in her mind the gentleman who has come home for his own accommodation makes a merit of it with himself arrives at the conclusion that it is the very last place in which he can hope to be comfortable and determines as he takes up his hat and cane never to be so virtuous again  thus a great many cool couples go on until they are cold couples and the grave has closed over their folly and indifference  loss of name station character life itself has ensued from causes as slight as these before now and when gossips tell such tales and aggravate their deformities they elevate their hands and eyebrows and call each other to witness what a cool couple mr and mrs so andso always were even in the best of times    the plausible couple    the plausible couple have many titles  they are a delightful couple an affectionate couple a most agreeable couple a goodhearted couple and the bestnatured couple in existence the truth is that the plausible couple are people of the world and either the way of pleasing the world has grown much easier than it was in the days of the old man and his ass or the old man was but a bad hand at it and knew very little of the trade  but is it really possible to please the world says some doubting reader  it is indeed  nay it is not only very possible but very easy  the ways are crooked and sometimes foul and low  what then  a man need but crawl upon his hands and knees know when to close his eyes and when his ears when to stoop and when to stand upright and if by the world is meant that atom of it in which he moves himself he shall please it never fear  now it will be readily seen that if a plausible man or woman have an easy means of pleasing the world by an adaptation of self to all its twistings and twinings a plausible man and woman or in other words a plausible couple playing into each others hands and acting in concert have a manifest advantage  hence it is that plausible couples scarcely ever fail of success on a pretty large scale and hence it is that if the reader laying down this unwieldy volume at the next full stop will have the goodness to review his or her circle of acquaintance and to search particularly for some man and wife with a large connexion and a good name not easily referable to their abilities or their wealth he or she that is the male or female reader will certainly find that gentleman or lady on a very short reflection to be a plausible couple  the plausible couple are the most ecstatic people living  the most sensitive peopleto meriton the face of the earth  nothing clever or virtuous escapes them  they have microscopic eyes for such endowments and can find them anywhere  the plausible couple never fawnoh no  they dont even scruple to tell their friends of their faults  one is too generous another too candid a third has a tendency to think all people like himself and to regard mankind as a company of angels a fourth is kindhearted to a fault  we never flatter my dear mrs jackson say the plausible couple we speak our minds  neither you nor mr jackson have faults enough  it may sound strangely but it is true  you have not faults enough  you know our waywe must speak out and always do  quarrel with us for saying so if you will but we repeat ityou have not faults enough  the plausible couple are no less plausible to each other than to third parties  they are always loving and harmonious  the plausible gentleman calls his wife darling and the plausible lady addresses him as dearest  if it be mr and mrs bobtail widger mrs widger is lavinia darling and mr widger is bobtail dearest  speaking of each other they observe the same tender form  mrs widger relates what bobtail said and mr widger recounts what darling thought and did  if you sit next to the plausible lady at a dinnertable she takes the earliest opportunity of expressing her belief that you are acquainted with the clickits she is sure she has heard the clickits speak of youshe must not tell you in what terms or you will take her for a flatterer  you admit a knowledge of the clickits the plausible lady immediately launches out in their praise  she quite loves the clickits  were there ever such true hearted hospitable excellent peoplesuch a gentle interesting little woman as mrs clickit or such a frank unaffected creature as mr clickit were there ever two people in short so little spoiled by the world as they are  as who darling cries mr widger from the opposite side of the table  the clickits dearest replies mrs widger  indeed you are right darling mr widger rejoins the clickits are a very highminded worthy estimable couple  mrs widger remarking that bobtail always grows quite eloquent upon this subject mr widger admits that he feels very strongly whenever such people as the clickits and some other friends of his here he glances at the host and hostess are mentioned for they are an honour to human nature and do one good to think of  you know the clickits mrs jackson he says addressing the lady of the house  no indeed we have not that pleasure she replies  you astonish me exclaims mr widger not know the clickits why you are the very people of all others who ought to be their bosom friends  you are kindred beings you are one and the same thing not know the clickits  now will you know the clickits  will you make a point of knowing them  will you meet them in a friendly way at our house one evening and be acquainted with them  mrs jackson will be quite delighted nothing would give her more pleasure  then lavinia my darling says mr widger mind you dont lose sight of that now pray take care that mr and mrs jackson know the clickits without loss of time  such people ought not to be strangers to each other  mrs widger books both families as the centre of attraction for her next party and mr widger going on to expatiate upon the virtues of the clickits adds to their other moral qualities that they keep one of the neatest phaetons in town and have two thousand a year  as the plausible couple never laud the merits of any absent person without dexterously contriving that their praises shall reflect upon somebody who is present so they never depreciate anything or anybody without turning their depreciation to the same account their friend mr slummery say they is unquestionably a clever painter and would no doubt be very popular and sell his pictures at a very high price if that cruel mr fithers had not forestalled him in his department of art and made it thoroughly and completely his ownfithers it is to be observed being present and within hearing and slummery elsewhere  is mrs tabblewick really as beautiful as people say  why there indeed you ask them a very puzzling question because there is no doubt that she is a very charming woman and they have long known her intimately  she is no doubt beautiful very beautiful they once thought her the most beautiful woman ever seen still if you press them for an honest answer they are bound to say that this was before they had ever seen our lovely friend on the sofa the sofa is hard by and our lovely friend cant help hearing the whispers in which this is said since that time perhaps they have been hardly fair judges mrs tabblewick is no doubt extremely handsomevery like our friend in fact in the form of the featuresbut in point of expression and soul and figure and air altogetheroh dear  but while the plausible couple depreciate they are still careful to preserve their character for amiability and kind feeling indeed the depreciation itself is often made to grow out of their excessive sympathy and good will  the plausible lady calls on a lady who dotes upon her children and is sitting with a little girl upon her knee enraptured by her artless replies and protesting that there is nothing she delights in so much as conversing with these fairies when the other lady inquires if she has seen young mrs finching lately and whether the baby has turned out a finer one than it promised to be  oh dear cries the plausible lady you cannot think how often bobtail and i have talked about poor mrs finchingshe is such a dear soul and was so anxious that the baby should be a fine childand very naturally because she was very much here at one time and there is you know a natural emulation among mothersthat it is impossible to tell you how much we have felt for her  is it weak or plain or what inquires the other  weak or plain my love returns the plausible lady its a frighta perfect little fright you never saw such a miserable creature in all your days  positively you must not let her see one of these beautiful dears again or youll break her heart you will indeedheaven bless this child see how she is looking in my face can you conceive anything prettier than that if poor mrs finching could only hopebut thats impossibleand the gifts of providence you knowwhat did i do with my pocket handkerchief  what prompts the mother who dotes upon her children to comment to her lord that evening on the plausible ladys engaging qualities and feeling heart and what is it that procures mr and mrs bobtail widger an immediate invitation to dinner    the nice little couple    a custom once prevailed in oldfashioned circles that when a lady or gentleman was unable to sing a song he or she should enliven the company with a story  as we find ourself in the predicament of not being able to describe to our own satisfaction nice little couples in the abstract we purpose telling in this place a little story about a nice little couple of our acquaintance  mr and mrs chirrup are the nice little couple in question  mr chirrup has the smartness and something of the brisk quick manner of a small bird  mrs chirrup is the prettiest of all little women and has the prettiest little figure conceivable  she has the neatest little foot and the softest little voice and the pleasantest little smile and the tidiest little curls and the brightest little eyes and the quietest little manner and is in short altogether one of the most engaging of all little women dead or alive  she is a condensation of all the domestic virtues a pocket edition of the young mans best companiona little woman at a very high pressure with an amazing quantity of goodness and usefulness in an exceedingly small space  little as she is mrs chirrup might furnish forth matter for the moral equipment of a score of housewives six feet high in their stockingsif in the presence of ladies we may be allowed the expressionand of corresponding robustness  nobody knows all this better than mr chirrup though he rather takes on that he dont  accordingly he is very proud of his betterhalf and evidently considers himself as all other people consider him rather fortunate in having her to wife  we say evidently because mr chirrup is a warmhearted little fellow and if you catch his eye when he has been slyly glancing at mrs chirrup in company there is a certain complacent twinkle in it accompanied perhaps by a halfexpressed toss of the head which as clearly indicates what has been passing in his mind as if he had put it into words and shouted it out through a speakingtrumpet moreover mr chirrup has a particularly mild and birdlike manner of calling mrs chirrup my dear andfor he is of a jocose turn of cutting little witticisms upon her and making her the subject of various harmless pleasantries which nobody enjoys more thoroughly than mrs chirrup herself  mr chirrup too now and then affects to deplore his bachelordays and to bemoan with a marvellously contented and smirking face the loss of his freedom and the sorrow of his heart at having been taken captive by mrs chirrupall of which circumstances combine to show the secret triumph and satisfaction of mr chirrups soul  we have already had occasion to observe that mrs chirrup is an incomparable housewife  in all the arts of domestic arrangement and management in all the mysteries of confectionerymaking pickling and preserving never was such a thorough adept as that nice little body  she is besides a cunning worker in muslin and fine linen and a special hand at marketing to the very best advantage  but if there be one branch of housekeeping in which she excels to an utterly unparalleled and unprecedented extent it is in the important one of carving  a roast goose is universally allowed to be the great stumblingblock in the way of young aspirants to perfection in this department of science many promising carvers beginning with legs of mutton and preserving a good reputation through fillets of veal sirloins of beef quarters of lamb fowls and even ducks have sunk before a roast goose and lost caste and character for ever  to mrs chirrup the resolving a goose into its smallest component parts is a pleasant pastimea practical jokea thing to be done in a minute or so without the smallest interruption to the conversation of the time  no handing the dish over to an unfortunate man upon her right or left no wild sharpening of the knife no hacking and sawing at an unruly joint no noise no splash no heat no leaving off in despair all is confidence and cheerfulness  the dish is set upon the table the cover is removed for an instant and only an instant you observe that mrs chirrups attention is distracted she smiles but heareth not  you proceed with your story meanwhile the glittering knife is slowly upraised both mrs chirrups wrists are slightly but not ungracefully agitated she compresses her lips for an instant then breaks into a smile and all is over  the legs of the bird slide gently down into a pool of gravy the wings seem to melt from the body the breast separates into a row of juicy slices the smaller and more complicated parts of his anatomy are perfectly developed a cavern of stuffing is revealed and the goose is gone  to dine with mr and mrs chirrup is one of the pleasantest things in the world  mr chirrup has a bachelor friend who lived with him in his own days of single blessedness and to whom he is mightily attached  contrary to the usual custom this bachelor friend is no less a friend of mrs chirrups and consequently whenever you dine with mr and mrs chirrup you meet the bachelor friend  it would put any reasonablyconditioned mortal into good humour to observe the entire unanimity which subsists between these three but there is a quiet welcome dimpling in mrs chirrups face a bustling hospitality oozing as it were out of the waistcoatpockets of mr chirrup and a patronising enjoyment of their cordiality and satisfaction on the part of the bachelor friend which is quite delightful  on these occasions mr chirrup usually takes an opportunity of rallying the friend on being single and the friend retorts on mr chirrup for being married at which moments some single young ladies present are like to die of laughter and we have more than once observed them bestow looks upon the friend which convinces us that his position is by no means a safe one as indeed we hold no bachelors to be who visits married friends and cracks jokes on wedlock for certain it is that such men walk among traps and nets and pitfalls innumerable and often find themselves down upon their knees at the altar rails taking m or n for their wedded wives before they know anything about the matter  however this is no business of mr chirrups who talks and laughs and drinks his wine and laughs again and talks more until it is time to repair to the drawingroom where coffee served and over mrs chirrup prepares for a round game by sorting the nicest possible little fish into the nicest possible little pools and calling mr chirrup to assist her which mr chirrup does  as they stand side by side you find that mr chirrup is the least possible shadow of a shade taller than mrs chirrup and that they are the neatest and bestmatched little couple that can be which the chances are ten to one against your observing with such effect at any other time unless you see them in the street armin arm or meet them some rainy day trotting along under a very small umbrella  the round game at which mr chirrup is the merriest of the party being done and over in course of time a nice little tray appears on which is a nice little supper and when that is finished likewise and you have said good night you find yourself repeating a dozen times as you ride home that there never was such a nice little couple as mr and mrs chirrup  whether it is that pleasant qualities being packed more closely in small bodies than in large come more readily to hand than when they are diffused over a wider space and have to be gathered together for use we dont know but as a general rule strengthened like all other rules by its exceptionswe hold that little people are sprightly and goodnatured  the more sprightly and goodnatured people we have the better therefore let us wish well to all nice little couples and hope that they may increase and multiply    the egotistical couple    egotism in couples is of two kindsit is our purpose to show this by two examples  the egotistical couple may be young old middleaged well to do or ill to do they may have a small family a large family or no family at all  there is no outward sign by which an egotistical couple may be known and avoided  they come upon you unawares there is no guarding against them  no man can of himself be forewarned or forearmed against an egotistical couple  the egotistical couple have undergone every calamity and experienced every pleasurable and painful sensation of which our nature is susceptible  you cannot by possibility tell the egotistical couple anything they dont know or describe to them anything they have not felt  they have been everything but dead sometimes we are tempted to wish they had been even that but only in our uncharitable moments which are few and far between  we happened the other day in the course of a morning call to encounter an egotistical couple nor were we suffered to remain long in ignorance of the fact for our very first inquiry of the lady of the house brought them into active and vigorous operation the inquiry was of course touching the ladys health and the answer happened to be that she had not been very well  oh my dear said the egotistical lady dont talk of not being well we have been in such a state since we saw you lastthe lady of the house happening to remark that her lord had not been well either the egotistical gentleman struck in  never let briggs complain of not being wellnever let briggs complain my dear mrs briggs after what i have undergone within these six weeks  he doesnt know what it is to be ill he hasnt the least idea of it not the faintest conceptionmy dear interposed his wife smiling you talk as if it were almost a crime in mr briggs not to have been as ill as we have been instead of feeling thankful to providence that both he and our dear mrs briggs are in such blissful ignorance of real sufferingmy love returned the egotistical gentleman in a low and pious voice you mistake me i feel gratefulvery grateful  i trust our friends may never purchase their experience as dearly as we have bought ours i hope they never may  having put down mrs briggs upon this theme and settled the question thus the egotistical gentleman turned to us and after a few preliminary remarks all tending towards and leading up to the point he had in his mind inquired if we happened to be acquainted with the dowager lady snorflerer  on our replying in the negative he presumed we had often met lord slang or beyond all doubt that we were on intimate terms with sir chipkins glogwog  finding that we were equally unable to lay claim to either of these distinctions he expressed great astonishment and turning to his wife with a retrospective smile inquired who it was that had told that capital story about the mashed potatoes  who my dear returned the egotistical lady why sir chipkins of course how can you ask  dont you remember his applying it to our cook and saying that you and i were so like the prince and princess that he could almost have sworn we were they  to be sure i remember that said the egotistical gentleman but are you quite certain that didnt apply to the other anecdote about the emperor of austria and the pump  upon my word then i think it did replied his wife  to be sure it did said the egotistical gentleman it was slangs story i remember now perfectly however it turned out a few seconds afterwards that the egotistical gentlemans memory was rather treacherous as he began to have a misgiving that the story had been told by the dowager lady snorflerer the very last time they dined there but there appearing on further consideration strong circumstantial evidence tending to show that this couldnt be inasmuch as the dowager lady snorflerer had been on the occasion in question wholly engrossed by the egotistical lady the egotistical gentleman recanted this opinion and after laying the story at the doors of a great many great people happily left it at last with the duke of scuttlewig observing that it was not extraordinary he had forgotten his grace hitherto as it often happened that the names of those with whom we were upon the most familiar footing were the very last to present themselves to our thoughts  it not only appeared that the egotistical couple knew everybody but that scarcely any event of importance or notoriety had occurred for many years with which they had not been in some way or other connected  thus we learned that when the wellknown attempt upon the life of george the third was made by hatfield in drury lane theatre the egotistical gentlemans grandfather sat upon his right hand and was the first man who collared him and that the egotistical ladys aunt sitting within a few boxes of the royal party was the only person in the audience who heard his majesty exclaim charlotte charlotte dont be frightened dont be frightened theyre letting off squibs theyre letting off squibs  when the fire broke out which ended in the destruction of the two houses of parliament the egotistical couple being at the time at a drawingroom window on blackheath then and there simultaneously exclaimed to the astonishment of a whole party its the house of lords  nor was this a solitary instance of their peculiar discernment for chancing to be as by a comparison of dates and circumstances they afterwards found in the same omnibus with mr greenacre when he carried his victims head about town in a blue bag they both remarked a singular twitching in the muscles of his countenance and walking down fish street hill a few weeks since the egotistical gentleman said to his lady slightly casting up his eyes to the top of the monumenttheres a boy up there my dear reading a bible  its very strange  i dont like itin five seconds afterwards sir says the egotistical gentleman bringing his hands together with one violent clapthe lad was over  diversifying these topics by the introduction of many others of the same kind and entertaining us between whiles with a minute account of what weather and diet agreed with them and what weather and diet disagreed with them and at what time they usually got up and at what time went to bed with many other particulars of their domestic economy too numerous to mention the egotistical couple at length took their leave and afforded us an opportunity of doing the same  mr and mrs sliverstone are an egotistical couple of another class for all the ladys egotism is about her husband and all the gentlemans about his wife  for example mr sliverstone is a clerical gentleman and occasionally writes sermons as clerical gentlemen do  if you happen to obtain admission at the streetdoor while he is so engaged mrs sliverstone appears on tiptoe and speaking in a solemn whisper as if there were at least three or four particular friends upstairs all upon the point of death implores you to be very silent for mr sliverstone is composing and she need not say how very important it is that he should not be disturbed  unwilling to interrupt anything so serious you hasten to withdraw with many apologies but this mrs sliverstone will by no means allow observing that she knows you would like to see him as it is very natural you should and that she is determined to make a trial for you as you are a great favourite  so you are led upstairsstill on tiptoeto the door of a little back room in which as the lady informs you in a whisper mr sliverstone always writes  no answer being returned to a couple of soft taps the lady opens the door and there sure enough is mr sliverstone with dishevelled hair powdering away with pen ink and paper at a rate which if he has any power of sustaining it would settle the longest sermon in no time  at first he is too much absorbed to be roused by this intrusion but presently looking up says faintly ah and pointing to his desk with a weary and languid smile extends his hand and hopes youll forgive him then mrs sliverstone sits down beside him and taking his hand in hers tells you how that mr sliverstone has been shut up there ever since nine oclock in the morning it is by this time twelve at noon and how she knows it cannot be good for his health and is very uneasy about it  unto this mr sliverstone replies firmly that it must be done which agonizes mrs sliverstone still more and she goes on to tell you that such were mr sliverstones labours last weekwhat with the buryings marryings churchings christenings and all togetherthat when he was going up the pulpit stairs on sunday evening he was obliged to hold on by the rails or he would certainly have fallen over into his own pew mr sliverstone who has been listening and smiling meekly says not quite so bad as that not quite so bad he admits though on crossexamination that he was very near falling upon the verger who was following him up to bolt the door but adds that it was his duty as a christian to fall upon him if need were and that he mr sliverstone and possibly the verger too ought to glory in it  this sentiment communicates new impulse to mrs sliverstone who launches into new praises of mr sliverstones worth and excellence to which he listens in the same meek silence save when he puts in a word of selfdenial relative to some question of fact asnot seventytwo christenings that week my dear  only seventyone only seventyone  at length his lady has quite concluded and then he says why should he repine why should he give way why should he suffer his heart to sink within him  is it he alone who toils and suffers  what has she gone through he should like to know  what does she go through every day for him and for society  with such an exordium mr sliverstone launches out into glowing praises of the conduct of mrs sliverstone in the production of eight young children and the subsequent rearing and fostering of the same and thus the husband magnifies the wife and the wife the husband  this would be well enough if mr and mrs sliverstone kept it to themselves or even to themselves and a friend or two but they do not  the more hearers they have the more egotistical the couple become and the more anxious they are to make believers in their merits  perhaps this is the worst kind of egotism  it has not even the poor excuse of being spontaneous but is the result of a deliberate system and malice aforethought  mere emptyheaded conceit excites our pity but ostentatious hypocrisy awakens our disgust    the couple who coddle themselves    mrs merrywinkles maiden name was chopper  she was the only child of mr and mrs chopper  her father died when she was as the playbooks express it yet an infant and so old mrs chopper when her daughter married made the house of her soninlaw her home from that time henceforth and set up her staff of rest with mr and mrs merrywinkle  mr and mrs merrywinkle are a couple who coddle themselves and the venerable mrs chopper is an aider and abettor in the same  mr merrywinkle is a rather lean and longnecked gentleman middle aged and middlesized and usually troubled with a cold in the head  mrs merrywinkle is a delicatelooking lady with very light hair and is exceedingly subject to the same unpleasant disorder the venerable mrs chopperwho is strictly entitled to the appellation her daughter not being very young otherwise than by courtesy at the time of her marriage which was some years agois a mysterious old lady who lurks behind a pair of spectacles and is afflicted with a chronic disease respecting which she has taken a vast deal of medical advice and referred to a vast number of medical books without meeting any definition of symptoms that at all suits her or enables her to say thats my complaint indeed the absence of authentic information upon the subject of this complaint would seem to be mrs choppers greatest ill as in all other respects she is an uncommonly hale and hearty gentlewoman  both mr and mrs chopper wear an extraordinary quantity of flannel and have a habit of putting their feet in hot water to an unnatural extent  they likewise indulge in chamomile tea and such like compounds and rub themselves on the slightest provocation with camphorated spirits and other lotions applicable to mumps sorethroat rheumatism or lumbago  mr merrywinkles leaving home to go to business on a damp or wet morning is a very elaborate affair  he puts on washleather socks over his stockings and indiarubber shoes above his boots and wears under his waistcoat a cuirass of hareskin  besides these precautions he winds a thick shawl round his throat and blocks up his mouth with a large silk handkerchief  thus accoutred and furnished besides with a greatcoat and umbrella he braves the dangers of the streets travelling in severe weather at a gentle trot the better to preserve the circulation and bringing his mouth to the surface to take breath but very seldom and with the utmost caution  his officedoor opened he shoots past his clerk at the same pace and diving into his own private room closes the door examines the windowfastenings and gradually unrobes himself  hanging his pockethandkerchief on the fender to air and determining to write to the newspapers about the fog which he says has really got to that pitch that it is quite unbearable  in this last opinion mrs merrywinkle and her respected mother fully concur for though not present their thoughts and tongues are occupied with the same subject which is their constant theme all day  if anybody happens to call mrs merrywinkle opines that they must assuredly be mad and her first salutation is why what in the name of goodness can bring you out in such weather  you know you must catch your death  this assurance is corroborated by mrs chopper who adds in further confirmation a dismal legend concerning an individual of her acquaintance who making a call under precisely parallel circumstances and being then in the best health and spirits expired in fortyeight hours afterwards of a complication of inflammatory disorders  the visitor rendered not altogether comfortable perhaps by this and other precedents inquires very affectionately after mr merrywinkle but by so doing brings about no change of the subject for mr merrywinkles name is inseparably connected with his complaints and his complaints are inseparably connected with mrs merrywinkles and when these are done with mrs chopper who has been biding her time cuts in with the chronic disordera subject upon which the amiable old lady never leaves off speaking until she is left alone and very often not then  but mr merrywinkle comes home to dinner  he is received by mrs merrywinkle and mrs chopper who on his remarking that he thinks his feet are damp turn pale as ashes and drag him upstairs imploring him to have them rubbed directly with a dry coarse towel rubbed they are one by mrs merrywinkle and one by mrs chopper until the friction causes mr merrywinkle to make horrible faces and look as if he had been smelling very powerful onions when they desist and the patient provided for his better security with thick worsted stockings and list slippers is borne downstairs to dinner  now the dinner is always a good one the appetites of the diners being delicate and requiring a little of what mrs merrywinkle calls tittivation the secret of which is understood to lie in good cookery and tasteful spices and which process is so successfully performed in the present instance that both mr and mrs merrywinkle eat a remarkably good dinner and even the afflicted mrs chopper wields her knife and fork with much of the spirit and elasticity of youth  but mr merrywinkle in his desire to gratify his appetite is not unmindful of his health for he has a bottle of carbonate of soda with which to qualify his porter and a little pair of scales in which to weigh it out  neither in his anxiety to take care of his body is he unmindful of the welfare of his immortal part as he always prays that for what he is going to receive he may be made truly thankful and in order that he may be as thankful as possible eats and drinks to the utmost  either from eating and drinking so much or from being the victim of this constitutional infirmity among others mr merrywinkle after two or three glasses of wine falls fast asleep and he has scarcely closed his eyes when mrs merrywinkle and mrs chopper fall asleep likewise  it is on awakening at teatime that their most alarming symptoms prevail for then mr merrywinkle feels as if his temples were tightly bound round with the chain of the streetdoor and mrs merrywinkle as if she had made a hearty dinner of halfhundredweights and mrs chopper as if cold water were running down her back and oysterknives with sharp points were plunging of their own accord into her ribs  symptoms like these are enough to make people peevish and no wonder that they remain so until suppertime doing little more than doze and complain unless mr merrywinkle calls out very loudly to a servant to keep that draught out or rushes into the passage to flourish his fist in the countenance of the twopennypostman for daring to give such a knock as he had just performed at the door of a private gentleman with nerves  supper coming after dinner should consist of some gentle provocative and therefore the tittivating art is again in requisition and againdone honour to by mr and mrs merrywinkle still comforted and abetted by mrs chopper  after supper it is ten to one but the lastnamed old lady becomes worse and is led off to bed with the chronic complaint in full vigour  mr and mrs merrywinkle having administered to her a warm cordial which is something of the strongest then repair to their own room where mr merrywinkle with his legs and feet in hot water superintends the mulling of some wine which he is to drink at the very moment he plunges into bed while mrs merrywinkle in garments whose nature is unknown to and unimagined by all but married men takes four small pills with a spasmodic look between each and finally comes to something hot and fragrant out of another little saucepan which serves as her composingdraught for the night  there is another kind of couple who coddle themselves and who do so at a cheaper rate and on more spare diet because they are niggardly and parsimonious for which reason they are kind enough to coddle their visitors too  it is unnecessary to describe them for our readers may rest assured of the accuracy of these general principles that all couples who coddle themselves are selfish and slothfulthat they charge upon every wind that blows every rain that falls and every vapour that hangs in the air the evils which arise from their own imprudence or the gloom which is engendered in their own tempersand that all men and women in couples or otherwise who fall into exclusive habits of selfindulgence and forget their natural sympathy and close connexion with everybody and everything in the world around them not only neglect the first duty of life but by a happy retributive justice deprive themselves of its truest and best enjoyment    the old couple    they are grandfather and grandmother to a dozen grown people and have greatgrandchildren besides their bodies are bent their hair is grey their step tottering and infirm  is this the lightsome pair whose wedding was so merry and have the young couple indeed grown old so soon  it seems but yesterdayand yet what a host of cares and griefs are crowded into the intervening time which reckoned by them lengthens out into a century  how many new associations have wreathed themselves about their hearts since then  the old time is gone and a new time has come for othersnot for them  they are but the rusting link that feebly joins the two and is silently loosening its hold and dropping asunder  it seems but yesterdayand yet three of their children have sunk into the grave and the tree that shades it has grown quite old one was an infantthey wept for him the next a girl a slight young thing too delicate for earthher loss was hard indeed to bear  the third a man  that was the worst of all but even that grief is softened now  it seems but yesterdayand yet how the gay and laughing faces of that bright morning have changed and vanished from above ground faint likenesses of some remain about them yet but they are very faint and scarcely to be traced  the rest are only seen in dreams and even they are unlike what they were in eyes so old and dim  one or two dresses from the bridal wardrobe are yet preserved they are of a quaint and antique fashion and seldom seen except in pictures  white has turned yellow and brighter hues have faded do you wonder child  the wrinkled face was once as smooth as yours the eyes as bright the shrivelled skin as fair and delicate  it is the work of hands that have been dust these many years  where are the fairy lovers of that happy day whose annual return comes upon the old man and his wife like the echo of some village bell which has long been silent  let yonder peevish bachelor racked by rheumatic pains and quarrelling with the world let him answer to the question  he recollects something of a favourite playmate her name was lucyso they tell him  he is not sure whether she was married or went abroad or died  it is a long while ago and he dont remember  is nothing as it used to be does no one feel or think or act as in days of yore  yes  there is an aged woman who once lived servant with the old ladys father and is sheltered in an alms house not far off  she is still attached to the family and loves them all she nursed the children in her lap and tended in their sickness those who are no more  her old mistress has still something of youth in her eyes the young ladies are like what she was but not quite so handsome nor are the gentlemen as stately as mr harvey used to be  she has seen a great deal of trouble her husband and her son died long ago but she has got over that and is happy nowquite happy  if ever her attachment to her old protectors were disturbed by fresher cares and hopes it has long since resumed its former current  it has filled the void in the poor creatures heart and replaced the love of kindred  death has not left her alone and this with a roof above her head and a warm hearth to sit by makes her cheerful and contented  does she remember the marriage of greatgrandmamma  ay that she does as wellas if it was only yesterday  you wouldnt think it to look at her now and perhaps she ought not to say so of herself but she was as smart a young girl then as youd wish to see  she recollects she took a friend of hers upstairs to see miss emma dressed for church her name wasah she forgets the name but she remembers that she was a very pretty girl and that she married not long afterwards and livedit has quite passed out of her mind where she lived but she knows she had a bad husband who used her ill and that she died in lambeth workhouse  dear dear in lambeth workhouse  and the old couplehave they no comfort or enjoyment of existence see them among their grandchildren and greatgrandchildren how garrulous they are how they compare one with another and insist on likenesses which no one else can see how gently the old lady lectures the girls on points of breeding and decorum and points the moral by anecdotes of herself in her young dayshow the old gentleman chuckles over boyish feats and roguish tricks and tells long stories of a barringout achieved at the school he went to which was very wrong he tells the boys and never to be imitated of course but which he cannot help letting them know was very pleasant tooespecially when he kissed the masters niece  this last however is a point on which the old lady is very tender for she considers it a shocking and indelicate thing to talk about and always says so whenever it is mentioned never failing to observe that he ought to be very penitent for having been so sinful  so the old gentleman gets no further and what the schoolmasters niece said afterwards which he is always going to tell is lost to posterity  the old gentleman is eighty years old todayeighty years old crofts and never had a headache he tells the barber who shaves him the barber being a young fellow and very subject to that complaint  thats a great age crofts says the old gentleman i dont think its sich a wery great age sir replied the barber  crofts rejoins the old gentleman youre talking nonsense to me  eighty not a great age  its a wery great age sir for a gentleman to be as healthy and active as you are returns the barber but my grandfather sir he was ninetyfour you dont mean that crofts says the old gentleman  i do indeed sir retorts the barber and as wiggerous as julius caesar my grandfather was  the old gentleman muses a little time and then says what did he die of crofts  he died accidentally sir returns the barber he didnt mean to do it he always would go a running about the streetswalking never satisfied his spiritand he run against a post and died of a hurt in his chest  the old gentleman says no more until the shaving is concluded and then he gives crofts halfacrown to drink his health  he is a little doubtful of the barbers veracity afterwards and telling the anecdote to the old lady affects to make very light of itthough to be sure he adds there was old parr and in some parts of england ninetyfive or so is a common age quite a common age  this morning the old couple are cheerful but serious recalling old times as well as they can remember them and dwelling upon many passages in their past lives which the day brings to mind  the old lady reads aloud in a tremulous voice out of a great bible and the old gentleman with his hand to his ear listens with profound respect  when the book is closed they sit silent for a short space and afterwards resume their conversation with a reference perhaps to their dead children as a subject not unsuited to that they have just left  by degrees they are led to consider which of those who survive are the most like those dearlyremembered objects and so they fall into a less solemn strain and become cheerful again  how many people in all grandchildren greatgrandchildren and one or two intimate friends of the family dine together today at the eldest sons to congratulate the old couple and wish them many happy returns is a calculation beyond our powers but this we know that the old couple no sooner present themselves very sprucely and carefully attired than there is a violent shouting and rushing forward of the younger branches with all manner of presents such as pocketbooks pencilcases penwipers watch papers pincushions sleevebuckles workedslippers watch guards and even a nutmeggrater  the latter article being presented by a very chubby and very little boy who exhibits it in great triumph as an extraordinary variety  the old couples emotion at these tokens of remembrance occasions quite a pathetic scene of which the chief ingredients are a vast quantity of kissing and hugging and repeated wipings of small eyes and noses with small square pockethandkerchiefs which dont come at all easily out of small pockets  even the peevish bachelor is moved and he says as he presents the old gentleman with a queer sort of antique ring from his own finger that hell be deed if he doesnt think he looks younger than he did ten years ago  but the great time is after dinner when the dessert and wine are on the table which is pushed back to make plenty of room and they are all gathered in a large circle round the fire for it is then the glasses being filled and everybody ready to drink the toast that two greatgrandchildren rush out at a given signal and presently return dragging in old jane adams leaning upon her crutched stick and trembling with age and pleasure  who so popular as poor old jane nurse and storyteller in ordinary to two generations and who so happy as she striving to bend her stiff limbs into a curtsey while tears of pleasure steal down her withered cheeks  the old couple sit side by side and the old time seems like yesterday indeed  looking back upon the path they have travelled its dust and ashes disappear the flowers that withered long ago show brightly again upon its borders and they grow young once more in the youth of those about them    conclusion    we have taken for the subjects of the foregoing moral essays twelve samples of married couples carefully selected from a large stock on hand open to the inspection of all comers  these samples are intended for the benefit of the rising generation of both sexes and for their more easy and pleasant information have been separately ticketed and labelled in the manner they have seen  we have purposely excluded from consideration the couple in which the lady reigns paramount and supreme holding such cases to be of a very unnatural kind and like hideous births and other monstrous deformities only to be discreetly and sparingly exhibited  and here our selfimposed task would have ended but that to those young ladies and gentlemen who are yet revolving singly round the church awaiting the advent of that time when the mysterious laws of attraction shall draw them towards it in couples we are desirous of addressing a few last words  before marriage and afterwards let them learn to centre all their hopes of real and lasting happiness in their own fireside let them cherish the faith that in home and all the english virtues which the love of home engenders lies the only true source of domestic felicity let them believe that round the household gods contentment and tranquillity cluster in their gentlest and most graceful forms and that many weary hunters of happiness through the noisy world have learnt this truth too late and found a cheerful spirit and a quiet mind only at home at last  how much may depend on the education of daughters and the conduct of mothers how much of the brightest part of our old national character may be perpetuated by their wisdom or frittered away by their follyhow much of it may have been lost already and how much more in danger of vanishing every dayare questions too weighty for discussion here but well deserving a little serious consideration from all young couples nevertheless  to that one young couple on whose bright destiny the thoughts of nations are fixed may the youth of england look and not in vain for an example  from that one young couple blessed and favoured as they are may they learn that even the glare and glitter of a court the splendour of a palace and the pomp and glory of a throne yield in their power of conferring happiness to domestic worth and virtue  from that one young couple may they learn that the crown of a great empire costly and jewelled though it be gives place in the estimation of a queen to the plain gold ring that links her womans nature to that of tens of thousands of her humble subjects and guards in her womans heart one secret store of tenderness whose proudest boast shall be that it knows no royalty save natures own and no pride of birth but being the child of heaven  so shall the highest young couple in the land for once hear the truth when men throw up their caps and cry with loving shouts    god bless them
