with such completeness and charm that it is peculiarly fitting that the poems should be grouped and issued in a form worthy of their own excellence the coöperation of mr keller was secured for making the illustrations not only on account of his recognized ability as an artist but also because of his admiration for mr hartes writings and his previous success in illustrating several of the stories
