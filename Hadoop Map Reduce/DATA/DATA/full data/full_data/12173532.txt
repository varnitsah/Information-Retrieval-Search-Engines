who is not goodnatured but then as everybody he comes in contack with is it comes to the same thing  the strongest and kindestearted man i ever come across was a man o the name of bill burton a shipmate of ginger dicks  for that matter e was a shipmate o peter russets and old sam smalls too  not over and above tall just about my height his arms was like another mans legs for size and is chest and his back and shoulders might ha been made for a giant  and with all that hed got a soft blue eye like a gals blues my favourite colour for gals eyes and a nice soft curly brown beard  he was an ab too and that showed ow goodnatured he was to pick up with firemen  he got so fond of em that when they was all paid off from the ocean king he asked to be allowed to join them in taking a room ashore  it pleased everybody four coming cheaper than three and bill being that goodtempered that ed put up with anything and when any of the three quarrelled he used to act the part of peacemaker  illustration when any of the three quarrelled he used to act the part of peacemaker  the only thing about im that they didnt like was that e was a teetotaler  hed go into publicouses with em but he wouldnt drink leastways that is to say he wouldnt drink beer and ginger used to say that it made im feel uncomfortable to see bill put away a bottle o lemonade every time they ad a drink  one night arter e had ad seventeen bottles he could ardly got home and peter russet who knew a lot about pills and suchlike pointed out to im ow bad it was for his constitushon  he proved that the lemonade would eat away the coats o bills stomach and that if e kept on e might drop down dead at any moment  that frightened bill a bit and the next night instead of aving lemonade e had five bottles o stone gingerbeer six of different kinds of teetotal beer three of sodawater and two cups of coffee  im not counting the drink he ad at the chemists shop arterward because he took that as medicine but he was so queer in is inside next morning that e began to be afraid hed ave to give up drink altogether  he went without the next night but e was such a generous man that e would pay every fourth time and there was no pleasure to the other chaps to see im pay and ave nothing out of it  it spoilt their evening and owing to aving only about arf wot they was accustomed to they all got up very disagreeable next morning  why not take just a little beer bill asks ginger  bill ung his ead and looked a bit silly  id rather not mate he ses at last  ive been teetotal for eleven months now  think of your ealth

was surprised to see the way e took his liquor  arter three or four pints hed expected to see im turn a bit silly or sing or do something o the kind but bill kept on as if e was drinking water  think of the armless pleasure youve been losing all these months bill ses ginger smiling at him  bill said it wouldnt bear thinking of and the next place they came to he said some rather ard things of the man whod persuaded im to take the pledge  he ad two or three more there and then they began to see that it was beginning to have an effect on im  the first one that noticed it was ginger dick  bill ad

ready to give me is lip next time  lets come to another pub and enjoy ourselves  sam and peter followed im out like lambs ardly daring to look over their shoulder at ginger who was staggering arter them some distance behind a olding a handerchief to is face  its your turn to pay sam ses bill when theyd got inside the next place  wots it to be  give it a name  three arf pints o four ale miss ses

hisself up arter a time and went outside to talk to ginger about it and then bill put is arm round peters neck and began to cry a bit and say e was the only pal hed got left in the world  it was very awkward for peter and more awkward still when the barman came up and told im to take bill outside  go on he ses out with im  hes all right ses peter trembling wes the truestarted gentleman in london

punched at im over the bar and not being able to reach im threw peters pot o beer at im  there was a fearful todo then and the landlord jumped over the bar and stood in the doorway whistling for the police  bill struck out right and left and the men in the bar went down like skittles peter among them  then they got outside and bill arter giving the landlord a thump in the back wot nearly made him swallow the whistle jumped into a cab and pulled peter russet in arter im  illustration bill jumped into a cab and pulled peter russet in arter im  ill talk to you byandby he ses as the cab drove off

such a dressing down that peter thought is last hour ad arrived  he let im go at last and after first making him pay the cabman took im along till they came to a publicouse and made im pay for drinks  they stayed there till nearly eleven oclock and then bill set off home olding the unfortunit peter by the scruff o the neck and wondering out loud whether e ought to pay im a bit more or not  afore e could make up is mind however he turned sleepy and throwing imself down on the bed which was meant for the two of em fell into a peaceful sleep  sam and ginger dick came in a little while arterward both badly marked where bill ad hit them and sat talking to peter in whispers as to wot was to be done  ginger who ad plenty of pluck was for them all to set on to im but sam wouldnt ear of it and as for peter he was so sore he could ardly move  they all turned in to the other bed at last arf afraid to move for fear of disturbing bill and when they woke up in the morning and see im sitting up in

out and see ow the land lay e could ardly thank im enough  he stayed in the bedroom all day with the blinds down and wouldnt eat anything and when ginger looked in about eight oclock to find out whether he ad gone he found im sitting on the bed clean shaved and is face cut about all over where the razor ad slipped  ginger was gone about two hours and when e came back he looked so solemn that

could move he suddenly clapped is hand over is mouth and flung im on the bed  ginger was like a child in is hands although he struggled like a madman and in five minutes e was laying there with a towel tied round his mouth and is arms and legs tied up with the cord off of sams chest  im very sorry ginger ses bill as e took a little over eight pounds out of gingers pocket  ill pay you back one o these days if i can if youd got a rope round your neck same as i ave youd do the same as ive done  he lifted up the bedclothes and put ginger inside and tucked im up gingers face was red with passion and is eyes starting out of his ead  eight and six is fifteen ses bill and just then he eard somebody coming up the stairs  ginger eard it too and as peter russet came into the room e tried

ill knock your ead off afore i tie you up  dont tie me up bill ses peter struggling  i cant trust you ses bill dragging im over to the washstand and taking up the other towel turn round  peter was a much easier job than ginger dick and arter bill ad done im e put im in alongside o ginger and covered em up arter first tying both the gags round with some string to prevent em slipping  mind ive only borrowed it he ses standing by the side o the bed but i must say mates im disappointed in both of you  if either of you ad ad the misfortune wot ive ad id have sold the clothes off my back to elp you  and i wouldnt ave waited to be asked neither  he stood there for a minute very sorrowful and then e patted both their eads and went downstairs  ginger and peter lay listening for a bit and then they turned their pore boundup faces to each other and tried to talk with their eyes  then ginger began to wriggle and try and twist the cords off but e might as well ave tried to wriggle out of is skin  the worst of it was they couldnt make known their intentions to each other and when peter russet leaned over im and tried to work is gag off by rubbing it up agin is nose ginger pretty near went crazy with temper  he banged peter with his ead and peter banged back and they kept it up till theyd both got splitting eadaches and at last they gave up in despair and lay in the darkness waiting for sam  and all this time sam was sitting in the red lion waiting for them  he sat there quite patient till twelve oclock and then walked slowly ome wondering wot ad happened and whether bill had gone  ginger was the fust to ear is foot on the stairs and as he came into the room in the darkness him an peter russet started shaking their bed in a way that scared old sam nearly to death  he thought it was bill carrying on agin and e was out o that door and arfway downstairs afore he stopped to take breath  he stood there trembling for about ten minutes and then as nothing appened he walked slowly upstairs agin on tiptoe and as soon as they heard the door creak peter and ginger made that bed do everything but speak  is that you bill  ses old sam in a shaky voice and standing ready to dash downstairs agin  there was no answer except for the bed and sam didnt know whether bill was dying or whether e ad got delirium trimmings  all e did know was that e wasnt going to sleep in that room  he shut the door gently and went downstairs agin feeling in is pocket for a match and not finding one e picked out the softest stair e could find and leaning his ead agin the banisters went to sleep  illustration picked out the softest stair e could find  it was about six oclock when e woke up and broad daylight  he was stiff and sore all over and feeling braver in the light e stepped softly upstairs and opened the door  peter and ginger was waiting for im and as he peeped in e saw two things sitting up in bed with their air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with bandages  he was that startled e nearly screamed and then e stepped into the room and stared at em as if he couldnt believe is eyes  is that you ginger he ses  wot dye mean by making sights of yourselves like that  ave you took leave of your senses  ginger and peter shook their eads and rolled their eyes and then sam see wot was the matter with em  fust thing e did was to pull out is knife and cut gingers gag off and the fust thing ginger did was to call im every name e could lay his tongue to  you wait a moment he screams arf crying with rage  you wait till i get my ands loose and ill pull you to pieces  the idea o leaving us like this all night you old crocodile  i eard you come in  ill pay you  sam didnt answer im  he cut off peter russets gag and peter russet called im arf a score o names without taking breath  and when gingers finished ill ave a go at you he ses  cut off these lines  at once dye hear  ses ginger  oh you wait till i get my ands on you  sam didnt answer em he shut up is knife with a click and then e sat at the foot o the bed on gingers feet and looked at em  it wasnt the fust time theyd been rude to im but as a rule hed ad to put up with it  he sat and listened while ginger swore imself faint  thatll do he ses at last another word and i shall put the bedclothes over your ead  afore i do anything more i want to know wot its all about  peter told im arter fust calling im some more names because ginger was past it and when ed finished old sam said ow surprised he was at them for letting bill do it and told em how they ought to ave prevented it  he sat there talking as though e enjoyed the sound of is own voice and he told peter and ginger all their faults and said wot sorrow it caused their friends  twice he ad to throw the bedclothes over their eads because o the noise they was making  illustration old sam said ow surprised he was at them for letting bill do it  are you goingto undous  ses ginger at last  no ginger ses old sam in justice to myself i couldnt do it  arter wot youve saidand arter wot ive saidmy life wouldnt be safe besides which youd want to go shares in my money  he took up is chest and marched downstairs with it and about arf an hour arterward the landladys usband came up and set em free  as soon as theyd got the use of their legs back they started out to look for sam but they didnt find im for nearly a year and as for bill they never set eyes on im again
