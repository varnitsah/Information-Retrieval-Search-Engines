bibliography of samuel taylor coleridge     introduction   i samuel taylor coleridge   i the beginnings   coleridge lived in what may safely be called the most momentous period of modern history in the year following his birth warren hastings was appointed first governorgeneral of india where he maintained english empire during years of war with rival nations and where he committed those acts of cruelty and tyranny which called forth the greatest eloquence of the greatest of english orators in the famous impeachment trial at westminster when coleridge was a sixteenyearold schoolboy in london a few years before his birth the liberal philosophy of france had found a popular voice in the writings of rousseau which became the gospel of revolution throughout europe in coleridges youth and early manhood the new héloise in the field of sentiment and of the relation of the sexes the social contract in political theory and Émile in matters of education were books whose influence upon coleridges generation it would be hard to estimate when coleridge was four years old the english colonies in america declared their independence and founded a new nation upon the natural rights of mana nation that has grown to be the mightiest and most beneficent on the globe coleridge was seventeen when the french revolution broke out he was fortythree when napoleon was sent to st helena he saw the whole career of the greatest political upheaval and of the greatest military genius of the modern world fox pitt and burkethe greatest liberal orator the greatest parliamentary leader and the greatest philosophic statesman that england has producedwere at the height of their glory when coleridge went up to cambridge in 1791  in literaturenaturally since literature is but an interpretation of lifethe age was not less remarkable dr johnson was still alive when coleridge came up to school at christs hospital goldsmith had died eight years before but a new spirit was abroad in the younger generation macphersons fingal alleged to be a translation from the ancient gaelic poet ossian had appeared in 1760 thomas percys reliques of ancient english poetry a collection of folkballads and rude verseromances such as the common people cherished but critics had long refused to consider as poetry was published in 1765 these two books were of prime importance in fostering a new taste in literaturea love of natural beauty of simplicity and of rude strength the new taste hailed with delight the appearance of a native lyric genius in burns whose first volume of poems was printed in 1786 it welcomed also the homely simple sweetness what coleridge and lamb called the divine chitchat of cowper whose task appeared in the preceding year but it was in coleridge himself and his close contemporaries and followers that the splendor of the new poetry showed itself he was two years younger than wordsworth a year younger than scott he was sixteen at the birth of byron twenty at that of shelley twentyfour at that of keats and he outlived all of them except wordsworth his genius blossomed early the ancient mariner his greatest poem was published some years before wordsworths ode on the intimations of immortality was written or scotts lay of the last minstrel he was in the prime of life or what should have been the prime of lifeforty years oldwhen byron burst into sudden fame with the first two cantos of childe harold in 1812 he was fortysix when keats published endymion he was fiftyone when shelley was drowned and of all this gifted company coleridge though not the strongest character or the most prolific poet was the profoundest intellect and the most originative poetic spirit  there was little hint however of future greatness or of fellowship with great names in his birth and early circumstances his father was a country clergyman and schoolmaster in the village of ottery st mary in devonshire a simplehearted unworldly man full of curious learning and not very attentive to practical affairs his mother managed the household and brought up the children both his parents were of simple westcountry stock but his father having a natural turn for study and having done well in his early manhood as a schoolmaster went at the age of thirtyone as a sizar or poor student to sidneysussex college cambridge took orders and was afterwards given the living of ottery st mary here he continued his beloved work of teaching in addition to his pastoral duties and by means of this combination won the humble livelihood which through his wifes careful economy sufficed for rearing his large family coleridge tells us that his father had so little of parental ambition in him that he had destined his children to be blacksmiths etc though he had resolved that i should be a parson and had accomplished his intention but for my mothers pride and spirit of aggrandizing her family several of the children rewarded their mothers care by distinguishing themselves in a modest way in the army or in the church but the only one about whom the world is curious now was the youngest of the ten samuel taylor coleridge who was born at ottery st mary october 21 1772  the essential traits of his later character appeared in his early childhood almost from infancy he lived in his imagination rather than in the world of reality the schoolboys drove me from play and were always tormenting me and hence i took no pleasure in boyish sports but read incessantly i became a dreamer and acquired an indisposition to all bodily activity and i was fretful and inordinately passionate sensibility imagination vanity sloth were prominent and manifest in his character before he was eight years old such is his own account of his childhood written to his friend poole in 1797 and it is an accurate description as far as it goes of the grown man but of the religious temper too the love of freedom and of virtue the hatred of injustice cruelty and falsehood that guided his uneven steps through all the pitiful struggle of his middle life of the conscience that made his weakness hell to himof these too we may be sure that the beginnings were to be seen in the boy at ottery st mary as indeed they were before his eyes in the person of his father who if not a firstrate genius was says his son a firstrate christian  the good vicar died in 1781 and the next year a presentation to christs hospital having been secured for him little samuel not yet eleven years old went up to london to enter the famous old city school here    in the great city pent mid cloisters dim  where he    saw nought lovely but the sky and stars  one of some seven hundred bluecoat boys coleridge lived for nine years  most of the boys at christs hospital then as now were given a commercial education which none the less included a very thorough training in latin but a few of the most promising students were each year selected by the masters for a classical training in preparation for the universities whence they were known as grecians coleridge was elected a grecian in 1788 the famous boyerfamous for his enthusiasm alike in teaching the classics and in wielding the birchlaid the foundation of coleridges later scholarship here too coleridge did a great amount of reading not laid down in the curriculumlatin and greek poetry and philosophy mediaeval science and metaphysicsand won the approval of his teachers by the excellence of his verses in greek and latin such as boys at school and students at the universities were expected to write in those days in the great city school as in the devonshire vicarage he lived in the imagination inert of body and rapacious of intellect but he was solitary no longer having found his tongue and among his more intellectual schoolfellows an interested audience while yet a boy he would hold an audience spellbound by his eloquent declamation or the fervor of his argument till as lamb who was one of his hearers tells us the walls of the old grey friars reechoed to the accents of the inspired charity boy that is the way his conversationor monologue as it often wasaffected not boys only but men and especially young men to his dying day he cast a spell upon men by his speech upon his schoolfellows upon young men at the universities in the pantisocracy days upon lloyd and poole at nether stowey upon earnest young thinkers in his last days at highgate so that even if he had never written the ancient mariner and the biographia literaria he would still be remembered for the inspiration of his talk  further details of the life at christs hospital must be sought in lambs two essays especially that on christs hospital fiveandthirty years ago in 1791 having secured a christs hospital exhibition he entered jesus college cambridge  his university life extended over three years from october 1791 to december 1794 it was an unhappy time for him and an uneasy time for his respectable relatives for reasons that were partly in his own nature and partly in the temper of the times  even boyers severe training while it had made him a hard student and an unusual scholar for his years had failed to give him what he most needed as a balance to his intellect and imagination stability of character there is evidence that after the first few months during which the habits of his hard school life had not yet broken the new liberty of university life led him into extravagance if not dissipation work he doubtless did he won the browne medal for a greek ode on the slavetrade in 1792 but fitfully giving less and less attention to his regular studies and more to conviviality and above all to dreams of literary fame he wrote verses after various models sentimental fanciful or gallant he was enthusiastic in praise of a contemporary sonneteer the rev william bowles whose divine sensibility seemed to him the height of poetic feeling and in connection with wordsworths younger brother christopher who entered cambridge in 1793 he formed a literary society that discussed among other things wordsworths volume of early poetry descriptive sketches published in that year wordsworth himself was a cambridge man but had taken his degree in 1791 and gone abroad so that the two men whose personal friendship was to mean so much in english poetry did not meet until 1796 already in 1793 however coleridge had developed political theories or rather sympathies which were preparing him for fellowship with wordsworth  the french revolution which after years of preparation took concrete shape in 1789 did not look to young englishmen in 17914 as it looks to us now nor even as it was to look to those same englishmen in 1800 in those first years warmhearted young enthusiasts at the universities saw in the violence of their fellowmen across the channel only the struggles of the beautiful spirit of liberty bursting the chains of agelong tyranny and corruption and calling men up to the heights to breathe diviner air    bliss was it in that dawn to be alive   but to be young was very heaven  wrote wordsworth afterwards and in the glow of his young idealism he had gone over to france in the autumn of 1791 and was on the point of throwing in his lot with the revolutionists when his parents compelled his return by cutting off his supplies and many who like coleridge merely watched from afar shared his faith that a new order of things was to be established wherein love should be law and mans inhumanity to man become but a memory of things outworn  less generous men with a selfish interest in established privileges timid men who looked with terror upon any prospect of change older and wiser men who better understood the foundations of social order and the nature of manall these looked with distrust upon the revolutionary idealism that was spreading from france through the younger generation of englishmen the new notions of liberty it was felt threatened not only the vested rights of property and the prescriptions of rank but the church too and religion some of the wouldbe reformers were avowed atheists some coleridge and his friends for instance in the pantisocracy period were communists in general they ascribed all the evils of society to institutions and wanted them abolished  just how far coleridge had gone in this direction by the autumn of 1793 we do not know far enough at least to disturb his view of the future to worry his elder brother george a clergyman and schoolteacher who had in some measure filled a fathers place to the young genius and most important of all to alarm and distress a gentle girl in london for before he left christs hospital for cambridge he had become intimate at the house of a mrs evans and most of the letters preserved from his first two years at the university were addressed to her or to one of her two daughters anne and mary with the latter coleridge was in love and that she had some regard for him is apparent from a letter she sent him in 1794 before that however coleridge had taken a step that seemed likely to close at once his college career and his prospects of literary fame the reasons have not been recorded probably pecuniary embarrassment the yeasty state of his religious and political ideas and impatience or despondency over his loveaffair with mary evans combined to precipitate his flight what we know is that he ran away from cambridge and in december 1793 enlisted as a dragoon in the army  coleridge had hardly taken the step before he repented of it his letters to his brother george who with other friends bestirred himself for coleridges release as soon as his whereabouts was discovered are rather distressing in their selfabasement the efforts of his friends were successful and in april he returned to the university where a public admonition was the extent of his punishment and he continued in receipt of his christs hospital exhibition  but coleridges college days were practically over he was now nearly twentytwo years old and the revolutionary unrest which had doubtless contributed to his first escapade soon resulted in the formation of schemes that took him away from cambridge for good and all in june 1794 he made a visit to an old schoolfellow at oxford here he met robert southey of balliol college a friendship sprang up between them out of which before the end of the summer grew the utopian scheme of pantisocracy a company of gentlemen and ladies were to emigrate to america take up lands in the susquehanna valley and there establish an ideal community in which all should bear rule equally and find happiness in a life of justice labor and love the education of the young in the principles of ideal humanity was an important part of the scheme we are reminded of the brook farm experiment in new england a generation later which bears a daughters likeness to pantisocracy the chief difference being that the new england enthusiasts were mature men and women and really put the idea into practice whereas the pantisocrats were for the most part collegians and never got beyond the stage of talking and writing about their plans the scheme was further elaborated at bristol where coleridge returning from a vacation tour in wales again met southey and at bath the home of southey and of southeys betrothed and her sister edith and sarah frickertwo sisters milliners of bath as byron contemptuously called them  to the other sister sarah coleridge rather precipitately engaged himself his love for mary evans was not dead but he seems to have despaired of winning her and to have determined by uniting himself domestically with southey and his friends to make retreat from their communistic scheme impossible a few weeks later he is back at cambridge tortured apparently between his old love and his new engagement mary evans has written to him deploring his wild notions and the mad plan of pantisocracy yet confident that he has too much sensibility to be an infidel southey has reproved him rather sharply for failing to write to his betrothed at bath our next glimpse of him is at london discussing poetry and philosophy with lamb at the salutation and cat tavern and perhaps trying to get a sight of mary evans in december he is again at bristol in lively correspondence with southey about democracy pantisocracy and poetry but at the same time he addresses a last appeal to miss evans her answer is kind but final that chapter is closed and coleridge writes to southey that he will do his duty by which he means apparently that he will be faithful to pantisocracy and marry sarah fricker  the pantisocracy scheme could not in the nature of things be longlived as a matter of fact it lasted little more than a year ending in a rupture between the two leading spirits just when they became brothersinlaw coleridge spent the summer of 1795 in bristol in company with southey writing and lecturing in october he was married to sarah fricker in st marys redcliff poor chattertons church in november southey married edith fricker and set sail for lisbon where his uncle was the english chaplain and pantisocracy was dead  the break with southey was the natural result of attempting to force through a scheme impracticable in itself and doubly impracticable for the men who conceived it its collapse did not altogether sever their literary relations the collaboration begun in the fall of robespierre cambridge 1794 was continued in southeys joan of arc 1796 to which coleridge contributed the part afterwards printed with some additions as the destiny of nations and in coleridges first volume of poems bristol 1796 a more important contributor to this volume however was charles lamb whose initials were appended to four of the pieces a second edition appeared in june 1797 with eleven additions from coleridge besides verses by lamb and charles lloyd all under the title poems by st coleridge second edition to which are added poems by charles lamb and charles lloyd the publisher of both editions was joseph cottle a bookseller of bristol who played the part of provincial murray to the young poets in these years  meanwhile coleridge after a period of lecturing and projecting had as we have seen married sarah fricker with whom he was now very much in love and had begun housekeeping in a cottage at clevedon near the bristol channel the beauty of the place and his happiness there are celebrated in the aeolian harp and reflections on leaving a place of retirement better known by its opening words low was our pretty cot his next residence was in bristolrather a base of operations than a home for coleridge was on the road much of the time lecturing preaching soliciting subscriptions for his political and philosophical paper the watchman which ran from march to may 1796 and trying in various other ways to provide for his family which was increased by the birth of a son in september 1796 at last in december he secured the little cottage at nether stowey in the quantock hills south of the bristol channel in somerset close to the house of his beloved friend thomas poole where he lived until his departure for germany in september 1798   ii at nether stowey   the stowey period was the blossoming time of coleridges genius all the poems in this volume except the last four and besides these this limetree bower my prison frost at midnight and fears in solitudethe bulk of his achievement in poetrywere either written or begun in 1797 and 1798 it will be proper then to dwell a little on his circumstances his friends and his ideas during these two years  the means of livelihood for himself and his family when he went to stowey were a subscription of about £40 that poole and some friends got together for him £20 that cottle paid for the second edition of the poems the promise of £80 from the father of charles lloyd who was to live with him and study under his direction and such money as he could earn by reviews and magazine articles which he estimated at £40 a year not a munificent provision for a household of three adults and a child but the theories of the simple life that had made pantisocracy seem a feasible project still inspired him with confidence sixteen shillings he wrote to poole would cover all the weekly expenses of my wife infant and myself this i say from my wifes own calculations further he will support himself by the labor of his hands if you can instruct me to manage an acre and a half of land and to raise in it with my own hands all kinds of vegetables and grain enough for myself and my wife and sufficient to feed a pig or two with the refuse i hope that you will have served me most effectually by placing me out of the necessity of being served this was in december just before he moved to stowey in february he wrote from his new home to another friend from seven till half past eight i work in my garden from breakfast till twelve i read and compose then read again feed the pigs poultry etc till two oclock after dinner work again till tea from tea till supper review so jogs the day and i am happy i raise potatoes and all manner of vegetables have an orchard and shall raise corn with the spade enough for my family we have two pigs and ducks and geese a cow would not answer the keep we have whatever milk we want from t poole  there is a suspicious regularity about this schedule lamb wrote from london in january is it a farm that you have got and what does your worship know about farming his agricultural activity in the month of february must have been chiefly prospective and we may safely assume that poole supplied other things besides milk and that the poet spent more time reading dreaming and talking than he did raising potatoes a good deal of time must have been spent in the actual composition of his poetry including his play osorio which was written in 1797 and in studying the landscape beauties of the quantocks after the coming of the wordsworths to alfoxden he spent much of the time walking between alfoxden and stowey or further afield with wordsworth and his sister my walks he wrote afterwards were almost daily on the top of quantock and among its sloping coombs with my pencil and memorandumbook in my hand i was making studies as the artists call them and often moulding them into verse with the objects and imagery immediately before my eyes this does not sound much like raising corn with the spade  on sundays he would sometimes preach before such unitarian congregations within walking distance as cared to hear him but as he would take no pay for his services his preaching contributed nothing toward the support of his family lloyd who was epileptic and subject to moody variation in his attachments was but an irregular housemate after the first few months and his contribution to the household expenses was correspondingly uncertain the future looked so dark in october 1797 that in spite of misgivings and former scruples he had concluded that he must become a unitarian minister as a less evil than starvation accordingly he was in shrewsbury in january 1798 preaching in the unitarian church and on the point of accepting the pastorate at a salary of £150 a year when the sky brightened in another quarter thomas and josiah wedgwood sons of the famous potter and friends of thomas poole offered him an equal sum annually as a free gift they were wealthy men well able to afford it they attached no condition to the gift except that he should devote himself entirely to the study of poetry and philosophy which was precisely what he wanted to do and he was not long in determining to accept the offer i accepted it he wrote to wordsworth while still at shrewsbury on the presumption that i had talents honesty and propensities to perseverant effort the propensities alas remained propensities never acquiring the force of habit the pension however continued to be paid in full until 1812 when josiah wedgwood withdrew his half of it the other half upon the death of thomas wedgwood in 1805 had been secured to coleridge for life and this annuity must have constituted the chief reliance of mrs coleridge for many years  if coleridge did not prosper financially he was at least fortunate in his friends and a mans friends are after all the best testimony to the character of his mind and heart when he went to stowey in december 1796 he was again on good terms with southey though the enthusiasm of their first fellowship was gone the friendship with lamb begun in their schooldays and renewed at the salutation and cat in 1794 was maintained by an eager correspondence and by lambs visit to stowey in july 1797 and although lloyds vagaries led to a coolness between the old friends in the following year the breach was soon healed and the friendship continued till death another with whom coleridge maintained a voluminous correspondence in 17967 was john thelwall theoretical democrat atheist and admirer of godwin whose visit to coleridge and wordsworth in the summer of 1797 so shocked the good conservatives of the neighborhood that wordsworth had to leave alfoxden in consequence of it but without doubt the dearest and most influential friend coleridge had before the wordsworths came into his life was thomas poole it was in order to be in daily intercourse with poole that he moved to stowey and pooles hesitation about securing the cottage for him arising coleridge seemed to fear from imperfect confidence and friendship was a source of agonized apprehension to the sensitive poet when we consider that poole was a selfeducated man a somersetshire tanner with no claim to literary genius or philosophical acquirements coleridges devotion to him and dependence on him bring out in a strong light the substantial elemental character of the man o poole coleridge wrote to him from germany afterwards you are a noble heart as ever god made poole had indeed in a marked degree the genius for friendship strength of character sympathy and selfeffacing devotion combined with prudence and sincerity made this man a tower of refuge for the unstable spirit of the poet  no other single relation however can compare in importance for coleridges poetic development with that which sprang up in the summer of 1797 between him and william wordsworth just when they first met is not recorded we have seen that coleridge was acquainted with wordsworths younger brother in his college days and discussed with him wordsworths first published poems in january 1797 he told cottle that he wished to submit his visions of the maid of arc to wordsworth for criticism the earliest definite record of their personal acquaintance is a letter coleridge wrote to cottle while on a visit to wordsworth at racedown just over the somerset border in dorsetshire early in june about the beginning of july he is again at racedown and when he returns he brings wordsworth and his sister dorothy with him for a visit on the 7th lamb arrived for his longplanned reunion with coleridge the second week of july 1797 was thus a rich and longremembered time for all of them despite the fact that mrs coleridge accidentally emptied a skillet of boiling milk on her husbands foot which confined him during the whole time of charles lambs stay the others took long walks in the neighborhood amid such scenery as is described in this limetree bower my prison a poem that admirably voices the happiness of those days of spiritual fellowship the wordsworths did not return to racedown by a combination of curious circumstances a gentlemans seat with a park and woods elegantly and completely furnished in the most beautiful and romantic situation by the seaside four miles from stoweythis we have got for wordsworth at the rent of twentythree pounds a year taxes included coleridge triumphantly announced to southey and in this house the manor of alfoxden the wordsworths remained for a year in daily companionship with coleridge and surrounded by scenes of natural beauty that have left a lasting mark on the work of both poets  what the friendship with coleridge meant to wordsworth may best be seen in the prelude or growth of a poets mind wordsworths greatest long poem written some years afterwards and addressed throughout to coleridge    there is no grief no sorrow no despair   no languor no dejection no dismay   no absence scarcely can there be for those   who love as we do  what wordsworth was to coleridge is more important for us here the admiration which the brilliant child of genius felt for the great preacherpoet is chiefly one feels an admiration for his character as a matter of fact wordsworth had written nothing up to his coming to alfoxden that would have preserved his name as a poet nothing so noteworthy or promising as what coleridge had already written but coleridge felt in this lean and thoughtful young man a strength of mind a depth and sureness of heart that compelled his allegiance and even imparted for the time some of that resolution in which he was by nature so sadly deficient the character of their friendship is to be seen not only in the published work of the two poets from this time on notably in dejection but perhaps even more clearly in dorothy wordsworths journal and in coleridges letters i speak with heartfelt sincerity he wrote to cottle in june 1797 and i think unblinded judgment when i tell you that i feel myself a little man by his side and yet do not think myself the less man than i formerly thought myself t pooles opinion of wordsworth is that he is the greatest man he ever knew i coincide wordsworths influence is evident in a letter from coleridge to his brother george in april 1798 i love fields and woods and mountains with almost a visionary fondness and because i have found benevolence and quietness growing within me as that fondness has increased therefore i should wish to be the means of implanting it in others and to destroy the bad passions not by combating them but by keeping them in inaction under the calming and clarifying influence of the stronger northern spirit the fever of his revolutionary dreams abated he found happiness in the conscious exercise of his poetic powers and for one year in his troubled existence his genius showed itself in all its splendor  the immediate poetic result of their friendship was the lyrical ballads published by cottle in september 1798 the origin of the work has been described both by wordsworth in a prefatory note to we are seven and by coleridge in the biographia literaria chap xiv at first they were to collaborate in writing a poem the proceeds of which should pay the expenses of a little tour they were making when the plan was thought of in november 1797 and thus the ancient mariner was begun as this poem grew under coleridges shapingspirit of imagination wordsworth saw that he could only be a clog upon its progress and it was resigned to coleridge the plan was then enlarged to include a volume illustrating two cardinal points of poetry the power of exciting the sympathy of the reader by a faithful adherence to the truth of nature and the power of giving the interest of novelty by the modifying colours of imagination wordsworth was to illustrate the former principle coleridge the latter and the proceeds of the book were to go toward the expenses of a trip to germany decided on in the spring of 1798 the bulk of the volume was wordsworths and was typically wordsworthian ranging from such simple ballads of humble incident as goody blake and the idiot boy to the magnificent blank verse of tintern abbey coleridges share consisted of a brief poem called the nightingale two short extracts from osorio and the rime of the ancyent marinere  apart from the lyrical ballads coleridge conceived and finished between june 1797 and the departure for germany in 1798 and published in the latter year fire famine and slaughter frost at midnight fears in solitude and france he conceived and partly executed but did not then publish christabel kubla khan love the ballad of the dark ladie and the three graves thus all coleridges best poetry with the exception of those three saddest of voices out of a broken life dejection 1802 the lines to wordsworth on hearing him read the prelude 1807 and youth and age 182332 belongs either wholly or in its inception to the year of his fellowship with the wordsworths in the quantock hills  of his political religious and literary opinions at this time he has left a fairly adequate account in his published writings and his correspondence especially in the biographia literaria and in the letter to the rev george coleridge referred to above the first year of his married life saw him still in spite of the failure of pantisocracy an eager visionary reformer upborne by generous enthusiasm and ardent religious feeling o never can i remember those days he wrote in the biographia with either shame or regret for i was most sincere most disinterested my opinions were indeed in many and most important points erroneous but my heart was single wealth rank life itself then seemed cheap to me compared with the interest of what i believed to be the truth and the will of my maker however much he may have consorted with unbelievers like thelwall and distressed his good brother george by his heterodoxy he was by nature deeply religious he tried in his letters to recover thelwall from his atheism though he heartily approved a sentiment expressed by the latter he who thinks and feels will be virtuous and he who is absorbed in self will be vicious whatever may be his speculative opinions godwins system of justice with its soulless logic he abhorred he preached often in unitarian churches to young hazlitt who heard him preach in january 1798 from the text and he went up into the mountain to pray himself alone it seemed as if the sounds had echoed from the bottom of the human heart and as if that prayer might have floated in solemn silence through the universe in politics he was when he went to stowey almost equidistant from all the three prominent parties the pittites the foxites and the democrats he was a vehement antiministerialist but after the invasion of switzerland a more vehement antigallican see the last two stanzas of france and still more intensely an antijacobin under wordsworths influence his thoughts turned in great measure from contemporary politics to more fundamental matters always his poetry had been the utterance of his essential being i feel strongly and i think strongly he wrote to thelwall in 1796 but i seldom feel without thinking or think without feeling hence though my poetry has in general a hue of tenderness or passion over it yet it seldom exhibits unmixed and simple tenderness and passion my philosophical opinions are blended with or deduced from my feelings wordsworth gave his feelings a new object and his philosophy a higher aim in april of the second year at stowey in the letter to his brother already quoted coleridge wrote i have for some time past withdrawn myself totally from the consideration of immediate causes which are infinitely complex and uncertain to muse on fundamental and general causes the causae causarum i devote myself to such works as encroach not on the antisocial passionsin poetry to elevate the imagination and set the affections in right tune by the beauty of the inanimate impregnated as with a living soul by the presence of lifein prose to the seeking with patience and a slow very slow mind quid sumus et quidnam victuri gignimuswhat our faculties are and what they are capable of becoming this last sentence is a sort of halfprophetic summary of his lifes work but the poetry soon gave way to the prose and he never again so nearly realized his poetical ideal as he had already done in the ancient mariner  of his person and the impression he made upon people at this time there are various contemporary accounts to thelwall in november 1796 he sent the following description of himself  my face unless when animated by immediate eloquence expresses great sloth and great indeed almost idiotic goodnature tis a mere carcass of a face fat flabby and expressive chiefly of inexpression yet i am told that my eyes eyebrows and forehead are physiognomically good but of this the deponent knoweth not as to my shape tis a good shape enough if measured but my gait is awkward and the walk of the whole man indicates indolence capable of energies i cannot breathe through my nose so my mouth with sensual thick lips is almost always open in conversation i am impassioned and oppose what i deem error with an eagerness which is often mistaken for personal asperity but i am ever so swallowed up in the thing said that i forget my opponent such am i the rev leapidge smith in his reminiscences of an octogenarian remembered him as a tall dark handsome young man with long black flowing hair eyes not merely dark but black and keenly penetrating a fine forehead a deeptoned harmonious voice a manner never to be forgotten full of life vivacity and kindness dignified in person and added to all these exhibiting the elements of his future greatness1 hazlitt in my first acquaintance with poets a paper that every student of coleridges life and poetry should read describing him as he appeared on his visit to hazlitts father at wem in 1798 says his complexion was at that time clear and even bright his forehead was broad and high light as if built of ivory with large projecting eyebrows and his eyes rolling beneath them like a sea with darkened lustre his mouth was gross voluptuous open eloquent his chin goodhumored and round but his nose the rudder of the face the index of the will was small feeble nothinglike what he has done and dorothy wordsworth to close with a contemporary and sympathetic impression set him down in her journal after their first meeting at racedown thus he is a wonderful man his conversation teems with soul mind and spirit at first i thought him very plain that is for about three minutes he is pale thin has a wide mouth thick lips and not very good teeth longish loosegrowing halfcurling rough black hair but if you hear him speak for five minutes you think no more of them his eye is large and full and not very dark but grey2such an eye as would receive from a heavy soul the dullest expression but it speaks every emotion of his animated mind it has more of the poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling than i ever witnessed he has fine dark eyebrows and an overhanging forehead the friendly and keensighted woman gives a more sympathetic picture than the others but there must have been truth too in the view of the equally keensighted and less friendly hazlitt whose description accords well with coleridges selfportraiture and in the last sarcastic item too well with the remainder of the poets career   footnotes

lived for thirtysix years after he left stowey for germany in 1798 his fame as a poet grew as the world became acquainted with and learned to feel the peculiar charm of his poetry and he was even more famous for a while as a literary critic and a moral philosopher but they were years of weakwilled wandering of vast hazy plans and feeble performance lighted only here and there by glimpses of fragmentary accomplishment and that seldom in poetry keats died at twentysix leaving behind him a body of poetry hardly less wonderful than coleridge had fashioned at the same age and another poet sang of him    the bloom whose petals nipt before they blew   died on the promise of the fruit is waste  in coleridge the poet died at nearly the same age almost as completely as if the man himself had passed within the twilight chamber  of white death and dejection is that poets dirge the remaining years need therefore but few words  coleridge had taken opium perhaps as early as his schooldays for relief from neuralgia he had recourse to it in march 1796 for sleeplessness in the following november for relief from violent nervous pains and near the close of the stowey period in may 1798 when the vagaries of lloyd the estrangement from lamb domestic anxiety and physical suffering had reduced him to a state of extreme nervous wretchedness he again took refuge in opiates of which kubla khan is partly the result he returned from germany in 1799 worked for a while on a newspaper in london and on a translation of schillers wallenstein and in the summer of 1800 removed to keswick in cumberland in the lake country where the wordsworths had already established themselves here in the autumn of 1800 he strove to finish christabel and did finish the second part in the winter and spring he suffered from a complicated illness in which he again had recourse to laudanum and from the spring of 1801 he was confirmed in the opium habit sinking often to pitiful depths of moral and physical misery he was in the mediterranean chiefly at malta from 1804 to 1806 his wife and children remained at keswick where southey and his family had become cotenants with them of greta hall southey it might almost be said took care of coleridges family henceforth for coleridge had begun to find his own fireside an intolerable place as early as 1802 lived little at home and made a formal separation from his wife in 1808though they saw each other occasionally after that and the wedgwood annuity continued to be paid to mrs coleridge in 1809 he was living with the wordsworths at grasmere where he wrote several numbers of a politicophilosophical paper called the friend about the close of 1810 he was taken in hand by a mr and mrs morgan of hammersmith near london under whose care he kept the opium in check sufficiently to give his famous lectures on the principles of poetry in the winter of 181112 and another series in the early summer on shakespeare in the winter following his play of remorse a recast of the osorio of 1797 was acted in london with some success in the winter of 181314 he lectured in a conversational fashion at bristol he also wrote irregularly for the london papers during these years but his studies since his return from germany had been directed to metaphysics and especially to the philosophical bases of poetry and theology and the last twenty years of his life at least were occupied with plans for a great philosophical work covering these two fields of thought one of the fragments of the great work that actually came to light the biographia literaria seems to have been sent to the printers in 1815 a collected edition of his poetry was also begun while he was under the morgans care  from 1816 till his death in 1834 he lived in comparative peace if not in happiness with a mr gilman of highgate near london an apothecary gilman and his wife were able so far to wean him from the drug or to regulate his use of it that he brought to the birth something of his vast plans in criticism and philosophy notably the biographia literaria 1817 and the aids to reflection 1825 the beginning of his stay with gilman was also marked by the publication of christabel and kubla khan 1816 and of a collected edition of his other poems including the ancient mariner considerably revised under the title sibylline leaves 1817 but the poems that were not finished in the first great period at stowey remained unfinished he talked divinely an archangel a little damaged lamb said and both by his talk and his metaphysical writings profoundly influenced the literature and philosophy of the century both in england and america but the poet in him was dead    sense of past youth and manhood come in vain   and genius given and knowledge won in vain   and all which i had culled in woodwalks wild   and all which patient toil had reared and all   commune with thee had opened outbut flowers   strewed on my corse and borne upon my bier   in the same coffin for the selfsame grave1  it would be a mistake to ascribe the paralysis of coleridges powers of constructive imagination exclusively to laudanum rather the resort to narcotics and the inability to control his creative faculty are alike symptoms of a temperamental malady which had its roots in his nature close to the seat of that special faculty under a favorable conjunction of outward circumstance and inward state imagination came it possessed him and he labored in it happily afterwards he could revise what he had shaped analyze it philosophically perfect some details of it but he could not proceed in the creative act after the inspiration had left him his own description of his natureindolence capable of energiesis accurate as far as it goes the opium resorted to often no doubt to quicken the dreams in his brain as well as to relieve his bodily suffering helped to enfeeble his will but the indolence was in him before he became addicted to opium and he was never capable of energies at the call of duty but only at the call of his shaping spirit over whose coming and going he had no control  poetically it is perhaps as well had he been like his friend wordsworth in strength and steadiness of purposewhich is to suppose him another nature than he washis life would have been happier and more edifying but he would hardly have given us anything better than christabel and the ancient mariner romantic poetry of the higher type is essentially the creature of mood even wordsworths long and conscientious labors produced but a small bulk of poetry of this character amid dreary reaches of uninspired preaching coleridge waitedin despondency often in selfupbraidings in the temporary deception of opium dreams with their consequent miseryfor the return of the spirit and it did not come   footnotes  footnote 1 from the lines addressed to wordsworth after hearing him read the prelude in 1807     ii coleridges poems   the ancient mariner  the ancient mariner was first printed in the first edition of lyrical ballads 1798 again with considerable changes in the second edition 1800 and without further significant change in the editions of 1802 and 1805 its fifth appearance was in sibylline leaves 1817 again with some important changes and the addition of the latin motto and the marginal gloss in the poetical works 1828 and again in the poetical works 1829 the poem appeared in its final form as we now have itdiffering very little from the form it had in sibylline leaves one or two significant minor changes will be mentioned in the notes  coleridges own account of the genesis of the poem given in the biographia literaria nearly twenty years later is interesting during the first year that mr wordsworth and i were neighbours our conversations turned frequently on the two cardinal points of poetry the power of exciting the sympathy of the reader by a faithful adherence to the truth of nature and the power of giving the interest of novelty by the modifying colours of imagination the sudden charm which accidents of light and shade which moonlight or sunset diffused over a known and familiar landscape appeared to represent the practicability of combining both these are the poetry of nature the thought suggested itself to which of us i do not recollect that a series of poems might be composed of two sorts in the one the incidents and agents were to be in part at least supernatural and the excellence aimed at was to consist in the interesting of the affections by the dramatic truth of such emotions as would naturally accompany such situations supposing them real and real in this sense they have been to every human being who from whatever source of delusion has at any time believed himself under supernatural agency for the second class subjects were to be chosen from ordinary life the characters and incidents were to be such as will be found in every village and its vicinity where there is a meditative and feeling mind to seek after them or to notice them when they present themselves  in this idea originated the lyrical ballads in which it was agreed that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural or at least romantic yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith mr wordsworth on the other hand was to propose to himself as his object to give the charm of novelty to things of every day and to excite a feeling analogous to the supernatural by awakening the minds attention from the lethargy of custom and directing it to the wonders and loveliness of the world before us an inexhaustible treasure but for which in consequence of the film of familiarity and selfish solicitude we have eyes yet see not ears that hear not and hearts that neither feel nor understand  with this view i wrote the ancient mariner and was preparing among other poems the dark ladie and the christabel in which i should have more nearly realized my ideal than i had done in my first attempt but mr wordsworths industry had proved so much more successful and the number of his poems so much greater that my compositions instead of forming a balance appeared rather an interpolation of heterogeneous matter mr wordsworth added two or three poems written in his own character in the impassioned lofty and sustained diction which is characteristic of his genius among them the lines composed a few miles above tintern abbey in this form the lyrical ballads were published  lyrical they hardly were in any current meaning of that word they were narrative but they were ballads as the word was then understood the two cardinal points of poetry that coleridge says they had in view in this partnership production were both believed to be special marks of the ballad the charm of homeliness and simplicity and the spell of the supernatural and romantic bishop percys reliques of ancient english poetry 1765 had created a taste for the traditional poetry of humble folk spreading to germany and uniting there with the sentimental sensationalism of the eighteenth century this taste found expression in burgers lenore which in turn had a powerful influence in england five distinct translations of it appearing in 1796 of the distinction so much insisted on by later analysts of the true popular balladits communal origin its impersonality its freedom from adornment its lack of conscious artthe englishman of coleridges time took no account the ancient mariner is not a ballad in the sense in which sir patrick spens or young waters is a ballad it is in the highest degree a work of conscious and individual art it is rather to be classed like christabel as a romance but it was conceived and written under the influence of the ballad revival and bears many marks of that influence both in its general structure and in its details of workmanship  much of the archaic diction and antique spelling as well as the ruder grotesquerie that in the first edition proclaimed its relation to the pseudoballadry of the time disappeared in the later editions but the archaisms the unpoetical diction and especially the disregard of tense coherence in the poem as we now have it contribute greatly to the atmosphere of romanceas of a story removed alike from the commonplace experience of every day and from familiar literary conventionswhich it was coleridges intention to produce by a few devotional ejaculationsheavens mother send us grace to mary queen the praise be givenwe are made to feel that the ancient mariner lived before the reformation in the ages of wonder and faith repetition as in many stanzas of part iv is a device caught from the folkballad and modified to produce the effect of a spell which is so strong a mark of the poem the abrupt opening the unannounced transitions in dialogue the omission of all but the vital incidents of the story all belong to the ballad style the verse form is what is known as the ballad stanza stanza of four linesa line of four accents followed by one of three the second and fourth lines riming variously extended and modified to suit the mood of the passage the prose summary in the form of a marginal gloss first added in the edition of 1817 is a practice taken from early printed books but not from balladry which is normally oral  of the literary qualities of the poem much might be said but i call attention here to but two the organic structure of the story and the character of the imagery two important aspects of creative imagination the seven parts are seven stages of the narrative each except the last closing with a reference to the mariners sin the story proceeds like the successive acts of a play in part i the deed is committed in part ii the punishment begins in part iii the punishment reaches its climax part iv brings the turn in the crisis of his sufferings comes the consciousness of fellowship with other creatures and repentance for his cruelty parts v and vi relate his penance begun and his return by supernatural agencies to the world of human fellowship and part vii brings us back to the opening scene closing the whole with a moral the moral is so plainly set forth that one wonders how mrs barbauld could ever have complained as coleridge tells us she did that the poem had no moral his reply is worth recording i told her that in my opinion the poem had too much and that the only or chief fault if i might say so was the obtrusion of the moral sentiment so openly on the reader as a principle or cause of action in a work of such pure imagination it ought to have had no more moral than the arabian nights tale of the merchants sitting down to eat dates by the side of a well and throwing the shells aside and lo a genie starts up and says he must kill the aforesaid merchant because one of the date shells had it seems put out the eye of the genies son but the poet of 1798 knew better than the metaphysician of 1830 the moral is as essential a part of the whole poem as moral consciousness is of man without it the poem would be without the coherence of human interest which alone can secure for these shadows of imagination poetic faith the moral really is suffused throughout the work is the blood of its being that it should be formulated at the close is quite in accord with the simplicity which marked the whole conception of the lyrical ballads and is moreover perfectly harmonious with the spirit of the poem itself there have been poets who seemed to be without the moral sense and who have written poetry quite free from any moral like poe and his landscape visions but wonderful as they are they are abnormal and are less great as they are less completely human it may be that wordsworth as one infers from recollections of the composition of the poem suggested the moral plot but if so it entered at once and completely into coleridges imagination and governed the shaping of the poem from the start in all the very considerable changes and omissions that the poem underwent after it was first printed there was none that either retrenched from or added to the moral interpretation of the tale  of its imagery the most evident characteristic is what may be called the anthropomorphic treatment of nature this although in accord with modern conceptions of primitive culture is not at all a mark of the popular ballad sun and moon and stormwind and ocean are in folksong sun and moon and wind and water and nothing more but in the ancient mariner they are living beings    and now the stormblast came and he   was tyrannous and strong   he struck with his oertaking wings   and chased us south along    and straight the sun was flecked with bars   heavens mother send us grace   as if through a dungeongrate he peered   with broad and burning face    still as a slave before his lord   the ocean hath no blast   his great bright eye most silently   up to the moon is cast    if he may know which way to go   for she guides him smooth or grim   see brother see how graciously   she looketh down on him  this is the most noticeable of the modifying colours of imagination in the ancient mariner the practice might be classed as a sort of personification but how utterly different in its effect from the conventional literary personifications of the eighteenth centuryof gray in the elegy for instance grandeur and envy and honour in that admirable poem are not real persons to the imagination the abstraction remains an abstraction but in coleridges poem all nature is alive with the life of men other elements of that synthetic and magical power to which we have exclusively appropriated the name of imagination and which blends the idea with the image and the sense of novelty and freshness with old and familiar objects will be felt as the poem is studied  wordsworth related in after years that the suggestion for the poem came from a dream of a phantom ship told to coleridge by a friend and that he wordsworth proposed the shooting of the albatross the revenge of the tutelary spirits and the navigation of the ship by the dead men and contributed the fourth stanza of the poem and the last two lines of the first stanza of part iv he had been reading shelvockes voyages a book in which he had found a description of albatrosses as they are seen in far southern waters other reading that may have suggested some of the scenery is described in the notes to the globe edition of coleridges poems there are also passages and situations in the last two acts of wordsworths play the borderers which coleridge read with great admiration in the summer of 1797 that have evident kinship with the ancient mariner and wordsworths peter bell composed at alfoxden but printed many years later suggests what the story might have become if coleridge instead of wordsworth had withdrawn from collaboration     christabel and kubla khan   christabel and kubla khan were first printed in 1816 in a pamphlet along with the pains of sleep a sort of contrast to kubla khan composed in 1803 in the preface to this pamphlet coleridge informs us that the first part of christabel was written at stowey in 1797 and the second part at keswick cumberland in 1800 the poem was intended originally for the lyrical ballads and it was with the hope of finishing it for the second edition that coleridge took it up again in the fall of 1800 there is a good deal of uncertainty as to just how much of the work was done at that time in two letters of that period he speaks of it as running up to 1300 lines and swelled into a poem of 1400 lines so that it is no longer suitable for the lyrical ballads but hardly half of this amount was printed in the 1816 pamphlet or has ever been found since one suspects that already in 1800 dreams and projects had begun to be confounded with performance in the latter of the two letters mentioned above he relates how his versemaking faculties returned to him after long and unsuccessful struggles with barrenness and deep dejection as the result of drinking at the house of a neighbouring clergyman  so much wine that i found some effort and dexterity requisite to balance myself on the hither edge of sobriety on the whole it seems probable that christabel owes little to the forced efforts of his first year in the lake country like most of the other poems in this volume it is a product of the great year at stowey he himself told a friend in later years i had the whole of the two cantos in my mind before i began it adding very truly certainly the first canto is more perfect has more of the true wild weird spirit than the last  down to the close of his life he dreamed of finishing this work he amused his listeners at highgate with a continuation of the plot and in 1833 he declared that if he were perfectly free from vexation and were in the ad libitum hearing of fine music he could yet finish christabel for i have as i always had the whole plan entire from beginning to end in my mind but i fear i could not carry on with equal success the execution of the idea wordsworth had a different recollection he told coleridges nephew in 1836 that he did not think coleridge had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it and added what is fully borne out by a study of coleridges life schemes of this sort passed rapidly and vividly through his mind and so impressed him that he often fancied he had arranged things which really and upon trial proved to be mere embryos    the unfinished window in aladdins tower     unfinished must remain  wrote longfellow alluding to the dolliver romance that hawthorne left incomplete at his death there is strong kinship moral and artistic between coleridge and hawthorne both believed that the heart is more than the head and neither could force his imagination to work under unfavorable conditions but hawthornes failure of imagination came at the end of a fruitful and consistent career and his life failed with it in coleridge the poet died half a lifetime before the man and left the manthe preacher and philosopherto lament his loss  whether or not coleridge had the story complete in his mind what we have is a fragment and does not enable us to divine as some broken statues do the plan of the whole what it gives us is the romantic mood the sense of witchery by daylight and this it does more hauntingly than anything else in the english language it is a series of magical and unforgetable pictures it owes a good deal to the old verse romances and ballads that so impressed the imagination in those days of the mediaeval revival but it was itself a far stronger influence it operated as an original force both by its form and by its spirit upon the poetic imagination of the first half of the nineteenth century more widely and deeply than the work of any other man burns and keats not excepted scott heard it read from manuscript and the lay of the last minstrel with the series of verse romances that followed may almost be called a result of that reading the verse form of scotts romances certainly is poes poetry is as far as the poles removed from scotts yet a close study of poes work shows the influence of christabel to be even deeper here than in the lay of the last minstrel  coleridge was fully aware of a special power both of imagination and of versemusic in the poem his attempts to complete it in 1800 brought persistently to his mind the project of a philosophy of poetry and especially of this poem as we may infer from a letter to poole in march 1801 i shall  immediately publish my christabel with two essays annexed to it on the preternatural and on metre when the two cantos were at last printed in 1816 coleridge wrote in the preface the metre of the christabel is not properly speaking irregular though it may seem so from its being founded on a new principle namely that of counting in each line the accents not the syllables though the latter may vary from seven to twelve yet in each line the accents will be found to be only four nevertheless this occasional variation in number of syllables is not introduced wantonly or for the mere ends of convenience but in correspondence with some transition in the nature of the imagery or passion this is not to be taken quite literally the accentual principle was assuredly nothing new in english verse and syllablecounting though introduced by chaucer had to be reintroduced by the renaissance poets and did not become an unquestioned convention till the latter part of the seventeenth century but the return to free accentual verse in the christabel was an innovation at the beginning of the nineteenth century it is to be noted too that there are lines of three and even of two accents in part i  in chap xv of the biographia literaria in a list of the specific symptoms of poetic power in shakespeares early work coleridge places first the perfect sweetness of the versification its adaptation to the subject and the power displayed in varying the march of the words the sense of musical delight with the power of producing it is a gift of imagination and this together with the power of reducing multitude into unity of effect and modifying a series of thoughts by some one predominant thought or feeling may be cultivated and improved but can never be learnt it is in these that poeta nascitur non fit  kubla khan is the remembered fragment of a dream all that we know about it is contained in the note coleridge prefixed to it in the pamphlet of 1816 in the summer of 1798 coleridge says 1797 but this seems to have been a slip of his memory1 the author then in ill health had retired to a lonely farmhouse between porlock and linton on the exmoor confines of somerset and devonshire in consequence of a slight indisposition an anodyne had been prescribed from the effects of which he fell asleep in his chair at the moment that he was reading the following sentence or words of the same substance in purchass pilgrimage here the khan kubla commanded a palace to be built and a stately garden thereunto and thus ten miles of fertile ground were inclosed with a wall the author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep at least of the external senses during which time he has the most vivid confidence that he could not have composed less than from two to three hundred lines if that indeed can be called composition in which all the images rose up before him as things with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions without any sensation or consciousness of effort on awaking he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole and taking his pen ink and paper instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved at this moment he was unfortunately called out by a person on business from porlock and detained by him above an hour and on his return to his room found to his no small surprise and mortification that though he still retained some vague and dim recollection of the general purport of the vision yet with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and images all the rest had passed away like the images on the surface of a stream into which a stone has been cast but alas without the after restoration of the latter  opinion will ever vary as to its poetic worth coleridge himself professed to consider it rather as a psychological curiosity than as a thing of any supposed poetic merits to lamb he repeated it so enchantingly that it irradiates and brings heaven and elysian bowers into any parlour when he sings or says it and it has been a sort of touchstone of romantic taste ever since it supremely illustrates that sense of musical delight with the power of producing it which the poet declared to be a gift of the imagination that can never be learnt   footnotes  footnote 1 see notes to this poem in the globe edition

the significant title of recantation in the autumn it was printed with its present title in a pamphlet together with fears in solitude another political poem and frost at midnight a poem on his infant child in october 1802 it was reprinted in the post with a prose argument see notes less necessary for the readers of that time than it may be now coleridge like wordsworth had welcomed the french revolution as ushering in an era of light and love in human society both though wordsworth more profoundly had been depressed by the excesses of 17934 and by the lust of conquest which became more and more evident under the directory and when at last in february 1798 the french armies invaded switzerland the ancient sacred home of liberty in europe coleridge recanted in this ode  political poetry is likely to lose its power with the passing of the events and passions that give it birth it retains its power just in proportion as it is built on lasting and universal interests of the heart of man that france has retained its position as one of the great odes of the english language is due not only to the loftiness of its thought and the splendor of its imagery but even more to the fact that it turns from the political excitement of the hour to the grandeur and beauty of nature and to those aspirations and ideals whose home is in the heart of man     love   from the second edition of lyrical ballads 1800 it was planned by coleridge as an introduction to the ballad of the dark ladie which was never completed but of which some fifteen stanzas were printed in the 1834 edition of his poetical works its composition cannot be accurately dated it is conceived in the general spirit of the ballads but is simpler more purely a poem of sentiment than either christabel or the ancient mariner and makes no use of the supernatural its simplicity and absolute purity of tone are however something more than a negative virtue coleridge himself declared of it and the ancient mariner that they might be excelled but could not be imitated     dejection an ode   this ode was written in april 1802 at a time when after sickness opium domestic unhappiness and the consequent paralysis of his poetic faculty had driven him to seek distraction in the study of metaphysics he made a visit to wordsworth at dove cottage and in that vitalizing presence experienced a brief return of his powersenough to give wonderful expression to perhaps the saddest thoughts that ever visited ungoverned genius the earliest known form of the poem preserved in a letter to w sotheby of july 19 1802 shows what is apparent enough to one familiar with the relations existing between the two poets that it was conceived as a letter to wordsworth who is addressed in this earliest version as dearest poet wordsworth and william it was first printed in the morning post for october 4 1802 with edmund for wordsworths name and with some omissions but with the strong personal feeling undiminished and in its present form that is with the parts omitted in the 1802 print restored but with the substitution of lady for edmund and with numerous other omissions and changes notably in the last stanza all tending to depersonalize the poem in sibylline leaves 1816 in 1810 a hint given by wordsworth with the best intentions to a third person concerning the real nature of coleridges troubles was reported or rather misreported to coleridge and an estrangement fraught with deep grief to both ensued the breach was healed as much as such wounds may be by the mediation of a common friend in 1812 but the old glad and fruitful fellowship could never be restored coleridge wrote to poole february 13 1813 a reconciliation has taken place but the feeling which i had previous to that moment  that i fear never can return all outward actions all inward wishes all thoughts and admirations will be the sameare the same butaye there remains an immedicable but  dejection is distinguished from the other poems in this volume by containing along with its wonderful interpretation of outward nature into harmony with his own else unutterable sadness coleridgesand perhaps all poetsessential philosophy of poetry it was natural that the metaphysics in which he had been immersed should color his thought but literature affords few if any instances of metaphysics so transformed into poetry in the crucible of feeling as is afforded by stanza v of this ode     youth and age and work without hope   in these two poems coleridge has left a record of the sadness of a life lived  in darkness with the light of youth gone out  or returning only in glimpses that showed what he had lost in these latter years he was busy enough in an incoherent visionary fashion and did even write and publish though in characteristically fragmentary form a work that made a great impression on young men in the second quarter of the century his aids to reflection but his activity was philosophical and theological not poetic and even in that field the product fell far short of his plans and promises the inner and real life of the man is revealed now as always in his poetry and amidst what profound dejection it glimmers on these two brief poems show  youth and age was written in 1823an air that whizzed  right across the diameter of my brain  over the summit of quantock at earliest dawn just between the nightingale that i stopt to

door she opened straight                                 125   all in the middle of the gate   the gate that was ironed within and without   where an army in battle array had marched out   the lady sank belike through pain   and christabel with might and main                                 130   lifted her up a weary weight   over the threshold of the gate   then the lady rose again   and moved as she were not in pain    so free from danger free from fear                               135   they crossed the court right glad they were   and christabel devoutly cried   to the lady by her side

they crossed the court right glad they were    outside her kennel the mastiff old                                145   lay fast asleep in moonshine cold   the mastiff old did not awake   yet she an angry moan did make   and what can ail the mastiff bitch   never till now she uttered yell                                    150   beneath the eye of christabel   perhaps it is the owlets scritch   for what can ail the mastiff bitch    they passed the hall that echoes still   pass as lightly as you will                                       155   the brands were flat the brands were dying   amid their own white ashes lying   but when the lady passed there came   a tongue of light a fit of flame   and christabel saw the ladys eye                                 160   and nothing else saw she thereby   save the boss of the shield of sir leoline tall   which hung in a murky old niche in the wall   o softly tread said christabel   my father seldom sleepeth well

                       170   as still as death with stifled breath   and now have reached her chamber door   and now doth geraldine press down   the rushes of the chamber floor    the moon shines dim in the open air                               175   and not a moonbeam enters here   but they without its light can see   the chamber carved so curiously   carved with figures strange and sweet   all made out of the carvers brain                                180   for a ladys chamber meet   the lamp with twofold silver chain   is fastened to an angels feet    the silver lamp burns dead and dim   but christabel the lamp will trim                                 185   she trimmed the lamp and made it bright   and left it swinging to and fro   while geraldine in wretched plight   sank down upon the floor below    o weary lady geraldine                                          190   i pray you drink this cordial wine   it is a wine of virtuous powers   my mother made it of wild flowers    and will your mother pity me   who am a maiden most forlorn                                      195   christabel answeredwoe is me   she died the hour that i was born   i have heard the grayhaired friar tell   how on her deathbed she did say   that she should hear the castlebell                               200   strike twelve upon my weddingday   o mother dear that thou wert here   i would said geraldine she were    but soon with altered voice said she   off wandering mother peak and pine                             205   i have power to bid thee flee   alas what ails poor geraldine   why stares she with unsettled eye   can she the bodiless dead espy   and why with hollow voice cries she                               210   off woman off this hour is mine   though thou her guardian spirit be   off woman off tis given to me    then christabel knelt by the ladys side   and raised to heaven her eyes so blue                            215   alas said she this ghastly ride   dear lady it hath wildered you   the lady wiped her moist cold brow   and faintly said tis over now    again the wildflower wine she drank                              220   her fair large eyes gan glitter bright   and from the floor whereon she sank   the lofty lady stood upright   she was most beautiful to see   like a lady of a far countree                                     225   and thus the lofty lady spake   all they who live in the upper sky   do love you holy christabel   and you love them and for their sake   and for the good which me befell                                  230   even i in my degree will try   fair maiden to requite you well   but now unrobe yourself for i   must pray ere yet in bed i lie    quoth christabel so let it be                                  235   and as the lady bade did she   her gentle limbs did she undress   and lay down in her loveliness    but through her brain of weal and woe   so many thoughts moved to and fro                                 240   that vain it were her lids to close   so halfway from the bed she rose   and on her elbow did recline   to look at the lady geraldine    beneath the lamp the lady bowed                                   245   and slowly rolled her eyes around   then drawing in her breath aloud   like one that shuddered she unbound   the cincture from beneath her breast   her silken robe and inner vest                                   250   dropt to her feet and full in view   behold her bosom and half her side   a sight to dream of not to tell   o shield her shield sweet christabel    yet geraldine nor speaks nor stirs                                255   ah what a stricken look was hers   deep from within she seems halfway   to lift some weight with sick assay   and eyes the maid and seeks delay   then suddenly as one defied                                      260   collects herself in scorn and pride   and lay down by the maidens side   and in her arms the maid she took           ah weladay   and with low voice and doleful look                                265   these words did say   in the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell   which is lord of thy utterance christabel   thou knowest tonight and wilt know tomorrow   this mark of my shame this seal of my sorrow                     270     but vainly thou warrest       for this is alone in     thy power to declare       that in the dim forest     thou heardst a low moaning                                     275   and foundst a bright lady surpassingly fair   and didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity   to shield her and shelter her from the damp air    the conclusion to part the first    it was a lovely sight to see   the lady christabel when she                                      280   was praying at the old oak tree     amid the jagged shadows     of mossy leafless boughs     kneeling in the moonlight     to make her gentle vows                                         285   her slender palms together prest   heaving sometimes on her breast   her face resigned to bliss or bale   her face oh call it fair not pale   and both blue eyes more bright than clear                         290   each about to have a tear    with open eyes ah woe is me   asleep and dreaming fearfully   fearfully dreaming yet i wis   dreaming that alone which is                                    295   o sorrow and shame can this be she   the lady who knelt at the old oak tree   and lo the worker of these harms   that holds the maiden in her arms   seems to slumber still and mild                                   300   as a mother with her child    a star hath set a star hath risen   o geraldine since arms of thine   have been the lovely ladys prison   o geraldine one hour was thine                                  305   thou st had thy will by tairn and rill   the nightbirds all that hour were still   but now they are jubilant anew   from cliff and tower tuwhoo tuwhoo   tuwhoo tuwhoo from wood and fell                            310    and see the lady christabel   gathers herself from out her trance   her limbs relax her countenance   grows sad and soft the smooth thin lids   close oer her eyes and tears she sheds                         315   large tears that leave the lashes bright   and oft the while she seems to smile   as infants at a sudden light    yea she doth smile and she doth weep   like a youthful hermitess                                         320   beauteous in a wilderness   who praying always prays in sleep   and if she move unquietly   perchance tis but the blood so free   comes back and tingles in her feet                                325   no doubt she hath a vision sweet   what if her guardian spirit twere   what if she knew her mother near   but this she knows in joys and woes   that saints will aid if men will call                             330   for the blue sky bends over all    part the second    each matin bell the baron saith   knells us back to a world of death   these words sir leoline first said   when he rose and found his lady dead                              335   these words sir leoline will say   many a morn to his dying day    and hence the custom and law began   that still at dawn the sacristan   who duly pulls the heavy bell                                     340   five and forty beads must tell   between each strokea warning knell   which not a soul can choose but hear   from bratha head to wyndermere    saith bracy the bard so let it knell                            345   and let the drowsy sacristan   still count as slowly as he can   there is no lack of such i ween   as well fill up the space between   in langdale pike and witchs lair                                 350   and dungeonghyll so foully rent   with ropes of rock and bells of air   three sinful sextons ghosts are pent   who all give back one after t other   the deathnote to their living brother                            355   and oft too by the knell offended   just as their one two three is ended   the devil mocks the doleful tale   with a merry peal from borrowdale    the air is still through mist and cloud                           360   that merry peal comes ringing loud   and geraldine shakes off her dread   and rises lightly from the bed   puts on her silken vestments white   and tricks her hair in lovely plight                              365   and nothing doubting of her spell   awakens the lady christabel   sleep you sweet lady christabel   i trust that you have rested well    and christabel awoke and spied                                     370   the same who lay down by her side   o rather say the same whom she   raised up beneath the old oak tree   nay fairer yet and yet more fair   for she belike hath drunken deep                                   375   of all the blessedness of sleep   and while she spake her looks her air   such gentle thankfulness declare   that so it seemed her girded vests   grew tight beneath her heaving breasts                            380   sure i have sinnd said christabel   now heaven be praised if all be well   and in low faltering tones yet sweet   did she the lofty lady greet   with such perplexity of mind                                       385   as dreams too lively leave behind    so quickly she rose and quickly arrayed   her maiden limbs and having prayed   that he who on the cross did groan   might wash away her sins unknown                                  390   she forthwith led fair geraldine   to meet her sire sir leoline    the lovely maid and the lady tall   are pacing both into the hall   and pacing on through page and groom                              395   enter the barons presenceroom    the baron rose and while he prest   his gentle daughter to his breast   with cheerful wonder in his eyes   the lady geraldine espies                                         400   and gave such welcome to the same   as might beseem so bright a dame    but when he heard the ladys tale   and when she told her fathers name   why waxed sir leoline so pale                                     405   murmuring oer the name again   lord roland de vaux of tryermaine    alas they had been friends in youth   but whispering tongues can poison truth   and constancy lives in realms above                               410   and life is thorny and youth is vain   and to be wroth with one we love   doth work like madness in the brain   and thus it chanced as i divine   with roland and sir leoline                                       415   each spake words of high disdain   and insult to his hearts best brother   they partedneer to meet again   but never either found another   to free the hollow heart from paining                            420   they stood aloof the scars remaining   like cliffs which had been rent asunder   a dreary sea now flows between   but neither heat nor frost nor thunder   shall wholly do away i ween                                      425   the marks of that which once hath been    sir leoline a moments space   stood gazing on the damsels face   and the youthful lord of tryermaine   came back upon his heart again                                    430    o then the baron forgot his age   his noble heart swelled high with rage   he swore by the wounds in jesus side   he would proclaim it far and wide   with trump and solemn heraldry                                    435   that they who thus had wronged the dame   were base as spotted infamy   and if they dare deny the same   my herald shall appoint a week   and let the recreant traitors seek                                 440   my tourney courtthat there and then   i may dislodge their reptile souls   from the bodies and forms of men   he spake his eye in lightning rolls   for the lady was ruthlessly seized and he kenned                  445   in the beautiful lady the child of his friend    and now the tears were on his face   and fondly in his arms he took   fair geraldine who met the embrace   prolonging it with joyous look                                    450   which when she viewed a vision fell   upon the soul of christabel   the vision of fear the touch and pain   she shrunk and shuddered and saw again   ah woe is me was it for thee                                   455   thou gentle maid such sights to see    again she saw that bosom old   again she felt that bosom cold   and drew in her breath with a hissing sound   whereat the knight turned wildly round                            460   and nothing saw but his own sweet maid   with eyes upraised as one that prayed    the touch the sight had passed away   and in its stead that vision blest   which comforted her afterrest                                    465   while in the ladys arms she lay   had put a rapture in her breast   and on her lips and oer her eyes   spread smiles like light                             with new surprise   what ails then my beloved child                                 470   the baron saidhis daughter mild   made answer all will yet be well   i ween she had no power to tell   aught else so mighty was the spell    yet he who saw this geraldine                                    475   had deemed her sure a thing divine   such sorrow with such grace she blended   as if she feared she had offended   sweet christabel that gentle maid   and with such lowly tones she prayed                               480   she might be sent without delay   home to her fathers mansion                                 nay   nay by my soul said leoline   ho bracy the bard the charge be thine   go thou with music sweet and loud                                485   and take two steeds with trappings proud   and take the youth whom thou lovst best   to bear thy harp and learn thy song   and clothe you both in solemn vest   and over the mountains haste along                                490   lest wandering folk that are abroad   detain you on the valley road    and when he has crossed the irthing flood   my merry bard he hastes he hastes   up knorren moor through halegarth wood                           495   and reaches soon that castle good   which stands and threatens scotlands wastes    bard bracy bard bracy your horses are fleet   ye must ride up the hall your music so sweet   more loud than your horses echoing feet                          500   and loud and loud to lord roland call   thy daughter is safe in langdale hall   thy beautiful daughter is safe and free   sir leoline greets thee thus through me   he bids thee come without delay                                    505   with all thy numerous array   and take thy lovely daughter home   and he will meet thee on the way   with all his numerous array   white with their panting palfreys foam                          510   and by mine honour i will say   that i repent me of the day   when i spake words of fierce disdain   to roland de vaux of tryermaine   for since that evil hour hath flown                             515   many a summers sun hath shone   yet neer found i a friend again   like roland de vaux of tryermaine    the lady fell and clasped his knees   her face upraised her eyes oerflowing                           520   and bracy replied with faltering voice   his gracious hail on all bestowing   thy words thou sire of christabel   are sweeter than my harp can tell   yet might i gain a boon of thee                                   525   this day my journey should not be   so strange a dream hath come to me   that i had vowed with music loud   to clear yon wood from thing unblest   warned by a vision in my rest                                     530   for in my sleep i saw that dove   that gentle bird whom thou dost love   and callst by thy own daughters name   sir leoline i saw the same   fluttering and uttering fearful moan                             535   among the green herbs in the forest alone   which when i saw and when i heard   i wondered what might ail the bird   for nothing near it could i see   save the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree            540    and in my dream methought i went   to search out what might there be found   and what the sweet birds trouble meant   that thus lay fluttering on the ground   i went and peered and could descry                                545   no cause for her distressful cry   but yet for her dear ladys sake   i stooped methought the dove to take   when lo i saw a bright green snake   coiled around its wings and neck                                  550   green as the herbs on which it couched   close by the doves its head it crouched   and with the dove it heaves and stirs   swelling its neck as she swelled hers   i woke it was the midnight hour                                  555   the clock was echoing in the tower   but though my slumber was gone by   this dream it would not pass away   it seems to live upon my eye   and thence i vowed this selfsame day                              560   with music strong and saintly song   to wander through the forest bare   lest aught unholy loiter there    thus bracy said the baron the while   halflistening heard him with a smile                             565   then turned to lady geraldine   his eyes made up of wonder and love   and said in courtly accents fine   sweet maid lord rolands beauteous dove   with arms more strong than harp or song                           570   thy sire and i will crush the snake   he kissed her forehead as he spake   and geraldine in maiden wise   casting down her large bright eyes   with blushing cheek and courtesy fine                              575   she turned her from sir leoline   softly gathering up her train   that oer her right arm fell again   and folded her arms across her chest   and couched her head upon her breast                              580   and looked askance at christabel   jesu maria shield her well    a snakes small eye blinks dull and shy   and the ladys eyes they shrunk in her head   each shrunk up to a serpents eye                                 585   and with somewhat of malice and more of dread   at christabel she looked askance   one momentand the sight was fled   but christabel in dizzy trance   stumbling on the unsteady ground                                   590   shuddered aloud with a hissing sound   and geraldine again turned round   and like a thing that sought relief   full of wonder and full of grief   she rolled her large bright eyes divine                            595   wildly on sir leoline    the maid alas her thoughts are gone   she nothing seesno sight but one   the maid devoid of guile and sin   i know not how in fearful wise                                   600   so deeply had she drunken in   that look those shrunken serpent eyes   that all her features were resigned   to this sole image in her mind   and passively did imitate                                          605   that look of dull and treacherous hate   and thus she stood in dizzy trance   still picturing that look askance   with forced unconscious sympathy   full before her fathers view                                    610   as far as such a look could be   in eyes so innocent and blue    and when the trance was oer the maid   paused awhile and inly prayed   then falling at the barons feet                                  615   by my mothers soul do i entreat   that thou this woman send away   she said and more she could not say   for what she knew she could not tell   oermastered by the mighty spell                                 620    why is thy cheek so wan and wild   sir leoline thy only child   lies at thy feet thy joy thy pride   so fair so innocent so mild   the same for whom thy lady died                                  625   o by the pangs of her dear mother   think thou no evil of thy child   for her and thee and for no other   she prayed the moment ere she died   prayed that the babe for whom she died                            630   might prove her dear lords joy and pride     that prayer her deadly pangs beguiled       sir leoline   and wouldst thou wrong thy only child       her child and thine                                           635    within the barons heart and brain   if thoughts like these had any share   they only swelled his rage and pain   and did but work confusion there    his heart was cleft with pain and rage                            640   his cheeks they quivered his eyes were wild   dishonoured thus in his old age   dishonourd by his only child   and all his hospitality   to the insulted daughter of his friend                             645   by more than womans jealousy   brought thus to a disgraceful end   he rolled his eye with stern regard   upon the gentle minstrel bard   and said in tones abrupt austere                                650   why bracy dost thou loiter here   i bade thee hence the bard obeyed   and turning from his own sweet maid   the aged knight sir leoline   led forth the lady geraldine                                      655    the conclusion to part the second    a little child a limber elf   singing dancing to itself   a fairy thing with red round cheeks   that always finds and never seeks   makes such a vision to the sight                                   660   as fills a fathers eyes with light   and pleasures flow in so thick and fast   upon his heart that he at last   must needs express his loves excess   with words of unmeant bitterness                                  665   perhaps tis pretty to force together   thoughts so all unlike each other   to mutter and mock a broken charm   to dally with wrong that does no harm   perhaps tis tender too and pretty                                 670   at each wild word to feel within   a sweet recoil of love and pity   and what if in a world of sin   o sorrow and shame should this be true   such giddiness of heart and brain                                  675   comes seldom save from rage and pain   so talks as its most used to do     kubla khan    in xanadu did kubla khan   a stately pleasuredome decree   where alph the sacred river ran   through caverns measureless to man     down to a sunless sea                                             5   so twice five miles of fertile ground   with walls and towers were girdled round   and here were gardens bright with sinuous rills   where blossomed many an incensebearing tree   and here were forests ancient as the hills                         10   enfolding sunny spots of greenery    but oh that deep romantic chasm which slanted   down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover   a savage place as holy and enchanted   as eer beneath a waning moon was haunted                           15   by woman wailing for her demonlover   and from this chasm with ceaseless turmoil seething   as if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing   a mighty fountain momently was forced   amid whose swift halfintermitted burst                             20   huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail   or chaffy grain beneath the threshers flail   and mid these dancing rocks at once and ever   it flung up momently the sacred river   five miles meandering with a mazy motion                            25   through wood and dale the sacred river ran   then reached the caverns measureless to man   and sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean   and mid this tumult kubla heard from far   ancestral voices prophesying war                                   30        the shadow of the dome of pleasure       floated midway on the waves     where was heard the mingled measure       from the fountain and the caves   it was a miracle of rare device                                    35   a sunny pleasuredome with caves of ice        a damsel with a dulcimer       in a vision once i saw       it was an abyssinian maid       and on her

flitting blush                                 25   with downcast eyes and modest grace   for well she knew i could not choose     but gaze upon her face    i told her of the knight that wore   upon his shield a burning brand                                    30   and that for ten long years he wooed     the lady of the land    i told her how he pined and ah   the deep the low the pleading tone   with which i sang anothers love                                   35     interpreted my own    she listened with a flitting blush   with downcast eyes and modest grace   and she forgave me that i gazed     too fondly on her face                                           40    but when i told the cruel scorn   that crazed that bold and lovely knight   and that he crossed the mountainwoods     nor rested day nor night    that sometimes from the savage den                                 45   and sometimes from the darksome shade   and sometimes starting up at once     in green and sunny glade    there came and looked him in the face   an angel beautiful and bright                                      50   and that he knew it was a fiend     this miserable knight    and that unknowing what he did   he leaped amid a murderous band   and saved from outrage worse than death                             55     the lady of the land    and how she wept and clasped his knees   and how she tended him in vain   and ever strove to expiate     the scorn that crazed his brain                                60    and that she nursed him in a cave   and how his madness went away   when on the yellow forestleaves     a dying man he lay    his dying wordsbut when i reached                                 65   that tenderest strain of all the ditty   my faltering voice and pausing harp     disturbed her soul with pity    all impulses of soul and sense   had thrilled my guileless genevieve                                70   the music and the doleful tale     the rich and balmy eve

delight   she blushed with love and virginshame   and like the murmur of a dream     i heard her breathe my name                                      80    her bosom heavedshe stepped aside   as conscious of my look she stepped   then suddenly with timorous eye     she fled to me and wept    she half enclosed me with her arms                                 85   she pressed me with a meek embrace   and bending back her head looked up     and gazed upon my face    twas partly love and partly fear   and partly twas a bashful art                                     90   that i might rather feel than see     the swelling of her heart    i calmed her fears and she was calm   and told her love with virgin pride   and so i won my genevieve                                          95

motto is condensed by omission from about a page of thomas burnets archaeologiae philosophicae sive doctrina antiqua de rerum originibus published in london in 1692 burnet was master of charterhouse from 1685 till his death in 1715 and enjoyed considerable reputation as a man of curious learning in the archaeologiae he professed to reconcile a former work of his on the origins of the world with the account given in genesis the quotation is from chapter vii of book i de hebraeis eorumque cabalâ and may be translated thus i easily believe that the invisible natures in the universe are more in number than the visible but who shall tell us all the kinds of them the ranks and relationships the peculiar qualities and gifts of each what they do where they dwell mans wit has ever been circling about the knowledge of these things but has never attained to it yet in the meanwhile i will not deny that it is profitable to contemplate from time to time in the mind as in a picture the idea of a larger and better world lest the mind becoming wonted to the little things of everyday life grow narrow and settle down altogether to mean businesses at the same time however we must watch for the truth and observe method so as to distinguish the certain from the uncertain day from night  instead of this motto the first edition had an argument prefixed as follows  how a ship having passed the line was driven by storms to the cold country towards the south pole and how from thence she made her course to the tropical latitude of the great pacific ocean and of the strange things that befell and in what manner the ancyent marinere came back to his own country  this was somewhat enlarged in the second edition 1800 and dropped thereafter  page 3 line 12eftsoons anglosaxon eftsona eft afterwards again  sona soon reënforced by the adverbial genitive ending s coleridge found the word in spenser and the old ballads  4 23kirk the scotch and northern english form of church the old ballads had been preserved chiefly in the north hence this northern form came to be looked on as the proper word for church in the ballad style  41 marginal glossdriven all editions down to campbells had drawn but this he believes to have been a misprint since the narrative seems to require driven  5 55clifts this word arose from a confusion of cliff a precipice and cleft a fissure it was exceedingly common in the 16th18th cent according to the new english dict which gives examples from captain john smith marlowe and defoe  62swound an archaic form of swoon found in elizabethan english  64thorough through and thorough are originally the same word and in shakespeares time both forms were used for the preposition cf pucks song in midsummer nights dream thorough bush thorough briar  67eat this form pronounced et is still in use in england and new england for the past tense of the verb though in america the form ate is now preferred eat as past participle however was archaic or rude even in coleridges time  76vespers properly a liturgical term meaning the daily evening service in church then in a more general way evening the century dict gives no examples of its use as a nautical term probably coleridge used it to give a suggestion of antereformation times the more familiar word for the evening service in the english church is evensong but coleridge in line 595 prefers the little vesper bell for its suggestion of medievalism  6 97like gods own head the comparison is the converse of that in the bible matthew xvii 2 revelations i 16 where the countenance of christ glorified is said to shine as the sun sykes  98uprist this word was used in middle english as a noun and regularly as the 3d pers sing pres ind of the verb uprise in the reves tale line 329 however chaucer uses it in a context of past tenses as coleridge does here as if it were a weak preterit and chaucer uses rist up in the same way several times sykes  104the furrow followed free this was changed in sibylline leaves to the furrow streamed off free because coleridge tells us from the ship itself the wake appears like a brook flowing off from the stern in the case of modern steamboats at least it would be more correct to say that the wake as seen from the stern of the boat looks like a brook following the boat the original reading was restored in the editions of 1828 and 1829  7 123the very deep did rot etc the ship becalmed in tropic seas and the slimy things engendered there were a vision in coleridges mind before the ancient mariner was thought of in the lines contributed to southeys joan of arc in 1796 published with additions as the destiny of nations in sibylline leaves in an allegoric passage on chaos and love he wrote    as what time after long and pestful calms   with slimy shapes and miscreated life   poisoning the vast pacific the fresh breeze   wakens the merchant sail uprising  the same subject had occupied wordsworths imagination before he

merchant of venice ii 2 128 richard iii iii 2 108 but in the ballads it is often a mere exclamation of wonder and surprise and so coleridge uses it heregrin coleridge says table talk may 31 1830 i took the thought of grinning for joy from my companions remark to me when we had climbed to the top of plinlimmon in wales in the summer of 1794 and were nearly dead with thirst we could not speak from the constriction till we found a little puddle under a stone he said to me you grinned like an idiot he had done the same to grin was originally to snarl and show the teeth as animals do when angry they go to and fro in the evening they grin like a dog and run about through the city ps lix 6 prayerbook version where the king james version has make a noise like a dog hence idiots stupid people foolish people all who are or who demean themselves below the dignity of man grin rather than smile and so the mariners companions their muscles stiffened by drought could show their gladness only by the contortions of a grin not by a natural smile of joy  169without a breeze without a tide the phantom ship is a widespread sailors superstition that has been often used in the romantic literature of the nineteenth century see scotts rokeby canto ii xi marryats phantom ship poes ms found in a bottle and longfellows ballad of carmilhan in tales of a wayside inn second day it is seen in storms driving by with all sails set and is generally held to be an omen of disaster coleridge has shaped the legend to his own purposes the ship appears in a calm not in a storm and sailing without rather than against wind and tide and instead of a crew of dead men it carries only death and lifeindeath possibly he was acquainted with a form of the legend found in bechsteins deutsches sagenbuch pointed out by dr sykes in which falkenberg for murder of his brother is condemned to sail a spectral bark attended only by his good and his evil spirit who play dice for his soul  185are

case of poetical illusion no one of course ever saw a star within the tip of the horned moon yet a good many readers until reminded of their astronomy think they have seen this phenomenon coleridge apparently knew that the human mind would receive it as experience the phrase is no slip on his part the earlier editions had instead almost atween the tips which is astronomically justifiable but in sibylline leaves and later he wrote it as in the text  222and every soul it passed me by like the whizz of my crossbow it was an ancient belief imaginatively revived by romantic poets that when a person died his soul could be seen or heard or both as it left the body cf keatss eve of st agnes first stanza rossettis sister helen and kiplings danny deever  11 226and thou art long etc for the last two lines of this stanza runs coleridges note to the passage in sibylline leaves i am indebted to mr wordsworth it was on a delightful walk from nether stowey to dulverton with him and his sister in the autumn of 1797 that this poem was planned and in part composed wordsworth in later years declared that he contributed also lines 1316 and four or five lines more in different parts of the poem which i could not now point out  245or ever or here is not the adversative conjunction but an entirely different word an archaic variant of ere meaning before  250for the sky and the sea etc another instance of the sound fitting the sense the rocking rhythm of the line is the rhythm of his fevered pulse the poem is full of this quality  13 297silly this word meant in old english timely from soel

bark ie frail ship and in burnss to a mouse    thy wee bit housie too in ruin   its silly was the wins are strewin  the epithet may be due either to the gush of love that has filled the mariners heart or to his noticing the buckets long useless frail now filled with water sykes very likely to both together  14 314fireflags the notion of the fireflags hurried about was probably suggested to coleridge by the description of the northern lights aurora borealis in hearnes journey  to the northern ocean a book printed in 1795 and known to both wordsworth and coleridge before 1798 hearne says

published in facsimile by mr eh coleridge which gives this reading for ll 2534    are lean and old and foul of hue   and she is to sleep by christabel  coleridge seems to have tried both ways that of revealing geraldines loathsome secret and that of leaving it an unknown and nameless horror and finally to have chosen the latter just as he rejected in later editions the charnelhouse particulars in the description of death in the ancient mariner unquestionably he was right the horror that is merely suggested and left shrouded in mystery for the imagination to work on is more powerful than that which is known the suppressed line however helps us in an age less familiar with notions of the supernatural to understand what geraldine is the character is conceived upon the general lines of duessa in the first book of the faerie queene a being of great external loveliness but within full of all uncleanness observe also that the thought shrouded here is half revealed later l 457  35 344bratha

edward the fourth  44the conclusion to part the second campbell thought it highly improbable that these lines were originally composed as a part of christabel in a letter to southey may 6 1801 coleridge speaks of his eldest boy hartley then in his fifth year dear hartley we are at times alarmed by the state of his health but at present he is well if i were to lose him i am afraid it would exceedingly deaden my affection for any other children i may have then he writes the lines that we now have as the conclusion to part the second and adds a very metaphysical account of fathers calling their children rogues rascals and little varlets etc   kubla khan  kubla khan grandson of genghis khan was a mongolian conqueror who stretched his empire from european russia to the eastern shores of china in the thirteenth century his exploits like those of his grandfather and those of the mohammedan timur in the next century made a deep impression on the imagination of western europe compilers of travellerss tales like hakluyt and purchas caught up eagerly whatever they could find history or legend concerning the extent of his domain the methods of his government or the splendors of his court the passage in purchas his pilgrimage to which coleridge refers is as follows  in xamdu did cublai can build a stately palace encompassing sixteene miles of plaine ground with a wall wherein are fertile meddowes pleasant springs delightfull streames and all sorts of beasts of chase and game and in the middest thereof a sumptuous house of pleasure quoted in the notes of the globe edition  coleridges poem however contains suggestions and reminiscences from another part of purchass book and probably from other books as well it reads like an arras of reminiscences from several accounts of natural or enchanted parks and from various descriptions of that elusive and dangerfraught garden which mystic geographers have studied to locate from florida to cathay cooper  the earthly paradise which was closed to man indeed but not destroyed when adam and eve were driven from its gates has exercised the imagination of the christian world from the early middle ages lactantius described it in the fourth century the author of the phoenix probably in the eighth century translated lactantius latin into anglosaxon verse sir john mandeville in the fourteenth century though he did not reach it himself because he was not worthy gives an account of it from what he has heard say of wise men beyond milton described it enchantingly in paradise lost dr johnson used a modification of it in rasselas and william morris in our own time made it the framework for a delightful series of worldold tales the idea indeed is not peculiar to christianity but is probably to be found in every civilization christian europe has naturally located it in the east and since the crusades which brought western europe more in contact with the east various eastern legends have been attached to or confounded with the original notion one of these is the abyssinian legend of the hill amara cf l 41 where coleridges mount abora seems to stand for purchass amara amara in purchass account is a hill in a great plain in ethiopia used as a prison for the sons of abyssinian kings its level top twenty leagues in circuit and surrounded by a high wall is a garden of delight heauen and earth nature and industrie have all been corriuals to it all presenting their best presents to make it of this so louely presence some taking this for the place of our forefathers paradise the sides of the hill are of overhanging rock bearing out like mushromes so that it is impossible to ascend it except by a passageway cut out within the rocke not with staires but ascending little by little and closed above and below with gates guarded by soldiers toward the south of the level top is a rising hill  yeelding  a pleasant spring which passeth through all that plaine  and making a lake whence issueth a river which having from these tops espied nilus never leaves seeking to find him whom he cannot leave both to seeke and to finde there are no cities on the top but palaces standing by themselves  spacious sumptuous and beautifull where the princes of the royall blood have their abode with their families  this legend looks backward to mandeville with whose account of the terrestrial paradise it has much in common and forward to milton who used some of its elements in his description of paradise in the fourth book of paradise lost see professor coopers article in modern philology iii 327 ff from which this is condensed  mr eh coleridge the poets grandson has recently shown that in the winter of 17978 coleridge read and made notes from a book travels through  the cherokee country by the american botanist william bartram chapter vii of bartrams book contains an account of some natural wonders in the cherokee country that almost certainly afforded part of the imagery of kubla khan bartram says mr coleridge speaks of waters which descend by slow degrees through rocky caverns into the bowels of the earth whence they are carried by subterraneous channels into other receptacles and basons he travels for several miles over fertile eminences and delightful shady forests he is enchanted by a view of a dark sublime grove of the grand fountain he says that the ebullition is astonishing and continual though its greatest force of fury intermits note the word intermits regularly for the space of thirty seconds of time the ebullition is perpendicular upward from a vast rugged orifice through a bed of rock throwing up small particles of white shells he is informed by a trader that when the great sink was forming there was heard an inexpressible rushing noise like a mighty hurricane or thunderstorm that the earth was overflowed by torrents of water which came wave after wave rushing down attended with a terrific noise and tremor of the earth that the fountain ceased to flow and sank into a huge bason of water but as he saw with his own eyes vast heaps of fragments of rock coleridge writes huge fragments white chalk stones and pebbles had been thrown up by the original outbursts and forced aside into the lateral valleys  from these and from other like sources coleridges mind was no doubt stored with suggestions of tropical wonder and loveliness which fell togetherif his own account of the making of the poem is to be relied oninto the kaleidoscopic beauty of kubla khan it is not unlikely too cf ll 1213 that the ashtree dell at stowey which he had already used for a scene of supernatural terror in osorio bears some part in his avowed dream of xanadu  45 3alph the sacred river this name seems to be of coleridges own invention at least it has not been pointed out where he found it  16demonlover the demonlover or more often with sexes reversed the fairy mistress is a favorite theme of romance taken from folklore where it appears in many forms cf the ballads of thomas rymer tam lin and the demon lover in childs english and scottish popular ballads and scotts william and helen a translation of burgers lenore  46 39 41abyssinian maid mount abora see introductory note above  53honeydew a sweet sticky substance found on plants deposited there by the aphis or plantlouse it was supposed to be the food of fairies not improbably coleridge was thinking of manna a saccharine exudation found upon certain plants in the east mandeville describes it as found in the land of job this manna is clept bread of angels and it is a white thing that is full sweet and right delicious and more sweet than honey or sugar and it cometh of the dew of heaven that falleth upon the herbs in that country and it congealeth and becometh all white and sweet and men put it in medicines  534for he on honeydew hath fed and drunk the milk of paradise professor cooper in the article cited in the introductory note above points out that this part of the poem contains perhaps reminiscences of the stories told of the old man of the mountain this was the title popularly given to the head of a fanatical sect of mohammedans in syria in the eleventh and twelfth centuries whose method of getting rid of their enemies has given us the word assassin to quote from mandevilles travels which has the essentials of the story though the chief is here called gatholonabes and his domain is not in syria but in the island mistorak in the lordship of prester john  he had a full fair castle and a strong in a mountain so strong and so noble that no man could devise a fairer or a stronger and he had made wall all the mountain about with a strong wall and a fair and within those walls he had the fairest garden that any man might behold  and he had also in that place the fairest damsels that might be found under the age of fifteen years and the fairest young striplings that men might get of that same age and they were all clothed in cloths of gold full richly and he said that those were angels  and he had also made 3 wells fair and noble and all environed with stone of jasper and of crystal diapered with gold and set with precious stones and great orient pearls and he had made a conduit under the earth so that the 3 wells at his list should run one milk another wine and another honey and that place he clept paradise  and when that any good knight that was hardy and noble came to see this royalty he would lead him into his paradise and show him these wonderful things for his sport and the marvellous and delicious song of divers birds and the fair damsels and the fair wells of milk wine and honey plenteously running and he would make divers instruments of music to sound in an high tower so merrily that it was joy to hear and no man should see the craft thereof and those he said were angels of god and that place was paradise that god had promised to his friends saying dabo vobis terram fluentem lacte et melle i shall give thee a land flowing with milk and honey and then would he make them to drink of certain drink hashish a narcotic drug whence their name of assassins whereof anon they should be drunk and then would they think it greater delight than they had before and then would he say to them that if they would die for him and for his love that after their death they should come to his paradise and they should be of the age of the damsels and they should play with them and yet be maidens and after that should he put them in a yet fairer paradise where that they should see the god of nature visibly in his majesty and in his bliss and then would he show them his intent and say to them that if they would go slay such a lord or such a man that was his enemy or contrarious to his list that they should not therefore dread to do it and to be slain themselves for after their death he would put them in another paradise that was an 100fold fairer than any of the tother and there should they dwell with the most fairest damsels that might be and play with them evermore  and thus went many divers lusty pachelors to slay great lords in divers countries that were his enemies and made themselves to be slain in hope to have that paradise   france an ode  when coleridge republished this poem in the post in 1802 he prefixed to it the following   argument  first stanza an invocation to those objects in nature the contemplation of which had inspired the poet with a devotional love of liberty second stanza the exultation of the poet at the commencement of the french revolution and his unqualified abhorrence of the alliance against the republic third stanza the blasphemies and horrors during the domination of the terrorists regarded by the poet as a transient storm and as the natural consequence of the former despotism and of the foul superstition of popery reason indeed began to suggest many apprehensions yet still the poet struggled to retain the hope that france would make conquests by no other means than by presenting to the observation of europe a people more happy and better instructed than under other forms of government fourth stanza switzerland and the poets recantation fifth stanza an address to liberty in which the poet expresses his conviction that those feelings and that grand ideal of freedom which the mind attains by its contemplation of its individual nature and of the sublime surrounding objects see stanza the first do not belong to men as a society nor can possibly be either gratified or realized under any form of human government but belong to the individual man so far as he is pure and inflamed with the love and adoration of god in nature  51 22when france in wrath etc the storming of the bastile took place july 14 1789 on the 4th of august feudal and manorial privileges were swept away by the national assembly and on the 18th of august the assembly formally adopted a declaration of the rights of man in september 1792 the national convention abolished royalty and declared france a republic  52 267with what a joy my lofty gratulation unawed i sang coleridge wrote a poem on the destruction of the bastile probably in 1789 or soon after first printed in 1834 and in september 1792 some lines to a young lady with a poem on the french revolution first printed in the watchman in 1796 in which he tells his emotions    when slumbering freedom roused with high disdain   with giant fury burst her triple chain  28the disenchanted nation disenchanted because they found that freedom peace and virtue were not to be secured by mere proclamation and that all europe was not ready at the call of the revolutionists to abolish prescriptive rights and establish republican forms of society in january 1793 louis xvi was beheaded the act was followed pretty promptly by a coalition of england holland spain naples and the german states against the republic  36yet still my voice in religious musings 17946 and more ardently in the parts that he contributed to southeys joan of arc 1796

coldblooded agent of tyranny by the french republicans and their english sympathizers  44sweet music of deliverance the french were so convinced that their revolution marked the beginning of a new era in human affairs that they determined to have a new chronology accordingly a commission of scientists was appointed to formulate a system which was adopted in october 1793 the era of the republic was to be counted from the autumnal equinox 1792 the year was divided into twelve months as before but they were renamed thermidor hot month fructidor fruit month nivose snow month c and ran in periods of thirty days each from the 22d of september this left five days undistributed which were set apart as feastdays in celebration of five virtues or ideals each month consisted of three decades and each tenth day or decadis was a holiday the purpose of this was to eradicate the observance of the christian sunday this chronology was in actual use in france until napoleon put an end to it in 1806  the municipality of paris in 1793 decreed that on the 10th of november the worship of reason should be inaugurated at notre dame on that day the venerable cathedral was profaned by a series of sacrilegious outrages unparalleled in the history of christendom a temple dedicated to philosophy was erected on a platform in the middle of the choir  the goddess of reason impersonated by mademoiselle maillard a well known figurante of the opera took her seat upon a grassy throne in front of the temple  and the multitude bowed the knee before her in profound admiration at the close of this grotesque ceremony the whole cortège proceeded to the hall of the convention carrying with them their goddess who was borne aloft in a chair of state on the shoulders of four men having deposited her in front of the president chaumette the spokesman of the procession harangued the assembly he proceeded to demand that the cidevant metropolitan church should henceforth be the temple of reason and liberty which proposition was immediately adopted the goddess was then conducted to the president and he and other officers of the house saluted her with the fraternal kiss amid thunders of applause after this upon the motion of thuriot the convention in a body joined the mass of the people and marched in their company to the temple of reason to witness a repetition of the impieties above described at st gervais a ball was given in the chapel of the virgin in other churches theatrical spectacles took place on sunday the 17th of november all the parish churches of paris were closed by authority with three exceptions religion was proscribed churches closed christian ordinances interdicted the dreary gloom of atheistical despotism overspread the landjervis the gallican church and the revolution quoted in larneds history for ready reference p 1300 the next year however robespierre had a decree passed of which the first article was the french people acknowledge the existence of the supreme being and the immortality of the soul and thereupon the inscriptions to reason that had been placed upon the french churches were replaced by others reading to the supreme being  50calm and bright after the downfall of robespierre in 1794 france gradually worked back to a less hysterical mood in october 1795 a new form of government known as the directory was established under which the people enjoyed comparative safety at home and developed a remarkable military efficiency against their foreign enemies bonapartes military genius brought him rapidly to the front in the wars of the directory it was he that created the cisalpine and ligurine republics and his policy directed the invasions of rome and of switzerland  53 66helvetia in march 1798 after having fostered or compelled the formation of republics under french protection in holland northern italy and rome the directory under pretence of defending the republican rights of the vaudois made a

illness i had compelled into hours of delight many a sleepless painful hour of darkness by chasing down metaphysical game and since then i have continued the hunt until i found myself unaware at the root of pure mathematics the poet is dead in me and years afterward in a letter to an artist friend w collins december 1818 poetry is out of the question the attempt would only hurry me into that

that it is a reality and so turns to forget it in the sensuous intoxication of the winds music or perhapsfor coleridge is already a metaphysicianreality is used here in opposition to ideality or imagination the truth of philosophy cf ll 8990 and the metaphysic habit of mind that the study of it induceswhat we call realityis a dream that has come between him and the world of the ideal in which he had and used his shaping spirit of imagination the passage is obscure  100bare crag etc the scenery here is that of the lake country where coleridge and wordsworth were then livingthe former at
