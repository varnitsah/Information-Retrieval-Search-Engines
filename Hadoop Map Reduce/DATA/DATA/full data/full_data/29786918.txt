trafford went into parliament for the borough of wednesbury as an advanced radical it nearly broke the heart of his uncle the old marquis of kingsbury among tories of his day the marquis had been hypertoryas were his friends the duke of newcastle who thought that a man should be allowed to do what he liked with his own and the marquis of londonderry who when some such fallingoff in the family politics came near him spoke with indignation of the family treasure which had been expended in defending the family seat wednesbury had never been the marquiss own but his nephew was so in a peculiar sense his nephew was necessarily his heirthe future marquisand the old marquis never again politically held up his head he was an old man when this occurred and luckily for him he did not live to see the worse things which came afterwards  the member for wednesbury became marquis and owner of the large family property but still he kept his politics he was a radical marquis wedded to all popular measures not ashamed of his charter days and still clamorous for further parliamentary reform although it was regularly noted in dod that the marquis of kingsbury was supposed to have strong influence in the borough of edgeware it was so strong that both he and his uncle had put in whom they pleased his uncle had declined to put him in because of his renegade theories but he revenged himself by giving the seat to a glibmouthed tailor who to tell the truth had not done much credit to his choice  but it came to pass that the shade of his uncle was avenged if it can be supposed that such feelings will affect the eternal rest of a dead marquis there grew up a young lord hampstead the son and heir of the radical marquis promising in intelligence and satisfactory in externals but very difficult to deal with as to the use of his thoughts they could not keep him at harrow or at oxford because he not only rejected but would talk openly against christian doctrines a religious boy but determined not to believe in revealed mysteries and at twentyone he declared himself a republicanexplaining thereby that he disapproved altogether of hereditary honours he was quite as bad to this marquis as had been this marquis to the other the tailor kept his seat because lord hampstead would not even condescend to sit for the family borough he explained to his father that he had doubts about a parliament of which one section was hereditary but was sure that at present he was too young for it there must surely have been gratification in this to the shade of the departed marquis  but there was worse than thisinfinitely worse lord hampstead formed a close friendship with a young man five years older than himself who was but a clerk in the post office in george roden as a man and a companion there was no special fault to be found there may be those who think that a marquiss heir should look for his most intimate friend in a somewhat higher scale of social rank and that he would more probably serve the purposes of his future life by associating with his equalsthat like to like in friendship is advantageous the marquis his father certainly thought so in spite of his radicalism but he might have been pardoned on the score of rodens general good giftsmight have been pardoned even though it were true as supposed that to rodens strong convictions lord hampstead owed much of the ultra virus of his political convictionsmight have been pardoned had not there been worse again at hendon hall the marquiss lovely suburban seat the post office clerk was made acquainted with lady frances trafford and they became lovers  the radicalism of a marquis is apt to be tainted by special considerations in regard to his own family this marquis though he had his exoteric politics had his esoteric feelings with him liberal as he was his own blood possessed a peculiar ichor though it might be well that men in the mass should be as nearly equal as possible yet looking at the state of possibilities and realities as existent it was clear to him that a marquis of kingsbury had been placed on a pedestal it might be that the state of things was matter for regret in his grander moments he was certain that it was so why should there be a ploughboy unable to open his mouth because of his infirmity and a marquis with his own voice very resonant in the house of lords and a deputy voice dependent on him in the house of commons he had said so very frequently before his son not knowing then what might be the effect of his own teaching there had been a certain pride in his heart as he taught these lessons wrong though it might be that there should be a marquis and a ploughboy so far reversed by the injustice of fate there had been a comfort to him in feeling that fate had made him the marquis and had made some one else the ploughboy he knew what it was to be a marquis down to the last inch of aristocratic admeasurement he would fain that his children should have understood this also but his lesson had gone deeper than he had intended and great grief had come of it  the marquis had been first married to a lady altogether unconnected with noble blood but whose father had held a position of remarkable ascendancy in the house of commons he had never been a cabinet minister because he had persisted in thinking that he could better serve his country by independence he had been possessed of wealth and had filled a great place in the social world in marrying the only daughter of this gentleman the marquis of kingsbury had indulged his peculiar taste in regard to liberalism and was at the same time held not to have derogated from his rank she had been a woman of great beauty and of many intellectual giftsthoroughly imbued with her fathers views but altogether free from feminine pedantry and that ambition which begrudges to men the rewards of male labour had she lived lady frances might probably not have fallen in with the post office clerk nevertheless had she lived she would have known the post office clerk to be a worthy gentleman  but she had died when her son was about sixteen and her daughter no more than fifteen two years afterwards our marquis had gone among the dukes and had found for himself another wife perhaps the freshness and edge of his political convictions had been blunted by that gradual sinking down among the great peers in general which was natural to his advanced years a man who has spouted at twentyfive becomes tired of spouting at fifty if nothing special has come from his spouting he had been glad when he married lady clara mountressor to think that circumstances as they had occurred at the last election would not make it necessary for him to deliver up the borough to the tailor on any further occasion the tailor had been drunk at the hustings and he ventured to hope that before six months were over lord hampstead would have so far rectified his frontiers as to be able to take a seat in the house of commons  then very quickly there were born three little flaxenhaired boyswho became at least flaxenhaired as they emerged from their cradleslord frederic lord augustus and lord gregory that they must be brought up with ideas becoming the scions of a noble house there could be no doubt their mother was every inch a dukes daughter but alas not one of them was likely to become marquis of kingsbury though born so absolutely in the purple they were but younger sons this was a silent sorrowbut when their half sister lady frances told their mother openly that she had plighted her troth to the post office clerk that was a sorrow which did not admit of silence  when lord hampstead had asked permission to bring his friend to the house there seemed to be no valid reason for refusing him low as he had descended amidst the depths of disreputable opinion it was not supposed that even he would countenance anything so horrible as this and was there not ground for security in the reticence and dignity of lady frances herself the idea never presented itself to the marchioness when she heard that the post office clerk was coming she was naturally disgusted all lord hampsteads ideas doings and ways were disgusting to her she was a woman full of highbred courtesy and had always been gracious to her soninlaws friendsbut it had been with a cold grace her heart rejected them thoroughlyas she did him and to tell the truth lady frances also lady frances had all her mothers dignity all her mothers tranquil manner but something more than her mothers advanced opinions she too had her ideas that the world should gradually be taught to dispense with the distances which separate the dukes and the ploughboysgradually but still with a progressive motion always tending in that direction this to her stepmother was disgusting  the post office clerk had never before been received at hendon hall though he had been introduced in london by lord hampstead to his sister the post office clerk had indeed abstained from coming having urged his own feelings with his friend as to certain unfitnesses a marquis is as absurd to me as to you he had said to lord hampstead but while there are marquises they should be indulgedparticularly marchionesses an overdelicate skin is a nuisance but if skins have been so trained as not to bear the free air veils must be allowed for their protection the object should be to train the skin not to punish it abruptly an unfortunate sybarite marchioness ought to have her rose leaves now i am not a rose leaf and so he had stayed away  but the argument had been carried on between the friends and the noble heir had at last prevailed george roden was not a rose leaf but he was found at hendon to have flowers of beautiful hues and with a sweet scent had he not been known to be a post office clerkcould the marchioness have been allowed to judge of him simply from his personal appearancehe might have been taken to be as fine a rose leaf as any he was a tall fair stronglybuilt young man with short light hair pleasant grey eyes an aquiline nose and small mouth in his gait and form and face nothing was discernibly more appropriate to post office clerks than to the nobility at large but he was a clerk and he himself as he himself declared knew nothing of his own familyremembered no relation but his mother  it had come to pass that the house at hendon had become specially the residence of lord hampstead who would neither have lodgings of his own in london or make part of the family when it occupied kingsbury house in park lane he would sometimes go abroad would sometimes appear for a week or two at trafford park the grand seat in yorkshire but he preferred the place half town half country in the neighbourhood of london and here george roden came frequently backwards and forwards after the ice had been broken by a first visit sometimes the marquis would be there and with him his daughterrarely the marchioness then came the time when lady frances declared boldly to her stepmother that she had pledged her troth to the post office clerk that happened in june when parliament was sitting and when the flowers at hendon were at their best the marchioness came there for a day or two and the post office clerk on that morning had left the house for his office work not purposing to come back some words had been said which had caused annoyance and he did not intend to return when he had been gone about an hour lady frances revealed the truth  her brother at that time was twoandtwenty she was a year younger the clerk might perhaps be six years older than the young lady had he only been the eldest son of a marquis or earl or viscount had he been but an embryo baron he might have done very well he was a wellspoken youth yet with a certain modesty such a one as might easily take the eye of a wishedfor though ever so noble a motherinlaw the little lords had learned to play with him and it had come about that he was at his ease in the house the very servants had seemed to forget that he was no more than a clerk and that he went off by railway into town every morning that he might earn ten shillings by sitting for six hours at his desk even the marchioness had almost trained herself to like himas one of those excrescences which are sometimes to be found in noble families some governess some chaplain or private secretary whom chance or merit has elevated in the house and who thus becomes a trusted friend then by chance she heard the name frances without the prefix lady and said a word in haughty anger the post office clerk packed up his portmanteau and lady frances told her story  lord hampsteads name was john he was the honourable john trafford called by courtesy earl of hampstead to the world at large he was lord hampsteadto his friends in general he was hampstead to his stepmother he was especially hampsteadas would have been her own eldest son the moment he was born had he been born to such good luck to his father he had become hampstead lately in early days there had been some secret family agreement that in spite of conventionalities he should be john among them the marquis had latterly suggested that increasing years made this foolish but the son himself attributed the change to stepmaternal influences but still he was john to his sister and john to some halfdozen sympathising friendsand among others to the post office clerk  he has not said a word to me the sister replied when she was taxed by her brother with seeming partiality for their young visitor  but he will  no girl will ever admit as much as that john  but if he should  no girl will have an answer ready for such a suggestion  i know he will  if so and if you have wishes to express you should speak to him  all this made the matter quite clear to her brother a girl such as was his sister would not so receive a brothers notice as to a proposed overture of love from a post office clerk unless she had brought herself to look at the possibility without abhorrence  would it go against the grain with you john this was what the clerk said when he was interrogated by his friend  there would be difficulties  very great difficultiesdifficulties even with you  i did not say so  they would come naturally the last thing that a man can abandon of his social idolatries is the sanctity of the women belonging to him  god forbid that i should give up anything of the sanctity of my sister  no but the idolatry attached to it it is as well that even a noblemans daughter should be married if she can find a nobleman or such like to her taste there is no breach of sanctity in the lovebut so great a wound to the idolatry in the man things have not changed so quickly that even you should be free from the feeling three hundred years ago if the man could not be despatched out of the country or to the other world the girl at least would be locked up three hundred years hence the girl and the man will stand together on their own merits just in this period of transition it is very hard for such a one as you to free himself altogether from the old trammels  i make the endeavour  most bravely but my dear fellow let this individual thing stand separately away from politics and abstract ideas i mean to ask your sister whether i can have her heart and as far as her will goes her hand if you are displeased i suppose we shall have to partfor a time let theories run ever so high love will be stronger than them all lord hampstead at this moment gave no assurance of his good will but when it came to pass that his sister had given her assurance then he ranged himself on the side of his friend the clerk  so it came to pass that there was great trouble in the household of the marquis of kingsbury the family went abroad before the end of july on account of the health of the children so said the morning post anxious friends inquired in vain what could have befallen those flaxenhaired young herculeses why was it necessary that they should be taken to the saxon alps when the beauties and comforts of trafford park were so much nearer and so superior lady frances was taken with them and there were one or two noble intimates among the world of fashion who heard some passing whispers of the truth when passing whispers creep into the world of fashion they are heard far and wide     chapter ii  lord hampstead   lord hampstead though he would not go into parliament or belong to any london club or walk about the streets with a chimneypot hat or perform any of his public functions as a young nobleman should do had nevertheless his own amusements and his own extravagances in the matter of money he was placed outside his fathers liberalitywho was himself inclined to be liberal enoughby the fact that he had inherited a considerable portion of his maternal grandfathers fortune it might almost be said truly of him that money was no object to him it was not that he did not often talk about money and think about money he was very prone to do so saying that money was the most important factor in the worlds justices and injustices but he was so fortunately circumstanced as to be able to leave money out of his own personal consideration never being driven by the want of it to deny himself anything or tempted by a superabundance to expenditure which did not otherwise approve itself to him to give 10s or 20s a bottle for wine because somebody pretended that it was very fine or £300 for a horse when one at a £100 would do his work for him was altogether below his philosophy by his fathers lodge gate there ran an omnibus up to town which he would often use saying that an omnibus with company was better than a private carriage with none he was wont to be angry with himself in that he employed a fashionable tailor declaring that he incurred unnecessary expense merely to save himself the trouble of going elsewhere in this however it may be thought that there was something of pretence as he was no doubt conscious of good looks and aware probably that a skilful tailor might add a grace  in his amusements he affected two which are especially expensive he kept a yacht in which he was accustomed to absent himself in the summer and autumn and he had a small hunting establishment in northamptonshire of the former little need be said here as he spent his time on board much alone or with friends with whom we need not follow him but it may be said that everything about the free trader was done wellfor such was the name of the vessel though he did not pay 10s a bottle for his wine he paid the best price for sails and cordage and hired a competent skipper to look after himself and his boat his hunting was done very much in the same wayunless it be that in his yachting he was given to be tranquil and in his hunting he was very fond of hard riding at gorse hall as his cottage was called he had all comforts we may perhaps say much of luxury around him it was indeed hardly more than a cottage having been an old farmhouse and lately converted to its present purpose there were no noble surroundings no stately hall no marble staircases no costly salon you entered by a passage which deserved no auguster name on the right of which was the diningroom on the left a larger chamber always called the drawingroom because of the fashion of the name beyond that was a smaller retreat in which the owner kept his books leading up from the end of the passage there was a steep staircase a remnant of the old farmhouse and above them five bedrooms so that his lordship was limited to the number of four guests behind this was the kitchen and the servants roomssufficient but not more than sufficient for such a house here our young democrat kept halfadozen horses all of themas men around were used to declarefit to go although they were said to have been bought at not more than £100 each it was supposed to be a crotchet on the part of lord hampstead to assert that cheap things were as good as dear and there were some who believed that he did in truth care as much for his horses as other people it was certainly a fact that he never would have but one out in a day and he was wont to declare that smith took out his second horse chiefly that jones might know that he did so down here at gorse hall the post office clerk had often been received as a visitorbut not at gorse hall had he ever seen lady frances  this lord had peculiar ideas about hunting in reference to sport in general it was supposed of him and supposed truly that no young man in england was more devotedly attached to foxhunting than heand that in want of a fox he would ride after a stag and in want of a stag after a drag if everything else failed he would go home across the country any friend accompanying him or else alone nevertheless he entertained a vehement hostility against all other sports  of racing he declared that it had become simply a way of making money and of all ways the least profitable to the world and the most disreputable he was never seen on a racecourse but his enemies declared of him that though he loved riding he was no judge of an animals pace and that he was afraid to bet lest he should lose his money  against shooting he was still louder if there was in his country any tradition any custom any law hateful to him it was such as had reference to the preservation of game the preservation of a fox he said stood on a perfectly different basis the fox was not preserved by law and when preserved was used for the advantage of all who chose to be present at the amusement one man in one day would shoot fifty pheasants which had eaten up the food of halfadozen human beings one fox afforded in one day amusement to two hundred sportsmen and wasor more generally was notkilled during the performance and the fox during his beneficial life had eaten no corn nor for the most part geesebut chiefly rats and such like what infinitesimal sum had the fox cost the country for every man who rushed after him then what had been the cost of all those pheasants which one shooting cormorant crammed into his huge bag during one days greedy sport  but it was the public nature of the one amusement and the thoroughly private nature of the other which chiefly affected him in the huntingfield the farmers son if he had a pony or the butcherboy out of the town could come and take his part and if the butcherboy could go ahead and keep his place while the man with a red coat and pink boots and with two horses fell behind the butcherboy would have the best of it and incur the displeasure of no one and the laws too by which hunting is governed if there be laws are thoroughly democratic in their nature they are not he said made by any parliament but are simply assented to on behalf of the common need it was simply in compliance with opinion that the lands of all men are open to be ridden over by the men of the hunt in compliance with opinion foxes are preserved in compliance with opinion coverts are drawn by this or the other pack of hounds the legislature had not stepped in to defile the statute book by byelaws made in favour of the amusements of the rich if injury were done the ordinary laws of the country were open to the injured party anything in hunting that had grown to be beyond the reach of the law had become so by the force of popular opinion  all of this was reversed in shooting from any participation in which the poor were debarred by enactments made solely on behalf of the rich four or five men in a couple of days would offer up hecatombs of slaughtered animals in doing which they could only justify themselves by the fact that they were acting as poultrybutchers for the supply of the markets of the country there was no excitement in itsimply the firing off of many guns with a rapidity which altogether prevents that competition which is essential to the enjoyment of sport then our noble republican would quote teufelsdröckh and the memorable epitaph of the partridgeslayer but it was on the popular and unpopular elements of the two sports that he would most strongly dilate and on the iniquity of the gamelaws as applying to the more aristocratic of the two it was however asserted by the sporting world at large that hampstead could not hit a haystack  as to fishing he was almost equally violent grounding his objection on the tedium and cruelty incident to the pursuit the first was only a matter of taste he would allow if a man could content himself and be happy with an average of one fish to every three days fishing that was the mans affair he could only think that in such case the man himself must be as coldblooded as the fish which he so seldom succeeded in catching as to the cruelty he thought there could be no doubt when he heard that bishops and ladies delighted themselves in hauling an unfortunate animal about by the gills for more than an hour at a stretch he was inclined to regret the past piety of the church and the past tenderness of the sex when he spoke in this way the cruelty of foxhunting was of course thrown in his teeth did not the poor hunted quadrupeds when followed hither and thither by a pack of foxhounds endure torments as sharp and as prolonged as those inflicted on the fish in answer to this lord hampstead was eloquent and argumentative as far as we could judge from nature the condition of the two animals during the process was very different the salmon with the hook in its throat was in a position certainly not intended by nature the fox using all its gifts to avoid an enemy was employed exactly as nature had enjoined it would be as just to compare a human being impaled alive on a stake with another overburdened with his worlds task the overburdened man might stumble and fall and so perish things would have been hard to him but not therefore could you compare his sufferings with the excruciating agonies of the poor wretch who had been left to linger and starve with an iron rod through his vitals this argument was thought to be crafty rather than cunning by those who were fond of fishing but he had another on which when he had blown off the steam of his eloquence by his sensational description of a salmon impaled by a bishop he could depend with greater confidence he would grantfor the moment though he was by no means sure of the factbut for the moment he would grant that the fox did not enjoy the hunt let it be acknowledgedfor the sake of the argumentthat he was tortured by the hounds rather than elated by the triumphant success of his own manoeuvres lord hampstead ventured to saythis he would put forward in the rationalistic tone with which he was wont to prove the absurdity of hereditary honoursthat in the infliction of all pain the question as to cruelty or no cruelty was one of relative value was it tanti who can doubt that for a certain maximum of good a certain minimum of suffering may be inflicted without slur to humanity in hunting one fox was made to finish his triumphant career perhaps prematurely for the advantage of two hundred sportsmen ah but only for their amusement would interpose some humanitarian averse equally to fishing and to hunting then his lordship would arise indignantly and would ask his opponent whether what he called amusement was not as beneficial as essential as necessary to the world as even such material good things as bread and meat was poetry less valuable than the multiplication table man could exist no doubt without foxhunting so he could without butter without wine or other socalled necessarieswithout ermine tippets for instance the original godinvested wearer of which had been doomed to lingering starvation and death when trapped amidst the snow in order that one lady might be made fine by the agonies of a dozen little furry sufferers it was all a case of tanti he said and he said that the fox who had saved himself halfadozen times and then died nobly on behalf of those who had been instrumental in preserving an existence for him ought not to complain of the lot which fate had provided for him among the animals of the earth it was said however in reference to this comparison between fishing and foxhunting that lord hampstead was altogether deficient in that skill and patience which is necessary for the landing of a salmon  but men though they laughed at him still they liked him he was goodhumoured and kindlyhearted he was liberal in more than his politics he had too a knack of laughing at himself and his own peculiarities which went far to redeem them that a young earl an embryo marquis the heir of such a house as that of trafford should preach a political doctrine which those who heard ignorantly called communistic was very dreadful but the horror of it was mitigated when he declared that no doubt as he got old he should turn tory like any other radical in this there seemed to be a covert allusion to his father and then they could perceive that his communistic principles did not prevent him from having a good eye to the value of land he knew what he was about as an owner of property should do and certainly rode to hounds as well as any one of the boys of the period  when the idea first presented itself to him that his sister was on the way to fall in love with george roden it has to be acknowledged that he was displeased it had not occurred to him that this peculiar breach would be made on the protected sanctity of his own family when roden had spoken to him of this sanctity as one of the social idolatries he had not quite been able to contradict him he had wished to do so both in defence of his own consistency and also if it were possible so as to maintain the sanctity the divinity which does hedge a king had been to him no more than a social idolatry the special respect in which dukes and such like were held was the same the judges ermine and the bishops apron were idolatries any outward honour not earned by the deeds or words of him so honoured but coming from birth wealth or from the doings of another was an idolatry carrying on his arguments he could not admit the same thing in reference to his sisteror rather he would have to admit it if he could not make another plea in defence of the sanctity his sister was very holy to himbut that should be because of her nearness to him because of her sweetness because of her own gifts because as her brother he was bound to be her especial knight till she should have chosen some other special knight for herself but it should not be because she was the daughter granddaughter and greatgranddaughter of dukes and marquises it should not be because she was lady frances trafford had he himself been a post office clerk then would not this chosen friend have been fit to love her there were unfitnesses no doubt very common in this world which should make the very idea of love impossible to a womanunfitness of character of habits of feelings of education unfitnesses as to inward personal nobility he could not say that there were any such which ought to separate his sister and his friend if it was to be that this sweet sister should some day give her heart to a lover why not to george roden as well as to another there were no such unfitnesses as those of which he would have thought in dealing with the lives of some other girl and some other young man  and yet he was if not displeased at any rate dissatisfied there was something which grated against either his taste or his judgmentor perhaps his prejudices he endeavoured to inquire into himself fairly on this matter and feared that he was yet the victim of the prejudices of his order he was wounded in his pride to think that his sister should make herself equal to a clerk in the post office though he had often endeavoured only too successfully to make her understand how little she had in truth received from her high birth yet he felt that she had received something which should have made the proposal of such a marriage distasteful to her a man cannot rid himself of a prejudice because he knows or believes it to be a prejudice that the two if they continued to wish it must become man and wife he acknowledged to himselfbut he could not bring himself not to be sorry that it should be so  there were some words on the subject between himself and his father before the marquis went abroad with his family which though they did not reconcile him to the match lessened the dissatisfaction his father was angry with him throwing the blame of this untoward affair on his head and he was always prone to resent censure thrown by any of his family on his own peculiar tenets thus it came to pass that in defending himself he was driven to defend his sister also the marquis had not been at hendon when the revelation was first made but had heard it in the course of the day from his wife his radical tendencies had done very little towards reconciling him to such a proposal he had never brought his theories home into his own personalities to be a radical peer in the house of lords and to have sent a radical tailor to the house of commons had been enough if not too much to satisfy his own political ideas to himself and to his valet to all those immediately touching himself he had always been the marquis of kingsbury and so also in his inner heart the marchioness was the marchioness and lady frances lady frances he had never gone through any process of realizing his convictions as his son had done hampstead he said can this possibly be true what your mother has told me this took place at the house in park lane to which the marquis had summoned his son  do you mean about frances and george roden  of course i mean that  i supposed you did sir i imagined that when you sent for me it was in regard to them no doubt it is true  what is true you speak as though you absolutely approved it  then my voice has belied me for i disapprove of it  you feel i hope how utterly impossible it is  not that  not that  i cannot say that i think it to be impossibleor even improbable knowing the two as i do i feel the probability to be on their side  that theyshould be married  that is what they intend i never knew either of them to mean anything which did not sooner or later get itself accomplished  youll have to learn it on this occasion how on earth can it have been brought about lord hampstead shrugged his shoulders somebody has been very much to blame  you mean me sir  somebody has been very much to blame  of course you mean me i cannot take any blame in the matter in introducing george roden to you and to my mother and to frances i brought you to the knowledge of a highlyeducated and extremely wellmannered young man  good god  i did to my friend what every young man i suppose does to his i should be ashamed of myself to associate with any one who was not a proper guest for my fathers table one does not calculate before that a young man and a young woman shall fall in love with each other  you see what has happened  it was extremely natural no doubtthough i had not anticipated it as i told you i am very sorry it will cause many heartburns and some unhappiness  unhappiness i should think so i must go awayin the middle of the session  it will be worse for her poor girl  it will be very bad for her said the marquis speaking as though his mind were quite made up on that matter  but nobody as far as i can see has done anything wrong continued lord hampstead when two young people get together whose tastes are similar and opinionswhose educations and habits of thought have been the same  habits the same  habits of thought i said sir  you would talk the hind legs off a dog said the marquis bouncing out of the room it was not unusual with him in the absolute privacy of his own circle to revert to language which he would have felt to be unbecoming to him as marquis of kingsbury among ordinary people     chapter iii  the marchioness   though the departure of the marquis was much hurried there were other meetings between hampstead and the family before the flitting was actually made  no doubt i will i am quite with you there the son said to the father who had desired him to explain to the young man the impossibility of such a marriage i think it would be a misfortune to them both which should be avoidedif they can get over their present feelings  feelings  i suppose there are such feelings sir  of course he is looking for positionand money  not in the least that might probably be the idea with some young nobleman who would wish to marry into his own class and to improve his fortune at the same time with such a one that would be fair enough he would give and take with george that would not be honestnor would such accusation be true the position as you call it he would feel to be burdensome as to money he does not know whether frances has a shilling or not  not a shillingunless i give it to her  he would not think of such a matter  then he must be a very imprudent young man and unfit to have a wife at all  i cannot admit thatbut suppose he is  and yet you think  i think sir that it is unfortunate i have said so ever since i first heard it i shall tell him exactly what i think you will have frances with you and will of course express your own opinion  the marquis was far from satisfied with his son but did not dare to go on further with the argument in all such discussions he was wont to feel that his son was talking the hind legs off a dog his own ideas on concrete points were clear enough to himas this present idea that his daughter lady frances trafford would outrage all propriety all fitness all decency if she were to give herself in marriage to george roden the post office clerk but words were not plenty with himor when plenty not efficaciousand he was prone to feel when beaten in argument that his opponent was taking an unfair advantage thus it was that he often thought and sometimes said that those who oppressed him with words would talk the hind legs off a dog  the marchioness also expressed her opinion to hampstead she was a lady stronger than her husbandstronger in this that she never allowed herself to be worsted in any encounter if words would not serve her occasion at the moment her countenance would do soand if not that her absence she could be very eloquent with silence and strike an adversary dumb by the way in which she would leave a room she was a tall handsome woman with a sublime gaitvera incessu patuit dea she had heard if not the words then some translation of the words and had taken them to heart and borne them with her as her secret motto to be every inch an aristocrat in look as in thought was the object of her life that such was her highest duty was quite fixed in her mind it had pleased god to make her a marchionessand should she derogate from gods wish it had been her one misfortune that god should not also have made her the mother of a future marquis her face though handsome was quite impassive showing nothing of her sorrows or her joys and her voice was equally under control no one had ever imagined not even her husband that she felt acutely that one blow of fortune though hampsteads politics had been to her abominable treasonable blasphemous she treated him with an extreme courtesy if there were anything that he wished about the house she would have it done for him she would endeavour to interest herself about his hunting and she would pay him a great respectto him most onerousas being second in all things to the marquis though a republican blasphemous rebelso she thought of himhe was second to the marquis she would fain have taught her little boys to respect himas the future head of the familyhad he not been so accustomed to romp with them to pull them out of their little beds and toss them about in their nightshirts that they loved him much too well for respect it was in vain that their mother strove to teach them to call him hampstead  lady frances had never been specially in her way but to lady frances the stepmother had been perhaps harder than to the stepson of whose presence as an absolute block to her ambition she was well aware lady frances had no claim to a respect higher than that which was due to her own children primogeniture had done nothing for her she was a marquiss daughter but her mother had been only the offspring of a commoner there was perhaps something of conscience in her feelings towards the two as lord hampstead was undoubtedly in her way it occurred to her to think that she should not on that account be inimical to him lady frances was not in her wayand therefore was open to depreciation and dislike without wounds to her conscience and then though hampstead was abominable because of his republicanism his implied treason and blasphemy yet he was entitled to some excuse as being a man these things were abominable no doubt in him but more pardonably abominable than they would be in a woman lady frances had never declared herself to be a republican or a disbeliever much less a rebelas indeed had neither lord hampstead in the presence of her stepmother she was generally silent on matters of political or religious interest but she was supposed to sympathise with her brother and was known to be far from properly alive to aristocratic interests there was never quarrelling between the two but there was a lack of that friendship which may subsist between a stepmother of thirtyeight and a stepdaughter of twentyone lady frances was tall and slender with quiet speaking features dark in colour with blue eyes and hair nearly black in appearance she was the very opposite of her stepmother moving quickly and achieving grace as she did so without a thought by the natural beauty of her motions the dignity was there but without a thought given to it not even did the little lords her brothers chuck their books and toys about with less idea of demeanour but the marchioness never arranged a scarf or buttoned a glove without feeling that it was her duty to button her glove and arrange her scarf as became the marchioness of kingsbury  the stepmother wished no evil to lady francesonly that she should be married properly and taken out of the way any stupid earl or mercurial viscount would have done so long as the blood and the money had been there lady frances had been felt to be dangerous and the hope was that the danger might be got rid of by a proper marriage but not by such a marriage as this  when that accidental calling of the name was first heard and the following avowal made the marchioness declared her immediate feelings by a look it was so that arthur may have looked when he first heard that his queen was sinfulso that cæsar must have felt when even brutus struck him for though lady frances had been known to be blind to her own greatness still thisthis at any rate was not suspected you cannot mean it the marchioness had at last said  i certainly mean it mamma then the marchioness with one hand guarding her raiment and with the other raised high above her shoulder in an agony of supplication to those deities who arrange the fates of ducal houses passed slowly out of the room it was necessary that she should bethink herself before another word was spoken  for some time after that very few words passed between her and the sinner a dead silence best befitted the occasionas when a child soils her best frock we put her in the corner with a scolding but when she tells a fib we quell her little soul within her by a terrible quiescence to be eloquently indignant without a word is within the compass of the thoughtfully stolid it was thus that lady frances was at first treated by her stepmother she was however at once taken up to london subjected to the louder anger of her father and made to prepare for the saxon alps at first indeed her immediate destiny was not communicated to her she was to be taken abroadand in so taking her it was felt to be well to treat her as the policeman does his prisoner whom he thinks to be the last person who need be informed as to the whereabouts of the prison it did leak out quickly because the marquis had a castle or château of his own in saxonybut that was only an accident  the marchioness still said little on the matterunless in what she might say to her husband in the secret recesses of marital discussion but before she departed she found it expedient to express herself on one occasion to lord hampstead hampstead she said this is a terrible blow that has fallen upon us  i was surprised myself i do not know that i should call it exactly a blow  not a blow but of course you mean that it will come to nothing  what i meant was that though i regard the proposition as inexpedient  inexpedient  yesi think it inexpedient certainly but there is nothing in it that shocks me  nothing that shocks you  marriage in itself is a good thing  hampstead do not talk to me in that way  but i think it is if it be good for a young man to marry it must be good for a young woman also the one makes the other necessary  but not for such as your sisterand himtogether you are speaking in that way simply to torment me  i can only speak as i think i do agree that it would be inexpedient she would to a certain extent lose the countenance of her friends  altogether  not altogetherbut to some extent a certain class of peoplenot the best worth knowingmight be inclined to drop her however foolish her own friends may be we owe somethingeven to their folly  her friends are not foolishher proper friends  i quite agree with that but then so many of them are improper  hampstead  i am afraid that i dont make myself quite clear but never mind it would be inexpedient it would go against the grain with my father who ought to be consulted  i should think so  i quite agree with you a father ought to be consulted even though a daughter be of age so as to be enabled by law to do as she likes with herself and then there would be money discomforts  she would not have a shilling  not but what i should think it my duty to put that right if there were any real distress here spoke the heir who was already in possession of much and upon whom the whole property of the family was entailed nevertheless if i can prevent itwithout quarrelling either with one or the other without saying a hard wordi shall do so  it will be your bounden duty  it is always a mans bounden duty to do what is right the difficulty is in seeing the way after this the marchioness was silent what she had gained by speaking was very littlelittle or nothing the nature of the opposition he proposed was almost as bad as a sanction and the reasons he gave for agreeing with her were as hurtful to her feelings as though they had been advanced on the other side even the marquis was not sufficiently struck with horror at the idea that a daughter of his should have condescended to listen to love from a post office clerk  on the day before they started hampstead was enabled to be alone with his sister for a few minutes what an absurdity it is she said laughingthis running away  it is what you must have expected  but not the less absurd of course i shall go just at the moment i have no alternative as i should have none if they threatened to lock me up till i got somebody to take my case in hand but i am as free to do what i please with myself as is papa  he has got money  but he is not therefore to be a tyrant  yes he isover an unmarried daughter who has got none we cannot but obey those on whom we are dependent  what i mean is that carrying me away can do no good you dont suppose john that i shall give him up after having once brought myself to say the word it was very difficult to saybut ten times harder to be unsaid i am quite determinedand quite satisfied  but they are not  as regards my father i am very sorry as to mamma she and i are so different in all our thinking that i know beforehand that whatever i might do would displease her it cannot be helped whether it be good or bad i cannot be made such as she is she came too late you will not turn against me john  i rather think i shall  john  i may rather say that i have i do not think your engagement to be wise  but it has been made said she  and may be unmade  nounless by him  i shall tell him that it ought to be unmadefor the happiness of both of you  he will not believe you  then lord hampstead shrugged his shoulders and thus the conversation was finished  it was now about the end of june and the marquis felt it to be a grievance that he should be carried away from the charm of political life in london in the horror of the first revelation he had yielded but had since begun to feel that too much was being done in withdrawing him from parliament the conservatives were now in but during the last liberal government he had consented so far to trammel himself with the bonds of office as to become privy seal for the concluding six months of its existence and therefore felt his own importance in a party point of view but having acceded to his wife he could not now go back and was sulky on the evening before their departure he was going to dine out with some of the party his wifes heart was too deep in the great family question for any gaiety and she intended to remain at homeand to look after the final packingsup for the little lords  i really do not see why you should not have gone without me the marquis said poking his head out of his dressingroom  impossible said the marchioness  i dont see it at all  if he should appear on the scene ready to carry her off what should i have done  then the marquis drew his head in again and went on with his dressing what indeed could he do himself if the man were to appear on the scene and if his daughter should declare herself willing to go off with him  when the marquis went to his dinner party the marchioness dined with lady frances there was no one else present but the two servants who waited on them and hardly a word was spoken the marchioness felt that an awful silence was becoming in the situation lady frances merely determined more strongly than ever that the situation should not last very long she would go abroad now but would let her father understand that the kind of life planned out for her was one that she could not endure if she was supposed to have disgraced her position let her be sent away  as soon as the melancholy meal was over the two ladies separated the marchioness going upstairs among her own children a more careful more affectionate perhaps i may say a more idolatrous mother never lived every little want belonging to themfor even little lords have wantswas a care to her to see them washed and put in and out of their duds was perhaps the greatest pleasure of her life to her eyes they were pearls of aristocratic loveliness and indeed they were fine healthy bairns cleanlimbed brighteyed with grand appetites and never cross as long as they were allowed either to romp and make a noise or else to sleep lord frederic the eldest was already in words of two syllables and sometimes had a bad time with them lord augustus was the owner of great ivory letters of which he contrived to make playthings lord gregory had not as yet been introduced to any of the torments of education there was an old english clergyman attached to the family who was supposed to be their tutor but whose chief duty consisted in finding conversation for the marquis when there was no one else to talk to him there was also a french governess and a swiss maid but as they both learned english quicker than the children learned french they were not serviceable for the purpose at first intended the marchioness had resolved that her children should talk three or four languages as fluently as their own and that they should learn them without any of the agonies generally incident to tuition in that she had not as yet succeeded  she seated herself for a few minutes among the boxes and portmanteaus in the midst of which the children were disporting themselves prior to their final withdrawal to bed no mother was ever so blessedif only if only mamma said lord frederic wheres jack jack absolutely was intended to signify lord hampstead  fred did not i say that you should not call him jack  he say he is jack declared lord augustus rolling up in between his mothers knees with an impetus which would have upset her had she not been a strong woman and accustomed to these attacks  that is only because he is goodnatured and likes to play with you you should call him hampstead  mamma wasnt he christianed asked the eldest  yes of course he was christened my dear said the mother sadlythinking how very much of the ceremony had been thrown away upon the unbelieving godless young man then she superintended the putting to bed thinking what a terrible bar to her happiness had been created by that first unfortunate marriage of her husbands oh that she should be stepmother to a daughter who desired to fling herself into the arms of a clerk in the post office and then that an unchristianed that an infidel republican unenglish heir should stand in the way of her darling boy she had told herself a thousand times that the devil was speaking to her when she had dared to wish thatthat lord hampstead was not there she had put down the wish in her heart very often telling herself that it came from the devil she had made a faint struggle to love the young manwhich had resulted in constrained civility it would have been unnatural to her to love any but her own now she thought how glorious her frederic would have been as lord hampsteadand how infinitely better it would have been how infinitely better it would be for all the traffords for all the nobles of england and for the country at large but in thinking this she knew that she was a sinner and she endeavoured to crush the sin was it not tantamount to wishing that her husbands son wasdead     chapter iv  lady frances   there is something so sad in the condition of a girl who is known to be in love and has to undergo the process of being made ashamed of it by her friends that one wonders that any young woman can bear it most young women cannot bear it and either give up their love or say that they do a young man who has got into debt or been pluckedor even when he has declared himself to be engaged to a penniless young lady which is worseis supposed merely to have gone after his kind and done what was to be expected of him the mother never looks at him with that enduring anger by which she intends to wear out the daughters constancy the father frets and fumes pays the debts prepares the way for a new campaign and merely shrugs his shoulders about the proposed marriage which he regards simply as an impossibility but the girl is held to have disgraced herself though it is expected of her or at any rate hoped that she will get married in due time yet the falling in love with a manwhich is we must suppose a preliminary step to marriageis a wickedness even among the ordinary joneses and browns of the world we see that it is so when we are intimate enough with the browns to be aware of jane browns passion we understand the fathers manner and the mothers look the very servants about the house are aware that she has given way to her feelings and treat her accordingly her brothers are ashamed of her whereas she if her brother be in love with jemima jones applauds him sympathizes with him and encourages him  there are heroines who live through it all and are true to the end there are many pseudoheroines who intend to do so but break down the pseudoheroine generally breaks down when young smithnot so very younghas been taken in as a partner by messrs smith and walker and comes in her way in want of a wife the persecution is at any rate so often efficacious as to make fathers and mothers feel it to be their duty to use it it need not be said here how high above the ways of the browns soared the ideas of the marchioness of kingsbury but she felt that it would be her duty to resort to the measures which they would have adopted and she was determined that the marquis should do the same a terrible evil an incurable evil had already been inflicted many people alas would know that lady frances had disgraced herself she the marchioness had been unable to keep the secret from her own sister lady persiflage and lady persiflage would undoubtedly tell it to others her own ladys maid knew it the marquis himself was the most indiscreet of men hampstead would see no cause for secrecy roden would of course boast of it all through the post office the lettercarriers who attended upon park lane would have talked the matter over with the footmen at the area gate there could be no hope of secrecy all the young marquises and unmarried earls would know that lady frances trafford was in love with the postman but time and care and strict precaution might prevent the final misery of a marriage then if the marquis would be generous some young earl or at least a baron might be induced to forget the postman and to take the noble lily soiled indeed but made gracious by gilding her darlings must suffer any excess of money given would be at their cost but anything would be better than a post office clerk for a brotherinlaw  such were the views as to their future life with which the marchioness intended to accompany her stepdaughter to their saxon residence the marquis with less of a fixed purpose was inclined in the same way i quite agree that they should be separatedquite he said it mustnt be heard ofcertainly not certainly not not a shillingunless she behaves herself properly of course she will have her fortune but not to bestow it in such a manner as that  his own idea was to see them all settled in the château and then if possible to hurry back to london before the season was quite at an end his wife laid strong injunctions on him as to absolute secrecy having forgotten probably that she herself had told the whole story to lady persiflage the marquis quite agreed secrecy was indispensable as for him was it likely that he should speak of a matter so painful and so near to his heart nevertheless he told it all to mr greenwood the gentleman who acted as tutor private secretary and chaplain in the house  lady frances had her own ideas as to this going away and living abroad very strongly developed in her mind they intended to persecute her till she should change her purpose she intended to persecute them till they should change theirs she knew herself too well she thought to have any fear as to her own persistency that the marchioness should persuade or even persecute her out of an engagement to which she had assented she felt to be quite out of the question in her heart she despised the marchionessbearing with her till the time should come in which she would be delivered from the nuisance of surveillance under such a woman in her father she trusted much knowing him to be affectionate believing him to be still opposed to those aristocratic dogmas which were a religion to the marchionessfeeling probably that in his very weakness she would find her best strength if her stepmother should in truth become cruel then her father would take her part against his wife there must be a period of discomfortsay six months and then would come the time in which she would be able to say i have tried myself and know my own mind and i intend to go home and get myself married she would take care that her declaration to this effect should not come as a sudden blow the six months should be employed in preparing for it the marchioness might be persistent in preaching her views during the six months but so would lady frances be persistent in preaching hers  she had not accepted the mans love when he had offered it without thinking much about it the lesson which she had heard in her earlier years from her mother had sunk deep into her very soulmuch more deeply than the teacher of those lessons had supposed that teacher had never intended to inculcate as a doctrine that rank is a mistake no one had thought more than she of the incentives provided by rank to high duty noblesse oblige the lesson had been engraved on her heart and might have been read in all the doings of her life but she had endeavoured to make it understood by her children that they should not be overquick to claim the privileges of rank too many such would be showered on themtoo many for their own welfare let them never be greedy to take with outstretched hands those good things of which chance had provided for them so much more than their fair share let them remember that after all there was no virtue in having been born a child to a marquis let them remember how much more it was to be a useful man or a kind woman so the lessons had been givenand had gone for more than had been intended then all the renown of their fathers old politics assistedthe reelection of the drunken tailorthe jeerings of friends who were high enough and near enough to dare to jeerthe convictions of childhood that it was a fine thing because peculiar for a marquis and his belongings to be radicaland added to this there was contempt for the specially noble graces of their stepmother thus it was that lord hampstead was brought to his present condition of thinkingand lady frances  her convictions were quite as strong as his though they did not assume the same form with a girl at an early age all her outlookings into the world have something to do with love and its consequences when a young man takes his leaning either towards liberalism or conservatism he is not at all actuated by any feeling as to how some possible future young woman may think on the subject but the girl if she entertains such ideas at all dreams of them as befitting the man whom she may some day hope to love should she a protestant become a roman catholic and then a nun she feels that in giving up her hope for a mans love she is making the greatest sacrifice in her power for the saviour she is taking to her heart if she devotes herself to music or the pencil or to languages the effect which her accomplishments may have on some beau ideal of manhood is present to her mind from the very first she is dressing herself unconsciously in the mirror of a mans eyes quite unconsciously all this had been present to lady frances as month after month and year after year she had formed her strong opinions she had thought of no mans lovehad thought but little of loving any manbut in her meditations as to the weaknesses and vanity of rank there had always been present that ideahow would it be with her if such a one should ask for her hand such a one as she might find among those of whom she dreamed as being more noble than dukes even though they were numbered among the worlds proletaries then she had told herself that if any such a one should comeif at any time any should be allowed by herself to comehe should be estimated by his merits whether duke or proletary with her mind in such a state she had of course been prone to receive kindly the overtures of her brothers friend  what was there missing in him that a girl should require it was so that she had asked herself the question as far as manners were concerned this man was a gentleman she was quite sure of that whether proletary or not there was nothing about him to offend the taste of the bestborn of ladies that he was better educated than any of the highlybred young men she saw around her she was quite sure he had more to talk about than others of his birth and family she knew nothing but rather prided herself in knowing nothing because of that doctrine of hers that a man is to be estimated only by what he is himself and not at all by what he may derive from others of his personal appearance which went far with her she was very proud he was certainly a handsome young man and endowed with all outward gifts of manliness easy in his gait but not mindful of it with motions of his body naturally graceful but never studied with his head erect with a laugh in his eye wellmade as to his hands and feet neither his intellect nor his political convictions would have recommended a man to her heart unless there had been something in the outside to please her eye and from the first moment in which she had met him he had never been afraid of herhad ventured when he disagreed from her to laugh at her and even to scold her there is no barrier in a girls heart so strong against love as the feeling that the man in question stands in awe of her  she had taken some time before she had given him her answer and had thought much of the perils before her she had known that she could not divest herself of her rank she had acknowledged to herself that whether it was for good or bad a marquiss daughter could not be like another girl she owed much to her father much to her brothers something even to her stepmother but was the thing she proposed to do of such a nature as to be regarded as an evil to her family she could see that there had been changes in the ways of the world during the last centurychanges continued from year to year rank was not so high as it used to beand in consequence those without rank not so low the queens daughter had married a subject lords john and lords thomas were every day going into this and the other business there were instances enough of ladies of title doing the very thing which she proposed to herself why should a post office clerk be lower than another  then came the great question whether it behoved her to ask her father girls in general ask their mother and send the lover to the father she had no mother she was quite sure that she would not leave her happiness in the hands of the present marchioness were she to ask her father she knew that the matter would be at once settled against her her father was too much under the dominion of his wife to be allowed to have an opinion of his own on such a matter so she declared to herself and then determined that she would act on her own responsibility she would accept the man and then take the first opportunity of telling her stepmother what she had done and so it was it was only early on that morning that she had given her answer to george rodenand early on that morning she had summoned up her courage and told her whole story  the station to which she was taken was a large german schloss very comfortably arranged with the mountain as a background and the river elbe running close beneath its terraces on which the marquis had spent some money and made it a residence to be envied by the eyes of all passersby it had been bought for its beauty in a freak but had never been occupied for more than a week at a time till this occasion under other circumstances lady frances would have been as happy here as the day was long and had often expressed a desire to be allowed to stay for a while at königsgraaf but now though she made an attempt to regard their sojourn in the place as one of the natural events of their life she could not shake off the idea of a prison the marchioness was determined that the idea of a prison should not be shaken off in the first few days she said not a word about the objectionable lover nor did the marquis that had been settled between them but neither was anything said on any other subject there was a sternness in every motion and a grim silence seemed to preside in the château except when the boys were presentand an attempt was made to separate her from her brothers as much as possible which she was more inclined to resent than any other ill usage which was adopted towards her after about a fortnight it was announced that the marquis was to return to london he had received letters from the party which made it quite necessary that he should be there when this was told to lady frances not a word was said as to the probable duration of their own stay at the château  papa she said you are going back to london  yes my dear my presence in town is imperatively necessary  how long are we to stay here  how long  yes papa i like königsgraaf very much i always thought it the prettiest place i know but i do not like looking forward to staying here without knowing when i am to go away  you had better ask your mamma my dear  mamma never says anything to me it would be no good my asking her papa you ought to tell me something before you go away  tell you what  or let me tell you something  what do you want to tell me frances in saying this he assumed his most angry tone and sternest countenancewhich however were not very angry or very stern and had no effect in frightening his daughter he did not in truth wish to say a word about the post office clerk before he made his escape and would have been very glad to frighten her enough to make her silent had that been possible  papa i want you to know that it will do no good shutting me up there  nobody shuts you up  i mean here in saxony of course i shall stay for some time but you cannot expect that i shall remain here always  who has talked about always  i understand that i am brought here to beout of mr rodens way  i would rather not speak of that young man  but papaif he is to be my husband  he is not to be your husband  it will be so papa though i should be kept here ever so long that is what i want you to understand having given my wordand so much more than my wordi certainly shall not go back from it i can understand that you should carry me off here so as to try and wean me from it  it is quite out of the question impossible  no papa if he chooseand i chooseno one can prevent us as she said this she looked him full in the face  do you mean to say that you owe no obedience to your parents  to you papa of course i owe obedienceto a certain extent there does come a time i suppose in which a daughter may use her own judgment as to her own happiness  and disgrace all her family  i do not think that i shall disgrace mine what i want you to understand papa is thisthat you will not ensure my obedience by keeping me here i think i should be more likely to be submissive at home there is an idea in enforced control which is hardly compatible with obedience i dont suppose you will lock me up  you have no right to talk to me in that way  i want to explain that our being here can do no good when you are gone mamma and i will only be very unhappy together she wont talk to me and will look at me as though i were a poor lost creature i dont think that i am a lost creature at all but i shall be just as much lost here as though i were at home in england  when you come to talking you are as bad as your brother said the marquis as he left her only that the expression was considered to be unfit for female ears he would have accused her of talking the hind legs off a dog  when he was gone the life at königsgraaf became very sombre indeed mr george rodens name was never mentioned by either of the ladies there was the post office no doubt and the post office was at first left open to her but there soon came a time in which she was deprived of this consolation with such a guardian as the marchioness it was not likely that free correspondence should be left open to her     chapter v  mrs roden   george roden the post office clerk lived with his mother at holloway about three miles from his office there they occupied a small house which had been taken when their means were smaller even than at presentfor this had been done before the young man had made his way into the official elysium of st martinslegrand this had been effected about five years since during which time he had risen to an income of £170 as his mother had means of her own amounting to about double as much and as her personal expenses were small they were enabled to live in comfort she was a lady of whom none around knew anything but there had gone abroad a rumour among her neighbours that there was something of a mystery attached to her and there existed a prevailing feeling that she was at any rate a wellborn lady few people at holloway knew either her or her son but there were some who condescended to watch them and to talk about them it was ascertained that mrs roden usually went to church on sunday morning but that her son never did so it was known too that a female friend called upon her regularly once a week and it was noted in the annals of holloway that this female friend came always at three oclock on a monday intelligent observers had become aware that the return visit was made in the course of the week but not always made on one certain dayfrom which circumstances various surmises arose as to the means whereabouts and character of the visitor mrs roden always went in a cab the lady whose name was soon known to be mrs vincent came in a brougham which for a time was supposed to be her own peculiar property the man who drove it was so well arrayed as to hat cravat and coat as to leave an impression that he must be a private servant but one feminine observer keener than others saw the man on an unfortunate day descend from his box at a publichouse and knew at once that the trousers were the trousers of a hired driver from a liverystable nevertheless it was manifest that mrs vincent was better to do in the world than mrs roden because she could afford to hire a wouldbe private carriage and it was imagined also that she was a lady accustomed to remain at home of an afternoon probably with the object of receiving visitors because mrs roden made her visits indifferently on thursday friday or saturday it was suggested also that mrs vincent was no friend to the young clerk because it was well known that he was never there when the lady came and it was supposed that he never accompanied his mother on the return visits he had indeed on one occasion been seen to get out of the cab with his mother at their own door but it was strongly surmised that she had then picked him up at the post office his official engagements might indeed have accounted for all this naturally but the ladies of holloway were well aware that the humanity of the postmastergeneral allowed a saturday halfholiday to his otherwise overworked officials and they were sure that so good a son as george roden would occasionally have accompanied his mother had there been no especial reason against it from this further surmises arose some glance had fallen from the eye of the visitor lady or perhaps some chance word had been heard from her lips which created an opinion that she was religious she probably objected to george roden because he was antireligious or at any rate antichurch meeting or chapelgoing it had become quite decided at holloway that mrs vincent would not put up with the young clerks infidelity and it was believed that there had been words between the two ladies themselves on the subject of religionas to which probably there was no valid foundation it being an ascertained fact that the two maids who were employed by mrs roden were never known to tell anything of their mistress  it was decided at holloway that mrs roden and mrs vincent were cousins they were like enough in face and near enough in age to have been sisters but old mrs demijohn of no 10 paradise row had declared that had george been a nephew his aunt would not have wearied in her endeavour to convert him in such a case there would have been intimacy in spite of disapproval but a first cousin once removed might be allowed to go to the mischief in his own way mrs vincent was supposed to be the elder cousinperhaps three or four years the elderand to have therefore something of an authority but not much she was stouter too less careful to hide what grey hairs years might have produced and showing manifestly by the nature of her bonnets and shawls that she despised the vanities of the world not but that she was always handsomely dressed as mrs demijohn was very well aware less than a hundred a year could not have clothed mrs vincent whereas mrs roden as all the world perceived did not spend half the money but who does not know that a lady may repudiate vanity in rich silks and cultivate the world in woollen stuffs or even in calico nothing was more certain to mrs demijohn than that mrs vincent was severe and that mrs roden was soft and gentle it was assumed also that the two ladies were widows as no husband or sign of a husband had appeared on the scene mrs vincent showed manifestly from her deportment as well as from her title that she had been a married woman as to mrs roden of course there was no doubt  in regard to all this the reader may take the settled opinions of mrs demijohn and of holloway as being nearly true riddles may be read very accurately by those who will give sufficient attention and ample time to the reading of them they who will devote twelve hours a day to the unravelling of acrostics may discover nearly all the enigmas of a weekly newspaper with a separate editor for such difficulties mrs demijohn had almost arrived at the facts the two ladies were second cousins mrs vincent was a widow was religious was austere was fairly well off and had quarrelled altogether with her distant relative george of the post office mrs roden though she went to church was not so well given to religious observances as her cousin would have her hence words had come which mrs roden had borne with equanimity but had received without effect nevertheless the two women loved each other dearly and it was a great part of the life of each of them that these weekly visits should be made there was one great fact as to which mrs demijohn and holloway were in the wrong mrs roden was not a widow  it was not till the kingsburys had left london that george told his mother of his engagement she was well acquainted with his intimacy with lord hampstead and knew that he had been staying at hendon hall with the kingsbury family there had been no reticence between the mother and son as to these people in regard to whom she had frequently cautioned him that there was danger in such associations with people moving altogether in a different sphere in answer to this the son had always declared that he did not see the danger he had not run after lord hampstead circumstances had thrown them together they had originally met each other in a small political debating society and gradually friendship had grown the lord had sought him and not he the lord that according to his own idea had been right difference in rank difference in wealth difference in social regard required as much as that he when he had discovered who was the young man whom he had met stood off somewhat and allowed the friendship to spring from the other side he had been slow to accept favoureven at first to accept hospitality but whenever the ice had as he said been thoroughly broken then he thought that there was no reason why they should not pull each other out of the cold water together as for danger what was there to fear the marchioness would not like it very probably the marchioness was not very much to hampstead and was nothing at all to him the marquis would not really like it perhaps not but in choosing a friend a young man is not supposed to follow altogether his fathers likingsmuch less need the chosen friend follow them but the marquis as george pointed out to his mother was hardly more like other marquises than the son was like other marquiss sons there was a radical strain in the family as was made clear by that tailor who was still sitting for the borough of edgeware mrs roden however though she lived so much alone seeing hardly anything of the world except as mrs vincent might be supposed to represent the world had learned that the feelings and political convictions of the marquis were hardly what they had been before he had married his present wife you may be sure george she had said that like to like is as safe a motto for friendship as it is for love  not a doubt mother he replied but before you act upon it you must define like what makes two men likeor a man and a woman  outside circumstances of the world more than anything else she answered boldly  i would fancy that the inside circumstances of the mind would have more to do with it she shook her head at him pleasantly softly and lovinglybut still with a settled purpose of contradiction i have admitted all along he continued that low birth  i have said nothing of low birth here was a point on which there did not exist full confidence between the mother and son but in regard to which the mother was always attempting to reassure the son while he would assume something against himself which she would not allow to pass without an attempt of faint denial  that birth low by comparison he continued going on with his sentence should not take upon itself as much as may be allowed to nobility by descent is certain though the young prince may be superior in his gifts to the young shoeblack and would best show his princeliness by cultivating the shoeblack still the shoeblack should wait to be cultivated the world has created a state of things in which the shoeblack cannot do otherwise without showing an arrogance and impudence by which he could achieve nothing  which too would make him black his shoes very badly  no doubt that will have to come to pass any way because the nobler employments to which he will be raised by the appreciating prince will cause him to drop his shoes  is lord hampstead to cause you to drop the post office  not at all he is not a prince nor am i a shoeblack though we are far apart we are not so far apart as to make such a change essential to our acquaintance but i was saying i dont know what i was saying  you were defining what like means but people always get muddled when they attempt definitions said the mother  though it depends somewhat on externals it has more to do with internals that is what i mean a man and woman might live together with most enduring love though one had been noble and wealthy and the other poor and a nobody but a thorough brute and a human being of fine conditions can hardly live together and love each other  that is true she said that i fear is true  i hope it is true  it has often to be tried generally to the great detriment of the better nature  all this however had been said before george roden had spoken a word to lady frances and had referred only to the friendship as it was growing between her son and the young lord  the young lord had come on various occasions to the house at holloway and had there made himself thoroughly pleasant to his friends mother lord hampstead had a way of making himself pleasant in which he never failed when he chose to exercise it and he did exercise it almost alwaysalways indeed unless he was driven to be courteously disagreeable by opposition to his own peculiar opinion in shooting fishing and other occupations not approved of he would fall into a line of argument seemingly and indeed truly goodhumoured which was apt however to be aggravating to his opponent in this way he would make himself thoroughly odious to his stepmother with whom he had not one sentiment in common in other respects his manners were invariably sweet with an assumption of intimacy which was not unbecoming and thus he had greatly recommended himself to mrs roden who does not know the fashion in which the normal young man conducts himself when he is making a morning call he has come there because he means to be civil he would not be there unless he wished to make himself popular he is carrying out some recognized purpose of society he would fain be agreeable if it were possible he would enjoy the moment if he could but it is clearly his conviction that he is bound to get through a certain amount of altogether uninteresting conversation and then to get himself out of the room with as little awkwardness as may be unless there be a pretty girl and chance favour him with her special companionship he does not for a moment suppose that any social pleasure is to be enjoyed that rational amusement can be got out of talking to mrs jones does not enter into his mind and yet mrs jones is probably a fair specimen of that general society in which every one wishes to mingle society is to him generally made up of several parts each of which is a pain though the total is deemed to be desirable the pretty girl episode is no doubt an exceptionthough that also has its pains when matter for conversation does not come readily or when conversation coming too readily is rebuked the morning call may be regarded as a period of unmitigated agony now it has to be asserted on lord hampsteads behalf that he could talk with almost any mrs jones freely and pleasantly while he remained and take his departure without that dislocating struggle which is too common he would make himself at ease and discourse as though he had known the lady all his life there is nothing which a woman likes so much as this and by doing this lord hampstead had done much if not to overcome at any rate to quiet the sense of danger of which mrs roden had spoken  but this refers to a time in which nothing was known at holloway as to lady frances very little had been said of the family between the mother and son of the marquis george roden had wished to think well but had hardly succeeded of the stepmother he had never even wished to do so she had from the first been known to him as a woman thoroughly wedded to aristocratic prejudiceswho regarded herself as endowed with certain privileges which made her altogether superior to other human beings hampstead himself could not even pretend to respect her of her roden had said very little to his mother simply speaking of her as the marchioness who was in no way related to hampstead of lady frances he had simply said that there was a girl there endowed with such a spirit that of all girls of her class she must surely be the best and noblest then his mother had shuddered inwardly thinking that here too there might be possible danger but she had shrunk from speaking of the special danger even to her son  how has the visit gone mrs roden asked when her son had already been some hours in the house this was after that last visit to hendon hall in which lady frances had promised to become his wife  pretty well taking it altogether  i know that something has disappointed you  no indeed nothing i have been somewhat abashed  what have they said to you she asked  very little but what was kindjust one word at the last  something i know has hurt you said the mother  lady kingsbury has made me aware that she dislikes me thoroughly it is very odd how one person can do that to another almost without a word spoken  i told you george that there would be danger in going there  there would be no danger in that if there were nothing more  what more is there then  there would be no danger in that if lady kingsbury was simply hampsteads stepmother  what more is she  she is stepmother also to lady frances oh mother  george what has happened she asked  i have asked lady frances to be my wife  your wife  and she has promised  oh george  yes indeed mother now you can perceive that she indeed may be a danger when i think of the power of tormenting her stepdaughter which may rest in her hands i can hardly forgive myself for doing as i have done  and the marquis asked the mother  i know nothing as yet as to what his feelings may be i have had no opportunity of speaking to him since the little occurrence took place a word escaped me an unthoughtof word which her ladyship overheard and for which she rebuked me then i left the house  what word  just a common word of greeting a word that would be common among dear friends but which coming from me to her told all the story i forgot the prefix which was due from such a one as i am to such as she is i can understand with what horror i must henceforward be regarded by lady kingsbury  what will the marquis say  i shall be a horror to him alsoan unutterable horror the idea of contact so vile will cure him at once of all his little radical longings  and hampstead  nothing i think can cure hampstead of his convictionsbut even he is not well pleased  has he quarrelled with you  no not that he is too noble to quarrel on such offence he is too noble even to take offence on such a cause but he refuses to believe that good will come of it and you mother  oh george i doubt i doubt  you will not congratulate me  what am i to say i fear more than i can hope  when i tell you that she is noble at all points noble in heart noble in beauty noble in that dignity which a woman should always carry with her that she is as sweet a creature as god ever created to bless a man with will you not then congratulate me  i would her birth were other than it is said the mother  i would have her altered in nothing said the son her birth is the smallest thing about her but such as she is i would have her altered in nothing     chapter vi  paradise row   about a fortnight after george rodens return to hollowaya fortnight passed by the mother in meditation as to her sons glorious but dangerous lovelord hampstead called at no 11 paradise row mrs roden lived at no 11 and mrs demijohn lived at no 10 the house opposite there had already been some discussion in holloway about lord hampstead but nothing had as yet been discovered he might have been at the house on various previous occasions but had come in so unpretending a manner as hardly to have done more than to cause himself to be regarded as a stranger in holloway he was known to be georges friend because he had been first seen coming with george on a saturday afternoon he had also called on a sunday and walked away down the row with george mrs demijohn concluded that he was a brother clerk in the post office and had expressed an opinion that it did not signify meaning thereby to imply that holloway need not interest itself about the stranger a young government clerk would naturally have another young government clerk for his friend twice lord hampstead had come down in an omnibus from islington on which occasion it was remarked that as he did not come on saturday there must be something wrong a clerk with saturday halfholidays ought not to be away from his work on mondays and tuesdays mrs duffer who was regarded in paradise row as being very inferior to mrs demijohn suggested that the young man might perhaps not be a post office clerk this however was ridiculed where should a post office clerk find his friends except among post office clerks perhaps he is coming after the widow suggested mrs duffer but this also was received with dissent mrs demijohn declared that post office clerks knew better than to marry widows with no more than two or three hundred a year and old enough to be their mothers but why does he come on a tuesday asked mrs duffer and why does he come alone oh you dear old mrs duffer said clara demijohn the old ladys niece naturally thinking that it might not be unnatural that handsome young men should come to paradise row  all this however had been as nothing to what occurred in the row on the occasion which is now about to be described  aunt jemima exclaimed clara demijohn looking out of the window theres that young man come again to number eleven riding on horseback with a groom behind to hold him  groom to hold him exclaimed mrs demijohn jumping with all her rheumatism quickly from her seat and trotting to the window  you look if there aintwith boots and breeches  it must be another said mrs demijohn after a pause during which she had been looking intently at the empty saddle of the horse which the groom was leading slowly up and down the row  its the same that came with young roden that saturday said clara only he hadnt been walking and he looked nicer than ever  you can hire them all horses and groom said mrs demijohn but hed never make his money last till the end of the month if he went on in that way  they aint hired theyre his own said clara  how do you know miss  by the colour of his boots and the way he touched his hat and because his gloves are clean he aint a post office clerk at all aunt jemima  i wonder whether he can be coming after the widow said mrs demijohn after this clara escaped out of the room leaving her aunt fixed at the window such a sight as that groom and those two horses moving up and down together had never been seen in the row before clara put on her hat and ran across hurriedly to mrs duffer who lived at no 15 next door but one to mrs roden but she was altogether too late to communicate the news as news  i knew he wasnt a post office clerk said mrs duffer who had seen lord hampstead ride up the street but who he is or why or wherefore it is beyond me to conjecture but i never will give up my opinion again talking to your aunt i suppose she holds out still that hes a post office clerk  she thinks he might have hired them  oh my hired them  but did you ever see anything so noble as the way he got off his horse as for hire thats nonsense hes been getting off that horse every day of his life thus it was that paradise row was awestricken by this last coming of george rodens friend  it was an odd thing to dothis riding down to holloway no one else would have done it either lord or post office clerkwith a hired horse or with private property there was a hot july sunshine and the roads across from hendon hall consisted chiefly of paved streets but lord hampstead always did things as others would not do them it was too far to walk in the midday sun and therefore he rode there would be no servant at mrs rodens house to hold his horse and therefore he brought one of his own he did not see why a man on horseback should attract more attention at holloway than at hyde park corner had he guessed the effect which he and his horse would have had in paradise row he would have come by some other means  mrs roden at first received him with considerable embarrassmentwhich he probably observed but in speaking to her seemed not to observe very hot indeed he saidtoo hot for riding as i found soon after i started i suppose george has given up walking for the present  he still walks home i think  if he had declared his purpose of doing so hed go on though he had sunstroke every afternoon  i hope he is not so obstinate as that my lord  the most obstinate fellow i ever knew in my life though the world were to come to an end hed let it come rather than change his purpose its all very well for a man to keep his purpose but he may overdo it  has he been very determined lately in anything  nonothing particular i havent seen him for the last week i want him to come over and dine with me at hendon one of these days im all alone there from this mrs roden learnt that lord hampstead at any rate did not intend to quarrel with her son and she learnt also that lady frances was no longer staying at the hall i can send him home continued the lord if he can manage to come down by the railway or the omnibus  i will give him your message my lord  tell him i start on the 21st my yacht is at cowes and i shall go down there on that morning i shall be away heaven knows how longprobably for a month vivian will be with me and we mean to bask away our time in the norway and iceland seas till he goes like an idiot that he is to his grouseshooting i should like to see george before i start i said that i was all alone but vivian will be with me george has met him before and as they didnt cut each others throats then i suppose they wont now  i will tell him all that said mrs roden  then there was a pause for a moment after which lord hampstead went on in an altered voice has he said anything to you since he was at hendonas to my family i mean  he has told me something  i was sure he had i should not have asked unless i had been quite sure i know that he would tell you anything of that kind well  what am i to say lord hampstead  what has he told you mrs roden  he has spoken to me of your sister  but what has he said  that he loves her  and that she loves him  that he hopes so  he has said more than that i take it they have engaged themselves to each other  so i understand  what do you think of it mrs roden  what can i think of it lord hampstead i hardly dare to think of it at all  was it wise  i suppose where love is concerned wisdom is not much considered  but people have to consider it i hardly know how to think of it to my idea it was not wise and yet there is no one living whom i esteem so much as your son  you are very good my lord  there is no goodness in itany more than in his liking for me but i can indulge my fancy without doing harm to others lady kingsbury thinks that i am an idiot because i do not live exclusively with counts and countesses but in declining to take her advice i do not injure her much she can talk about me and my infatuations among her friends with a smile she will not be tortured by any feeling of disgrace so with my father he has an idea that i am outheroding herod he having been herodbut there is nothing bitter in it to him those fine young gentlemen my brothers who are the dearest little chicks in the world five and six and seven years old will be able to laugh pleasantly at their elder brother when they grow up as they will do among the other idle young swells of the nation that their brother and george roden should be always together will not even vex them they may probably receive some benefit themselves may achieve some diminution of the folly natural to their position by their advantage in knowing him in looking at it all round as far as that goes there is not only satisfaction to me but a certain pride i am doing no more than i have a right to do whatever counterinfluence i may introduce among my own people will be good and wholesome do you understand me mrs roden  i think sovery clearly i should be dull if i did not  but it becomes different when ones sister is concerned i am thinking of the happiness of other people  she i suppose will think of her own  not exclusively i hope  no not that i am sure but a girl when she loves  yes that is all true but a girl situated like frances is bound not tonot to sacrifice those with whom fame and fortune have connected her i can speak plainly to you mrs roden because you know what are my own opinions about many things  george has no sister no girl belonging to him but if he had and you loved her would you abstain from marrying her lest you should sacrifice yourconnections  the word has offended you  not in the least it is a word true to the purpose in hand i understand the sacrifice you mean lady kingsburys feelings would besacrificed were her daughtereven her stepdaughterto become my boys husband she supposes that her girls birth is superior to my boys  there are so many meanings to that word birth  i will take it all as you mean lord hampstead and will not be offended my boy as he is is no match for your sister both lord and lady kingsbury would think that there had beena sacrifice it might be that those little lords would not in future years be wont to talk at their club of their brotherinlaw the post office clerk as they would of some earl or some duke with whom they might have become connected let us pass it by and acknowledge that there would bea sacrifice so there will be should you marry below your degree the sacrifice would be greater because it would be carried on to some future marquis of kingsbury would you practise such selfdenial as that you demand from your sister  lord hampstead considered the matter a while and then answered the question i do not think that the two cases would be quite analogous  where is the difference  there is something more delicate more nice requiring greater caution in the conduct of a girl than of a man  quite so lord hampstead where conduct is in question the girl is bound to submit to stricter laws i may explain that by saying that the girl is lost for ever who gives herself up to unlawful lovewhereas for the man the way back to the worlds respect is only too easy even should he on that score have lost aught of the worlds respect the same law runs through every act of a girls life as contrasted with the acts of men but in this actthe act now supposed of marrying a gentleman whom she lovesyour sister would do nothing which should exclude her from the respect of good men or the society of wellordered ladies i do not say that the marriage would be wellassorted i do not recommend it though my boys heart is dearer to me than anything else can be in the world i can see that it may be fit that his heart should be made to suffer but when you talk of the sacrifice which he and your sister are called on to make so that others should be delivered from lesser sacrifices i think you should ask what duty would require from yourself i do not think she would sacrifice the noble blood of the traffords more effectually than you would by a similar marriage as she thus spoke she leant forward from her chair on the table and looked him full in the face and he felt as she did so that she was singularly handsome greatly gifted a woman noble to the eye and to the ear she was pleading for her sonand he knew that but she had condescended to use no mean argument  if you will say that such a law is dominant among your class and that it is one to which you would submit yourself i will not repudiate it but you shall not induce me to consent to it by even a false idea as to the softer delicacy of the sex that softer delicacy with its privileges and duties shall be made to stand for what it is worth and to occupy its real ground if you use it for other mock purposes then i will quarrel with you it was thus that she had spoken and he understood it all  i am not brought in question he said slowly  cannot you put it to yourself as though you were brought in question you will at any rate admit that my argument is just  i hardly know i must think of it such a marriage on my part would not outrage my stepmother as would that of my sister  outrage you speak lord hampstead as though your mother would think that your sister would have disgraced herself as a woman  i am speaking of her feelingsnot of mine it would be different were i to marry in the same degree  would it then i think that perhaps i had better counsel george not to go to hendon hall  my sister is not there they are all in germany  he had better not go where your sister will be thought of  i would not quarrel with your son for all the world  it will be better that you should do not suppose that i am pleading for him that however was what he did suppose and that was what she was doing i have told him already that i think that the prejudices will be too hard for him and that he had better give it up before he adds to his own misery and perhaps to hers what i have said has not been in the way of pleadingbut only as showing the ground on which i think that such a marriage would be inexpedient it is not that we or our sister are too bad or too low for such contact but that you on your side are not as yet good enough or high enough  i will not dispute that with you mrs roden but you will give him my message  yes i will give him your message  then lord hampstead having spent a full hour in the house took his departure and rode away  just an hour said clara demijohn who was still looking out of mrs duffers window what can they have been talking about  i think he must be making up to the widow said mrs duffer who was so lost in surprise as to be unable to suggest any new idea  hed never have come with saddle horses to do that she wouldnt be taken by a young man spending his money in that fashion shed like saving ways better but theyre his own horses and his own man and hes no more after the widow than hes after me said clara laughing  i wish he were my dear  there may be as good as him come yet mrs duffer i dont think so much of their having horses and grooms when they have these things they cant afford to have wives tooand sometimes they cant afford to pay for either then having seen the last of lord hampstead as he rode out of the row she went back to her mothers house  but mrs demijohn had been making use of her time while clara and mrs duffer had been wasting theirs in mere gazing and making vain surmises as soon as she found herself alone the old woman got her bonnet and shawl and going out slily into the row made her way down to the end of the street in the direction opposite to that in which the groom was at that moment walking the horses there she escaped the eyes of her niece and of the neighbours and was enabled to wait unseen till the man in his walking came down to the spot at which she was standing my young man she said in her most winning voice when the groom came near her  what is it mum  youd like a glass of beer wouldnt youafter walking up and down so long  no i wouldnt not just at present he knew whom he served and from whom it would become him to take beer  id be happy to pay for a pint said mrs demijohn fingering a fourpenny bit so that he might see it  thankye mum no i takes it reglar when i takes it im on dooty just at present  your masters horses i suppose  whose else mum his lordship dont ride generally nobodys orses but his own  here was a success and the fourpenny bit saved his lordship of course not said mrs demijohn why should he  why indeed mum  lord lordlord who is he  the groom poked up his hat and scratched his head and bethought himself a servant generally wishes to do what honour he can to his master this man had no desire to gratify an inquisitive old woman but he thought it derogatory to his master and to himself to seem to deny their joint name ampstead he said looking down very serenely on the lady and then moved on not wasting another word  i knew all along they were something out of the common way said mrs demijohn as soon as her niece came in  you havent found out who it is aunt  youve been with mrs duffer i suppose you twod put your heads together for a week and then would know nothing it was not till quite the last thing at night that she told her secret he was a peer he was lord ampstead  a peer  he was lord ampstead i tell you said mrs demijohn  i dont believe there is such a lord said clara as she took herself up to bed     chapter vii  the post office   when george roden came home that evening the matter was discussed between him and his mother at great length she was eager with him if not to abandon his love at any rate to understand how impossible it was that he should marry lady frances she was very tender with him full of feeling full of compassion and sympathy but she was persistent in declaring that no good could come from such an engagement but he would not be deterred in the least from his resolution nor would he accept it as possible that he should be turned from his object by the wishes of any person as long as lady frances was true to him you speak as if daughters were slaves he said  so they are so women must beslaves to the conventions of the world a young woman can hardly run counter to her family on a question of marriage she may be persistent enough to overcome objections but that will be because the objections themselves are not strong enough to stand against her but here the objections will be very strong  we will see mother he said she who knew him well perceived that it would be vain to talk to him further  oh yes he said i will go out to hendon perhaps on sunday that mr vivian is a pleasant fellow and as hampstead does not wish to quarrel with me i certainly will not quarrel with him  roden was generally popular at his office and had contrived to make his occupation there pleasant to himself and interesting but he had his little troubles as will happen to most men in all walks of life his came to him chiefly from the illmanners of a fellowclerk who sat in the same room with him and at the same desk there were five who occupied the apartment an elderly gentleman and four youngsters the elderly gentleman was a quiet civil dull old man who never made himself disagreeable and was content to put up with the frivolities of youth if they did not become too uproarious or antagonistic to discipline when they did he had but one word of rebuke mr crocker i will not have it beyond that he had never been known to go in the way either of reporting the misconduct of his subordinates to other superior powers or in quarrelling with the young men himself even with mr crocker who no doubt was troublesome he contrived to maintain terms of outward friendship his name was jerningham and next to mr jerningham in age came mr crocker by whose illtimed witticisms our george roden was not unfrequently made to suffer this had sometimes gone so far that roden had contemplated the necessity of desiring mr crocker to assume that a bond of enmity had been established between themor in other words that they were not to speak except on official subjects but there had been an air of importance about such a proceeding of which crocker hardly seemed to be worthy and roden had abstained putting off the evil hour from day to day but still conscious that he must do something to stop vulgarities which were distasteful to him  the two other young men mr bobbin and mr geraghty who sat at a table by themselves and were the two junior clerks in that branch of the office were pleasant and goodhumoured enough they were both young and as yet not very useful to the queen they were apt to come late to their office and impatient to leave it when the hour of four drew nigh there would sometimes come a storm through the department moved by an unseen but powerful and unsatisfied Æolus in which bobbin and geraghty would be threatened to be blown into infinite space minutes would be written and rumours spread about punishments would be inflicted and it would be given to be understood that now one and then the other would certainly have to return to his disconsolate family at the very next offence there was a question at this very moment whether geraghty who had come from the sister island about twelve months since should not be returned to kings county no doubt he had passed the civil service examiners with distinguished applause but Æolus hated the young crichtons who came to him with full marks and had declared that geraghty though no doubt a linguist a philosopher and a mathematician was not worth his salt as a post office clerk but he and bobbin also were protected by mr jerningham and were well liked by george roden  that roden was intimate with lord hampstead had become known to his fellowclerks the knowledge of this association acted somewhat to his advantage and somewhat to his injury his daily companions could not but feel a reflected honour in their own intimacy with the friend of the eldest son of a marquis and were anxious to stand well with one who lived in such high society such was naturalbut it was natural also that envy should show itself in ridicule and that the lord should be thrown in the clerks teeth when the clerk should be deemed to have given offence crocker when it first became certain that roden passed much of his time in company with a young lord had been anxious enough to foregather with the fortunate youth who sat opposite to him but roden had not cared much for crockers society and hence it had come to pass that crocker had devoted himself to jeers and witticisms mr jerningham who in his very soul respected a marquis and felt something of genuine awe for anything that touched the peerage held his fortunate junior in unfeigned esteem from the moment in which he became aware of the intimacy he did in truth think better of the clerk because the clerk had known how to make himself a companion to a lord he did not want anything for himself he was too old and settled in life to be desirous of new friendships he was naturally conscientious gentle and unassuming but roden rose in his estimation and crocker fell when he became assured that roden and lord hampstead were intimate friends and that crocker had dared to jeer at the friendship a lord is like a new hat the one on the arm the other on the head are no evidences of mental superiority but yet they are taken and not incorrectly taken as signs of merit the increased esteem shown by mr jerningham for roden should i think be taken as showing mr jerninghams good sense and general appreciation  the two lads were both on rodens side roden was not a rose but he lived with a rose and the lads of course liked the scent of roses they did not particularly like crocker though crocker had a dash about him which would sometimes win their flattery crocker was brave and impudent and selfassuming they were not as yet sufficiently advanced in life to be able to despise crocker crocker imposed upon them but should there come anything of real warfare between crocker and roden there could be no doubt but that they would side with lord hampsteads friend such was the state of the room at the post office when crocker entered it on the morning of lord hampsteads visit to paradise row  crocker was a little late he was often a little latea fact of which mr jerningham ought to have taken more stringent notice than he did perhaps mr jerningham rather feared crocker crocker had so read mr jerninghams character as to have become aware that his senior was soft and perhaps timid he had so far advanced in this reading as to have learned to think that he could get the better of mr jerningham by being loud and impudent he had no doubt hitherto been successful but there were those in the office who believed that the day might come when mr jerningham would rouse himself in his wrath  mr crocker you are late said mr jerningham  mr jerningham i am late i scorn false excuses geraghty would say that his watch was wrong bobbin would have eaten something that had disagreed with him roden would have been detained by his friend lord hampstead to this roden made no reply even by a look for me i have to acknowledge that i did not turn out when i was called of twenty minutes i have deprived my country but as my country values so much of my time at only sevenpencehalfpenny it is hardly worth saying much about it  you are frequently late  when the amount has come up to ten pound i will send the postmastergeneral stamps to that amount he was now standing at his desk opposite to roden to whom he made a low bow mr george roden he said i hope that his lordship is quite well  the only lord with whom i am acquainted is quite well but i do not know why you should trouble yourself about him  i think it becoming in one who takes the queens pay to show a becoming anxiety as to the queens aristocracy i have the greatest respect for the marquis of kingsbury have not you mr jerningham  certainly i have but if you would go to your work instead of talking so much it would be better for everybody  i am at my work already do you think that i cannot work and talk at the same time bobbin my boy if you would open that window do you think it would hurt your complexion bobbin opened the window paddy where were you last night paddy was mr geraghty  i was dining then with my sisters motherinlaw  whatthe okelly the great legislator and home ruler whom his country so loves and parliament so hates i dont think any home rulers relative ought to be allowed into the service do you mr jerningham  i think mr geraghty if he will only be a little more careful will do great credit to the service said mr jerningham  i hope that Æolus may think the same Æolus was the name by which a certain pundit was known at the officea violent and imperious secretary but not in the main illnatured Æolus when last i heard of his opinion seemed to have his doubts about poor paddy this was a disagreeable subject and it was felt by them all that it might better be left in silence from that time the work of the day was continued with no more than moderate interruptions till the hour of luncheon when the usual attendant entered with the usual muttonchops i wonder if lord hampstead has muttonchops for luncheon asked crocker  why should he not asked mr jerningham foolishly  there must be some kind of gilded cutlet upon which the higher members of the aristocracy regale themselves i suppose roden you must have seen his lordship at lunch  i dare say i have said roden angrily he knew that he was annoyed and was angry with himself at his own annoyance  are they golden or only gilded asked crocker  i believe you mean to make yourself disagreeable said the other  quite the reverse i mean to make myself agreeableonly you have soared so high of late that ordinary conversation has no charms for you is there any reason why lord hampsteads lunch should not be mentioned  certainly there is said roden  then upon my life i cannot see it if you talked of my midday chop i should not take it amiss  i dont think a fellow should ever talk about another fellows eating unless he knows the fellow this came from bobbin who intended it well meaning to fight the battle for roden as well as he knew how  most sapient bobb said crocker you seem to be unaware that one young fellow who is roden happens to be the peculiarly intimate friend of the other fellow who is the earl of hampstead therefore the law as so clearly laid down by yourself has not been infringed to return to our muttons as the frenchman says what sort of lunch does his lordship eat  you are determined to make yourself disagreeable said roden  i appeal to mr jerningham whether i have said anything unbecoming  if you appeal to me i think you have said mr jerningham  you have at any rate been so successful in doing it continued roden that i must ask you to hold your tongue about lord hampstead it has not been by anything i have said that you have heard of my acquaintance with him the joke is a bad one and will become vulgar if repeated  vulgar cried crocker pushing away his plate and rising from his chair  i mean ungentlemanlike i dont want to use hard words but i will not allow myself to be annoyed  hoity toity said crocker heres a row because i made a chance allusion to a noble lord i am to be called vulgar because i mentioned his name then he began to whistle  mr crocker i will not have it said mr jerningham assuming his most angry tone you make more noise in the room than all the others put together  nevertheless i do wonder what lord hampstead has had for his lunch this was the last shot and after that the five gentlemen did in truth settle down to their afternoons work  when four oclock came mr jerningham with praiseworthy punctuality took his hat and departed his wife and three unmarried daughters were waiting for him at islington and as he was always in his seat punctually at ten he was justified in leaving it punctually at four crocker swaggered about the room for a minute or two with his hat on desirous of showing that he was by no means affected by the rebukes which he had received but he too soon went not having summoned courage to recur to the name of rodens noble friend the two lads remained for the sake of saying a word of comfort to roden who still sat writing at his desk i thought it was very low form said bobbin crocker going on like that  crockers a baist said geraghty  what was it to him what anybody eats for his lunch continued bobbin  only he likes to have a noblemans name in his mouth said geraghty i think its the hoighth of bad manners talking about anybodys friends unless you happen to know them yourself  i think it is said roden looking up from his desk but ill tell you what shows worse mannersthat is a desire to annoy anybody crocker likes to be funny and he thinks there is no fun so good as what he calls taking a rise i dont know that im very fond of crocker but it may be as well that we should all think no more about it upon this the young men promised that they at least would think no more about it and then took their departure george roden soon followed them for it was not the practice of anybody in that department to remain at work long after four oclock  roden as he walked home did think more of the little affair than it deservedmore at least than he would acknowledge that it deserved he was angry with himself for bearing it in mind and yet he did bear it in mind could it be that a creature so insignificant as crocker could annoy him by a mere word or two but he was annoyed and did not know how such annoyance could be made to cease if the man would continue to talk about lord hampstead there was nothing by which he could be made to hold his tongue he could not be kicked or beaten or turned out of the room for any purpose of real assistance mr jerningham was useless as to complaining to the Æolus of the office that a certain clerk would talk about lord hampstead that of course was out of the question he had already used strong language calling the man vulgar and ungentlemanlike but if a man does not regard strong language what further can an angry victim do to him  then his thoughts passed on to his connexion with the marquis of kingsburys family generally had he not done wrong at any rate done foolishly in thus moving himself out of his own sphere at the present moment lady frances was nearer to him even than lord hampsteadwas more important to him and more in his thoughts was it not certain that he would give rise to misery rather than to happiness by what had occurred between him and lady frances was it not probable that he had embittered for her all the life of the lady whom he loved he had assumed an assured face and a confident smile while declaring to his mother that no power on earth should stand between him and his promised wifethat she would be able to walk out from her fathers hall and marry him as certainly as might the housemaid or the ploughmans daughter go to her lover but what would be achieved by that if she were to walk out only to encounter misery the country was so constituted that he and these traffords were in truth of a different race as much so as the negro is different from the white man the post office clerk may indeed possibly become a duke whereas the negros skin cannot be washed white but while he and lady frances were as they were the distance between them was so great that no approach could be made between them without disruption the world might be wrong in this to his thinking the world was wrong but while the facts existed they were too strong to be set aside he could do his duty to the world by struggling to propagate his own opinions so that the distance might be a little lessened in his own time he was sure that the distance was being lessened and with this he thought that he ought to have been contented the jeering of such a one as crocker was unimportant though disagreeable but it sufficed to show the feeling such a friendship as his with lord hampstead had appeared to crocker to be ridiculous crocker would not have seen the absurdity unless others had seen it also even his own mother saw it here in england it was accounted so foolish a thing that he a post office clerk should be hand and glove with such a one as lord hampstead that even a crocker could raise a laugh against him what would the world say when it should have become known that he intended to lead lady frances to the hymeneal altar as he repeated the words to himself there was something ridiculous even to himself in the idea that the hymeneal altar should ever be mentioned in reference to the adventures of such a person as george roden the post office clerk thinking of all this he was not in a happy frame of mind when he reached his home in paradise row     chapter viii  mr greenwood   roden spent a pleasant evening with his friend and his friends friend at hendon hall before their departure for the yachtduring which not a word was said or an allusion made to lady frances the day was sunday july 20th the weather was very hot and the two young men were delighted at the idea of getting away to the cool breezes of the northern seas vivian also was a clerk in the public service but he was a clerk very far removed in his position from that filled by george roden he was attached to the foreign office and was junior private secretary to lord persiflage who was secretary of state at that moment lord persiflage and our marquis had married sisters vivian was distantly related to the two ladies and hence the young men had become friends as lord hampstead and roden had been drawn together by similarity of opinion so had lord hampstead and vivian by the reverse hampstead could always produce vivian in proof that he was not in truth opposed to his own order vivian was one who proclaimed his great liking for things as he found them it was a thousand pities that any one should be hungry but for himself he liked truffles ortolans and all good things if there was any injustice in the world he was not responsible and if there was any injustice he had not been the gainer seeing that he was a younger brother to him all hampsteads theories were sheer rhodomontade there was the world and men had got to live in it as best they might he intended to do so and as he liked yachting and liked grouseshooting he was very glad to have arranged with lord persiflage and his brother private secretary so as to be able to get out of town for the next two months he was member of halfadozen clubs could always go to his brothers country house if nothing more inviting offered dined out in london four or five days a week and considered himself a thoroughly useful member of society in that he condescended to write letters for lord persiflage he was pleasant in his manners to all men and had accommodated himself to roden as well as though rodens office had also been in downing street instead of the city  yes grouse he said after dinner if anything better can be invented ill go and do it american bears are a myth you may get one in three years and as far as i can hear very poor fun it is when you get it lions are a grind elephants are as big as a haystack pigsticking may be very well but youve got to go to india and if youre a poor foreign office clerk you havent got either the time or the money  you speak as though killing something were a necessity said roden  so it is unless somebody can invent something better i hate races where a fellow has nothing to do with himself when he cant afford to bet i dont mean to take to cards for the next ten years i have never been up in a balloon spooning is good fun but it comes to an end so soon one way or another girls are so wideawake that they wont spoon for nothing upon the whole i dont see what a fellow is to do unless he kills something  you wont have much to kill on board the yacht said roden  fishing without end in iceland and norway i knew a man who killed a ton of trout out of an iceland lake he had to pack himself up very closely in tightfitting nets or the midges would have eaten him and the skin came off his nose and ears from the sun but he liked that rather than not and he killed his ton of trout  who weighed them asked hampstead  how well you may know a utilitarian by the nature of his questions if a man doesnt kill his ton all out he can say he did which is the next best thing to it  are you taking closepacking nets with you roden asked  well no hampstead would be too impatient and the free trader isnt big enough to bring away the fish but i dont mind betting a sovereign that i kill something every day im outbarring sundays  not a word was said about lady frances although there were a few moments in which roden and lord hampstead were alone together roden had made up his mind that he would ask no questions unless the subject were mentioned and did not even allude to any of the family but he learnt in the course of the evening that the marquis had come back from germany with the intention of attending to his parliamentary duties during the remainder of the session  hes going to turn us all out said vivian on the county franchise i suppose  im afraid my father is not so keen about county franchise as he used to be though i hope he will be one of the few to support it in the house of lords if the house of commons ever dares to pass it  in this way roden learnt that the marquis who had carried his daughter off to saxony as soon as he had heard of the engagement had left his charge there and had returned to london as he went home that evening he thought that it would be his duty to go to lord kingsbury and tell him as from himself that which the father had as yet only learnt from his daughter or from his wife he was aware that it behoves a man when he has won a girls heart to go to the father and ask permission to carry on his suit this duty he thought he was bound to perform even though the father were a person so high and mighty as the marquis of kingsbury hitherto any such going was out of his power the marquis had heard the tidings and had immediately caught his daughter up and carried her off to germany it would have been possible to write to him but roden had thought that not in such a way should such a duty be performed now the marquis had come back to london and though the operation would be painful the duty seemed to be paramount on the next day he informed mr jerningham that private business of importance would take him to the west end and asked leave to absent himself the morning had been passed in the room at the post office with more than ordinary silence crocker had been collecting himself for an attack but his courage had hitherto failed him as roden put on his hat and opened the door he fired a parting shot remember me kindly to lord hampstead he said and tell him i hope he enjoyed his cutlets  roden stood for a moment with the door in his hand thinking that he would turn upon the man and rebuke his insolence but at last determined that it would be best to hold his peace  he went direct to park lane thinking that he would probably find the marquis before he left the house after his luncheon he had never been before at the town mansion which was known as kingsbury house and which possessed all the appanages of grandeur which can be given to a london residence as he knocked at the door he acknowledged that he was struck with a certain awe of which he was ashamed having said so much to the daughter surely he should not be afraid to speak to the father but he felt that he could have managed the matter much better had he contrived to have the interview at hendon hall which was much less grand than kingsbury house almost as soon as he knocked the door was opened and he found himself with a powdered footman as well as the porter the powdered footman did not know whether or no my lord was at home he would inquire would the gentleman sit down for a minute or two the gentleman did sit down and waited for what seemed to him to be more than halfanhour the house must be very large indeed if it took the man all this time to look for the marquis he was beginning to think in what way he might best make his escapeas a man is apt to think when delays of this kind prove too long for the patiencebut the man returned and with a cold unfriendly air bade roden to follow him roden was quite sure that some evil was to happen so cold and unfriendly was the manner of the man but still he followed having now no means of escape the man had not said that the marquis would see him had not even given any intimation that the marquis was in the house it was as though he were being led away to execution for having had the impertinence to knock at the door but still he followed he was taken along a passage on the ground floor past numerous doors to what must have been the back of the house and there was shown into a somewhat dingy room that was altogether surrounded by books there he saw an old gentlemanbut the old gentleman was not the marquis of kingsbury  ah eh oh said the old gentleman you i believe are mr george roden  that is my name i had hoped to see lord kingsbury  lord kingsbury has thought it best for all parties thatthatthati should see you that is if anybody should see you my name is greenwoodthe rev mr greenwood i am his lordships chaplain and if i may presume to say so his most attached and sincere friend i have had the honour of a very long connexion with his lordship and have therefore been entrusted by him with thisthisthis delicate duty i had perhaps better call it mr greenwood was a stout short man about sixty years of age with pendant cheeks and pendant chin with a few grey hairs brushed carefully over his head with a good forehead and wellfashioned nose who must have been goodlooking when he was young but that he was too short for manly beauty now in advanced years he had become lethargic and averse to exercise and having grown to be corpulent he had lost whatever he had possessed in height by becoming broad and looked to be a fat dwarf still there would have been something pleasant in his face but for an air of doubt and hesitation which seemed almost to betray cowardice at the present moment he stood in the middle of the room rubbing his hands together and almost trembling as he explained to george roden who he was  i had certainly wished to see his lordship himself said roden  the marquis has thought it better not and i must say that i agree with the marquis at the moment roden hardly knew how to go on with the business in hand i believe i am justified in assuring you that anything you would have said to the marquis you may say to me  am i to understand that lord kingsbury refuses to see me  wellyes at the present crisis he does refuse what can be gained  roden did not as yet know how far he might go in mentioning the name of lady frances to the clergyman but was unwilling to leave the house without some reference to the business he had in hand he was peculiarly averse to leaving an impression that he was afraid to mention what he had done i had to speak to his lordship about his daughter he said  i know i know lady frances i have known lady frances since she was a little child i have the warmest regard for lady francesas i have also for lord hampsteadand for the marchioness and for her three dear little boys lord frederic lord augustus and lord gregory i feel a natural hesitation in calling them my friends because i think that the difference in rank and station which it has pleased the lord to institute should be maintained with all their privileges and all their honours though i have agreed with the marquis through a long life in those political tenets by propagating which he has been ever anxious to improve the condition of the lower classes i am not and have not been on that account less anxious to uphold by any small means which may be in my power those variations in rank to which i think in conjunction with the protestant religion the welfare and high standing of this country are mainly to be attributed having these feelings at my heart very strongly i do not wish particularly on such an occasion as this to seem by even a chance word to diminish the respect which i feel to be due to all the members of a family of a rank so exalted as that which belongs to the family of the marquis of kingsbury putting that aside for a moment i perhaps may venture on this occasion having had confided to me a task so delicate as the present to declare my warm friendship for all who bear the honoured name of trafford i am at any rate entitled to declare myself so far a friend that you may say anything on this delicate subject which you would think it necessary to say to the young ladys father however inexpedient it may be that anything should be said at all i have been instructed by his lordship to hearand to reply  george roden while he was listening to this tedious sermon was standing opposite to the preacher with his hat in his hand having not yet had accorded to him the favour of a seat during the preaching of the sermon the preacher had never ceased to shiver and shake rubbing one fat little clammy hand slowly over the other and apparently afraid to look his audience in the face it seemed to roden as though the words must have been learnt by heart they came so glibly with so much of unction and of earnestness and were in their glibness so strongly opposed to the mans manner there had not been a single word spoken that had not been offensive to roden it seemed to him that they had been chosen because of their offence in all those longwinded sentences about rank in which mr greenwood had expressed his own humility and insufficiency for the position of friend in a family so exalted he had manifestly intended to signify the much more manifest insufficiency of his hearer to fill a place of higher honour even than that of friend had the words come at the spur of the moment the man must thought roden have great gifts for extempore preaching he had thought the time in the hall to be long but it had not been much for the communication of the earls wishes and then for the preparation of all these words it was necessary however that he must make his reply without any preparation  i have come he said to tell lord kingsbury that i am in love with his daughter at hearing this the fat little man held up both his hands in amazementalthough he had already made it clear that he was acquainted with all the circumstances and i should have been bound to add said roden plucking up all his courage that the young lady is also in love with me  ohohoh the hands went higher and higher as these interjections were made  why not is not the truth the best  a young man mr roden should never boast of a young ladys affectionparticularly of such a young ladyparticularly when i cannot admit that it existsparticularly not in her fathers house  nobody should boast of anything mr greenwood i speak of a fact which it is necessary that a father should know if the lady denies the assertion i have done  it is a matter in which delicacy demands that no question shall be put to the young lady after what has occurred it is out of the question that your name should even be mentioned in the young ladys hearing  whyi mean to marry her  meanthis word was shouted in the extremity of mr greenwoods horror mr roden it is my duty to assure you that under no circumstances can you ever see the young lady again  who says so  the marquis says soand the marchionessand her little brothers who with their growing strength will protect her from all harm  i hope their growing strength may not be wanted for any such purpose should it be so i am sure they will not be deficient as brothers at present there could not be much for them to do mr greenwood shook his head he was still standing not having moved an inch from the position in which he had been placed when the door was opened i can understand mr greenwood that any further conversation on the subject between you and me must be quite useless  quite useless said mr greenwood  but it has been necessary for my honour and for my purpose that lord kingsbury should know that i had come to ask him for his daughters hand i had not dared to expect that he would accept my proposal graciously  no no hardly that mr roden  but it was necessary that he should know my purpose from myself he will now no doubt do so he is as i understand you aware of my presence in the house mr greenwood shook his head as though he would say that this was a matter he could not any longer discuss if not i must trouble his lordship with a letter  that will be unnecessary  he does know mr greenwood nodded his head and you will tell him why i have come  the marquis shall be made acquainted with the nature of the interview  roden then turned to leave the room but was obliged to ask mr greenwood to show him the way along the passages this the clergyman did tripping on ahead upon his toes till he had delivered the intruder over to the hall porter having done so he made as it were a valedictory bow and tripped back to his own apartment then roden left the house thinking as he did so that there was certainly much to be done before he could be received there as a welcome soninlaw  as he made his way back to holloway he again considered it all how could there be an end to thisan end that would be satisfactory to himself and to the girl that he loved the aversion expressed to him through the person of mr greenwood was natural it could not but be expected that such a one as the marquis of kingsbury should endeavour to keep his daughter out of the hands of such a suitor if it were only in regard to money would it not be necessary for him to do so every possible barricade would be built up in his way there would be nothing on his side except the girls love for himself was it to be expected that her love would have power to conquer such obstacles as these and if it were would she obtain her own happiness by clinging to it he was aware that in his present position no duty was so incumbent on him as that of looking to the happiness of the woman whom he wished to make his wife     chapter ix  at kÖnigsgraaf   very shortly after this there came a letter from lady frances to paradise rowthe only letter which roden received from her during this period of his courtship a portion of the letter shall be given from which the reader will see that difficulties had arisen at königsgraaf as to their correspondence he had written twice the first letter had in due course reached the young ladys hands having been brought up from the village postoffice in the usual manner and delivered to her without remark by her own maid when the second reached the castle it fell into the hands of the marchioness she had indeed taken steps that it should fall into her hands she was aware that the first letter had come and had been shocked at the idea of such a correspondence she had received no direct authority from her husband on the subject but felt that it was incumbent on herself to take strong steps it must not be that lady frances should receive loveletters from a post office clerk as regarded lady frances herself the marchioness would have been willing enough that the girl should be given over to a lettercarrier if she could be thus got rid of altogetherso that the world should not know that there was or had been a lady frances but the fact was patentas was also that too toosad truth of the existence of a brother older than her own comely bairns as the feeling of hatred grew upon her she continually declared to herself that she would have been as gentle a stepmother as ever loved another womans children had these two known how to bear themselves like the son and daughter of a marquis seeing what they wereand what were her own childrenhow these struggled to repudiate that rank which her own were born to adorn and protect was it not natural that she should hate them and profess that she should wish them to be out of the way they could not be made to get out of the way but lady frances might at any rate be repressed therefore she determined to stop the correspondence  she did stop the second letterand told her daughter that she had done so  papa didnt say i wasnt to have my letters pleaded lady frances  your papa did not suppose for a moment that you would submit to anything so indecent  it is not indecent  i shall make myself the judge of that you are now in my care your papa can do as he likes when he comes back there was a long altercation but it ended in victory on the part of the marchioness the young lady when she was told that if necessary the postmistress in the village should be instructed not to send on any letter addressed to george roden believed in the potency of the threat she felt sure also that she would be unable to get at any letters addressed to herself if the quasiparental authority of the marchioness were used to prevent it she yielded on the condition however that one letter should be sent and the marchioness not at all thinking that her own instructions would have prevailed with the postmistress yielded so far  the tenderness of the letter readers can appreciate and understand without seeing it expressed in words it was very tender full of promises and full of trust then came the short passage in which her own uncomfortable position was explainedyou will understand that there has come one letter which i have not been allowed to see whether mamma has opened it i do not know or whether she has destroyed it though i have not seen it i take it as an assurance of your goodness and truth but it will be useless for you to write more till you hear from me again and i have promised that this for the present shall be my last to you the last and the first i hope you will keep it till you have another in order that you may have something to tell you how well i love you as she sent it from her she did not know how much of solace there was even in the writing of a letter to him she loved nor had she as yet felt how great was the torment of remaining without palpable notice from him she loved  after the episode of the letter life at königsgraaf was very bitter and very dull but few words were spoken between the marchioness and her stepdaughter and those were never friendly in their tone or kindly in their nature even the children were taken out of their sisters way as much as possible so that their morals should not be corrupted by evil communication when she complained of this to their mother the marchioness merely drew herself up and was silent were it possible she would have altogether separated her darlings from contact with their sister not because she thought that the darlings would in truth be injuredas to which she had no fears at all seeing that the darlings were subject to her own influencesbut in order that the punishment to lady frances might be the more complete the circumstances being such as they were there should be no family love no fraternal sports no softnesses no mercy there must she thought have come from the blood of that first wife a stain of impurity which had made her children altogether unfit for the rank to which they had unfortunately been born this iniquity on the part of lady frances this disgrace which made her absolutely tremble as she thought of it this abominable affection for an inferior creature acerbated her feelings even against lord hampstead the two were altogether so base as to make her think that they could not be intended by divine providence to stand permanently in the way of the glory of the family something certainly would happen it would turn out that they were not truly the legitimate children of a real marchioness some beautiful scheme of romance would discover itself to save her and her darlings and all the traffords and all the montressors from the terrible abomination with which they were threatened by these interlopers the idea dwelt in her mind till it became an almost fixed conviction that lord frederic would live to become lord hampsteador probably lord highgate as there was a third title in the family and the name of hampstead must for a time be held to have been disgracedand in due course of happy time marquis of kingsbury hitherto she had been accustomed to speak to her own babies of their elder brother with something of that respect which was due to the future head of the family but in these days she altered her tone when they spoke to her of jack as they would call him and she from herself never mentioned his name to them is fanny naughty lord frederic asked one day to this she made no reply is fanny very naughty the boy persisted in asking to this she nodded her head solemnly what has fanny done mamma at this she shook her head mysteriously it may therefore be understood that poor lady frances was sadly in want of comfort during the sojourn at königsgraaf  about the end of august the marquis returned he had hung on in london till the very last days of the session had been enjoyed and had then pretended that his presence had been absolutely required at trafford park to trafford park he went and had spent ten miserable days alone mr greenwood had indeed gone with him but the marquis was a man who was miserable unless surrounded by the comforts of his family and he led mr greenwood such a life that that worthy clergyman was very happy when he was left altogether in solitude by his noble friend then in compliance with the promise which he had absolutely made and aware that it was his duty to look after his wicked daughter the marquis returned to königsgraaf lady frances was to him at this period of his life a cause of unmitigated trouble it must not be supposed that his feelings were in any way akin to those of the marchioness as to either of his elder children both of them were very dear to him and of both of them he was in some degree proud they were handsome noblelooking clever and to himself thoroughly wellbehaved he had seen what trouble other elder sons could give their fathers what demands were made for increased allowances what disreputable pursuits were sometimes followed what quarrels there were what differences what want of affection and want of respect he was wise enough to have perceived all this and to be aware that he was in some respects singularly blest hampstead never asked him for a shilling he was a liberal man and would willingly have given many shillings but still there was a comfort in having a son who was quite contented in having his own income no doubt a time would come when those little lords would want shillings and lady frances had always been particularly soft to him diffusing over his life a sweet taste of the memory of his first wife of the present marchioness he was fond enough and was aware how much she did for him to support his position but he was conscious ever of a prior existence in which there had been higher thoughts grander feelings and aspirations which were now wanting to him of these something would come back in the moments which he spent with his daughter and in this way she was very dear to him but now there had come a trouble which robbed his life of all its sweetness he must go back to the grandeur of his wife and reject the tenderness of his daughter during these days at trafford he made himself very unpleasant to the devoted friend who had always been so true to his interests  when the battle about the correspondence was explained to him by his wife it of course became necessary to him to give his orders to his daughter such a matter could hardly be passed over in silencethough he probably might have done so had he not been instigated to action by the marchioness  fanny he said i have been shocked by these letters  i only wrote one papa  well one but two came  i only had one papa  that made two but there should have been no letter at all do you think it proper that a young lady should correspond withwitha gentleman in opposition to the wishes of her father and mother  i dont know papa  this seemed to him so weak that the marquis took heart of grace and made the oration which he felt that he as a father was bound to utter upon the entire question for after all it was not the letters which were of importance but the resolute feeling which had given birth to the letters my dear this is a most unfortunate affair he paused for a reply but lady frances felt that the assertion was one to which at the present moment she could make no reply it is you know quite out of the question that you should marry a young man so altogether unfitted for you in point of station as this young man  but i shall papa  fanny you can do no such thing  i certainly shall it may be a very long time first but i certainly shallunless i die  it is wicked of you my dear to talk of dying in that way  what i mean is that however long i may live i shall consider myself engaged to mr roden  he has behaved very very badly he has made his way into my house under a false pretence  he came as hampsteads friend  it was very foolish of hampstead to bring himvery foolisha post office clerk  mr vivian is a clerk in the foreign office why shouldnt one office be the same as another  they are very differentbut mr vivian wouldnt think of such a thing he understands the nature of things and knows his own position there is a conceit about the other man  a man should be conceited papa nobody will think well of him unless he thinks well of himself  he came to me in park lane  what mr roden  yes he came but i didnt see him mr greenwood saw him  what could mr greenwood say to him  mr greenwood could tell him to leave the houseand he did so there was nothing more to tell him now my dear let there be no more about it if you will put on your hat we will go out and walk down to the village  to this lady frances gave a ready assent she was not at all disposed to quarrel with her father or to take in bad part what he had said about her lover she had not expected that things would go very easily she had promised to herself constancy and final success but she had not expected that in her case the course of true love could be made to run smooth she was quite willing to return to a condition of good humour with her father andnot exactly to drop her lover for the momentbut so to conduct herself as though he were not paramount in her thoughts the cruelty of her stepmother had so weighed upon her that she found it to be quite a luxury to be allowed to walk with her father  i dont know that anything can be done the marquis said a few days afterwards to his wife it is one of those misfortunes which do happen now and again  that such a one as your daughter should give herself up to a clerk in the post office  whats the use of repeating that so often i dont know that the post office is worse than anything else of course it cant be allowedand having said so the best thing will be to go on just as though nothing had happened  and let her do just what she pleases  whos going to let her do anything she said she wouldnt write and she hasnt written we must just take her back to trafford and let her forget him as soon as she can  the marchioness was by no means satisfied though she did not know what measure of special severity to recommend there was once a timea very good time as lady kingsbury thought nowin which a young lady could be locked up in a convent or perhaps in a prison or absolutely forced to marry some suitor whom her parents should find for her but those comfortable days were past in a prison lady frances was detained now but it was a prison of which the marchioness was forced to make herself the gaoler and in which her darlings were made to be fellowprisoners with their wicked sister she herself was anxious to get back to trafford and the comforts of her own home the beauties of königsgraaf were not lovely to her in her present frame of mind but how would it be if lady frances should jump out of the window at trafford and run away with george roden the windows at königsgraaf were certainly much higher than those at trafford  they had made up their mind to return early in september and the excitement of packing up had almost commenced among them when lord hampstead suddenly appeared on the scene he had had enough of yachting and had grown tired of books and gardening at hendon something must be done before the hunting began and so without notice he appeared one day at königsgraaf this was to the intense delight of his brothers over whose doings he assumed a power which their mother was unable to withstand they were made to gallop on ponies on which they had only walked before they were bathed in the river and taken to the top of the castle and shut up in the dungeon after a fashion which was within the reach of no one but hampstead jack was jack and all was delight as far as the children were concerned but the marchioness was not so well pleased with the arrival a few days after his coming a conversation arose as to lady frances which lady kingsbury would have avoided had it been possible but it was forced upon her by her stepson  i dont think that fanny ought to be bullied said her stepson  hampstead i wish you would understand that i do not understand strong language  teased tormented and made wretched  if she be wretched she has brought it on herself  but she is not to be treated as though she had disgraced herself  she has disgraced herself  i deny it i will not hear such a word said of her even by you the marchioness drew herself up as though she had been insulted if there is to be such a feeling about her in your house i must ask my father to have her removed and i will make a home for her i will not see her brokenhearted by cruel treatment i am sure that he would not wish it  you have no right to speak to me in this manner  i surely have a right to protect my sister and i will exercise it  you have brought most improperly a young man into the house  i have brought into the house a young man whom i am proud to call my friend  and now you mean to assist him in destroying your sister  you are very wrong to say so they both know roden and my sister also that i disapprove of this marriage if fanny were with me i should not think it right to ask roden into the house they would both understand that but it does not follow that she should be cruelly used  no one has been cruel to her but she herself  it is easy enough to perceive what is going on it will be much better that fanny should remain with the family but you may be sure of thisthat i will not see her tortured then he took himself off and on the next day he had left königsgraaf it may be understood that the marchioness was not reconciled to her radical stepson by such language as he had used to her about a week afterwards the whole family returned to england and to trafford     chapter x  noblesse oblige   i quite agree said hampstead endeavouring to discuss the matter rationally with his sister that her ladyship should not be allowed to torment you  she does torment me you cannot perceive what my life was at königsgraaf there is a kind of usage which would drive any girl to run awayor to drown herself i dont suppose a man can know what it is always to be frowned at a man has his own friends and can go anywhere his spirits are not broken by being isolated he would not even see half the things which a girl is made to feel the very servants were encouraged to treat me badly the boys were not allowed to come near me i never heard a word that was not intended to be severe  i am sure it was bad  and it was not made better by the conviction that she has never cared for me it is to suffer all the authority but to enjoy none of the love of a mother when papa came of course it was better but even papa cannot make her change her ways a man is comparatively so very little in the house if it goes on it will drive me mad  of course ill stand to you  oh john i am sure you will  but it isnt altogether easy to know how to set about it if we were to keep house together at hendon as he made this proposition a look of joy came over her face and shone amidst her tears there would of course be a difficulty  what difficulty she however knew well what would be the difficulty  george roden would be too near to us  i should never see him unless you approved  i should not approve that would be the difficulty he would argue the matter with me and i should have to tell him that i could not let him come to the house except with my fathers leave that would be out of the question and therefore as i say there would be a difficulty  i would never see himexcept with your sanctionnor write to himnor receive letters from him you are not to suppose that i would give him up i shall never do that i shall go on and wait when a girl has once brought herself to tell a man that she loves him according to my idea she cannot give him up there are things which cannot be changed i could have lived very well without thinking of him had i not encouraged myself to love him but i have done that and now he must be everything to me  i am sorry that it should be so  it is so but if you will take me to hendon i will never see him till i have papas leave it is my duty to obey himbut not her  i am not quite clear about that  she has rejected me as a daughter and therefore i reject her as a mother she would get rid of us both if she could  you should not attribute to her any such thoughts  if you saw her as often as i do you would know she hates you almost as much as methough she cannot show it so easily  that she should hate my theories i can easily understand  you stand in her way  of course i do it is natural that a woman should wish to have the best for her own children i have sometimes myself felt it to be a pity that frederic should have an elder brother think what a gallant young marquis he would make while i am altogether out of my element  that is nonsense john  i ought to have been a tailor tailors i think are generally the most illconditioned sceptical and patriotic of men had my natural propensities been sharpened by the difficulty of maintaining a wife and children upon seven and sixpence a day i really think i could have done something to make myself conspicuous as it is i am neither one thing nor another neither fish nor fowl nor good red herring to the mind devoted to marquises i can understand that i should be a revolting being i have no aptitudes for aristocratic prettinesses her ladyship has three sons either of which would make a perfect marquis how is it possible that she should not think that i am standing in her way  but she knew of your existence when she married papa  no doubt she didbut that does not alter her nature i think i could find it in my heart to forgive her even though she attempted to poison me so much do i stand in her way i have sometimes thought that i ought to repudiate myself give up my prospects and call myself john traffordso as to make way for her more lordly lordlings  that is nonsense john  at any rate it is impossible i could only do it by blowing my brains outwhich would not be in accordance with my ideas of life but you are not in anybodys way there is nothing to be got by poisoning you if she were to murder me there would be something reasonable in itsomething that one could pardon but in torturing you she is instigated by a vile ambition she is afraid lest her own position should be tarnished by an inferior marriage on your part there would be something noble in killing me for the sake of dear little fred she would be getting something for him who of course is most dear to her but the other is the meanest vanityand i will not stand it  this conversation took place early in october when they had been some weeks at trafford park hampstead had come and gone as was his wont never remaining there above two or three days at a time lord kingsbury who was ill at ease had run hither and thither about the country looking after this or the other property and staying for a day or two with this or the other friend the marchioness had declined to invite any friends to the house declaring to her husband that the family was made unfit for gaiety by the wicked conduct of his eldest daughter there was no attempt at shooting the pheasants or even preparing to shoot them so great was the general depression mr greenwood was there and was thrown into very close intercourse with her ladyship he fully sympathized with her ladyship although he had always agreed with the marquisas he had not forgotten to tell george roden during that interview in londonin regard to his lordships early political tenets nevertheless his mind was so constituted that he was quite at one with her ladyship as to the disgraceful horror of low associations for noble families not only did he sympathize as to the abomination of the post office clerk but he sympathized also fully as to the positive unfitness which lord hampstead displayed for that station in life to which he had been called mr greenwood would sigh and wheeze and groan when the future prospects of the house of trafford were discussed between him and her ladyship it might be or it might not be wellso he kindly put it in talking to the marchionessthat a nobleman should indulge himself with liberal politics but it was dreadful to think that the heir to a great title should condescend to opinions worthy of a radical tailor for mr greenwood agreed with lord hampstead about the tailor lord hampstead seemed to him to be a matter simply for sorrownot for action nothing he thought could be done in regard to lord hampstead timetime that destroys but which also cures so many thingswould no doubt have its effect so that lord hampstead might in the fulness of years live to be as staunch a supporter of his class as any duke or marquis living or perhapsperhaps it might be that the lord would take him mr greenwood saw that this remark was more to the purpose and at once went to work with the peerage and found a score of cases in which within halfacentury the second brother had risen to the title it seemed indeed to be the case that a peculiar mortality attached itself to the eldest sons of peers this was comforting but there was not in it so much ground for positive action as at the present moment existed in regard to lady frances on this matter there was a complete unison of spirit between the two friends  mr greenwood had seen the objectionable young man and could say how thoroughly objectionable he was at all pointshow vulgar flippant ignorant impudent exactly what a clerk in the post office might be expected to be any severity according to mr greenwood would be justified in keeping the two young persons apart gradually mr greenwood learnt to talk of the female young person with very little of that respect which he showed to other members of the family in this way her ladyship came to regard lady frances as though she were not lady frances at allas though she were some distant fanny trafford a girl of bad taste and evil conduct who had unfortunately been brought into the family on grounds of mistaken charity  things had so gone on at trafford that trafford had hardly been preferable to königsgraaf indeed at königsgraaf there had been no mr greenwood and mr greenwood had certainly added much to the annoyances which poor lady frances was made to bear in this condition of things she had written to her brother begging him to come to her he had come and thus had taken place the conversation which has been given above  on the same day hampstead saw his father and discussed the matter with himthat matter and as will be seen some others also what on earth do you wish me to do about her asked the marquis  let her come and live with me at hendon if you will let me have the house i will take all the rest upon myself  keep an establishment of your own  why not if i found i couldnt afford it id give up the hunting and stick to the yacht  it isnt about money said the marquis shaking his head  her ladyship never liked hendon for herself  nor is it about the house you might have the house and welcome but how can i give up my charge over your sister just when i know that she is disposed to do just what she ought not  she wont be a bit more likely to do it there than here said the brother  he would be quite close to her  you may take this for granted sir that no two persons would be more thoroughly guided by a sense of duty than my sister and george roden  did she show her duty when she allowed herself to be engaged to a man like that without saying a word to any of her family  she told her ladyship as soon as it occurred  she should not have allowed it to have occurred at all it is nonsense talking like that you cannot mean to say that such a girl as your sister is entitled to do what she likes with herself without consulting any of her familyeven to accepting such a man as this for her lover  i hardly know said hampstead thoughtfully  you ought to know i know everybody knows it is nonsense talking like that  i doubt whether people do know said hampstead she is twentyone and as far as the law goes might i believe walk out of the house and marry any man she pleases tomorrow you as her father have no authority over her whateverhere the indignant father jumped up from his chair but his son went on with his speech as though determined not to be interruptedexcept what may come to you by her good feeling or else from the fact that she is dependent on you for her maintenance  good g shouted the marquis  i think this is about the truth of it young ladies do subject themselves to the authority of their parents from feeling from love and from dependence but as far as i understand in the matter they are not legally subject beyond a certain age  youd talk the hind legs off a dog  i wish i could but one may say a few words without being so eloquent as that if such is the case i am not sure that fanny has been morally wrong she may have been foolish i think she has been because i feel that the marriage is not suitable for her  noblesse oblige said the marquis putting his hand upon his bosom  no doubt nobility whatever may be its nature imposes bonds on us and if these bonds be not obeyed then nobility ceases but i deny that any nobility can bind us to any conduct which we believe to be wrong  who has said that it does  nobility continued the son not regarding his fathers question cannot bind me to do that which you or others think to be right if i do not approve it myself  what on earth are you driving at  you imply that because i belong to a certain orderor my sisterwe are bound to those practices of life which that order regards with favour this i deny both on her behalf and my own i didnt make myself the eldest son of an english peer i do acknowledge that as very much has been given to me in the way of education of social advantages and even of money a higher line of conduct is justly demanded from me than from those who have been less gifted so far noblesse oblige but before i undertake the duty thus imposed upon me i must find out what is that higher line of conduct fanny should do the same in marrying george roden she would do better according to your maxim than in giving herself to some noodle of a lord who from first to last will have nothing to be proud of beyond his acres and his title  the marquis had been walking about the room impatiently while his didactic son was struggling to explain his own theory as to those words noblesse oblige nothing could so plainly express the feelings of the marquis on the occasion as that illustration of his as to the dogs hind legs but he was a little ashamed of it and did not dare to use it twice on the same occasion he fretted and fumed and would have stopped hampstead had it been possible but hampstead was irrepressible when he had become warm on his own themes and his father knew that he must listen on to the bitter end i wont have her go to hendon at all he said when his son had finished  then you will understand little of her natureor of mine roden will not come near her there i can hardly be sure that he will not do so here here fanny will feel that she is being treated as an enemy  you have no right to say so  there she will know that you have done much to promote her happiness i will give you my assurance that she will neither see him nor write to him she has promised as much to me herself and i can trust her  why should she be so anxious to leave her natural home  because said hampstead boldly she has lost her natural mother the marquis frowned awfully at hearing this i have not a word to say against my stepmother as to myself i will not accuse her of anything as to fannyexcept that they thoroughly misunderstand each other you must see it yourself sir the marquis had seen it very thoroughly and mr greenwood has taken upon himself to speak to herwhich was i think very impertinent  i never authorized him  but he did her ladyship no doubt authorized him the end of it is that fanny is watched of course she will not bear a continuation of such misery why should she it will be better that she should come to me than be driven to go off with her lover  before the week was over the marquis had yielded hendon hall was to be given up altogether to lord hampstead and his sister was to be allowed to live with him as the mistress of his house she was to come in the course of next month and remain there at any rate till the spring there would be a difficulty about the hunting no doubt but that hampstead if necessary was prepared to abandon for the season he thought that perhaps he might be able to run down twice a week to the vale of aylesbury going across from hendon to the willesden junction he would at any rate make his sisters comfort the first object of his life and would take care that in doing so george roden should be excluded altogether from the arrangement  the marchioness was paralyzed when she heard that lady frances was to be taken awayto be taken into the direct neighbourhood of london and the post office very many words she said to her husband and often the marquis vacillated but when once the promise was given lady frances was strong enough to demand its fulfilment it was on this occasion that the marchioness first allowed herself to speak to mr greenwood with absolute disapproval of her husband to hendon hall said mr greenwood holding up his hands with surprise when the project was explained  yes indeed it does seem to me to be the mostmost improper sort of thing to do  he can walk over there every day as soon as he has got rid of the letters mr greenwood probably thought that george roden was sent about with the post office bags  of course they will meet  i fear so lady kingsbury  hampstead will arrange that for them  no no said the clergyman as though he were bound on behalf of the family to repudiate an idea that was so damnatory to its honour  it is just what he will do why else should he want to have her there with his ideas he would think it the best thing he could do utterly to degrade us all he has no idea of the honour of his brothers how should he when he is so anxious to sacrifice his own sister as for me of course he would do anything to break my heart he knows that i am anxious for his fathers name and therefore he would disgrace me in any way that was possible but that the marquis should consent  that is what i cannot understand said mr greenwood  there must be something in it mr greenwood which they mean to keep from me  the marquis cant intend to give her to that young man  i dont understand it i dont understand it at all said the marchioness he did seem so firm about it as for the girl herself i will never see her again after she has left my house in such a fashion and to tell the truth i never wish to see hampstead again they are plotting against me and if there is anything i hate it is a plot in this way mr greenwood and the marchioness became bound together in their great disapproval of lady frances and her love     chapter xi  lady persiflage   hampstead rushed up to hendon almost without seeing his stepmother intent on making preparations for his sister and then before october was over rushed back to fetch her he was very great at rushing never begrudging himself any personal trouble in what he undertook to do when he left the house he hardly spoke to her ladyship when he took lady frances away he was of course bound to bid her adieu  i think he said that frances will be happy with me at hendon  i have nothing to do with itliterally nothing said the marchioness with her sternest frown i wash my hands of the whole concern  i am sure you would be glad that she should be happy  it is impossible that any one should be happy who misconducts herself  that i think is true  it is certainly true with misconduct such as this  i quite agree with what you said first but the question remains as to what is misconduct now  i will not hear you hampstead not a word you can persuade your father i dare say but you cannot persuade me fanny has divorced herself from my heart for ever  i am sorry for that  and im bound to say that you are doing the same it is better in some cases to be plain  ohcertainly but not to be irrational  i am not irrational and it is most improper for you to speak to me in that way  well goodbye i have no doubt it will come right some of these days said hampstead as he took his leave then he carried his sister off to hendon  previous to this there had been a great deal of unpleasantness in the house from the moment in which lady kingsbury had heard that her stepdaughter was to go to her brother she had refused even to speak to the unfortunate girl as far as it was possible she put her husband also into coventry she held daily consultations with mr greenwood and spent most of her hours in embracing coddling and spoiling those three unfortunate young noblemen who were being so cruelly injured by their brother and sister one of her keenest pangs was in seeing how boisterously the three bairns romped with jack even after she had dismissed him from her own good graces as utterly unworthy of her regard that night he positively brought lord gregory down into the drawingroom in his nightshirt having dragged the little urchin out of his cotas one might do who was on peculiar terms of friendship with the mother lord gregory was in elysium but the mother tore the child from the sinners arms and carried him back in anger to the nursery  nothing does children so much good as disturbing them in their sleep said lord hampstead turning to his father but the anger of the marchioness was too serious a thing to allow of a joke  from this time forth for evermore she is no child of mine said lady kingsbury the next morning to her husband as soon as the carriage had taken the two sinners away from the door  it is very wrong to say that she is your child and must be your child  i have divorced her from my heartand also lord hampstead how can it be otherwise when they are both in rebellion against me now there will be this disgraceful marriage would you wish that i should receive the post office clerk here as my soninlaw  there wont be any disgraceful marriage said the marquis at least what i mean is that it will be much less likely at hendon than here  less likely than here here it would have been impossible there they will be all together  no such thing said the marquis hampstead will see to that and she too has promised me  pshaw exclaimed the marchioness  i wont have you say pshaw to me when i tell you fanny always has kept her word to me and i dont in the least doubt her had she remained here your treatment would have induced her to run away with him at the first word  lord kingsbury said the offended lady i have always done my duty by the children of your first marriage as a mother should do i have found them to be violent and altogether unaware of the duties which their position should impose upon them it was only yesterday that lord hampstead presumed to call me irrational i have borne a great deal from them and can bear no more i wish you would have found some one better able to control their conduct then with a stately step she stalked out of the room under these circumstances the house was not comfortable to any of the inhabitants  as soon as her ladyship had reached her own apartments after this rough interview she seated herself at the table and commenced a letter to her sister lady persiflage in which she proceeded to give a detailed account of all her troubles and sufferings lady persiflage who was by a year or two the younger of the two filled a higher position in society than that of the marchioness herself she was the wife only of an earl but the earl was a knight of the garter lord lieutenant of his county and at the present moment secretary of state for the home department the marquis had risen to no such honours as these lord persiflage was a peculiar man nobody quite knew of what his great gifts consisted but it was acknowledged of him that he was an astute diplomat that the honour of england was safe in his hands and that no more perfect courtier ever gave advice to a wellsatisfied sovereign he was beautiful to look at with his soft grey hair his bright eyes and wellcut features he was much of a dandy and though he was known to be nearer seventy than sixty years of age he maintained an appearance of almost green juvenility active he was not nor learned nor eloquent but he knew how to hold his own and had held it for many years he had married his wife when she was very young and she had become first a distinguished beauty and then a leader of fashion her sister our marchioness had been past thirty when she married and had never been quite so much in the worlds eye as her sister lady persiflage and lady persiflage was the mother of her husbands heir the young lord hautboy her eldest son was now just of age lady kingsbury looked upon him as all that the heir to an earldom ought to be his mother too was proud of him for he was beautiful as a young phoebus the earl his father was not always as well pleased because his son had already achieved a knack of spending money the persiflage estates were somewhat encumbered and there seemed to be a probability that lord hautboy might create further trouble such was the family to whom collectively the marchioness looked for support in her unhappiness the letter which she wrote to her sister on the present occasion was as follows      trafford park    saturday october 25th     my dear geraldine     i take up my pen to write to you with a heart laden with    trouble things have become so bad with me that i do not    know where to turn myself unless you can give me comfort    i am beginning to feel how terrible it is to have    undertaken the position of mother to another persons    children god knows i have endeavoured to do my duty but    it has all been in vain everything is over now i have    divided myself for ever from hampstead and from fanny i    have felt myself compelled to tell their father that i    have divorced them from my heart and i have told lord    hampstead the same you will understand how terrible must    have been the occasion when i found myself compelled to    take such a step as this     you know how dreadfully shocked i was when she first    revealed to me the fact that she had promised to marry    that post office clerk the young man had actually the    impudence to call on lord kingsbury in london to offer    himself as a soninlaw kingsbury very properly would    not see him but instructed mr greenwood to do so mr    greenwood has behaved very well in the matter and is a    great comfort to me i hope we may be able to do something    for him some day a viler or more illconditioned young    man he says that he never sawinsolent too and talking    as though he had as much right to ask for fannys hand as    though he were one of the same class as for that she    would deserve nothing better than to be married to such a    man were it not that all the world would know how closely    she is connected with my own darling boys     then we took her off to königsgraaf and such a time as    i had with her she would write letters to this wretch    and contrived to receive one i did stop that but you    cannot conceive what a life she led me of course i have    felt from the first that she would be divided from her    brothers because one never knows how early bad morals may    be inculcated then her papa came and hampsteadwho in    all this has encouraged his sister the young man is his    friend after this who will say that any nobleman ought to    call himself what they call a liberal then we came home    and what do you think has happened hampstead has taken    his sister to live with him at hendon next door as you    may say to the post office clerk where the young man    has made himself thoroughly at homeand kingsbury has    permitted it oh geraldine that is the worst of it am i    not justified in declaring that i have divorced them from    my heart     you can hardly feel as i do you whose son fills so well    that position which an eldest son ought to fill here    am i with my darlings not only under a shade but with    this disgrace before them which they will never be able    altogether to get rid of i can divorce hampstead and his    sister from my heart but they will still be in some sort    brother and sister to my poor boys how am i to teach them    to respect their elder brother who i suppose must in    course of time become head of the house when he is hand    and glove with a dreadful young man such as that am i not    justified in declaring that no communication shall be kept    up between the two families if she marries the man she    will of course drop the name but yet all the world will    know because of the title as for him i am afraid that    there is no hopealthough it is odd that the second son    does so very often come to the title if you look into it    you will find that the second brother has almost a better    chance than the elderalthough i am sure that nothing of    the kind will ever happen to dear hautboy but he knows    how to live in that state of life to which it has pleased    god to call him do write to me at once and tell me what    i ought to do with a due regard to the position to which i    have been called upon to fill in the world     your most affectionate sister     clara kingsbury     psdo remember poor mr greenwood if lord persiflage    should know how to do something for a clergyman he is    getting old and kingsbury has never been able to do    anything for him i hope the liberals never will be able    to do anything for anybody i dont think mr greenwood    would be fit for any duty because he has been idle all    his life and is now fond of good living but a deanery    would just suit him   after the interval of a fortnight lady kingsbury received a reply from her sister which the reader may as well see at once      castle hautboy    november 9th     my dear clara     i dont know that there is anything further to be done    about fanny as for divorcing her from your heart i dont    suppose that it amounts to much i advise you to keep on    good terms with hampstead because if anything were to    happen it is always well for the dowager to be friends    with the heir if fanny will marry the man she must lady    di peacocke married mr billyboy who was a clerk in one    of the offices they made him assistant secretary and    they now live in portugal street and do very well i see    lady diana about everywhere mr billyboy cant keep a    carriage for her but that of course is her lookout     as to what you say about second sons succeeding dont    think of it it would get you into a bad frame of mind    and make you hate the very person upon whom you will    probably have to depend for much of your comfort     i think you should take things easier and above all do    not trouble your husband i am sure he could make himself    very unpleasant if he were driven too far persiflage has    no clerical patronage whatever and would not interfere    about deans or bishops for all the world i suppose he    could appoint a chaplain to an embassy but your clergyman    seems to be too old and too idle for that     your affectionate sister     geraldine persiflage   this letter brought very little comfort to the distracted marchioness there was much in it so cold that it offended her deeply and for a moment prompted her almost to divorce also lady persiflage from her heart lady persiflage seemed to think that fanny should be absolutely encouraged to marry the post office clerk because at some past period some lady diana who at the time was near fifty had married a clerk also it might be that a lady diana should have run away with a groom but would that be a reason why so monstrous a crime should be repeated and then in this letter there was so absolute an absence of all affectionate regard for her own children she had spoken with great love of lord hautboy but then lord hautboy was the acknowledged heir whereas her own children were nobodies in this there lay the sting and then she felt herself to have been rebuked because she had hinted at the possibility of lord hampsteads departure for a better world lord hampstead was mortal as well as others and why should not his death be contemplated especially as it would confer so great a benefit on the world at large her sisters letter persuaded her of nothing the divorce should remain as complete as ever she would not condescend to think of any future advantages which might accrue to her from any intimacy with her stepson her dower had been regularly settled her duty was to her own childrenand secondly to her husband if she could succeed in turning him against these two wicked elder children then she would omit to do nothing which might render his life pleasant to him such were the resolutions which she formed on receipt of her sisters letter  about this time lord kingsbury found it necessary to say a few words to mr greenwood there had not of late been much expression of kindness from the marquis to the clergyman since their return from germany his lordship had been either taciturn or cross mr greenwood took this very much to heart for though he was most anxious to assure to himself the friendship of the marchioness he did not at all wish to neglect the marquis it was in truth on the marquis that he depended for everything that he had in the world the marquis could send him out of the house tomorrowand if this house were closed to him none other as far as he knew would be open to him except the union he had lived delicately all his life and luxuriouslybut fruitlessly as regarded the gathering of any honey for future wants whatever small scraps of preferment might have come in his way had been rejected as having been joined with too much of labour and too little of emolument he had gone on hoping that so great a man as the marquis would be able to do something for himthinking that he might at any rate fasten his patron closely to him by bonds of affection this had been in days before the coming of the present marchioness at first she had not created any special difficulty for him she did not at once attempt to overthrow the settled politics of the family and mr greenwood had been allowed to be blandly liberal but during the last year or two great management had been necessary by degrees he had found it essential to fall into the conservative views of her ladyshipwhich extended simply to the idea that the cream of the earth should be allowed to be the cream of the earth it is difficult in the same house to adhere to two political doctrines because the holders of each will require support at all general meetings gradually the marchioness had become exigeant and the marquis was becoming aware that he was being thrown over a feeling of anger was growing up in his mind which he did not himself analyze when he heard that the clergyman had taken upon himself to lecture lady francesfor it was thus he read the few words which his son had spoken to himhe carried his anger with him for a day or two till at last he found an opportunity of explaining himself to the culprit  lady frances will do very well where she is said the marquis in answer to some expression of a wish as to his daughters comfort  oh no doubt  i am not sure that i am fond of too much interference in such matters  have i interfered my lord  i do not mean to find any special fault on this occasion  i hope not my lord  but you did speak to lady frances when i think it might have been as well that you should have held your tongue  i had been instructed to see that young man in london  exactlybut not to say anything to lady frances  i had known her ladyship so many years  do not drive me to say that you had known her too long  mr greenwood felt this to be very hardfor what he had said to lady frances he had in truth said under instruction that last speech as to having perhaps known the young lady too long seemed to contain a terrible threat he was thus driven to fall back upon his instructions her ladyship seemed to think that perhaps a word in season  the marquis felt this to be cowardly and was more inclined to be angry with his old friend than if he had stuck to that former plea of old friendship i will not have interference in this house and theres an end of it if i wish you to do anything for me i will tell you that is all if you please nothing more shall be said about it the subject is disagreeable to me                                          has the marquis said anything about lady frances since she went the marchioness asked the clergyman the next morning how was he to hold his balance between them if he was to be questioned by both sides in this way i suppose he has mentioned her  he just mentioned the name one day  well  i rather think that he does not wish to be interrogated about her ladyship  i dare say not is he anxious to have her back again  that i cannot say lady kingsbury i should think he must be  of course i shall be desirous to ascertain the truth he has been so unreasonable that i hardly know how to speak to him myself i suppose he tells you  i rather think his lordship will decline to speak about her ladyship just at present  of course it is necessary that i should know now that she has chosen to take herself off i shall not choose to live under the same roof with her again if lord kingsbury speaks to you on the subject you should make him understand that poor mr greenwood felt that there were thorny paths before him in which it might be very difficult to guard his feet from pricks then he had to consider if there were to be two sides in the house strongly opposed to each other with which would it be best for him to take a part the houses of the marquis with all their comforts were open for him but the influence of lord persiflage was very great whereas that of the marquis was next to nothing     chapter xii  castle hautboy   youd better ask the old traffords down here for a few weeks hampstead wont shoot but he can hunt with the braeside harriers  this was the answer made by lord persiflage to his wife when he was told by her of that divorce which had taken place at trafford park and of the departure of lady frances for hendon hampstead and lady frances were the old traffords lord persiflage too was a conservative but his politics were of a very different order from those entertained by his sisterinlaw he was above all a man of the world he had been our ambassador at st petersburg and was now a member of the cabinet he liked the good things of office but had no idea of quarrelling with a radical because he was a radical he cared very little as to the opinions of his guests if they could make themselves either pleasant or useful he looked upon his sisterinlaw as an old fool and had no idea of quarrelling with hampstead for her sake if the girl persisted in making a bad match she must take the consequences no great harm would comeexcept to her as to the evil done to his order that did not affect lord persiflage at all he did not expect his order to endure for ever all orders become worn out in time and effete he had no abhorrence for anybody but he liked pleasant people he liked to treat everything as a joke and he liked the labours of his not unlaborious life to be minimised having given his orders about the old traffords as he called them in reference to the darlings he said nothing more on the subject lady persiflage wrote a note to dear fanny conveying the invitation in three words and received a reply to the effect that she and her brother would be at castle hautboy before the end of november hampstead would perhaps bring a couple of horses but he would put them up at the livery stables at penrith  how do you do hampstead said persiflage when he first met his guest before dinner on the day of the arrival you havent got rid of everything yet  this question was supposed to refer to lord hampsteads revolutionary tendencies not quite so thoroughly as we hope to do soon  i always think it a great comfort that in our country the blackguards are so considerate i must own that we do very little for them and yet they never knock us over the head or shoot at us as they do in russia and germany and france then he passed on having said quite enough for one conversation  so youve gone off to hendon to live with your brother said lady persiflage to her niece  yes indeed said lady fanny blushing at the implied allusion to her lowborn lover which was contained in this question  but lady persiflage had no idea of saying a word about the lover or of making herself in any way unpleasant i dare say it will be very comfortable for you both she said but we thought you might be a little lonely till you got used to it and therefore asked you to come down for a week or two the house is full of people and you will be sure to find some one that you know not a word was said at castle hautboy as to those terrible things which had occurred in the trafford family  young vivian was there half as he said for ornament but partly for pleasure and partly for business he likes to have a private secretary with him he said to hampstead in order that people might think there is something to do as a rule they never send anything down from the foreign office at this time of year he always has a foreign minister or two in the house or a few secretaries of legation and that gives an air of business nothing would offend or surprise him so much as if one of them were to say a word about affairs nobody ever does and therefore he is supposed to be the safest foreign minister that weve had in downing street since old s time  well hautboy well hampstead thus the two heirs greeted each other youll come and shoot tomorrow asked the young host  i never shoot i thought all the world knew that  the best cockshooting in all england said hautboy but we shant come to that for the next month  cocks or hens pheasants grouse or partridge rabbits or hares its all one to me i couldnt hit em if i would and i wouldnt if i could  there is a great deal in the couldnt said hautboy as for hunting those braeside fellows go out two or three times a week but its a wretched sort of affair they hunt hares or foxes just as they come and theyre always climbing up a ravine or tumbling down a precipice  i can climb and tumble as well as any one said hampstead so that question as to the future amusement of the guest was settled  but the glory of the house of hautevillehauteville was the earls family nameat present shone most brightly in the person of the eldest daughter lady amaldina lady amaldina who was as beautiful in colour shape and proportion as wax could make a venus was engaged to marry the eldest son of the duke of merioneth the marquis of llwddythlw was a young man about forty years of age of great promise who had never been known to do a foolish thing in his life and his father was one of those halfdozen happy noblemen each of whom is ordinarily reported to be the richest man in england lady amaldina was not unnaturally proud of her high destiny and as the alliance had already been advertised in all the newspapers she was not unwilling to talk about it lady frances was not exactly a cousin but stood in the place of a cousin and therefore was regarded as a good listener for all the details which had to be repeated it might be that lady amaldina took special joy in having such a listener because lady frances herself had placed her own hopes so low that story as to the post office clerk was known to everybody at castle hautboy lady persiflage ridiculed the idea of keeping such things secret having so much to be proud of in regard to her own children she thought that there should be no such secrets if fanny trafford did intend to marry the post office clerk it would be better that all the world should know it beforehand lady amaldina knew it and was delighted at having a confidante whose views and prospects in life were so different from her own of course dear you have heard what is going to happen to me she said smiling  i have heard of your engagement with the son of the duke of merioneth the man with the terrible welsh name  when you once know how to pronounce it it is the prettiest word that poetry ever produced then lady amaldina did pronounce her future namebut nothing serviceable would be done for the reader if an attempt were made to write the sound which she produced i am not sure but what it was the name which first won my heart i can sign it now quite easily without a mistake  it wont be long i suppose before you will have to do so always  an age my dear the dukes affairs are of such a natureand llwddythlw is so constantly engaged in business that i dont suppose it will take place for the next ten years what with settlements and entails and parliament and the rest of it i shall be an old woman before i amled to the hymeneal altar  ten years said lady fanny  well say ten months which seems to be just as long  isnt he in a hurry  oh awfully but what can he do poor fellow he is so placed that he cannot have his affairs arranged for him in halfanhour as other men can do it is a great trouble having estates so large and interests so complicated now there is one thing i particularly want to ask you  what is it  about being one of the bridesmaids  one can hardly answer for ten years hence  that is nonsense of course i am determined to have no girl who has not a title it isnt that i care about that kind of thing in the least but the duke does and then i think the list will sound more distinguished in the newspapers if all the christian names are given with the lady before them there are to be his three sisters lady anne lady antoinette and lady anatoliathen my two sisters lady alphonsa and lady amelia to be sure they are very young  they may be old enough according to what you say  yes indeed and then there will be lady arabella portroyal and lady augusta gelashires i have got the list written out somewhere and there are to be just twenty  if the catalogue is finished there will hardly be room for me  the earl of knocknacoppuls daughter has sent me word that she must refuse because her own marriage will take place first she would have put it off as she is only going to marry an irish baronet and because she is dying to have her name down as one of the bevy but he says that if she delays any longer hell go on a shooting expedition to the rocky mountains and then perhaps he might never come back so there is a vacancy  i hardly like to make a promise so long beforehand perhaps i might have a young man and he might go off to the rocky mountains  thats just what made me not put down your name at first of course you know weve heard about mr roden  i didnt know said lady frances blushing  oh dear yes everybody knows it and i think it such a brave thing to doif youre really attached to him  i should never marry any man without being attached to him said lady frances  thats of course but i mean romantically attached i dont pretend to that kind of thing with llwddythlw i dont think it necessary in a marriage of this kind he is a great deal older than i am and is bald i suppose mr roden is very very handsome  i have not thought much about that  i should have considered that one would want it for a marriage of that kind i dont know whether after all it isnt the best thing to do romance is so delicious  but then its delicious to be a duchess said lady frances with the slightest touch of irony  oh no doubt one has to look at it all round and then to form a judgment it went a great way with papa i know llwddythlw being such a good man of business he has been in the household and the queen will be sure to send a handsome present i expect to have the grandest show of wedding presents that any girl has yet exhibited in england ever so many people have asked mamma already as to what i should like best mr macwhapple said out plain that he would go to a hundred and fifty pounds he is a scotch manufacturer and has papas interest in wigtonshire i suppose you dont intend to do anything very grand in that way  i suppose not as i dont know any scotch manufacturers but my marriage if i ever am married is a thing so much of the future that i havent even begun to think of my dress yet  ill tell you a secret said lady amaldina whispering mine is already made and ive tried it on  you might get ever so much stouter in ten years said lady frances  that of course was joking but we did think the marriage would come off last june and as we were in paris in april the order was given dont you tell anybody about that  then it was settled that the name of lady frances should be put down on the list of bridesmaids but put down in a doubtful manneras is done with other things of great importance  a few days after lord hampsteads arrival a very great dinnerparty was given at the castle at which all the county round was invited castle hautboy is situated near pooly bridge just in the county of westmoreland on an eminence giving it a grand prospect over ulleswater which is generally considered to be one of the cumberland lakes therefore the gentry from the two counties were invited as far round as penrith shap bampton and patterdale the earls property in that neighbourhood was scattered about through the two counties and was looked after by a steward or manager who lived himself at penrith and was supposed to be very efficacious in such duties his name was crocker and not only was he invited to the dinner but also his son who happened at the time to be enjoying the months holiday which was allowed to him by the authorities of the office in london to which he was attached  the reader may remember that a smart young man of this name sat at the same desk with george roden at the general post office young crocker was specially delighted with the honour done him on this occasion he not only knew that his fellow clerks friend lord hampstead was at the castle and his sister lady frances with him but he also knew that george roden was engaged to marry that noble lady had he heard this before he left london he would probably have endeavoured to make some atonement for his insolence to roden for he was in truth filled with a strong admiration for the man who had before him the possibility of such high prospects but the news had only reached him since he had been in the north now he thought that he might possibly find an opportunity of making known to lord hampstead his intimacy with roden and of possibly saying a wordjust uttering a hintas to that future event  it was long before he could find himself near enough to lord hampstead to address him he had even refused to return home with his father who did not like being very late on the road saying that he had got a lift into town in another conveyance this he did with the prospect of having to walk six miles into penrith in his dress boots solely with the object of saying a few words to rodens friend at last he was successful  we have had what i call an extremely pleasant evening my lord it was thus he commenced and hampstead whose practice it was to be specially graceful to any one whom he chanced to meet but did not think to be a gentleman replied very courteously that the evening had been pleasant  quite a thing to remember continued crocker  perhaps one remembers the unpleasant things the longest said hampstead laughing  oh no my lord not that i always forget the unpleasant thats what i call philosophy then he broke away into the subject that was near his heart i wish our friend roden had been here my lord  is he a friend of yours  oh dear yesmost intimate we sit in the same room at the post office and at the same deskas thick as thieves as the saying is we often have a crack about your lordship  i have a great esteem for george roden he and i are really friends i know no one for whom i have a higher regard this he said with an earnest voice thinking himself bound to express his friendship more loudly than he would have done had the friend been in his own rank of life  thats just what i feel roden is a man that will rise  i hope so  hell be sure to get something good before long theyll make him a surveyor or chief clerk or something of that kind ill back him to have £500 a year before any man in the office therell be a shindy about it of course there always is a shindy when a fellow is put up out of his turn but he neednt care for that they can laugh as win eh my lord  he would be the last to wish an injustice to be done for his own good  weve got to take that as it comes my lord i wont say but what i should like to go up at once to a senior class over other mens heads there isnt a chance of that because im independent and the seniors dont like me old jerningham is always down upon me just for that reason you ask roden and hell tell you the same thingmy lord then came a momentary break in the conversation and lord hampstead was seizing advantage of it to escape but crocker who had taken enough wine to be bold saw the attempt and intercepted it he was desirous of letting the lord know all that he knew roden is a happy dog my lord  happy i hope though not a dog said hampstead trusting that he could retreat gracefully behind the joke  ha ha ha the dog only meant what a lucky fellow he is i have heard him speak in raptures of what is in store for him  what  theres no happiness like married happiness is there my lord  upon my word i cant say good night to you  i hope you will come and see me and roden at the office some of these days  good night good night then the man did go for a moment or two lord hampstead felt actually angry with his friend could it be that roden should make so little of his sisters name as to talk about her to the post office clerksto so mean a fellow as this and yet the man certainly knew the fact of the existing engagement hampstead thought it impossible that it should have travelled beyond the limits of his own family it was natural that roden should have told his mother but unnaturalso hampstead thoughtthat his friend should have made his sister a subject of conversation to any one else it was horrible to him that a stranger such as that should have spoken to him about his sister at all but surely it was not possible that roden should have sinned after that fashion he soon resolved that it was not possible but how grievous a thing it was that a girls name should be made so common in the mouths of men  after that he sauntered into the smokingroom where were congregated the young men who were staying in the house thats a kind of thing that happens only once a year said hautboy speaking to all the party but i cannot for the life of me see why it should happen at all  your governor finds that it succeeds in the county said one  he polishes off a whole heap at one go said another  it does help to keep a party together said a third  and enables a lot of people to talk of dining at castle hautboy without lying said a fourth  but why should a lot of people be enabled to say that theyd dined here asked hautboy i like to see my friends at dinner what did you think about it hampstead  its all according to hampsteads theories said one  only hed have had the tinkers and the tailors too said another  and wouldnt have had the ladies and gentlemen said a third  i would have had the tailors and tinkers said hampstead and i would have had the ladies and gentlemen too if i could have got them to meet the tailors and tinkersbut i would not have had that young man who got me out into the hall just now  whythat was crocker the post office clerk said hautboy why shouldnt we have a post office clerk as well as some one else nevertheless crocker is a sad cad in the mean time crocker was walking home to penrith in his dress boots     chapter xiii  the braeside harriers   the braeside harriers can hardly be called a crack pack of hounds lord hautboy had been right in saying that they were always scrambling through ravines and that they hunted whatever they could find to hunt nevertheless the men and the hounds were in earnest and did accomplish a fair average of sport under difficult circumstances no pegasus or littlelegs or pigskin ever sent accounts of wondrous runs from cumberland or westmoreland to the sporting papers in which the gentlemen who had asked the special pigskin of the day to dinner were described as having been in at some glorious finish on their wellknown horses banker or buffthe horses named being generally those which the gentlemen wished to sell the names of gorses and brooks had not become historic as have those of ranksborough and whissendine trains were not run to suit this or the other meet gentlemen did not get out of fast drags with pretty little aprons tied around their waists like girls in a country house coming down to breakfast not many perhaps wore pink coats and none pink tops one horse would suffice for one days work an old assistant huntsman in an old red coat with one boy mounted on a ragged pony served for an establishment the whole thing was despicable in the eyes of men from the quorn and cottesmore but there was some wonderful riding and much constant sport with the braeside harriers and the country had given birth to certainly the best hunting song in the language      do you ken john peel with his coat so gay    do you ken john peel at the break of day    do you ken john peel when hes far far away       with his hounds and his horn in the morning   such as the braeside harriers were lord hampstead determined to make the experiment and on a certain morning had himself driven to cronelloe thorn a favourite meet halfway between penrith and keswick  i hold that nothing is so likely to be permanently prejudicial to the interest of hunting in the british isles as a certain flavour of tiptop fashion which has gradually enveloped it there is a pretence of grandeur about that and alas about other sports also which is to my thinking destructive of all sport itself men will not shoot unless game is made to appear before them in clouds they will not fish unless the rivers be exquisite to row is nothing unless you can be known as a national hero cricket requires appendages which are troublesome and costly and by which the minds of economical fathers are astounded to play a game of hockey in accordance with the times you must have a specially trained pony and a gaudy dress racquets have given place to tennis because tennis is costly in all these cases the fashion of the game is much more cherished than the game itself but in nothing is this feeling so predominant as in hunting for the management of a pack as packs are managed now a huntsman needs must be a great man himself and three mounted subordinates are necessary as at any rate for two of these servants a second horse is required a hunt is nothing in the world unless it goes out four times a week at least a run is nothing unless the pace be that of a steeplechase whether there be or be not a fox before the hounds is of little consequence to the great body of riders a bold huntsman who can make a dash across country from one covert to another and who can so train his hounds that they shall run as though game were before them is supposed to have provided good sport if a fox can be killed in covert afterwards so much the better for those who like to talk of their doings though the hounds brought no fox with them it is of no matter when a fox does run according to his nature he is reviled as a useless brute because he will not go straight across country but the worst of all is the attention given by men to things altogether outside the sport their coats and waistcoats their boots and breeches their little strings and pretty scarfs their saddles and bridles their dandy knickknacks and above all their flasks are more to many men than aught else in the days proceedings i have known girls who have thought that their first appearance in the ballroom when all was fresh unstained and perfect from the milliners hand was the one moment of rapture for the evening i have sometimes felt the same of young sportsmen at a leicestershire or northamptonshire meet it is not that they will not ride when the occasion comes they are always ready enough to break their bones there is no greater mistake than to suppose that dandyism is antagonistic to pluck the fault is that men train themselves to care for nothing that is not as costly as unlimited expenditure can make it thus it comes about that the real love of sport is crushed under a desire for fashion a man will be almost ashamed to confess that he hunts in essex or sussex because the proper thing is to go down to the shires grass no doubt is better than ploughed land to ride upon but taking together the virtues and vices of all hunting counties i doubt whether better sport is not to be found in what i will venture to call the haunts of the clodpoles than among the palmy pastures of the wellbreeched beauties of leicestershire  braeside harriers though they were a strong taste for foxes had lately grown up in the minds of men and in the noses of hounds blank days they did not know because a hare would serve the turn if the nobler animal were not forthcoming but ideas of preserving had sprung up steps were taken to solace the minds of old women who had lost their geese and the braeside harriers though they had kept their name were gradually losing their character on this occasion the hounds were taken off to draw a covert instead of going to a soho as regularly as though they were advertised among the foxhounds in the times it was soon known that lord hampstead was lord hampstead and he was welcomed by the field what matter that he was a revolutionary radical if he could ride to hounds at any rate he was the son of a marquis and was not left to that solitude which sometimes falls upon a man who appears suddenly as a stranger among strangers on a hunting morning i am glad to see you out my lord said mr amblethwaite the master it isnt often that we get recruits from castle hautboy  they think a good deal of shooting there  yes and they keep their horses in northamptonshire lord hautboy does his hunting there the earl i think never comes out now  i dare say not he has all the foreign nations to look after  i suppose he has his hands pretty full said mr amblethwaite i know i have mine just at this time of the year where do you think these hounds ran their fox to last friday we found him outside of the lowther woods near the village of clifton they took him straight over shap fell and then turning sharp to the right went all along hawes wall and over high street into troutbeck  thats all among the mountains said hampstead  mountains i should think so i have to spend half my time among the mountains  but you couldnt ride over high street  no we couldnt ride not there but we had to make our way round some of us and some of them went on foot dick never lost sight of the hounds the whole day dick was the boy who rode the ragged pony when we found em there he was with half the hounds around him and the foxs brush stuck in his cap  how did you get home that night asked hampstead  home i didnt get home at all it was pitch dark before we got the rest of the hounds together some of them we didnt find till next day i had to go and sleep at bowness and thought myself very lucky to get a bed then i had to ride home next day over kirkstone fell thats what i call something like work for a man and horsetheres a fox in there my lord do you hear them then mr amblethwaite bustled away to assist at the duty of getting the fox to break  im glad to see that youre fond of this kind of thing my lord said a voice in hampsteads ear which though he had only heard it once he well remembered it was crocker the guest at the dinnerpartycrocker the post office clerk  yes said lord hampstead i am very fond of this kind of thing that fox has broken i think at the other side of the cover then he trotted off down a little lane between two loosebuilt walls so narrow that there was no space for two men to ride abreast his object at that moment was to escape crocker rather than to look after the hounds  they were in a wild country not exactly on a mountain side but among hills which not far off grew into mountains where cultivation of the rudest kind was just beginning to effect its domination over human nature there was a long spinney rather than a wood stretching down a bottom through which a brook ran it would now cease and then renew itself so that the trees though not absolutely continuous were nearly so for the distance of half a mile the ground on each side was rough with big stones and steep in some places as they went down the hill but still it was such that horsemen could gallop on it the fox made his way along the whole length and then traversing so as to avoid the hounds ran a ring up the hillside and back into the spinney again among the horsemen many declared that the brute must be killed unless he would make up his mind for a fair start mr amblethwaite was very busy hunting the hounds himself and intent rather on killing the fox fairly than on the hopes of a run perhaps he was not desirous of sleeping out another night on the far side of helvellyn in this way the sportsmen galloped up and down the side of the wood till the feeling arose as it does on such occasions that it might be well for a man to stand still awhile and spare his horse in regard to the future necessities of the day lord hampstead did as others were doing and in a moment crocker was by his side crocker was riding an animal which his father was wont to drive about the country but one well known in the annals of the braeside harriers it was asserted of him that the fence was not made which he did not know how to creep over of jumping such as jumping is supposed to be in the shires he knew nothing he was too a bad hand at galloping but with a shambling half cantering trot which he had invented for himself he could go along all day not very quickly but in such fashion as never to be left altogether behind he was a fleabitten horse if my readers know what that isa fleabitten roan or white covered with small red spots horses of this colour are ugly to look at but are very seldom bad animals such as he was crocker who did not ride much when up in london was very proud of him crocker was dressed in a green coat which in a moment of extravagance he had had made for hunting and in brown breeches in which he delighted to display himself on all possible occasions my lord he said youd hardly think it but i believe this horse to be the best hunter in cumberland  is he indeed some horse of course must be the best and why not yours  theres nothing he cant donothing his jumping is miraculous and as for pace youd be quite surprisedtheyre at him again now what an echo they do make among the hills  indeed they did every now and then the master would just touch his horn giving a short blast just half a note and then the sound would come back first from this rock and then from the other and the hounds as they heard it would open as though encouraged by the music of the hills and then their voices would be carried round the valley and come back again and again from the steep places and they would become louder and louder as though delighted with the effect of their own efforts though there should be no hunting the concert was enough to repay a man for his trouble in coming there yes said lord hampstead his disgust at the man having been quenched for the moment by the charm of the music it is a wonderful spot for echoes  its what i call awfully nice we dont have anything like that up at st martinslegrand perhaps it may be necessary to explain that the post office in london stands in a spot bearing that poetic name  i dont remember any echoes there said lord hampstead  no indeednor yet no hunting nor yet no hounds are there my lord all the same its not a bad sort of place  a very respectable public establishment said lord hampstead  just so my lord thats just what i always say it aint swell like downing street but its a deal more respectable than the custom house  is it i didnt know  oh yes they all admit that you ask roden else on hearing the name lord hampstead began to move his horse but crocker was at his side and could not be shaken off have you heard from him my lord since you have been down in these parts  not a word  i dare say he thinks more of writing to a correspondent of the fairer sex  this was unbearable though the fox had again turned and gone up the valleya movement which seemed to threaten his instant death and to preclude any hope of a run from that spothampstead felt himself compelled to escape if he could in his anger he touched his horse with his spur and galloped away among the rocks as though his object was to assist mr amblethwaite in his almost frantic efforts but crocker cared nothing for the stones where the lord went he went having made acquaintance with a lord he was not going to waste the blessing which providence had vouchsafed to him  hell never leave that place alive my lord  i dare say not and again the persecuted nobleman rode onthinking that neither should crocker if he could have his will  by the way as we are talking of roden  i havent been talking about him at all crocker caught the tone of anger and stared at his companion id rather not talk about him  my lord i hope there has been nothing like a quarrel for the ladys sake i hope theres no misunderstanding  mr crocker he said very slowly it isnt customary  at that moment the fox broke the hounds were away and mr amblethwaite was seen rushing down the hillside as though determined on breaking his neck lord hampstead rushed after him at a pace which for a time defied mr crocker he became thoroughly ashamed of himself in even attempting to make the man understand that he was sinning against good taste he could not do so without some implied mention of his sister and to allude to his sister in connection with such a man was a profanation he could only escape from the brute was this a punishment which he was doomed to bear for beingas his stepmother was wont to sayuntrue to his order  in the mean time the hounds went at a great pace down the hill some of the old stagers who knew the country well made a wide sweep round to the left whence by lanes and tracks which were known to them they could make their way down to the road which leads along ulleswater to patterdale in doing this they might probably not see the hounds again that daybut such are the charms of hunting in a hilly country they rode miles around and though they did again see the hounds they did not see the hunt to have seen the hounds as they start and to see them again as they are clustering round the huntsman after eating their fox is a great deal to some men  on this occasion it was hampsteads lotand crockersto do much more than that though they had started down a steep valleydown the side rather of a gullythey were not making their way out from among the hills into the low country the fox soon went up againnot back but over an intervening spur of a mountain towards the lake the riding seemed sometimes to hampstead to be impossible but mr amblethwaite did it and he stuck to mr amblethwaite it would have been all very well had not crocker stuck to him if the old roan would only tumble among the stones what an escape there would be but the old roan was true to his character and to give every one his due the post office clerk rode as well as the lord there was nearly an hour and ahalf of it before the hounds ran into their fox just as he was gaining an earth among the bushes and hollies with which airey force is surrounded then on the sloping meadow just above the waterfall the john peel of the hunt dragged out the fox from among the trees and having dismembered him artistically gave him to the hungry hounds then it was that perhaps halfadozen diligent but cautious huntsmen came up and heard all those details of the race which they were afterwards able to give as on their own authority to others who had been as cautious but not so diligent as themselves  one of the best things i ever saw in this country said crocker who had never seen a hound in any other country at this moment he had ridden up alongside of hampstead on the way back to penrith the master and the hounds and crocker must go all the way hampstead would turn off at pooley bridge but still there were four miles during which he would be subjected to his tormentor  yes indeed a very good thing as i was saying mr amblethwaite     chapter xiv  coming home from hunting   lord hampstead had been discussing with mr amblethwaite the difficult nature of hunting in such a county as cumberland the hounds were in the road before them with john peel in the midst of them dick with the ragged pony was behind looking after stragglers together with lord hampstead and the master was a hardriding rough weatherbeaten halfgentleman halffarmer named patterson who lived a few miles beyond penrith and was amblethwaites right hand in regard to hunting just as crocker joined them the road had become narrow and the young lord had fallen a little behind crocker had seized his opportunitybut the lord also seized his and thrust himself in between mr patterson and the master thats all true said the master of course we dont presume to do the thing as you swells do it down in the shires we havent the money and we havent the country and we havent the foxes but i dont know whether for hunting we dont see as much of it as you do  quite as much if i may take today as a sample  very ordinarywasnt it amblethwaite asked patterson who was quite determined to make the most of his own good things  it was not bad today the hounds never left their scent after they found him i think our hillsides carry the scent better than our grasses if you want to ride of course its rough but if you like hunting and dont mind a scramble perhaps you may see it here as well as elsewhere  better a deal from all i hear tell said patterson did you ever hear any music like that in leicestershire my lord  i dont know that ever i did said hampstead i enjoyed myself amazingly  i hope youll come again said the master and that often  certainly if i remain here  i knew his lordship would like it said crocker crowding in on a spot where it was possible for four to ride abreast i think it was quite extraordinary to see how a stranger like his lordship got over our country  clever little orse his lordships on said patterson  its the man more than the beast i think said crocker trying to flatter  the best man in england said patterson cant ride to hounds without a tidy animal under him  nor yet cant the best horse in england stick to hounds without a good man on top of him said the determined crocker patterson gruntedhating flattery and remembering that the man flattered was a lord  then the road became narrow again and hampstead fell a little behind crocker was alongside of him in a moment there seemed to be something mean in running away from the mansomething at any rate absurd in seeming to run away from him hampstead was ashamed in allowing himself to be so much annoyed by such a cause he had already snubbed the man and the man might probably be now silent on the one subject which was so peculiarly offensive i suppose said he beginning a conversation which should show that he was willing to discuss any general matter with mr crocker that the country north and west of penrith is less hilly than this  oh yes my lord a delightful country to ride over in some parts is roden fond of following the hounds my lord  i dont in the least know said hampstead curtly then he made another attempt these hounds dont go as far north as carlisle  oh no my lord never more than eight or ten miles from penrith theyve another pack up in that country nothing like ours but still they do show sport i should have thought now roden would have been just the man to ride to houndsif he got the opportunity  i dont think he ever saw a hound in his life im rather in a hurry and i think i shall trot on  im in a hurry myself said crocker and i shall be happy to show your lordship the way it isnt above a quarter of a miles difference to me going by pooley bridge instead of dallmaine  pray dont do anything of the kind i can find the road whereupon hampstead shook hands cordially with the master bade mr patterson goodbye with a kindly smile and trotted on beyond the hounds as quickly as he could  but crocker was not to be shaken off the fleabitten roan was as good at the end of a day as he was at the beginning and trotted on gallantly when they had gone some quarter of a mile hampstead acknowledged to himself that it was beyond his power to shake off his foe by that time crocker had made good his position close alongside of the lord with his horses head even with that of the other there is a word my lord i want to say to you this crocker muttered somewhat piteously so that hampsteads heart was for the moment softened towards him he checked his horse and prepared himself to listen i hope i havent given any offence i can assure you my lord i havent intended it i have so much respect for your lordship that i wouldnt do it for the world  what was he to do he had been offended he had intended to show that he was offended and yet he did not like to declare as much openly his object had been to stop the man from talking and to do so if possible without making any reference himself to the subject in question were he now to declare himself offended he could hardly do so without making some allusion to his sister but he had determined that he would make no such allusion now as the man appealed to him asking as it were forgiveness for some fault of which he was not himself conscious it was impossible to refrain from making him some answer all right he said im sure you didnt mean anything let us drop it and there will be an end of it  oh certainlyand im sure im very much obliged to your lordship but i dont quite know what it is that ought to be dropped as i am so intimate with roden sitting at the same desk with him every day of my life it did seem natural to speak to your lordship about him  this was true as it had happened that crocker who as well as roden was a post office clerk had appeared as a guest at castle hautboy it had been natural that he should speak of his office companion to a man who was notoriously that companions friend hampstead did not quite believe in the pretended intimacy having heard roden declare that he had not as yet formed any peculiar friendship at the office he had too felt unconsciously that such a one as roden ought not to be intimate with such a one as crocker but there was no cause of offence in this it was natural he said  and then i was unhappy when i thought from what you said that there had been some quarrel  there has been no quarrel said hampstead  i am very glad indeed to hear that he was beginning to touch again on a matter that should have been private what was it to him whether or no there was a quarrel between lord hampstead and roden hampstead therefore again rode on in silence  i should have been so very sorry that anything should have occurred to interfere with our friends brilliant prospects lord hampstead looked about to see whether there was any spot at which he could make his escape by jumping over a fence on the right hand there was the lake rippling up on to the edge of the road and on the left was a high stone wall without any vestige of an aperture through it as far as the eye could reach he was already making the pace as fast as he could and was aware that no escape could be effected in that manner he shook his head and bit the handle of his whip and looked straight away before him through his horses ears you cannot think how proud ive been that a gentleman sitting at the same desk with myself should have been so fortunate in his matrimonial prospects i think it an honour to the post office all round  mr crocker said lord hampstead pulling up his horse suddenly and standing still upon the spot if you will remain here for five minutes i will ride on or if you will ride on i will remain here till you are out of sight i must insist that one of these arrangements be made  my lord  which shall it be  now i have offended you again  dont talk of offence but just do as i bid you i want to be alone  is it about the matrimonial alliance demanded crocker almost in tears thereupon lord hampstead turned his horse round and trotted back towards the hounds and horsemen whom he heard on the road behind him crocker paused a moment trying to discover by the light of his own intellect what might have been the cause of this singular conduct on the part of the young nobleman and then having failed to throw any light on the matter he rode on homewards immersed in deep thought hampstead when he found himself again with his late companions asked some idle questions as to the hunting arrangements of next week that they were idle he was quite aware having resolved that he would not willingly put himself into any position in which it might be probable that he should again meet that objectionable young man but he went on with his questions listening or not listening to mr amblethwaites answers till he parted company with his companions in the neighbourhood of pooley bridge then he rode alone to hautboy castle with his mind much harassed by what had occurred it seemed to him to have been almost proved that george roden must have spoken to this man of his intended marriage in all that the man had said he had suggested that the information had come direct from his fellowclerk he had seemed to declarehampstead thought that he had declaredthat roden had often discussed the marriage with him if so how base must have been his friends conduct how thoroughly must he have been mistaken in his friends character how egregiously wrong must his sister have been in her estimate of the man for himself as long as the question had been simply one of his own intimacy with a companion whose outside position in the world had been inferior to his own he had been proud of what he had done and had answered those who had remonstrated with him with a spirit showing that he despised their practices quite as much as they could ridicule his he had explained to his father his own ideas of friendship and had been eager in showing that george rodens company was superior to most young men of his own position there had been hautboy and scatterdash and lord plunge and the young earl of longoolds all of them elder sons whom he described as young men without a serious thought in their heads what was it to him how roden got his bread so long as he got it honestly the mans the man for a that thus he had defended himself and been quite conscious that he was right when roden had suddenly fallen in love with his sister and his sister had as suddenly fallen in love with rodenthen he had begun to doubt a thing which was in itself meritorious might become dangerous and objectionable by reason of other things which it would bring in its train he felt for a time that associations which were good for himself might not be so good for his sister there seemed to be a sanctity about her rank which did not attach to his own he had thought that the post office clerk was as good as himself but he could not assure himself that he was as good as the ladies of his family then he had begun to reason with himself on this subject as he did on all what was there different in a girls nature that ought to make her fastidious as to society which he felt to be good enough for himself in entertaining the feeling which had been strong within him as to that feminine sanctity was he not giving way to one of those empty prejudices of the world in opposition to which he had resolved to make a lifelong fight so he had reasoned with himself but his reason though it affected his conduct did not reach his taste it irked him to think there should be this marriage though he was strong in his resolution to uphold his sisterand if necessary to defend her he had not given way as to the marriage it had been settled between himself and his sister and his father that there should be no meeting of the lovers at hendon hall he did hope that the engagement might die away though he was determined to cling to her even though she clung to her lover this was his state of mind when this hideous young man who seemed to have been created with the object of showing him how low a creature a post office clerk could be came across him and almost convinced him that that other post office clerk had been boasting among his official associates of the favours of the highborn lady who had unfortunately become attached to him he would stick to his politics to his radical theories to his old ideas about social matters generally but he was almost tempted to declare to himself that women for the present ought to be regarded as exempt from those radical changes which would be good for men for himself his order was a vanity and a delusion but for his sister it must still be held as containing some bonds in this frame of mind he determined that he would return to hendon hall almost immediately further hope of hunting with the braeside harriers there was none and it was necessary for him to see roden as soon as possible  that evening at the castle lady amaldina got hold of him and asked him his advice as to her future duties as a married woman lady amaldina was very fond of little confidences as to her future life and had as yet found no opportunity of demanding the sympathy of her cousin hampstead was not in truth her cousin but they called each other cousinsor were called so none of the hauteville family felt any of that aversion to the radicalism of the heir to the marquisate which the marchioness entertained lady amaldina delighted to be amy to lord hampstead and was very anxious to ask him his advice as to lord llwddythlw  of course you know all about my marriage hampstead she said  i dont know anything about it hampstead replied  oh hampstead how illnatured  nobody knows anything about it because it hasnt taken place  that is so like a radical to be so precise and rational my engagement then  yes ive heard a great deal about that weve been talking about that forhow long shall i say  dont be disagreeable of course such a man as llwddythlw cant be married all in a hurry just like anybody else  what a misfortune for him  why should it be a misfortune  i should think it so if i were going to be married to you  thats the prettiest thing i have ever heard you say at any rate he has got to put up with it and so have i it is a bore because people will talk about nothing else what do you think of llwddythlw as a public man  i havent thought about it i havent any means of thinking i am so completely a private man myself that i know nothing of public men i hope hes good at going to sleep  going to sleep  otherwise it must be so dull sitting so many hours in the house of commons but hes been at it a long time and i dare say hes used to it  isnt it well that a man in his position should have a regard to his country  every man ought to have a regard to his countrybut a stronger regard if it be possible to the world at large  lady amaldina stared at him not knowing in the least what he meant you are so droll she said you never i think think of the position you were born to fill  oh yes i do im a man and i think a great deal about it  but youve got to be marquis of kingsbury and llwddythlw has got to be duke of merioneth he never forgets it for a moment  what a nuisance for himand for you  why should it be a nuisance for me cannot a woman understand her duties as well as a man  quite so if she knows how to get a glimpse at them  i do said lady amaldina earnestly i am always getting glimpses at them i am quite aware of the functions which it will become me to perform when i am llwddythlws wife  mother of his children  i didnt mean that at all hampstead thats all in the hands of the almighty but in becoming the future duchess of merioneth  thats in the hands of the almighty too isnt it  no yes of course everything is in gods hands  the children the dukedom and all the estates  i never knew any one so provoking she exclaimed  one is at any rate as much as another  you dont a bit understand me she said of course if i go and get married i do get married  and if you have children you do have children if you doand i hope you willim sure theyll be very pretty and well behaved that will be your duty and then youll have to see that llwddythlw has what he likes for dinner  i shall do nothing of the kind  then hell dine at the club or at the house of commons thats my idea of married life  nothing beyond that no community of soul  certainly not  no  because you believe in the trinity llwddythlw wont go to heaven if he were to take to gambling and drinking you wouldnt go to the other place  how can you be so horrid  that would be a community of soulsas souls are understood a community of interests i hope you will have and in order that you may take care and look after his dinner she could not make much more of her cousin in the way of confidence but she did exact a promise from him that he would be in attendance at her wedding  a few days afterwards he returned to hendon park leaving his sister to remain for a fortnight longer at castle hautboy     chapter xv  marion fay and her father   i saw him go in a full quarter of an hour since and marion fay went in before i feel quite sure that she knew that he was expected thus spoke clara demijohn to her mother  how could she have known it asked mrs duffer who was present in mrs demijohns parlour where the two younger women were standing with their faces close to the window with their gloves on and best bonnets ready for church  i am sure she did because she had made herself smarter than ever with her new brown silk and her new brown gloves and her new brown hatsly little quaker that she is i can see when a girl has made herself up for some special occasion she wouldnt have put on new gloves surely to go to church with mrs roden  if you stay staring there any longer youll both be late said mrs demijohn  mrs roden hasnt gone yet said clara lingering it was sunday morning and the ladies at no 10 were preparing for their devotions mrs demijohn herself never went to church having some years since had a temporary attack of sciatica which had provided her with a perpetual excuse for not leaving the house on a sunday morning she was always left at home with a volume of blairs sermons but clara who was a clever girl was well aware that more than half a page was never read she was aware also that great progress was then made with the novel which happened to have last come into the house from the little circulating library round the corner the ringing of the neighbouring church bell had come to its final tinkling and mrs duffer knew that she must start or disgrace herself in the eyes of the pewopener come my dear she said and away they went as the door of no 10 opened so did that of no 11 opposite and the four ladies including marion fay met in the road you have a visitor this morning said clara  yesa friend of my sons  we know all about it said clara dont you think hes a very finelooking young man miss fay  yes i do said marion he is certainly a handsome young man  beauty is but skin deep said mrs duffer  but still it goes a long way said clara particularly with high birth and noble rank  he is an excellent young man as far as i know him said mrs roden thinking that she was called upon to defend her sons friend  hampstead had returned home on the saturday and had taken the earliest opportunity on the following sunday morning to go over to his friend at holloway the distance was about six miles and he had driven over sending the vehicle back with the intention of walking home he would get his friend to walk with him and then should take place that conversation which he feared would become excessively unpleasant before it was finished he was shown up to the drawingroom of no 11 and there he found all alone a young woman whom he had never seen before this was marion fay the daughter of zachary fay a quaker who lived at no 17 paradise row i had thought mrs roden was here he said  mrs roden will be down directly she is putting her bonnet on to go to church  and mr roden he asked he i suppose is not going to church with her  ah no i wish he were george roden never goes to church  is he a friend of yours  for his mothers sake i was speakingbut why not for his also he is not specially my friend but i wish well to all men he is not at home at present but i understood that he will be here shortly  do you always go to church he asked grounding his question not on any impertinent curiosity as to her observance of her religious duties but because he had thought from her dress she must certainly be a quaker  i do usually go to your church on a sunday  nay said he i have no right to claim it as my church i fear you must regard me also as a heathenas you do george roden  i am sorry for that sir it cannot be good that any man should be a heathen when so much christian teaching is abroad but men i think allow themselves a freedom of thought from which women in their timidity are apt to shrink if so it is surely good that we should be cowards then the door opened and mrs roden came into the room  george is gone she said to call on a sick friend but he will be back immediately he got your letter yesterday evening and he left word that i was to tell you that he would be back by eleven have you introduced yourself to my friend miss fay  i had not heard her name he said smiling but we had introduced ourselves  marion fay is my name said the girl and yours i suppose islord hampstead  so now we may be supposed to know each other for ever after he replied laughing only i fear mrs roden that your friend will repudiate the acquaintance because i do not go to church  i said not so lord hampstead the nearer we were to being friendsif that were possiblethe more i should regret it then the two ladies started on their morning duty  lord hampstead when he was alone immediately decided that he would like to have marion fay for a friend and not the less so because she went to church he felt that she had been right in saying that audacity in speculation on religious subjects was not becoming a young woman as it was unfitting that his sister lady frances should marry a post office clerk so would it have been unbecoming that marion fay should have been what she herself called a heathen surely of all the women on whom his eyes had ever rested she washe would not say to himself the most lovelybut certainly the best worth looking at the close brown bonnet and the little cap and the wellmade brown silk dress and the brown gloves on her little hands together made to his eyes as pleasing a female attire as a girl could well wear could it have been by accident that the graces of her form were so excellently shown it had to be supposed that she as a quaker was indifferent to outside feminine garniture it is the theory of a quaker that she should be so and in every article she had adhered closely to quaker rule as far as he could see there was not a ribbon about her there was no variety of colour her headdress was as simple and close as any that could have been worn by her grandmother hardly a margin of smooth hair appeared between her cap and her forehead her dress fitted close to her neck and on her shoulders she wore a tightfitting shawl the purpose in her raiment had been quaker all through the exquisite grace must have come altogether by accidentjust because it had pleased nature to make her gracious as to all this there might perhaps be room for doubt whether there had been design or not might possibly afford scope for consideration but that the grace was there was a matter which required no consideration and admitted of no doubt  as marion fay will have much to do with our story it will be well that some further description should be given here of herself and of her condition in life zachary fay her father with whom she lived was a widower with no other living child there had been many others who had all died as had also their mother she had been a prey to consumption but had lived long enough to know that she had bequeathed the fatal legacy to her offspringto all of them except to marion who when her mother died had seemed to be exempted from the terrible curse of the family she had then been old enough to receive her mothers last instructions as to her father who was then a brokenhearted man struggling with difficulty against the cruelty of providence why should it have been that god should thus afflict himhim who had no other pleasure in the world no delights but those which were afforded to him by the love of his wife and children it was to be her duty to comfort him to make up as best she might by her tenderness for all that he had lost and was losing it was to be especially her duty to soften his heart in all worldly matters and to turn him as far as possible to the love of heavenly things it was now two years since her mothers death and in all things she had endeavoured to perform the duties which her mother had exacted from her  but zachary fay was not a man whom it was easy to turn hither and thither he was a stern hard just man of whom it may probably be said that if a world were altogether composed of such the condition of such a world would be much better than that of the world we knowfor generosity is less efficacious towards permanent good than justice and tender speaking less enduring in its beneficial results than truth his enemies for he had enemies said of him that he loved money it was no doubt true for he that does not love money must be an idiot he was certainly a man who liked to have what was his own who would have been irate with any one who had endeavoured to rob him of his own or had hindered him in his just endeavour to increase his own that which belonged to another he did not covetunless it might be in the way of earning it things had prospered with him and he wasfor his condition in lifea rich man but his worldly prosperity had not for a moment succeeded in lessening the asperity of the blow which had fallen upon him with all his sternness he was essentially a loving man to earn money he would sayor perhaps more probably would only thinkwas the necessity imposed upon man by the fall of adam but to have something warm at his heart something that should be infinitely dearer to him than himself and all his possessionsthat was what had been left of divine essence in a man even after the fall of adam now the one living thing left for him to love was his daughter marion  he was not a man whose wealth was of high order or his employment of great moment or he would not probably have been living at holloway in paradise row he was and had now been for many years senior clerk to messrs pogson and littlebird commission agents at the top of kings court old broad street by messrs pogson and littlebird he was trusted with everything and had become so amalgamated with the firm as to have achieved in the city almost the credit of a merchant himself there were some who thought that zachary fay must surely be a partner in the house or he would not have been so well known or so much respected among merchants themselves but in truth he was no more than senior clerk with a salary amounting to four hundred a year nor though he was anxious about his money would he have dreamed of asking for any increase of his stipend it was for messrs pogson and littlebird to say what his services were worth he would not on any account have lessened his authority with them by becoming a suppliant for increased payment but for many years he had spent much less than his income and had known how to use his city experiences in turning his savings to the best account thus as regarded paradise row and its neighbourhood zachary fay was a rich man  he was now old turned seventy tall and thin with long grey hair with a slight stoop in his shouldersbut otherwise hale as well as healthy he went every day to his office leaving his house with strict punctuality at halfpast eight and entering the door of the countinghouse just as the clock struck nine with equal accuracy he returned home at six having dined in the middle of the day at an eatinghouse in the city all this time was devoted to the interests of the firm except for three hours on thursday during which he attended a meeting in a quaker house of worship on these occasions marion always joined him making a journey into the city for the purpose she would fain have induced him also to accompany her on sundays to the english church but to this he never would consent at her instanceas he had refused to do so at the instance of his wife he was he said a quaker and did not mean to be aught else than a quaker in truth though he was very punctual at those quaker meetings he was not at heart a religious man to go through certain formularies quaker though he was was as sufficient to him as to many other votaries of church ordinances he had been brought up to attend quaker meetings and no doubt would continue to attend them as long as his strength might suffice but it may be presumed of him without harsh judgment that the price of stocks was often present to his mind during those tedious hours in the meetinghouse in his language he always complied with the strict tenets of his sect thouing and theeing all those whom he addressed but he had assented to an omission in this matter on the part of his daughter recognizing the fact that there could be no falsehood in using a mode of language common to all the world if a plural pronoun of ignoble sound so he said were used commonly for the singular because the singular was too grand and authoritative for ordinary use it was no doubt a pity that the language should be so injured but there could be no untruth in such usage and it was better that at any rate the young should adhere to the manner of speech which was common among those with whom they lived thus marion was saved from the thees and the thous and escaped that touch of hypocrisy which seems to permeate the now antiquated speeches of quakers zachary fay in these latter years of his life was never known to laugh or to joke but if circumstances were favourable he would sometimes fall into a quaint mode of conversation in which there was something of drollery and something also of sarcasm but this was unfrequent as zachary was slow in making new friends and never conversed after this fashion with the mere acquaintance of the hour  of marion fays appearance something has already been said enough perhapsnot to impress any clear idea of her figure on the minds eye of a reader for that i regard as a feat beyond the power of any writerbut to enable the reader to form a conception of his own she was small of stature it should be said with limbs exquisitely made it was not the brilliance of her eyes or the chiselled correctness of her features which had struck hampstead so forcibly as a certain expression of earnest eloquence which pervaded her whole form and there was a fleeting brightness of colour which went about her cheeks and forehead and ran around her mouth which gave to her when she was speaking a brilliance which was hardly to be expected from the ordinary lines of her countenance had you been asked you would have said that she was a brunettetill she had been worked to some excitement in talking then i think you would have hardly ventured to describe her complexion by any single word lord hampstead had he been asked what he thought about her as he sat waiting for his friend would have declared that some divinity of grace had been the peculiar gift which had attracted him and yet that rapid change of colour had not passed unobserved as she told him that she was sorry that he did not go to church  marion fays life in paradise row would have been very lonely had she not become acquainted with mrs roden before her mothers death now hardly a day passed but what she spent an hour with that lady they were indeed fast friendsso much so that mrs vincent had also come to know marion and approving of the girls religious tendencies had invited her to spend two or three days at wimbledon this was impossible because marion would never leave her fatherbut she had once or twice gone over with mrs roden when she made her weekly call and had certainly ingratiated herself with the austere lady other society she had none nor did she seem to desire it clara demijohn seeing the intimacy which had been struck up between marion and mrs rodenas to which she had her own little jealousies to endurewas quite sure that marion was setting her cap at the post office clerk and had declared in confidence to mrs duffer that the girl was doing it in the most brazenfaced manner clara had herself on more than one occasion contrived to throw herself in the clerks way on his return homewards on dusky eveningsperhaps intent only on knowing what might be the young mans intentions as to marion fay the young man had been courteous to her but she had declared to mrs duffer that he was one of those stiff young men who dont care for ladies society these are they said mrs duffer who marry the readiest and make the best husbands ohshell go on sticking to him till she dont leave a stone unturned said clarathereby implying that as far as she was concerned she did not think it worth her while to continue her attacks unless a young man would give way to her at once george had been asked more than once to drink tea at no 10 but had been asked in vain clara therefore had declared quite loudly that marion had made an absolute prisoner of himhad bound him hand and footwould not let him call his life his own she interrupts him constantly as he comes from the office she said to mrs duffer i call that downright unfeminine audacity yet she knew that mrs duffer knew that she had intercepted the young man mrs duffer took it all in good part knowing very well how necessary it is that a young woman should fight her own battle strenuously  in the mean time marion fay and george roden were good friends he is engagedi must not say to whom mrs roden had said to her young friend it will i fear be a long long tedious affair you must not speak of it  if she be true to him i hope he will be true to her said marion with true feminine excitement  i only fear that he will be too true  no nothat cannot be even though he suffer let him be true you may be sure i will not mention itto him or to any one i like him so well that i do hope he may not suffer much from that time she found herself able to regard george roden as a real friend and to talk to him as though there need be no cause for dreading an intimacy with an engaged man a girl may suffer herself to be intimate     chapter xvi  the walk back to hendon   i was here a little early said hampstead when his friend came in and i found your mother just going to churchwith a friend  marion fay  yes miss fay  she is the daughter of a quaker who lives a few doors off but though she is a quaker she goes to church as well i envy the tone of mind of those who are able to find a comfort in pouring themselves out in gratitude to the great unknown god  i pour myself out in gratitude said hampstead but with me it is an affair of solitude  i doubt whether you ever hold yourself for two hours in commune with heavenly power and heavenly influence something more than gratitude is necessary you must conceive that there is a dutyby the nonperformance of which you would encounter peril then comes the feeling of safety which always follows the performance of a duty that i never can achieve what did you think of marion fay  she is a most lovely creature  very pretty is she not particularly when speaking  i never care for female beauty that does not display itself in actioneither speaking moving laughing or perhaps only frowning said hampstead enthusiastically i was talking the other day to a sort of cousin of mine who has a reputation of being a remarkably handsome young woman she had ever so much to say to me and when i was in company with her a page in buttons kept coming into the room he was a roundfaced highcheeked ugly boy but i thought him so much betterlooking than my cousin because he opened his mouth when he spoke and showed his eagerness by his eyes  your cousin is complimented  she has made her market so it does not signify the greeks seem to me to have regarded form without expression i doubt whether phidias would have done much with your miss fay to my eyes she is the perfection of loveliness  she is not my miss fay she is my mothers friend  your mother is lucky a woman without vanity without jealousy without envy  where will you find one  your mother such a woman as that can i think enjoy feminine loveliness almost as much as a man  i have often heard my mother speak of marions good qualities but not much of her loveliness to me her great charm is her voice she speaks musically  as one can fancy melpomene did does she come here often  every day i fancybut not generally when i am here not but what she and i are great friends she will sometimes go with me into town on a thursday morning on her way to the meeting house  lucky fellow roden shrugged his shoulders as though conscious that any luck of that kind must come to him from another quarter if it came at all  what does she talk about  religion generally  and you  anything else if she will allow me she would wish to convert me i am not at all anxious to convert her really believing that she is very well as she is  yes said hampstead that is the worst of what we are apt to call advanced opinions with all my selfassurance i never dare to tamper with the religious opinions of those who are younger or weaker than myself i feel that they at any rate are safe if they are in earnest no one i think has ever been put in danger by believing christ to be a god  they none of them know what they believe said roden nor do you or i men talk of belief as though it were a settled thing it is so but with few and that only with those who lack imagination what sort of a time did you have down at castle hautboy  ohi dont knowpretty well everybody was very kind and my sister likes it the scenery is lovely you can look up a long reach of ulleswater from the castle terrace and there is helvellyn in the distance the house was full of peoplewho despised me more than i did them  which is saying a great deal perhaps  there were some uncommon apes one young lady not very young asked me what i meant to do with all the land in the world when i took it away from everybody i told her that when it was all divided equally there would be a nice little estate even for all the daughters and that in such circumstances all the sons would certainly get married she acknowledged that such a result would be excellent but she did not believe in it a world in which the men should want to marry was beyond her comprehension i went out hunting one day  the hunting i should suppose was not very good  but for one drawback it would have been very good indeed  the mountains i should have thought would be one drawback and the lakes another  not at all i liked the mountains because of their echoes and the lakes did not come in our way  where was the fault  there came a man  whom you disliked  who was a bore  could you not shut him up  no nor shake him off i did at last do that but it was by turning round and riding backwards when we were coming home i had just invited him to ride on while i stood stillbut he wouldnt  did it come to that  quite to that i actually turned tail and ran away from himnot as we ordinarily do in society when we sneak off under some pretence leaving the pretender to think that he has made himself very pleasant but with a full declaration of my opinion and intention  who was he  that was the question hampstead had come there on purpose to say who the man wasand to talk about the man with great freedom and he was determined to do so but he preferred not to begin that which he intended to be a severe accusation against his friend till they were walking together and he did not wish to leave the house without saying a word further about marion fay it was his intention to dine all alone at hendon hall how much nicer it would be if he could dine in paradise row with marion fay he knew it was mrs rodens custom to dine early after church on sundays so that the two maidens who made up her establishment might go outeither to church or to their lovers or perhaps to both as might best suit them he had dined there once or twice already eating the humble but social leg of mutton of holloway in preference to the varied but solitary banquet of hendon he was of opinion that really intimate acquaintance demanded the practice of social feeling to know a man very well and never to sit at table with him was according to his views of life altogether unsatisfactory though the leg of mutton might be cold and have no other accompaniment but the common illboiled potato yet it would be better than any banquet prepared simply for the purpose of eating he was gregarious and now felt a longing of which he was almost ashamed to be admitted to the same pastures with marion fay there was not however the slightest reason for supposing that marion fay would dine at no 11 even were he asked to do so himself nothing in fact could be less probable as marion fay never deserted her father nor did he like to give any hint to his friend that he was desirous of further immediate intimacy with marion there would be an absurdity in doing so which he did not dare to perpetrate only if he could have passed the morning in paradise row and then have walked home with roden in the dark evening he could he thought have said what he had to say very conveniently  but it was impossible he sat silent for some minute or two after roden had asked the name of the bore of the hunting field and then answered him by proposing that they should start together on their walk towards hendon i am all ready but you must tell me the name of this dreadful man  as soon as we have started i will i have come here on purpose to tell you  to tell me the name of the man you ran away from in cumberland  exactly thatcome along and so they started more than an hour before the time at which marion fay would return from church the man who annoyed me so out hunting was an intimate friend of yours  i have not an intimate friend in the world except yourself  not marion fay  i meant among men i do not suppose that marion fay was out hunting in cumberland  i should not have ran away from her i think if she had it was mr crocker of the general post office  crocker in cumberland  certainly he was in cumberlandunless some one personated him i met him dining at castle hautboy when he was kind enough to make himself known to me and again out huntingwhen he did more than make himself known to me  i am surprised  is he not away on leave  oh yeshe is away on leave i do not doubt that it was he  why should he not be in cumberlandwhen as it happens his father is landsteward or something of that sort to my uncle persiflage  because i did not know that he had any connection with cumberland why not cumberland or westmoreland or northumberland you may say why notor yorkshire or lincolnshire or norfolk i certainly did not suppose that a post office clerk out on his holidays would be found hunting in any county  you have never heard of his fleabitten horse  not a word i didnt know that he had ever sat upon a horse and now will you let me know why you have called him my friend  is he not so  by no means  does he not sit at the same desk with you  certainly he does  i think i should be friends with a man if i sat at the same desk with him  with crocker even asked roden  well he might be an exception  but if an exception to you why not also an exception to me as it happens crocker has made himself disagreeable to me instead of being my friend he isi will not say my enemy because i should be making too much of him but nearer to being so than any one i know now what is the meaning of all this why did he trouble you especially down in cumberland why do you call him my friend and why do you wish to speak to me about him  he introduced himself to me and told me that he was your special friend  then he lied  i should not have cared about thatbut he did more  what more did he do  i would have been courteous to himif only because he sat at the same desk with youbut  but what  there are things which are difficult to be told  if they have to be told they had better be told said roden almost angrily  whether friend or not he knew ofyour engagement with my sister  impossible  he told me of it said lord hampstead impetuously his tongue now at length loosed told me of it he spoke of it again and again to my extreme disgust though the thing had been fixed as fate he should not have mentioned it  certainly not  but he did nothing but tell me of your happiness and good luck and the rest of it it was impossible to stop him so that i had to ride away from him i bade him be silentas plainly as i could without mentioning fannys name but it was of no use  how did he know it  you told him  i  so he said this was not strictly the case crocker had so introduced the subject as to have avoided the palpable lie of declaring that the tidings had been absolutely given by roden to himself but he had not the less falsely intended to convey that impression to hampstead and had conveyed it he gave me to understand that you were speaking about it continually at your office roden turned round and looked at the other man white with rageas though he could not allow himself to utter a word it was as i tell you he began it at the castle and afterwards continued it whenever he could get near me when hunting  and you believed him  when he repeated his story so often what was i to do  knock him off his horse  and so be forced to speak of my sister to every one in the hunt and in the county you do not feel how much is due to a girls name  i think i do i think that of all men i am the most likely to feel what is due to the name of lady frances trafford of course i never mentioned it to any one at the post office  from whom had he heard it  how can i answer that probably through some of your own family it has made its way through lady kingsbury to castle hautboy and has then been talked about i am not responsible for that  not for that certainlyif it be so  nor because such a one as he has lied you should not have believed it of me  i was bound to ask you  you were bound to tell me but should not have asked me there are things which do not require asking what must i do with him  nothing nothing can be done you could not touch the subject without alluding to my sister she is coming back to hendon in another week  she was there before but i did not see her  of course you did not see her how should you  simply by going there  she would not have seen you there came a black frown over rodens brow as he heard this it has been understood between my father and fanny and myself that you should not come to hendon while she is living with me  should not i have been a party to that agreement  hardly i think this agreement must have been made whether you assented or not on no other terms would my father have permitted her to come it was most desirable that she should be separated from lady kingsbury  oh yes  and therefore the agreement was advisable i would not have had her on any other terms  why not  because i think that such visitings would have been unwise it is no use my blinking it to you i do not believe that the marriage is practicable  i do  as i dont of course i cannot be a party to throwing you together were you to persist in coming you would only force me to find a home for her elsewhere  i have not disturbed you  you have not now i want you to promise me that you will not i have assured my father that it shall be so will you say that you will neither come to her at hendon hall or write to her while she is staying with me he paused on the road for an answer but roden walked on without making one and hampstead was forced to accompany him will you promise me  i will not promise i will do nothing which may possibly subject me to be called a liar i have no wish to knock at any door at which i do not think myself to be welcome  you know how welcome you would be at mine but for her  it might be that i should find myself forced to endeavour to see her and i will therefore make no promise a man should fetter himself by no assurances of that kind as to his conduct if a man be a drunkard it may be well that he should bind himself by a vow against drinking but he who can rule his own conduct should promise nothing goodday now i must be back to dinner with my mother  then he took his leave somewhat abruptly and returned hampstead went on to hendon with his thoughts sometimes fixed on his sister sometimes on roden whom he regarded as impracticable sometimes on that horrid crockerbut more generally on marion fay whom he resolved that he must see again whatever might be the difficulties in his way     chapter xvii  lord hampsteads scheme   during the following week hampstead went down to gorse hall and hunted two or three days with various packs of hounds within his reach declaring to himself that after all leicestershire was better than cumberland because he was known there and no one would dare to treat him as crocker had done never before had his democratic spirit received such a shockor rather the remnant of that aristocratic spirit which he had striven to quell by the wisdom and humanity of democracy that a stranger should have dared to talk to him about one of the ladies of his family no man certainly would do so in northamptonshire or leicestershire he could not quite explain to himself the difference in the localities but he was quite sure that he was safe from anything of that kind at gorse hall  but he had other matters to think of as he galloped about the country how might he best manage to see marion fay his mind was set upon thator perhaps more dangerously still his heart had he been asked before he would have said that there could have been nothing more easy than for such a one as he to make acquaintance with a young lady in paradise row but now when he came to look at it he found that marion fay was environed with fortifications and a chevauxdefrise of difficulties which were apparently impregnable he could not call at no 17 and simply ask for miss fay to do so he must be a proficient in that impudence the lack of which created so many difficulties for him he thought of finding out the quaker chapel in the city and there sitting out the whole proceedingunless desired to leave the placewith the quixotic idea of returning to holloway with her in an omnibus as he looked at this project all round he became sure that the joint journey in an omnibus would never be achieved then he imagined that mrs roden might perhaps give him aid but with what a face could such a one as he ask such a one as mrs roden to assist him in such an enterprise and yet if anything were to be done it must be done through mrs rodenor at any rate through mrs rodens house as to this too there was a new difficulty he had not actually quarrelled with george roden but the two had parted on the road as though there were some hitch in the cordiality of their friendship he had been rebuked for having believed what crocker had told him he did acknowledge to himself that he should not have believed it though crockers lies had been monstrous he should rather have supposed him to be guilty even of lies so monstrous than have suspected his friend of conduct that would certainly have been base even this added something to the difficulties by which marion fay was surrounded  vivian was staying with him at gorse hall i shall go up to london tomorrow he said as the two of them were riding home after hunting on the saturdaythe saturday after the sunday on which hampstead had been in paradise row  tomorrow is sundayno day for travelling said vivian the fitzwilliams are at lilford cross roads on mondaydraw back towards the kennelsafternoon train up from peterborough at 530branch from oundle to meet it 450have your traps sent there its all arranged by providence on monday evening i go to gatcombeso that it will all fit  you need not be disturbed a solitary sunday will enable you to write all your official correspondence for the fortnight  that i should have done even in your presence  i must be at home on monday morning give my love to them all at lilford cross roads i shall be down again before long if my sister can spare meor perhaps i may induce her to come and rough it here for a week or two he was as good as his word and travelled up to london and thence across to hendon hall on the sunday  it might have been said that no young man could have had stronger inducements for clinging to his sport or fewer reasons for abandoning it his stables were full of horses the weather was good the hunting had been excellent his friends were all around him and he had nothing else to do his sister intended to remain for yet another week at castle hautboy and hendon hall of itself had certainly no special attractions at the end of november but marion fay was on his mind and he had arranged his scheme his scheme as far as he knew would be as practicable on a tuesday as on a monday but he was impatient and for the nonce preferred marion fay whom he probably would not find to the foxes which would certainly be found in the neighbourhood of lilford cross roads  it was not much of a scheme after all he would go over to paradise row and call on mrs roden he would then explain to her what had taken place between him and george and leave some sort of apology for the offended post office clerk then he would ask them both to come over and dine with him on some day before his sisters return in what way marion fays name might be introduced or how she might be brought into the arrangement he must leave to the chapter of accidents on the monday he left home at about two oclock and making a roundabout journey viâ baker street kings cross and islington went down to holloway by an omnibus he had become somewhat abashed and perplexed as to his visits to paradise row having learned to entertain a notion that some of the people there looked at him it was hard he thought that if he had a friend in that or any other street he should not be allowed to visit his friend without creating attention he was not aware of the special existence of mrs demijohn or of clara or of mrs duffer nor did he know from what window exactly the eyes of curious inhabitants were fixed upon him but he was conscious that an interest was taken in his comings and goings as long as his acquaintance in the street was confined to the inhabitants of no 11 this did not very much signify though the neighbours should become aware that he was intimate with mrs roden or her son he need not care much about that but if he should succeed in adding marion fay to the number of his holloway friends then he thought inquisitive eyes might be an annoyance it was on this account that he made his way down in an omnibus and felt that there was something almost of hypocrisy in the soft unpretending and almost skulking manner in which he crept up paradise row as though his walking there was really of no moment to any one as he looked round after knocking at mrs rodens door he saw the figure of clara demijohn standing a little back from the parlour window of the house opposite  mrs roden is at home said the maid but there are friends with her nevertheless she showed the young lord up to the drawingroom there were friends indeed it was mrs vincents day for coming and she was in the room that alone would not have been much but with the two elder ladies was seated marion fay so far at any rate fortune had favoured him but now there was a difficulty in explaining his purpose he could not very well give his general invitationgeneral at any rate as regarded marion faybefore mrs vincent  of course there was an introduction mrs vincent who had often heard lord hampsteads name in spite of her general severity was open to the allurements of nobility she was glad to meet the young man although she had strong reasons for believing that he was not a tower of strength on matters of faith hampstead and marion fay shook hands as though they were old friends and then the conversation naturally fell upon george roden  you didnt expect my son i hope said the mother  oh dear no i had a message to leave for him which will do just as well in a note  this was to some extent unfortunate because it made both mrs vincent and marion feel that they were in the way  i think ill send betsy down for the brougham said the former the brougham which brought mrs vincent was always in the habit of retiring round the corner to the duchess of edinburgh where the driver had succeeded in creating for himself quite an intimacy  pray do not stir madam said hampstead for he had perceived from certain preparations made by miss fay that she would find it necessary to follow mrs vincent out of the room i will write two words for roden and that will tell him all i have to say  then the elder ladies went back to the matter they were discussing before lord hampstead had appeared i was asking this young lady said mrs vincent to come with me for two or three days down to brighton it is absolutely the fact that she has never seen brighton  as mrs vincent went to brighton twice annually for a month at the beginning of the winter and then again for a fortnight in the spring it seemed to her a wonderful thing that any one living even at holloway should never have seen the place  i think it would be a very good thing said mrs rodenif your father can spare you  i never leave my father said marion  dont you think my lord said mrs vincent that she looks as though she wanted a change  authorized by this lord hampstead took the opportunity of gazing at marion and was convinced that the young lady wanted no change at all there was certainly no room for improvement but it occurred to him on the spur of the moment that he too might spend two or three days at brighton and that he might find his opportunities there easier than in paradise row yes indeed he said a change is always good i never like to stay long in one place myself  some people must stay in one place said marion with a smile father has to go to his business and would be very uncomfortable if there were no one to give him his meals and sit at table with him  he could spare you for a day or two said mrs roden who knew that it would be well for marion that she should sometimes be out of london  i am sure that he would not begrudge you a short recreation like that said mrs vincent  he never begrudges me anything we did go down to cowes for a fortnight in april though i am quite sure that papa himself would have preferred remaining at home all the time he does not believe in the newfangled idea of changing the air  doesnt he said mrs vincent i do i know where i live at wimbledon may be said to be more country than town but if i were to remain all the year without moving i should become so low and out of sorts that i veritably believe they would have to bury me before the first year was over  father says that when he was young it was only people of rank and fashion who went out of town regularly and that folk lived as long then as they do now  i think people get used to living and dying according to circumstances said hampstead our ancestors did a great many things which we regard as quite fatal they drank their water without filtering it and ate salt meat all the winter through they did very little in the washing way and knew nothing of ventilation yet they contrived to live marion fay however was obstinate and declared her purpose of declining mrs vincents kind invitation there was a good deal more said about it because hampstead managed to make various propositions he was very fond of the sea himself he said and would take them all round including mrs vincent and mrs roden in his yacht if not to brighton at any rate to cowes december was not exactly the time for yachting and as brighton could be reached in an hour by railway he was driven to abandon that proposition with a little laughter at his own absurdity  but it was all done with a gaiety and a kindness which quite won mrs vincents heart she stayed considerably beyond her accustomed hour to the advantage of the proprietor of the duchess of edinburgh and at last sent betsy down to the corner in high good humour i declare lord hampstead she said i ought to charge you threeandsixpence before i go i shall have to break into another hour because i have stayed talking to you pritchard never lets me off if i am not back punctually by four then she took her departure  you neednt go marion said mrs rodenunless lord hampstead has something special to say to me lord hampstead declared that he had nothing special to say and marion did not go  but i have something special to say said hampstead when the elder lady was quite gone but miss fay may know it just as well as yourself as we were walking to hendon on sunday a matter came up as to which george and i did not agree  there was no quarrel i hope said the mother  oh dear nobut we werent best pleased with each other therefore i want you both to come and dine with me one day this week i shall be engaged on saturday but any day before that will do mrs roden put on a very serious look on receiving the proposition having never before been invited to the house of her sons friend nor for some years past had she dined out with any acquaintance and yet she could not think at the moment of any reason why she should not do so i was going to ask miss fay to come with you  oh quite impossible said marion it is very kind my lord but i never go out do i mrs roden  that seems to me a reason why you should begin of course i understand about your father but i should be delighted to make his acquaintance if you would bring him  he rarely goes out lord hampstead  then he will have less power to plead that he is engaged what do you say mrs roden it would give me the most unaffected pleasure like your father miss fay i too am unaccustomed to much going out as you call it i am as peculiar as he is let us acknowledge that we are all peculiar people and that therefore there is the more reason why we should come together mrs roden do not try to prevent an arrangement which will give me the greatest pleasure and to which there cannot be any real objection why should not mr fay make acquaintance with your sons friend which day would suit you best wednesday thursday or friday  at last it was settled that at any rate george roden should dine at hendon hall on the fridayhe being absent during the discussionand that time must be taken as to any further acceptance of the invitation mrs roden was inclined to think that it had best be regarded as impossible she thought that she had made up her mind never to dine out again then there came across her mind a remembrance that her son was engaged to marry this young mans sister and that it might be for his welfare that she should give way to these overtures of friendship when her thoughts had travelled so far as this she might have felt sure that the invitation would at last be accepted  as to marion fay the subject was allowed to drop without any further decision she had said that it was impossible and she said nothing more that was the last dictum heard from her but it was not repeated as would probably have been the case had she been quite sure that it was impossible mrs roden during the interview did not allude to that branch of the subject again she was fluttered with what had already been said a little angry with herself that she had so far yielded a little perplexed at her own too evident confusion a little frightened at lord hampsteads evident admiration of the girl as to marion it must of course be left to her fatheras would the question as to the quaker himself  i had better be going said marion fay who was also confused  so must i said hampstead i have to return round by london and have ever so many things to do in park lane the worst of having two or three houses is that one never knows where ones clothes are goodbye mrs roden mind i depend upon you and that i have set my heart upon it you will let me walk with you as far as your door miss fay  it is only three doors off said marion and in the other direction nevertheless he did go with her to the house though it was only three doors off tell your father with my compliments he said that george roden can show you the way over if you can get a cab to bring you across i will send you back in the waggonette for the matter of that there is no reason on earth why it should not be sent for you  oh no my lord that is i do not think it possible that we should come  pray do pray do pray do he said as he took her hand when the door at no 17 was opened as he walked down the street he saw the figure still standing at the parlour window of no 10  on the same evening clara demijohn was closeted with mrs duffer at her lodgings at no 15 standing in the street squeezing her hand said mrs duffer as though the very hairs of her head were made to stand on end by the tidingsthe moral hairs that is of her moral head her head in the flesh was ornamented by a front which must have prevented the actual standing on end of any hair that was left to her  i saw it they came out together from no 11 as loving as could be and he walked up with her to their own house then he seized her hand and held itoh for minutesin the street there is nothing those quaker girls wont allow themselves they are so free with their christian names that of course they get into intimacies instantly i never allow a young man to call me clara without leave asked and given  i should think not  one cant be too particular about ones christian name theyve been in there together at no 11 for two hours what can that mean old mrs vincent was there but she went away  i suppose she didnt like such doings  what can a lord be doing in such a place as that asked clara coming so often you know and one that has to be a markiss which is much more than a lord one thing is quite certain it cant mean that he is going to marry marion fay with this assurance clara demijohn comforted herself as best she might     chapter xviii  how they lived at trafford park   there certainly was no justification for the illhumour which lady kingsbury displayed to her husband because hampstead and his sister had been invited down to castle hautboy the hautboy people were her own relationsnot her husbands if lady persiflage had taken upon herself to think better of all the evil things done by the children of the first marchioness that was not the fault of the marquis but to her thinking this visit had been made in direct opposition to her wishes and her interests had it been possible she would have sent the naughty young lord and the naughty young lady altogether to coventryas far as all aristocratic associations were concerned this encouragement of them at castle hautboy was in direct contravention of her ideas but poor lord kingsbury had had nothing to do with it they are not fit to go to such a house as castle hautboy she said the marquis who was sitting alone in his own morning room at trafford frowned angrily but her ladyship too was very angry they have disgraced themselves and geraldine should not have received them  there were two causes for displeasure in this in the first place the marquis could not endure that such hard things should be said of his elder children then by the very nature of the accusation made there was a certain special honour paid to the hauteville family which he did not think at all to be their due on many occasions his wife had spoken as though her sister had married into a house of peculiar nobilitybecause forsooth lord persiflage was in the cabinet and was supposed to have made a figure in politics the marquis was not at all disposed to regard the earl as in any way bigger than was he himself he could have paid all the earls debtswhich the earl certainly could not do himselfand never have felt it the social gatherings at castle hautboy were much more numerous than any at trafford but the guests at castle hautboy were often people whom the marquis would never have entertained his wife pined for the social influence which her sister was supposed to possess but he felt no sympathy with his wife in that respect  i deny it said the father rising from his chair and scowling at his wife as he stood leaning upon the table they have not disgraced themselves  i say they have her ladyship made her assertion boldly having come into the room prepared for battle and determined if possible to be victor has not fanny disgraced herself in having engaged herself to a low fellow the scum of the earth without saying anything even to you about it  no shouted the marquis who was resolved to contradict his wife in anything she might say  then i know nothing of what becomes a young woman continued the marchioness and does not hampstead associate with all manner of low people  no never  is not this george roden a low person does he ever live with young men or with ladies of his own rank  and yet youre angry with him because he goes to castle hautboy though no doubt he may meet people there quite unfit for society  that is not true said the marchioness my brotherinlaw entertains the best company in europe  he did do so when he had my son and my daughter under his roof  hampstead does not belong to a single club in london said the stepmother  so much the better said the father as far as i know anything about the clubs hautboy lost fourteen hundred pounds the other day at the pandemonium and where did the money come from to save him from being expelled  thats a very old story said the marchioness who knew that her husband and hampstead between them had supplied the money to save the young lad from disgrace  and yet you throw it in my teeth that hampstead doesnt belong to any club there isnt a club in london he couldnt get into tomorrow if he were to put his name down  i wish hed try at the carlton said her ladyship whose father and brother and all her cousins belonged to that aristocratic and exclusive political association  i should disown him said the still liberal marquisthat is to say of course hell do nothing of the kind but to declare that a young man has disgraced himself because he doesnt care for club life is absurdand coming from you as his stepmother is wicked as he said this he bobbed his head at her looking into her face as though he should say to her now you have my true opinion about yourself at this moment there came a gentle knock at the door and mr greenwood put in his head i am busy said the marquis very angrily then the unhappy chaplain retired abashed to his own rooms which were also on the ground floor beyond that in which his patron was now sitting  my lord said his wife towering in her passion if you call me wicked in regard to your children i will not continue to live under the same roof with you  then you may go away  i have endeavoured to do my duty by your children and a very hard time ive had of it if you think that your daughter is now conducting herself with propriety i can only wash my hands of her  wash your hands he said  very well of course i must suffer deeply because the shadow of the disgrace must fall more or less upon my own darlings  bother the darlings said the marquis  theyre your own children my lord your own children  of course they are why shouldnt they be my own children they are doing very well and will get quite as good treatment as younger brothers ought to have  i dont believe you care for them the least in the world said the marchioness  that is not true you know i care for them  you said bother the darlings when i spoke of them here the poor mother sobbed almost overcome by the contumely of the expression used towards her own offspring  you drive a man to say anything now look here i will not have hampstead and fanny abused in my presence if there be anything wrong i must suffer more than you because they are my children you have made it impossible for her to live here  i havent made it impossible for her to live here i have only done my duty by her ask mr greenwood  d mr greenwood said the marquis he certainly did say the word at full length as far as it can be said to have length and with all the emphasis of which it was capable he certainly did say it though when the circumstance was afterwards not unfrequently thrown in his teeth he would forget it and deny it her ladyship heard the word very plainly and at once stalked out of the room thereby showing that her feminine feelings had received a wrench which made it impossible for her any longer to endure the presence of such a foulmouthed monster up to that moment she had been anything but the victor but the vulgarity of the curse had restored to her much of her prestige so that she was able to leave the battlefield as one retiring with all his forces in proper order he had bothered his own children and damned his own chaplain  the marquis sat awhile thinking alone and then pulled a string by which communication was made between his room and that in which the clergyman sat it was not a vulgar bell which would have been injurious to the reverence and dignity of a clerical friend as savouring of a menials task work nor was it a pipe for oral communication which is undignified as requiring a man to stoop and put his mouth to itbut an arrangement by which a light tap was made against the wall so that the inhabitant of the room might know that he was wanted without any process derogatory to his selfrespect the chaplain obeyed the summons and lightly knocking at the door again stood before the lord he found the marquis standing upon the hearthrug by which as he well knew it was signified that he was not intended to sit down mr greenwood said the marquis in a tone of voice which was intended to be peculiarly mild but which at the same time was felt to be menacing i do not mean at the present moment to have any conversation with you on the subject to which it is necessary that i should allude and as i shall not ask for your presence for above a minute or two i will not detain you by getting you to sit down if i can induce you to listen to me without replying to me it will i think be better for both of us  certainly my lord  i will not have you speak to me respecting lady frances  when have i done so asked the chaplain plaintively  nor will i have you speak to lady kingsbury about her stepdaughter then he was silent and seemed to imply by what he had said before that the clergyman should now leave the room the first order given had been very simple it was one which the marquis certainly had a right to exact and with which mr greenwood felt that he would be bound to comply but the other was altogether of a different nature he was in the habit of constant conversation with lady kingsbury as to lady frances twice three times four times a day her ladyship who in her present condition had no other confidant would open out her sorrow to him on this terrible subject was he to tell her that he had been forbidden by his employer to continue this practice or was he to continue it in opposition to the marquiss wishes he would have been willing enough to do as he was bidden but that he saw that he would be driven to quarrel with the lord or the lady the lord no doubt could turn him out of the house but the lady could make the house too hot to hold him the lord was a just man though unreasonable and would probably not turn him out without compensation but the lady was a violent woman who if she were angered would remember nothing of justice thinking of all this he stood distracted and vacillating before his patron i expect you said the marquis to comply with my wishesor to leave me  to leave trafford asked the poor man  yes to leave trafford to do that or to comply with my wishes on a matter as to which my wishes are certainly entitled to consideration which is it to be mr greenwood  of course i will do as you bid me then the marquis bowed graciously as he still stood with his back to the fire and mr greenwood left the room  mr greenwood knew well that this was only the beginning of his troubles when he made the promise he was quite sure that he would be unable to keep it the only prospect open to him was that of breaking the promise and keeping the marquis in ignorance of his doing so it would be out of his power not to follow any lead in conversation which the marchioness might give him but it might be possible to make the marchioness understand that her husband must be kept in the dark as to any confidence between them for in truth many secrets were now discussed between them as to which it was impossible that her ladyship should be got to hold her tongue it had come to be received as a family doctrine between them that lord hampsteads removal to a better world was a thing devoutly to be wished it is astonishing how quickly though how gradually ideas of such a nature will be developed when entertainment has once been given to them the devil makes himself at home with great rapidity when the hall door has been opened to him a month or two back before her ladyship went to königsgraaf she certainly would not have ventured to express a direct wish for the young mans death however frequently her thoughts might have travelled in that direction and certainly in those days though they were yet not many weeks since mr greenwood would have been much shocked had any such suggestion been made to him as that which was now quite commonly entertained between them the pity of it the pity of it the pity of it it was thus the heartbroken mother put the matter reconciling to herself her own wishes by that which she thought to be a duty to her own children it was not that she and mr greenwood had between them any scheme by which lord hampstead might cease to be in the way murder certainly had not come into their thoughts but the pity of it the pity of it as lord hampstead was in all respects unfit for that high position which if he lived he would be called upon to fill so was her boy her lord frederic made to adorn it by all good gifts he was noblelooking gracious and aristocratic from the crown of his little head to the soles of his little feet no more glorious heir to a title made happy the heart of any british motherif only he were the heir and why should it be denied to her a noble scion of the great house of montressor to be the mother of none but younger sons the more her mind dwelt upon it the more completely did the iniquity of her wishes fade out of sight and her ambition appear to be no more than the natural anxiety of a mother for her child mr greenwood had no such excuses to offer to himself but with him too the devil having once made his entrance soon found himself comfortably at home of meditating lord hampsteads murder he declared to himself that he had no idea his conscience was quite clear to him in that respect what was it to him who might inherit the title and the property of the traffords he was simply discussing with a silly woman a circumstance which no words of theirs could do aught either to cause or to prevent it soon seemed to him to be natural that she should wish it and natural also that he should seem to sympathize with her who was his best friend the marquis he was sure was gradually dropping him where was he to look for maintenance but to his own remaining friend the marquis would probably give him something were he dismissedbut that something would go but a short way towards supporting him comfortably for the rest of his life there was a certain living in the gift of the marquis the rectory of appleslocombe in somersetshire which would exactly suit mr greenwoods needs the incumbent was a very old man now known to be bedridden it was £800 a year there would be ample for himself and for a curate mr greenwood had spoken to the marquis on the subjectbut had been told with some expression of civil regret that he was considered to be too old for new duties the marchioness had talked to him frequently of appleslocombebut what was the use of that if the marquis himself were to die and then the rector there would be a chance for himon condition that lord hampstead were also out of the way but mr greenwood as he thought of it shook his head at the barren prospect his sympathies no doubt were on the side of the lady the marquis was treating him ill lord hampstead was a disgrace to his order lady frances was worse even than her brother it would be a good thing that lord frederic should be the heir but all this had nothing to do with murderor even with meditation of murder if the lord should choose to take the young man it would be well that was all  on the same afternoon an hour or two after he had made his promise to the marquis lady kingsbury sent for him she always did send for him to drink tea with her at five oclock it was so regular that the servant would simply announce that tea was ready in her ladyships room upstairs have you seen his lordship today she asked  yesi have seen him  since he told you in that rude way to leave the room  yes he called me after that  well  he bade me not talk about lady frances  i dare say not he does not wish to hear her name spoken i can understand that  he does not wish me to mention her to you  not to me is my mouth to be stopped i shall say respecting her whatever i think fit i dare say indeed  it was to my talking that he referred  he cannot stop peoples mouths it is all nonsense he should have kept her at königsgraaf and locked her up till she had changed her mind  he wanted me to promise that i would not speak of her to your ladyship  and what did you say he shrugged his shoulders and drank his tea she shook her head and bit her lips she would not hold her tongue be he ever so angry i almost wish that she would marry the man so that the matter might be settled i dont suppose he would ever mention her name then himself has she gone back to hendon yet  i dont know my lady  this is his punishment for having run counter to his uncles wishes and his uncles principles you cannot touch pitch and not be defiled the pitch as mr greenwood very well understood was the first marchioness did he say anything about hampstead  not a word  i suppose we are not to talk about him either unfortunate young man i wonder whether he feels himself how thoroughly he is destroying the family  i should think he must  those sort of men are so selfish that they never think of any one else it does not occur to him what frederic might be if he were not in the way nothing annoys me so much as when he pretends to be fond of the children  i suppose he wont come any more now  nothing will keep him awayunless he were to die mr greenwood shook his head sadly they say he rides hard  i dont know there was something in the suggestion which at the moment made the clergyman almost monosyllabic  or his yacht might go down with him  he never yachts at this time of the year said the clergyman feeling comfort in the security thus assured  i suppose not bad weeds never get cut off but yet it is astonishing how many elder sons have beentaken away during the last quarter of a century  a great many  there never could have been one who could be better spared said the stepmother  yeshe might be spared  if you only think of the advantage to the family it will be ruined if he comes to the title and my fred would be such an honour to the name there is nothing to be done of course that was the first word that had ever been spoken in that direction and that word was allowed to pass without any reply having been made to it though it had been uttered almost in a question     chapter xix  lady amaldinas lover   trafford park was in shropshire llwddythlw the welsh seat of the duke of merioneth was in the next countyone of the seats that is for the duke had mansions in many counties here at this period of the year it suited lord llwddythlw to livenot for any special gratification of his own but because north wales was supposed to require his presence he looked to the quarter sessions to the roads to the lunatic asylum and to the conservative interests generally of that part of great britain that he should spend christmas at llwddythlw was a thing of course in january he went into durham february to somersetshire in this way he parcelled himself out about the kingdom remaining in london of course from the first to the last of the parliamentary session it was we may say emphatically a most useful life but in which there was no recreation and very little excitement it was not wonderful that he should be unable to find time to get married as he could not get as far as castle hautboypartly perhaps because he did not especially like the omniumgatherum mode of living which prevailed thereit had been arranged that he should give up two days early in december to meet the lady of his love under her aunts roof at trafford park lady amaldina and he were both to arrive there on wednesday december 3rd and remain till the tuesday morning there had not been any special term arranged as to the young ladys visit as her time was not of much consequence but it had been explained minutely that the lover must reach denbigh by the 545 train so as to be able to visit certain institutions in the town before a public dinner which was to be held in the conservative interest at seven lord llwddythlw had comfort in thinking that he could utilize his two days idleness at trafford in composing and studying the speech on the present state of affairs which though to be uttered at denbigh would no doubt appear in all the london newspapers on the following morning  as it was to be altogether a lovers meeting no company was to be invited mr greenwood would of course be there to make up something of a dinnerparty the mayor of shrewsbury was asked for the first evening with his wife the mayor was a strong conservative politician and lord llwddythlw would therefore be glad to meet him for the next days dinner the clergyman of the parish with his wife and daughter were secured the chief drawback to these festive arrangements consisted in the fact that both lady amaldina and her lover arrived on the day of the bitter quarrel between the marquis and his wife  perhaps however the coming of guests is the best relief which can be afforded for the misery of such domestic feuds after such words as had been spoken lord and lady trafford could hardly have sat down comfortably to dinner with no one between them but mr greenwood in such case there could not have been much conversation but now the marquis could come bustling into the drawingroom to welcome his wifes niece before dinner without any reference to the discomforts of the morning almost at the same moment lord llwddythlw made his appearance having arrived at the latest possible moment and having dressed himself in ten minutes as there was no one present but the family lady amaldina kissed her future husbandas she might have kissed her grandfatherand his lordship received the salutation as any stern undemonstrative grandfather might have done then mr greenwood entered with the mayor and his wife and the party was complete the marquis took lady amaldina out to dinner and her lover sat next to her the mayor and his wife were on the other side of the table and mr greenwood was between them the soup had not been handed round before lord llwddythlw was deep in a question as to the comparative merits of the shropshire and welsh lunatic asylums from that moment till the time at which the gentlemen went to the ladies in the drawingroom the conversation was altogether of a practical nature as soon as the ladies had left the table roads and asylums gave way to general politicsas to which the marquis and mr greenwood allowed the conservatives to have pretty much their own way in the drawingroom conversation became rather heavy till at a few minutes after ten the mayor observing that he had a drive before him retired for the night the marchioness with lady amaldina followed quickly and within five minutes the welsh lord having muttered something as to the writing of letters was within the seclusion of his own bedroom not a word of love had been spoken but lady amaldina was satisfied on her toilettable she found a little parcel addressed to her by his lordship containing a locket with her monogram a l in diamonds the hour of midnight was long passed before his lordship had reduced to words the first half of those promises of constitutional safety which he intended to make to the conservatives of denbigh not much was seen of lord llwddythlw after breakfast on the following morning so determined was he to do justice to the noble cause which he had in hand after lunch a little expedition was arranged for the two lovers and the busy politician allowed himself to be sent out for a short drive with no other companion than his future bride had he been quite intimate with her he would have given her the manuscript of his speech and occupied himself by saying it to her as a lesson which he had learnt as he could not do this he recapitulated to her all his engagements as though excusing his own slowness as to matrimony and declared that what with the property and what with parliament he never knew whether he was standing on his head or his heels but when he paused he had done nothing towards naming a certain day so that lady amaldina found herself obliged to take the matter into her own hands when then do you think it will be she asked he put his hand up and rubbed his head under his hat as though the subject were very distressing to him i would not for worlds you know think that i was in your way she said with just a tone of reproach in her voice  he was in truth sincerely attached to hermuch more so than it was in the compass of her nature to be to him if he could have had her for his wife without any trouble of bridal preparations or of subsequent honeymooning he would most willingly have begun from this moment it was incumbent on him to be married and he had quite made up his mind that this was the sort of wife that he required but now he was sadly put about by that tone of reproach i wish to goodness he said that i had been born a younger brother or just anybody else than i am  why on earth should you wish that  because i am so bothered of course you dont understand it  i do understand said amaldinabut there must you know be some end to all that i suppose the parliament and the lunatic asylums will go on just the same always  no doubtno doubt  if so there is no reason why any day should ever be fixed people are beginning to think that it must be off because it has been talked of so long  i hope it will never be off  i know the prince said the other day that he had expected but it does not signify what he expected lord llwddythlw had also heard the story of what the prince had said that he expected and he scratched his head again with vexation it had been reported that the prince had declared that he had hoped to be asked to be godfather long ago lady amaldina had probably heard some other version of the story what i mean is that everybody was surprised that it should be so long postponed but that they now begin to think it is abandoned altogether  shall we say june next said the ecstatic lover lady amaldina thought that june would do very well but there will be the towns education improvement bill said his lordship again scratching his head  i thought all the towns had been educated long ago he looked at her with feelings of a double sorrowsorrow that she should have known so little sorrow that she should be treated so badly i think we will put it off altogether she said angrily  no no no he exclaimed would august do i certainly have promised to be at inverness to open the new docks  thats nonsense she said what can the docks want with you to open them  my father you know he said has a very great interest in the city i think ill get david to do it lord david was his brother also a member of parliament and a busy man as were all the powell family but one who liked a little recreation among the moors when the fatigue of the house of commons were over  of course he could do it said lady amaldina he got himself married ten years ago  ill ask him but hell be very angry he always says that he oughtnt to be made to do an elder brothers work  then i may tell mamma his lordship again rubbed his head but did it this time in a manner that was conceived to signify assent the lady pressed his arm gently and the visit to trafford as far as she was concerned was supposed to have been a success she gave him another little squeeze as they got out of the carriage and he went away sadly to learn the rest of his speech thinking how sweet it might be to do as others use play with the tangles of neæras hair or sport with amaryllis in the shade  but there was a worse interruption for lord llwddythlw than this which he had now undergone at about five when he was making the peroration of his speech quite secure in his memory a message came to him from the marchioness saying that she would be much obliged to him if he would give her five minutes in her own room perhaps he would be kind enough to drink a cup of tea with her this message was brought by her ladyships own maid and could be regarded only as a command but lord llwddythlw wanted no tea cared not at all for lady kingsbury and was very anxious as to his speech he almost cursed the fidgety fretfulness of women as he slipped the manuscript into his lettercase and followed the girl along the passages  this is so kind of you she said he gave himself the usual rub of vexation as he bowed his head but said nothing she saw the state of his mind but was determined to persevere though he was a man plain to look at he was known to be the very pillar and support of his order no man in england was so wedded to the conservative causeto that cause which depends for its success on the maintenance of those social institutions by which great britain has become the first among the nations no one believed as did lord llwddythlw in keeping the different classes in their own placeseach place requiring honour truth and industry the marchioness understood something of his character in that respect who therefore would be so ready to see the bitterness of her own injuries to sympathize with her as to the unfitness of that son and daughter who had no blood relationship to herself to perceive how infinitely better it would be for the order that her own little lord frederic should be allowed to succeed and to assist in keeping the institutions of great britain in their proper position she had become absolutely dead to the fact that by any allusion to the probability of such a succession she was expressing a wish for the untimely death of one for whose welfare she was bound to be solicitous she had lost by constant dwelling on the subject her power of seeing how the idea would strike the feelings of another person here was a man peculiarly blessed in the world a man at the very top of his order one who would be closely connected with herself and on whom at some future time she might be able to lean as on a strong staff therefore she determined to trust her sorrows into his ears  wont you have a cup of tea  i never take any at this time of the day  perhaps a cup of coffee  nothing before dinner thank you  you were not at castle hautboy when hampstead and his sister were there  i have not been at castle hautboy since the spring  did you not think it very odd that they should have been asked  no indeed why odd  you know the storydo you not as one about to be so nearly connected with the family you ought to know it lady frances has made a most unfortunate engagement to a young man altogether beneath herto a post office clerk  i did hear something of that  she behaved shockingly here and was then taken away by her brother i have been forced to divorce myself from her altogether lord llwddythlw rubbed his head but on this occasion lady kingsbury misinterpreted the cause of his vexation he was troubled at being made to listen to this story she conceived that he was disgusted by the wickedness of lady frances after that i think my sister was very wrong to have her at castle hautboy no countenance ought to be shown to a young woman who can behave so abominably he could only rub his head do you not think that such marriages are most injurious to the best interests of society  i certainly think that young ladies should marry in their own rank  so much depends upon itdoes it not lord llwddythlw all the future blood of our head families my own opinion is that nothing could be too severe for such conduct  will severity prevent it  nothing else can my own impression is that a father in such case should be allowed to confine his daughter but then the marquis is so weak  the country would not stand it for a moment  so much the worse for the country said her ladyship holding up her hands but the brother is if possible worse than the sister  hampstead  he utterly hates all idea of an aristocracy  that is absurd  most absurd said the marchioness feeling herself to be encouragedmost absurd and abominable and wicked he is quite a revolutionist  not that i think said his lordship who knew pretty well the nature of hampsteads political feelings  indeed he is why he encourages his sister he would not mind her marrying a shoeblack if only he could debase his own family think what i must feel i with my darling boys  is not he kind to them  i would prefer that he should never see them  i dont see that at all said the angry lord  but she altogether misunderstood him when i think of what he is and to what he will reduce the whole family should he live i cannot bear to see him touch them think of the blood of the traffords of the blood of the mountressors of the blood of the hautevillesthink of your own blood which is now to be connected with theirs and that all this is to be defiled because this man chooses to bring about a disreputable disgusting marriage with the expressed purpose of degrading us all  i beg your pardon lady kingsbury i shall be in no way degraded  think of us think of my children  nor will they it may be a misfortune but will be no degradation honour can only be impaired by that which is dishonourable i wish that lady frances had given her heart elsewhere but i feel sure that the name of her family is safe in her hands as for hampstead he is a young man for whose convictions i have no sympathybut i am sure that he is a gentleman  i would that he were dead said lady kingsbury in her wrath  lady kingsbury  i would that he were dead  i can only say said lord llwddythlw rising from his chair that you have made your confidence most unfortunately lord hampstead is a young nobleman whom i should be proud to call my friend a mans politics are his own his honour his integrity and even his conduct belong in a measure to his family i do not think that his father or his brothers or if i may say so his stepmother will ever have occasion to blush for anything that he may do with this he bowed to the marchioness and stalked out of the room with a grand manner which those who saw him shuffling his feet in the house of commons would hardly have thought belonged to him  the dinner on that day was very quiet and lady kingsbury retired to bed earlier even than usual the conversation at the dinner was dull and turned mostly on church subjects mr greenwood endeavoured to be sprightly and the parson and the parsons wife and the parsons daughter were uncomfortable lord llwddythlw was almost dumb lady amaldina having settled the one matter of interest to her was simply contented on the next morning her lover took his departure by an earlier train than he had intended it was he said necessary that he should look into some matters at denbigh before he made his speech he contrived to get a compartment to himself and there he practised his lesson till he felt that further practice would only confuse him  you had fanny at the castle the other day lady kingsbury said the next morning to her niece  mamma thought it would be goodnatured to ask them both  they did not deserve it their conduct has been such that i am forced to say that they deserve nothing from my family did she speak about this marriage of hers  she did mention it  well  oh there was nothing of course there was much more to say about mine she was saying that she would be glad to be a bridesmaid  pray dont have her  why not aunt  i could not possibly be there if you did i have been compelled to divorce her from my heart  poor fanny  but she was not ashamed of what she is doing  i should say not she is not one of those that are ever ashamed  no no nothing would make her ashamed all ideas of propriety she has banished from heras though they didnt exist i expect to hear that she disregards marriage altogether  aunt clara  what can you expect from doctrines such as those which she and her brother share thank god you have never been in the way of hearing of such things it breaks my heart when i think of what my own darlings will be sure to hear some of these daysshould their halfbrother and halfsister still be left alive but amaldina pray do not have her for one of your bridesmaids lady amaldina remembering that her cousin was very handsome and also that there might be a difficulty in making up the twenty titled virgins gave her aunt no promise     chapter xx  the scheme is successful   when the matter was mentioned to george roden by his mother he could see no reason why she should not dine at hendon hall he himself was glad to have an opportunity of getting over that roughness of feeling which had certainly existed between him and his friend when they parted with each other on the road as to his mother it would be well that she should so far return to the usages of the world as to dine at the house of her sons friend it is only going back to what you used to be he said  you know nothing of what i used to be she replied almost angrily  i ask no questions and have endeavoured so to train myself that i should care but little about it but i knew it was so then after a pause he went back to the current of his thoughts had my father been a prince i think that i should take no pride in it  it is well to have been born a gentleman she said  it is well to be a gentleman and if the good things which are generally attendant on high birth will help a man in reaching noble feelings and grand resolves so it may be that to have been well born will be an assistance but if a man derogates from his birthas so many dothen it is a crime  all that has to be taken for granted george  but it is not taken for granted though the man himself be knave and fool and coward he is supposed to be ennobled because the blood of the howards run in his veins and worse again though he has gifts of nobility beyond compare he can hardly dare to stand upright before lords and dukes because of his inferiority  that is all going away  would that it could be made to go a little faster it may be helped in its going it may be that in these days the progress shall be accelerated but you will let me write to hampstead and say that you will come she assented and so that part of the little dinnerparty was arranged  after that she herself contrived to see the quaker one evening on his return home yes said mr fay i have heard thy proposition from marion why should the young lord desire such a one as i am to sit at his table  he is georges intimate friend  that thy son should choose his friend well i surely believe because i see him to be a prudent and wise young man who does not devote himself overmuch to riotous amusements george did occasionally go to a theatre thereby offending the quakers judgment justifying the overmuch and losing his claim to a full measure of praise therefore i will not quarrel with him that he has chosen his friend from among the great ones of the earth but like to like is a good motto i fancy that the weary draughthorse such as i am should not stable himself with hunters and racers  this young man affects the society of such as yourself and george rather than that of others nobly born as himself  i do not know that he shows his wisdom the more  you should give him credit at any rate for good endeavours  it is not for me to judge him one way or the other did he ask that marion should also go to his house  certainly why should not the child see something of the world that may amuse her  little good can come to my marion from such amusements mrs roden but something perhaps of harm wilt thou say that such recreation must necessarily be of service to a girl born to perform the hard duties of a strict life  i would trust marion in anything said mrs roden eagerly  so would i so would i she hath ever been a good girl  but do you not distrust her if you shut her up and are afraid to allow her even to sit at table in a strange house  i have never forbidden her to sit at thy table said the quaker  and you should let her go specially as a kindness to me for my sons sake i have promised to be there and it would be a comfort to me to have another woman with me  then you will hardly need me said mr fay not without a touch of jealousy  he specially pressed his request that you would come it is among such as you that he would wish to make himself known moreover if marion is to be there you i am sure will choose to accompany her would you not wish to see how the child bears herself on such an occasion  on all occasions at all places at all hours i would wish to have my child with me there is nothing else left to me in all the world on which my eye can rest with pleasure but i doubt whether it may be for her good then he took his departure leaving the matter still undecided speaking of it with words which seemed to imply that he must ultimately refuse but impressing mrs roden with a conviction that he would at last accept the invitation  doest thou wish it thyself he said to his daughter before retiring to rest that night  if you will go father i should like it  why shouldst thou like it what doest thou expect is it because the young man is a lord and that there will be something of the gilded grandeur of the grand ones of the earth to be seen about his house and his table  it is not for that father  or is it because he is young and comely and can say soft things as such youths are wont to say because he will smell sweetly of scents and lavender because his hand will be soft to the touch with rings on his fingers and jewels perhaps on his bosom like a woman  no father it is not for that  the delicacies which he will give thee to eat and to drink the sweetmeats and rich food cannot be much to one nurtured as thou hast been  certainly not father they can be nothing to me  then why is it that thou wouldst go to his house  it is that i may hear you father speak among men  nay said he laughing thou mayst hear me better speak among men at kings court in the city there i can hold my own well enough but with these young men over their wine i shall have but little to say i fancy if thou hast nothing to gain but to hear thy old father talk the time and money will be surely thrown away  i would hear him talk father  the young lord  yes the young lord he is bright and clever and coming from another world than our world can tell me things that i do not know  can he tell thee aught that is good  from what i hear of him from our friend he will tell me i think naught that is bad you will be there to hear and to arrest his words if they be evil but i think him to be one from whose mouth no guile or folly will be heard  who art thou my child that thou shouldst be able to judge whether words of guile are likely to come from a young mans lips but this he said smiling and pressing her hand while he seemed to rebuke her  nay father i do not judge i only say that i think it might be so they are not surely all false and wicked but if you wish it otherwise i will not utter another syllable to urge the request  we will go marion thy friend urged that it is not good that thou shouldst always be shut up with me alone and though i may distrust the young lord as not knowing him my confidence in thee is such that i think that nothing will ever shake it and so it was settled that they should all go he would send to a livery stable and hire a carriage for this unusual occasion there should be no need for the young lord to send them home though he did not know as he said much of the ways of the outside world it was hardly the custom for the host to supply carriages as well as viands when he dined as he did annually with the elder mr pogson mr pogson sent him home in no carriage he would sit at the lords table but he would go and come as did other men  on the friday named the two ladies and the two men arrived at hendon hall in something more than good time hampstead hopped and skipped about as though he were delighted as a boy might have been at their coming it may be possible that there was something of guile even in this and that he had calculated that he might thus best create quickly that intimacy with the quaker and his daughter which he felt to be necessary for his full enjoyment of the evening if the quaker himself expected much of that gilding of which he had spoken he was certainly disappointed the garniture of hendon hall had always been simple and now had assumed less even of aristocratic finery than it used to show when prepared for the use of the marchioness im glad youve come in time said he because you can get comfortably warm before dinner then he fluttered about round mrs roden paying her attention much rather than marion faystill with some guile as knowing that he might thus best prepare for the coming of future good things i suppose you found it awfully cold he said  i do not know that we were awed my lord said the quaker but the winter has certainly set in with some severity  oh father said marion rebuking him  everything is awful now said hampstead laughing of course the word is absurd but one gets in the way of using it because other people do  nay my lord i crave pardon if i seemed to criticize thy language being somewhat used to a sterner manner of speaking i took the word in its stricter sense  it is but slang from a girls school after all said roden  now master george i am not going to bear correction from you said hampstead though i put up with it from your elders miss fay when you were at school did they talk slang  where i was at school lord hampstead marion answered we were kept in strict leadingstrings fancy father what miss watson would have said if we had used any word in a sense not used in a dictionary  miss watson was a sensible woman my dear and understood well and performed faithfully the duties which she had undertaken i do not know that as much can be said of all those who keep fashionable seminaries for young ladies at the west end  miss watson had a red face and a big cap and spectacleshad she not said hampstead appealing to marion fay  miss watson said mrs roden whom i remember to have seen once when marion was at school with her was a very little woman with bright eyes who wore her own hair and always looked as though she had come out of a bandbox  she was absolutely true to her ideas of life as a quaker should be said mr fay and i only hope that marion will follow her example as to language it is i think convenient that to a certain extent our mode of speech should consort with our mode of living you would not expect to hear from a pulpit the phrases which belong to a racecourse nor would the expressions which are decorous perhaps in aristocratic drawingrooms befit the humble parlours of clerks and artisans  i never will say that anything is awful again said lord hampstead as he gave his arm to mrs roden and took her in to dinner  i hope he will not be angry with father whispered marion fay to george roden as they walked across the hall together  not in the least nothing of that kind could anger him if your father were to cringe or to flatter him then he would be disgusted  father would never do that said marion with confidence  the dinner went off very pleasantly hampstead and roden taking between them the weight of the conversation the quaker was perhaps a little frightened by the asperity of his own first remark and ate his good things almost in silence marion was quite contented to listen as she had told her father was her purpose but it was perhaps to the young lords words that she gave attention rather than to those of his friends his voice was pleasant to her ears there was a certain graciousness in his words as to which she did not suppose that their softness was specially intended for her hearing who does not know the way in which a man may set himself at work to gain admission into a womans heart without addressing hardly a word to herself and who has not noted the sympathy with which the woman has unconsciously accepted the homage that pressing of the hand that squeezing of the arm that glancing of the eyes which are common among lovers are generally the developed consequences of former indications which have had their full effect even though they were hardly understood and could not have been acknowledged at the time but marion did perhaps feel that there was something of worship even in the way in which her host looked towards her with rapid glances from minute to minute as though to see that if not with words at any rate with thoughts she was taking her share in the conversation which was certainly intended for her delight the quaker in the mean time ate his dinner very silently he was conscious of having shown himself somewhat of a prig about that slang phrase and was repenting himself mrs roden every now and then would put in a word in answer rather to her son than to the host but she was aware of those electric sparks which from lord hampsteads end of the wire were being directed every moment against marion fays heart  now just for the fashion of the thing you must sit here for a quarter of an hour while we are supposed to be drinking our wine this was said by lord hampstead when he took the two ladies into the drawingroom after dinner  dont hurry yourselves said mrs roden marion and i are old friends and will get on very well  oh yes said marion it will be pleasure enough to me just to sit here and look around me then hampstead knelt down between them pretending to doctor up the fire which certainly required no doctoring they were standing one on one side and the other on the other looking down upon him  you are spoiling that fire lord hampstead said mrs roden  coals were made to be poked i feel sure of that do take the poker and give them one blow that will make you at home in the house for ever you know then he handed the implement to marion she could hardly do other than take it in her hand she took it blushed up to the roots of her hair paused a moment and then gave the one blow to the coals that had been required of her thanks said he nodding at her as he still knelt at her feet and took the poker from her thanks now you are free of hendon hall for ever i wouldnt have any one but a friend poke my fire upon that he got up and walked slowly out of the room  oh mrs roden said marion i wish i hadnt done it  it doesnt matter it was only a joke  of course it was a joke but i wish i hadnt done it it seemed at the moment that i should look to be cross if i didnt do as he bade me but when he had said that about being at home oh mrs roden i wish i had not done it  he will know that it was nothing my dear he is goodhumoured and playful and likes the feeling of making us feel that we are not strangers but marion knew that lord hampstead would not take it as meaning nothing though she could see no more than his back as he walked out of the room she knew that he was glowing with triumph  now mr fay here is port if you like but i recommend you to stick to the claret  i have pretty well done all the sticking my lord of which i am competent said the quaker a little wine goes a long way with me as i am not much used to it  wine maketh glad the heart of man said roden  true enough mr roden but i doubt whether it be good that a mans heart should be much gladdened gladness and sorrow counterbalance each other too surely an even serenity is best fitted to human life if it can be reached  a level road without hills said hampstead they say that horses are soonest tired by such travelling  they would hardly tell you so themselves if they could give their experience after a long days journey then there was a pause but mr fay continued to speak my lord i fear i misbehaved myself in reference to that word awful which fell by chance from thy mouth  oh dear no nothing of the kind  i was bethinking me that i was among the young men in our court in great broad street who will indulge sometimes in a manner of language not befitting their occupation at the time or perhaps their station in life i am wont then to remind them that words during business hours should be used in their strict sense but my lord if you will take a farm horse from his plough you cannot expect from him that he should prance upon the green  it is because i think that there should be more mixing between what you call plough horses and animals used simply for play that i have been so proud to make you welcome here i hope it may not be by many the last time that you will act as a living dictionary for me if you wont have any more wine we will go to them in the drawingroom  mrs roden very soon declared it necessary that they should start back to holloway hampstead himself did not attempt to delay them the words that had absolutely passed between him and marion had hardly been more than those which have been here set down but yet he felt that he had accomplished not only with satisfaction but with some glory to himself the purpose for which he had specially invited his guests his scheme had been carried out with perfect success after the manner in which marion had obeyed his behest about the fire he was sure that he was justified in regarding her as a friend     chapter xxi  what they all thought as they went home   lord hampstead had come to the door to help them into the carriage lord hampstead said mrs roden you will catch your death of cold it is freezing and you have nothing on your head  i am quite indifferent about those things he said as for a moment he held marions hand while he helped her into the carriage  do go in she whispered her lips as she spoke were close to his earbut that simply came from the position in which chance had placed her her hand was still in hisbut that too was the accident of the situation but there is i think an involuntary tendency among women to make more than necessary use of assistance when the person tendering it has made himself really welcome marion had certainly no such intention had the idea come to her at the moment she would have shrank from his touch it was only when his fingers were withdrawn when the feeling of the warmth of this proximity had passed away that she became aware that he had been so close to her and that now they were separated  then her father entered the carriage and roden  goodnight my lord said the quaker i have passed my evening very pleasantly i doubt whether i may not feel the less disposed for my days work tomorrow  not at all mr fay not at all you will be like a giant refreshed there is nothing like a little friendly conversation for bracing up the mind i hope it will not be long before you come and try it again then the carriage was driven off and lord hampstead went in to warm himself before the fire which marion fay had poked  he had not intended to fall in love with her was there ever a young man who when he first found a girl to be pleasant to him has intended to fall in love with her girls will intend to fall in love or more frequently perhaps to avoid it but men in such matters rarely have a purpose lord hampstead had found her as he thought to be an admirable specimen of excellence in that class of mankind which his convictions and theories induced him to extol he thought that good could be done by mixing the racers and ploughhorsesand as regarded the present experiment marion fay was a ploughhorse no doubt he would not have made this special attempt had she not pleased his eye and his ear and his senses generally he certainly was not a philosopher to whom in his search after wisdom an old man such as zachary fay could make himself as acceptable as his daughter it may be acknowledged of him that he was susceptible to female influences but it had not at first occurred to him that it would be a good thing to fall in love with marion fay why should he not be on friendly terms with an excellent and lovely girl without loving her such had been his ideas after first meeting marion at mrs rodens house then he had determined that friends could not become friends without seeing each other and he had concocted his scheme without being aware of the feelings which she had excited the scheme had been carried out he had had his dinnerparty marion fay had poked his fire there had been one little pressure of the hand as he helped her into the carriage one little whispered word which had it not been whispered would have been as nothing one moment of consciousness that his lips were close to her cheek and then he returned to the warmth of his fire quite conscious that he was in love  what was to come of it when he had argued both with his sister and with roden that their marriage would be unsuitable because of their difference in social position and had justified his opinion by declaring it to be impossible that any two persons could by their own doing break through the conventions of the world without ultimate damage to themselves and to others he had silently acknowledged to himself that he also was bound by the law which he was teaching that such conventions should gradually cease to be would be good but no man is strong enough to make a new law for his own governing at the spur of the momentand certainly no woman the existing distances between man and man were radically bad this was the very gist of his doctrine but the instant abolition of such distances had been proved by many experiments to be a vain dream and the diminution of them must be gradual and slow that such diminution would go on till the distances should ultimately disappear in some future millennium was to him a certainty the distances were being diminished by the increasing wisdom and philanthropy of mankind to him born to high rank and great wealth it had been given to do more perhaps than another in surrendering there is more efficacy as there is also more grace than in seizing what of his grandeur he might surrender without injury to others to whom he was bound he would surrender of what exact nature or kind should be the woman whom it might please him to select as his wife he had formed no accurate idea but he would endeavour so to marry that he would make no step down in the world that might be offensive to his family but would yet satisfy his own convictions by drawing himself somewhat away from aristocratic blood his father had done the same when choosing his first wife and the happiness of his choice would have been perfect had not death interfered actuated by such reasoning as this he had endeavoured in a mild way to separate his sister from her lover thinking that they who were in love should be bound by the arguments which seemed good to him who was not in love but now he also was in love and the arguments as they applied to himself fell into shreds and tatters as he sat gazing at his fire holding the poker in his hand  had there ever been anything more graceful than the mock violence with which she had pretended to strike heartily at the coalshad there ever anything been more lovely than that mingled glance of doubt of fear and of friendliness with which she had looked into his face as she did it she had quite understood his feeling when he made his little request there had been heart enough in her spirit enough intelligence enough to tell her at once the purport of his demand or rather she had not seen it all at once but had only understood when her hand had gone too far to be withdrawn that something of love as well as friendship had been intended before long she should know how much of love had been intended whether his purpose was or was not compatible with the wisdom of his theory as to a gradual diminution of distances his heart had gone too far now for any retracting as he sat there he at once began to teach himself that the arguments he had used were only good in reference to highborn females and that they need not necessarily affect himself whomever he might marry he would raise to his own rank for his rank he did not care a straw himself it was of the prejudices of others he was thinking when he assured himself that marion would make as good a countess and as good a marchioness as any lady in the land in regard to his sister it was otherwise she must follow the rank of her husband it might be that the sores which she would cause to many by becoming the wife of a post office clerk ought to be avoided but there need be no sores in regard to his marriage with marion fay  his present reasoning was no doubt bad but such as it was it was allowed to prevail absolutely it did not even occur to him that he would make an attempt to enfranchise himself from marions charms whatever might occur whatever details there might be which would require his attention in regard to his father or others of the family everything must give way to his present passion she had poked his fire and she must be made to sit at his hearth for the remainder of their joint existence she must be made to sit there if he could so plead his cause that his love should prevail with her as to the quaker father he thought altogether well of him tooan industrious useful intelligent man of whose quaint manners and manly bearing he would not be ashamed in any society she too was a quaker but that to him was little or nothing he also had his religious convictions but they were not of a nature to be affronted or shocked by those of any one who believed that the increasing civilization of the world had come from christs teaching the simple earnest purity of the girls faith would be an attraction to him rather than otherwise indeed there was nothing in his marion as he saw her that was not conducive to feminine excellence  his marion how many words had he spoken to her how many thoughts had he extracted from her how many of her daily doings had he ever witnessed but what did it matter it is not the girl that the man loves but the image which imagination has built up for him to fill the outside covering which has pleased his senses he was quite as sure that the ten commandments were as safe in marions hands as though she were already a saint canonized for the perfection of all virtues he was quite ready to take that for granted and having so convinced himself was now only anxious as to the means by which he might make this priceless pearl his own  there must be some other scheme he sat thinking of this cudgelling his brains for some contrivance by which he and marion fay might be brought together again with the least possible delay his idea of a dinnerparty had succeeded beyond all hope but he could not have another dinnerparty next week nor could he bring together the guests whom he had today entertained after his sisters return he was bound not to admit george roden to his house as long as she should be with him without george he could hardly hope that mrs roden would come to him and without mrs roden how could he entice the quaker and his daughter his sister would be with him on the following day and would no doubt be willing to assist him with marion if it were possible but the giving of such assistance on her part would tacitly demand assistance also from him in her difficulties such assistance he knew he could not give having pledged himself to his father in regard to george roden he could at the present moment devise no other scheme than the very simple one of going to mrs roden and declaring his love for the girl                                          the four guests in the carriage were silent throughout their drive home they all had thoughts of their own sufficient to occupy them george roden told himself that this for a long day must be his last visit to hendon hall he knew that lady frances would arrive on the morrow and that then his presence was forbidden he had refused to make any promise as to his assured absence not caring to subject himself to an absolute bond but he was quite aware that he was bound in honour not to enter the house in which he could not be made welcome he felt himself to be safe with a great security the girl whom he loved would certainly be true he was not impatient as was hampstead he did not trouble his mind with schemes which were to be brought to bear within the next few days he could bide his time comforting himself with his faith but still a lover can hardly be satisfied with the world unless he can see some point in his heaven from which light may be expected to break through the clouds he could not see the point from which the light might be expected  the quaker was asking himself many questions had he done well to take his girl to this young noblemans house had he done well to take himself there it had been as it were a sudden disruption in the settled purposes of his life what had he or his girl to do with lords and yet he had been pleased courtesy always flatters and flattery is always pleasant a certain sense of softness had been grateful to him there came upon him a painful questionas there does on so many of us when for a time we make a successful struggle against the worlds allurementswhether in abandoning the delights of life we do in truth get any compensation for them would it not after all be better to do as others use phoebus as he touches our trembling ear encourages us but with a faint voice it had been very pleasantthe soft chairs the quiet attendance the wellcooked dinner the good wines the bright glasses the white linenand pleasanter than all that silvery tone of conversation to which he was so little accustomed either in kings court or paradise row marion indeed was always gentle to him as a dove cooing but he was aware of himself that he was not gentle in return stern truth expressed shortly in strong language was the staple of his conversation at home he had declared to himself all through his life that stern truth and strong language were better for mankind than soft phrases but in his own parlour in paradise row he had rarely seen his marion bright as she had been at this lords table was it good for his marion that she should be encouraged to such brightness and if so had he been cruel to her to suffuse her entire life with a colour so dark as to admit of no light why had her beauty shone so brightly in the lords presence he too knew something of love and had it always present to his mind that the time would come when his marions heart would be given to some stranger he did not think he would not think that the stranger had now comebut would it be well that his girls future should be affected even as was his own he argued the points much within himself and told himself that it could not be well  mrs roden had read it nearly allthough she could not quite read the simple honesty of the young lords purpose the symptoms of love had been plain enough to her eyes and she had soon told herself that she had done wrong in taking the girl to the young lords house she had seen that hampstead had admired marion but she had not dreamed that it would be carried to such a length as this but when he had knelt on the rug between them leaning just a little towards the girl and had looked up into the girls face smiling at his own little joke but with his face full of lovethen she had known and when marion had whispered the one word with her little fingers lingering within the young lords touch then she had known it was not the young lord only who had given way to the softness of the moment if evil had been done she had done it and it seemed as though evil had certainly been done if much evil had been done how could she forgive herself  and what were marions thoughts did she feel that an evil had been done an evil for which there could never be a cure found she would have so assured herself had she as yet become aware of the full power and depth and mortal nature of the wound she had received for such a wound for such a hurt there is but one cure and of that she certainly would have entertained no hope but as it will sometimes be that a man shall in his flesh receive a fatal injury of which he shall for awhile think that only some bruise has pained him some scratch annoyed him that a little time with ointment and a plaister will give him back his body as sound as ever but then after a short space it becomes known to him that a deadly gangrene is affecting his very life so will it be with a girls heart she did not yetnot yettell herself that halfadozen gentle words that two or three soft glances that a touch of a hand the mere presence of a youth whose comeliness was endearing to the eye had mastered and subdued all that there was of marion fay but it was so not for a moment did her mind run away as they were taken homewards from the object of her unconscious idolatry had she behaved illthat was her regret he had been so graciousthat was her joy then there came a pang from the wound though it was not as yet a pang as of death what right had such a one as she to receive even an idle word of compliment from a man such as was lord hampstead what could he be to her or she to him he had his high mission to complete his great duties to perform and doubtless would find some noble lady as a fit mother for his children he had come across her path for a moment and she could not but remember him for ever there was something of an idea present to her that love would now be beyond her reach but the pain necessarily attached to such an idea had not as yet reached her there came something of a regret that fortune had placed her so utterly beyond his noticebut she was sure of this sure of this that if the chance were offered to her she would not mar his greatness by accepting the priceless boon of his love but whywhy had he been so tender to her then she thought of what were the ways of men and of what she had heard of them it had been bad for her to go abroad thus with her poor foolish softness with her girls untried tendernessthat thus she should be affected by the first chance smile that had been thrown to her by one of those petted darlings of fortune and then she was brought round to that same resolution which was at the moment forming itself in her fathers mindthat it would have been better for her had she not allowed herself to be taken to hendon hall then they were in paradise row and were put down at their separate doors with but few words of farewell to each other  they have just come home said clara demijohn rushing into her mothers bedroom youll find it is quite true they have been dining with the lord     chapter xxii  again at trafford   the meeting between hampstead and his sister was affectionate and upon the whole satisfactory though it was necessary that a few words should be spoken which could hardly be pleasant in themselves i had a dinnerparty here last night he said laughing desirous of telling her something of george rodenand something also of marion fay  who were the guests  roden was here then there was silence she was glad that her lover had been one of the guests but she was not as yet moved to say anything respecting him and his mother  i am sure i shall like his mother said lady frances  i have mentioned it continued her brother speaking with unusual care because in compliance with the agreement i made at trafford i cannot ask him here again at present  i am sorry that i should be in your way john  you are not in my way as i think you know let us say no more than that at present then i had a singular old quaker named zachary fay an earnest honest but humble man who blew me up instantly for talking slang  where did you pick him up  he comes out of the city he said not wishing to refer again to paradise row and the neighbourhood of the rodensand he brought his daughter  a young lady  certainly a young lady  ah but youngand beautiful  youngand beautiful  now you are laughing i suppose she is some strongminded rather repulsive middleaged woman  as to the strength of her mind i have not seen enough to constitute myself a judge said hampstead almost with a tone of offence why you should imagine her to be repulsive because she is a quaker or why middleaged i do not understand she is not repulsive to me  oh john i am so sorry now i know that you have found some divine beauty  we sometimes entertain angels unawares i thought that i had done so when she took her departure  are you in earnest  i am quite in earnest as to the angel now i have to consult you as to a project it may be remembered that hampstead had spoken to his father as to the expediency of giving up his horses if he found that his means were not sufficient to keep up hendon hall his yacht and his hunting establishment in northamptonshire the marquis without saying a word to his son had settled that matter and gorse hall with its stables was continued the proposition now made to lady frances was that she should go down with him and remain there for a week or two till she should find the place too dull he had intended to fix an almost immediate day but now he was debarred from this by his determination to see marion yet once again before he took himself altogether beyond the reach of holloway the plan therefore though it was fixed as far as his own intention went and the assent of lady frances was left undefined as to time the more he thought of holloway and the difficulties of approaching paradise row the more convinced he became that his only mode of approaching marion must be through mrs roden he had taken two or three days to consider what would be the most appropriate manner of going through this operation when on a sudden he was arrested by a letter from his father begging his presence down at trafford the marquis was ill and was anxious to see his son the letter in which the request was made was sad and plaintive throughout he was hardly able to write lord kingsbury said because he was so unwell but he had no one to write for him mr greenwood had made himself so disagreeable that he could no longer employ him for such purposes your stepmother is causing me much vexation which i do not think that i deserve from her he then added that it would be necessary for him to have his lawyer down at trafford but that he wished to see hampstead first in order that they might settle as to certain arrangements which were required in regard to the disposition of the property there were some things which hampstead could not fail to perceive from this letter he was sure that his father was alarmed as to his own condition or he would not have thought of sending for the lawyer to trafford he had hitherto always been glad to seize an opportunity of running up to london when any matter of business had seemed to justify the journey then it occurred to his son that his father had rarely or ever spoken or written to him of his stepmother in certain moods the marquis had been wont to call his wife either the marchioness or lady kingsbury when in good humour he had generally spoken of her to his son as your mother the injurious though strictly legal name now given to her was a certain index of abiding wrath but things must have been very bad with the marquis at trafford when he had utterly discarded the services of mr greenwoodservices to which he had been used for a time to which the memory of his son did not go back hampstead of course obeyed his fathers injunctions and went down to trafford instantly leaving his sister alone at hendon hall he found the marquis not in bed indeed but confined to his own sittingroom and to a very small bedchamber which had been fitted up for him close to it mr greenwood had been anxious to give up his own rooms as being more spacious but the offer had been peremptorily and almost indignantly refused the marquis had been unwilling to accept anything like a courtesy from mr greenwood should he make up his mind to turn mr greenwood out of the houseand he had almost made up his mind to do sothen he could do what he pleased with mr greenwoods rooms but he wasnt going to accept the loan of chambers in his own house as a favour from mr greenwood  hampstead on arriving at the house saw the marchioness for a moment before he went to his father i cannot tell how he is said lady kingsbury speaking in evident dudgeon he will hardly let me go near him doctor spicer seems to think that we need not be alarmed he shuts himself up in those gloomy rooms downstairs of course it would be better for him to be off the ground floor where he would have more light and air but he has become so obstinate that i do not know how to deal with him  he has always liked to live in the room next to mr greenwoods  he has taken an absolute hatred to mr greenwood you had better not mention the poor old gentlemans name to him shut up as i am here i have no one else to speak a word to and for that reason i suppose he wishes to get rid of him he is absolutely talking of sending the man away after having had him with him for nearly thirty years in answer to all this hampstead said almost nothing he knew his stepmother and was aware that he could do no service by telling her what he might find it to be his duty to say to his father as to mr greenwood or on any other subject he did not hate his stepmotheras she hated him but he regarded her as one to whom it was quite useless to speak seriously as to the affairs of the family he knew her to be prejudiced ignorant and falsely proudbut he did not suppose her to be either wicked or cruel  his father began almost instantly about mr greenwood so that it would have been quite impossible for him to follow lady kingsburys advice on that matter had he been ever so well minded of course im ill he said i suffer so much from sickness and dyspepsia that i can eat nothing doctor spicer seems to think that i should get better if i did not worry myself but there are so many things to worry me the conduct of that man is abominable  what man sir asked hampsteadwho knew however very well what was coming  that clergyman said lord kingsbury pointing in the direction of mr greenwoods room  he does not come to you sir unless you send for him  i havent seen him for the last five days and i dont care if i never see him again  how has he offended you sir  i gave him my express injunctions that he should not speak of your sister either to me or the marchioness he gave me his solemn promise and i know very well that they are talking about her every hour of the day  perhaps that is not his fault  yes it is a man neednt talk to a woman unless he likes it is downright impudence on his part your stepmother comes to me every day and never leaves me without abusing fanny  that is why i thought it better that fanny should come to me  and then when i argue with her she always tells me what mr greenwood says about it who cares about mr greenwood what business has mr greenwood to interfere in my family he does not know how to behave himself and he shall go  he has been here a great many years sir said hampstead pleading for the old man  too many said the marquis when youve had a man about you so long as that he is sure to take liberties  you must provide for him sir if he goes  i have thought of that he must have something of course he has had three hundred ayear for the last ten years and has had everything found for him down to his washing and his cab fares for fiveandtwenty years he has never paid for a bed or a meal out of his own pocket what has he done with his money he ought to be a rich man for his degree  what a man does with his money is i suppose no concern to those who pay it it is supposed to have been earned and there is an end of it as far as they are concerned  he shall have a thousand pounds said the marquis  that would hardly be liberal i would think twice before i dismissed him sir  i have thought a dozen times  i would let him remain said hampstead if only because hes a comfort to lady kingsbury what does it matter though he does talk of fanny were he to go she would talk to somebody else who might be perhaps less fit to hear her and he would of course talk to everybody  why has he not obeyed me demanded the marquis angrily it is i who have employed him i have been his patron and now he turns against me thus the marquis went on till his strength would not suffice for any further talking hampstead found himself quite unable to bring him to any other subject on that day he was sore with the injury done him in that he was not allowed to be the master in his own house  on the next morning hampstead heard from dr spicer that his father was in a state of health very far from satisfactory the doctor recommended that he should be taken away from trafford and at last went so far as to say that his advice extended to separating his patient from lady kingsbury it is of course a very disagreeable subject said the doctor for a medical man to meddle with but my lord the truth is that lady kingsbury frets him i dont of course care to hear what it is but there is something wrong lord hampstead who knew very well what it was did not attempt to contradict him when however he spoke to his father of the expediency of change of air the marquis told him that he would rather die at trafford than elsewhere  that his father was really thinking of his death was only too apparent from all that was said and done as to those matters of business they were soon settled between them there was at any rate that comfort to the poor man that there was no probability of any difference between him and his heir as to the property or as to money halfanhour settled all that then came the time which had been arranged for hampsteads return to his sister but before he went there were conversations between him and mr greenwood between him and his stepmother and between him and his father to which for the sake of our story it may be as well to refer  i think your father is illtreating me said mr greenwood mr greenwood had allowed himself to be talked into a thorough contempt and dislike for the young lord so that he had almost brought himself to believe in those predictions as to the young lords death in which lady kingsbury was always indulging as a consequence of this he now spoke in a voice very different from those obsequious tones which he had before been accustomed to use when he had regarded lord hampstead as his young patron  i am sure my father would never do that said hampstead angrily  it looks very like it i have devoted all the best of my life to his service and he now talks of dismissing me as though i were no better than a servant  whatever he does he will i am sure have adequate cause for doing  i have done nothing but my duty it is out of the question that a man in my position should submit to orders as to what he is to talk about and what not it is natural that lady kingsbury should come to me in her troubles  if you will take my advice said lord hampstead in that tone of voice which always produces in the mind of the listener a determination that the special advice offered shall not be taken you will comply with my fathers wishes while it suits you to live in his house if you cannot do that it would become you i think to leave it in every word of this there was a rebuke and mr greenwood who did not like being rebuked remembered it  of course i am nobody in this house now said the marchioness in her last interview with her stepson it is of no use to argue with an angry woman and in answer to this hampstead made some gentle murmur which was intended neither to assent or to dispute the proposition made to him because i ventured to disapprove of mr roden as a husband for your sister i have been shut up here and not allowed to speak to any one  fanny has left the house so that she may no longer cause you annoyance by her presence  she has left the house in order that she may be near the abominable lover with whom you have furnished her  this is not true said hampstead who was moved beyond his control by the double falseness of the accusation  of course you can be insolent to me and tell me that i speak falsehoods it is part of your new creed that you should be neither respectful to a parent nor civil to a lady  i beg your pardon lady kingsburyhe had never called her lady kingsbury beforeif i have been disrespectful or uncivil but your statements were very hard to bear fannys engagement with mr roden has not even received my sanction much less was it arranged or encouraged by me she has not gone to hendon hall to be near mr roden with whom she had undertaken to hold no communication as long as she remains there with me both for my own sake and for hers i am bound to repudiate the accusation then he went without further adieu leaving with her a conviction that she had been treated with the greatest contumely by her husbands rebellious heir  nothing could be sadder than the last words which the marquis spoke to his son i dont suppose hampstead that we shall ever meet again in this world  oh father  i dont think mr spicer knows how bad i am  will you have sir james down from london  no sir james can do me any good i fear it is ill ministering to a mind diseased  why sir should you have a mind diseased with few men can things be said to be more prosperous than with you surely this affair of fannys is not of such a nature as to make you feel that all things are bitter round you  it is not that  what then i hope i have not been a cause of grief to you  no my boyno it irks me sometimes to think that i should have trained you to ideas which you have taken up too violently but it is not that  my mother  she has set her heart against meagainst you and fanny i feel that a division has been made between my two families why should my daughter be expelled from my own house why should i not be able to have you here except as an enemy in the camp why am i to have that man take up arms against me whom i have fed in idleness all his life  i would not let him trouble my thoughts  when you are old and weak you will find it hard to banish thoughts that trouble you as to going where am i to go to  come to hendon  and leave her here with him so that all the world shall say that i am running away from my own wife hendon is your house now and this is mineand here i must stay till my time has come  this was very sad not as indicating the state of his fathers health as to which he was more disposed to take the doctors opinion than that of the patient but as showing the infirmity of his fathers mind he had been aware of a certain weakness in his fathers charactera desire not so much for ruling as for seeming to rule all that were around him the marquis had wished to be thought a despot even when he had delighted in submitting himself to the stronger mind of his first wife now he felt the chains that were imposed upon him so that they galled him when he could not throw them off all this was very sad to hampstead but it did not make him think that his fathers health had in truth been seriously affected   end of vol i                                          marion fay  a novel  by  anthony trollope  author of

only a few days before christmas crocker the post office clerk came back to his duties at the same time but as was the custom with him stole a day more than belonged to him and thus incurred the frowns of mr jerningham and the heavy wrath of the great Æolus the Æoluses of the civil service are necessarily much exercised in their minds by such irregularities to them personally it matters not at all whether one or another young man may be neglectful it may be known to such a one that a crocker may be missed from his seat without any great injurypossibly with no injury at allto the queens service there are crockers whom it would be better to pay for their absence than their presence this Æolus thought it was so with this crocker then why not dismiss crocker and thus save the waste of public money but there is a necessityalmost a necessitythat the crockers of the world should live they have mothers or perhaps even wives with backs to be clothed and stomachs to be fed or perhaps with hearts to be broken there is at any rate a dislike to proceed to the ultimate resort of what may be called the capital punishment of the civil service to threaten to frown to scold to make a young mans life a burden to him are all within the compass of an official Æolus you would think occasionally that such a one was resolved to turn half the clerks in his office out into the streetsso loud are the threats in regard to individuals he often is resolved to do so at the very next fault but when the time comes his heart misgives him even an Æolus is subject to mercy and at last his conscience becomes so callous to his first imperative duty of protecting the public service that it grows to be a settled thing with him that though a mans life is to be made a burden to him the man is not to be actually dismissed but there are men to whom you cannot make their life a burdenmen upon whom no frowns no scoldings no threats operate at all and men unfortunately sharp enough to perceive what is that ultimate decision to which their Æolus had been brought such a one was our crocker who cared very little for the blusterings on this occasion he had remained away for the sake of having an additional day with the braeside harriers and when he pleaded a bilious headache no one believed him for an instant it was in vain for Æolus to tell him that a man subject to health so precarious was altogether unfitted for the civil service crocker had known beforehand exactly what was going to be said to him and had discounted it at its exact worth even in the presence of mr jerningham he spoke openly of the days hunting knowing that mr jerningham would prefer his own ease to the trouble of renewed complaint if you would sit at your desk now that you have come back and go on with your docketing instead of making everybody else idle it would be a great deal better said mr jerningham  then my horse took the wall in a fly and old amblethwaite crept over afterwards continued crocker standing with his back to the fire utterly disregarding mr jerninghams admonitions  on his first entrance into the room crocker had shaken hands with mr jerningham then with bobbin and geraghty and at last he came to roden with whom he would willingly have struck up terms of affectionate friendship had it been possible for him to do so he had resolved that it should be so but when the moment came his courage a little failed him he had made himself very offensive to roden at their last interview and could see at a glance that roden remembered it as far as his own feelings were concerned such tiffs as he called them went for nothing he had indeed no feelings and was accustomed to say that he liked the system of give and takemeaning that he liked being impudent to others and did not care how impudent others might be to him this toughness and insolence are as sharp as needles to others who do not possess the same gifts roden had learned to detest the presence of the young man to be sore when he was even spoken to and yet did not know how to put him down you may have a fierce bull shut up you may muzzle a dog that will bite you may shoot a horse that you cannot cure of biting and tearing but you cannot bring yourself to spend a morning in hunting a bug or killing a flea crocker had made himself a serious annoyance even to lord hampstead though their presence together had only been for a very short time but roden had to pass his life at the same desk with the odious companion absolutely to cut him to let it be known all through the office that they two did not speak was to make too much of the matter but yet it was essentially necessary for his peace that some step should be taken to save himself from the mans insolence on the present occasion he nodded his head to crocker being careful not to lay the pen down from his fingers aint you going to give us your hand old fellow said crocker putting on his best show of courage  i dont know that i am said roden perhaps some of these days you may learn to make yourself less disagreeable  im sure ive always meant to be very friendly especially with you said crocker but it is so hard to get what one says taken in the proper sense  after this not a word was spoken between the two all the morning this happened on a saturdaysaturday the 20th of december on which day hampstead was to return to his own house punctually at one crocker left his desk and with a comic bow of mock courtesy to mr jerningham stuck his hat on the side of his head and left the office his mind as he took himself home to his lodgings was full of rodens demeanour towards him since he had become assured that his brother clerk was engaged to marry lady frances trafford he was quite determined to cultivate an enduring and affectionate friendship but what steps should he take to recover the ground which he had lost it occurred to him now that while he was in cumberland he had established quite an intimacy with lord hampstead and he thought that it would be well to use lord hampsteads acknowledged goodnature for recovering the ground which he had lost with his brother clerk                                          at about three oclock that afternoon when lady frances was beginning to think that the time of her brothers arrival was near at hand the servant came into the drawingroom and told her that a gentleman had called and was desirous of seeing her what gentleman asked lady frances has he sent his name  no my lady but he sayshe says that he is a clerk from the post office lady frances was at the moment so dismayed that she did not know what answer to give there could be but one post office clerk who should be anxious to see her and she had felt from the tone of the servants voice that he had known that it was her lover who had called everybody knew that the post office clerk was her lover some immediate answer was necessary she quite understood the pledge that her brother had made on her behalf and though she had not herself made any actual promise she felt that she was bound not to receive george roden but yet she could not bring herself to turn him away from the door and so to let the servant suppose that she was ashamed to see him to whom she had given the promise of her hand you had better show the gentleman in she said at last with a voice that almost trembled a moment afterwards the door was opened and mr crocker entered the room  she had endeavoured in the minute which had been allowed her to study the manner in which she should receive her lover as she heard the approaching footsteps she prepared herself she had just risen from her seat nearly risen when the strange man appeared it has to be acknowledged that she was grievously disappointed although she had told herself that roden ought not to have come to her what woman is there will not forgive her lover for coming even though he certainly should not have come what woman is there will fail to receive a stranger with hard looks when a stranger shall appear to her instead of an expected lover sir she said standing as he walked up the room and made a low bow to her as he took his position before her  crocker was dressed up to the eyes and wore yellow kid gloves lady frances he said i am mr crocker mr samuel crocker of the general post office you may not perhaps have heard of me from my friend mr roden  no indeed sir  you might have done so as we sit in the same room and at the same desk or you may remember meeting me at dinner at your uncles castle in cumberland  is anythinganything the matter with mr roden  not in the least my lady i had the pleasure of leaving him in very good health about two hours since there is nothing at all to occasion your ladyship the slightest uneasiness a dark frown came across her brow as she heard the man talk thus freely of her interest in george rodens condition she no doubt had betrayed her own secret as far as there was a secret but she was not on that account the less angry because he had forced her to do so  has mr roden sent you as a messenger she asked  no my lady no that would not be at all probable i am sure he would very much rather come with any message of his own at this he sniggered most offensively i called with a hope of seeing your brother lord hampstead with whom i may take the liberty of saying that i have a slight acquaintance  lord hampstead is not at home  so the servant told me then it occurred to me that as i had come all the way down from london for a certain purpose to ask a little favour from his lordship and as i was not fortunate enough to find his lordship at home i might ask the same from your ladyship  there can be nothing that i can do for you sir  you can do it my lady much better than any one else in the world you can be more powerful in this matter even than his lordship  what can it be asked lady frances  if your ladyship will allow me i will sit down as the story i have to tell is somewhat particular it was impossible to refuse him the use of a chair and she could therefore only bow as he seated himself i and george roden my lady have known each other intimately for these ever so many years again she bowed her head and i may say that we used to be quite pals when two men sit at the same desk together they ought to be thick as thieves see what a cat and dog life it is else dont you think so my lady  i know nothing of office life as i dont think that i can help you perhaps you wouldnt mindgoing away  oh my lady you must hear me to the end because you are just the person who can help me of course as you two are situated he would do anything you were to bid him now he has taken it into his head to be very huffy with me  indeed i can do nothing in the matter she said in a tone of deep distress  if you would only just tell him that i have never meant to offend him i am sure i dont know what it is that has come up it may be that i said a word in joke about lord hampstead only that there really could not have been anything in that nobody could have a more profound respect for his lordships qualities than i have and i may say the same for your ladyship most sincerely i have always thought it a great feather in rodens cap that he should be so closely connectedmore than closely i may saywith your noble family  what on earth was she to do with a man who would go on talking to her making at every moment insolent allusions to the most cherished secret of her heart i must beg you to go away and leave me sir she said my brother will be here almost immediately  this had escaped from her with a vain idea that the man would receive it as a threatthat he would think probably that her brother would turn him out of the house for his insolence in this she was altogether mistaken he had no idea that he was insolent then perhaps you will allow me to wait for his lordship he said  oh dear no he may come or he may not you really cannot wait you ought not to have come at all  but for the sake of peace my lady one word from your fair lips lady frances could endure it no longer she got up from her seat and walked out of the room leaving mr crocker planted in his chair in the hall she found one of the servants whom she told to take that man to the front door at once the servant did as he was bid and crocker was ushered out of the house without any feeling on his part that he had misbehaved himself  crocker had hardly got beyond the grounds when hampstead did in truth return the first words spoken between him and his sister of course referred to their fathers health he is unhappy rather than ill said hampstead  is it about me she asked  no not at all about you in the first instance  what does that mean  it is not because of you but from what others say about you  mamma she asked  yes and mr greenwood  does he interfere  i am afraid he doesnot directly with my father but through her ladyship who daily tells my father what the stupid old man says lady kingsbury is most irrational and harassing i have always thought her to be silly but now i cannot keep myself from feeling that she misbehaves herself grievously she does everything she can to add to his annoyance  that is very bad  it is bad he can turn mr greenwood out of the house if mr greenwood becomes unbearable but he cannot turn his wife out  could he not come here  i am afraid notwithout bringing her too she has taken it into her stupid head that you and i are disgracing the family as for me she seems to think that i am actually robbing her own boys of their rights i would do anything for them or even for her if i could comfort her but she is determined to look upon us as enemies my father says that it will worry him into his grave  poor papa  we can run away but he can not i became very angry when i was there both with her ladyship and that pestilential old clergyman and told them both pretty much what i thought i have the comfort of knowing that i have two bitter enemies in the house  can they hurt you  not in the leastexcept in this that they can teach those little boys to regard me as an enemy i would fain have had my brothers left to me mr greenwood and i must now say her ladyship also are nothing to me  it was not till after dinner that the story was told about crocker think what i must have felt when i was told that a clerk from the post office wanted to see me  and then that brute crocker was shown in asked hampstead  do you really know him  know him i should rather think so dont you remember him at castle hautboy  not in the least but he told me that he had been there  he never would leave me he absolutely drove me out of the country because he would follow me about when we were hunting he insulted me so grievously that i had to turn tail and run away from him what did he want of me  to intercede for him with george roden  he is an abominable man irrepressible so thickskinned that you cannot possibly get at him so as to hurt him it is of no use telling him to keep his distance for he does not in the least know what you mean i do not doubt that he has left the house with a conviction that he has gained a sincere friend in you                                          it was now more than a fortnight since marion fay had dined at hendon and hampstead felt that unless he could succeed in carrying on the attack which he had commenced any little beginning of a friendship which he had made with the quaker would be obliterated by the length of time if she thought about him at all she must think that he was very indifferent to let so long a time pass by without any struggle on his part to see her again there had been no word of love spoken he had been sure of that but still there had been something of affectionate intercourse which she could not have failed to recognize what must she think of him if he allowed that to pass away without any renewal without an attempt at carrying it further when she had bade him go in out of the cold there had been something in her voice which had made him feel that she was in truth anxious for him now more than a fortnight had gone and there had been no renewal fanny he said how would it be if we were to ask those quakers to dine here on christmas day  it would be odd wouldnt it as they are strangers and dined here so lately  people like that do not stand on ceremony at all i dont see why they shouldnt come i could say that you want to make their acquaintance  would you ask them alone  in that he felt that the great difficulty lay the fays would hardly come without mrs roden and the rodens could not be asked one doesnt always ask the same people to meet each other  it would be very odd and i dont think theyd come said lady frances gravely then after a pause she went on i fear john that there is more in it than mere dinner company  certainly there is he said boldlymuch more in it  you are not in love with the quakers daughter  i rather think i am when i have seen her three or four times more i shall be able to find out you may be sure of this that i mean to see her three or four times more and at any rate one of the times must be before i go down to gorse hall then of course she knew the whole truth he did however give up the idea as to the christmas dinnerparty having arrived at the belief after turning the matter over in his mind that zachary fay would not bring his daughter again so soon     chapter ii  mrs rodens eloquence   on sunday hampstead was nervous and fidgety he had at one time thought that it would be the very day for him to go to holloway he would be sure to find mrs roden at home after church and then if he could carry things to the necessary length he might also see zachary fay but on consideration it appeared to him that sunday would not suit his purpose george roden would be there and would be sadly in the way and the quaker himself would be in the way as it would be necessary that he should have some preliminary interview with marion before anything could be serviceably said to her father he was driven therefore to postpone his visit nor would monday do as he knew enough of the manners of paradise row to be aware that on monday mrs vincent would certainly be there it would be his object if things could be made to go pleasantly first to see mrs roden for a few minutes and then to spend as much of the afternoon as might be possible with marion fay he therefore fixed on the tuesday for his purpose and having telegraphed about the country for his horses groom and other appurtenances he went down to leighton on the monday and consoled himself with a days hunting with the staghounds  on his return his sister spoke to him very seriously as to her own affairs is not this almost silly john about mr roden not coming here  not silly at all according to my ideas  all the world knows that we are engaged the very servants have heard of it that horrid young man who came from the post office was aware of it  what has all that to do with it  if it has been made public in that way what can be the object of keeping us apart mamma no doubt told her sister and lady persiflage has published it everywhere her daughter is going to marry a duke and it has crowned her triumph to let it be known that i am going to marry only a post office clerk i dont begrudge her that in the least but as they have talked about it so much they ought at any rate to let me have my post office clerk  i have nothing to say about it one way or the other said hampstead i say nothing about it at any rate now  what do you mean by that john  when i saw how miserable you were at trafford i did my best to bring you away but i could only bring you here on an express stipulation that you should not meet george roden while you were in my house if you can get my fathers consent to your meeting him then that part of the contract will be over  i dont think i made any promise  i understand it so  i said nothing to papa on the subjectand i do not remember that i made any promise to you i am sure i did not  i promised for you to this she was silent are you going to ask him to come here  certainly not but if he did come how could i refuse to see him i thought that he was here on saturday and i told richard to admit him i could not send him away from the door  i do not think he will come unless he is asked said hampstead then the conversation was over  on the following day at two oclock lord hampstead again started for holloway on this occasion he drove over and left his trap and servant at the duchess of edinburgh he was so well known in the neighbourhood now as hardly to be able to hope to enter on the domains of paradise row without being recognized he felt that it was hard that his motions should be watched telling himself that it was one of the evils belonging to an hereditary nobility but he must accept this mischief as he did others and he walked up the street trying to look as though he didnt know that his motions were being watched first from number fifteen as he passed it and then from number ten opposite as he stood at mrs rodens door  mrs roden was at home and received him of course with her most gracious smile but her heart sank within her as she saw him for she felt sure that he had come in pursuit of marion fay it is very kind of you to call she said i had heard from george that you had gone down into the country since we had the pleasure of dining with you  yes my father has been unwell and i had to stay with him a few days or i should have been here sooner you got home all of you quite well  oh yes  miss fay did not catch cold  not at allthough i fear she is hardly strong  she is not ill i hope  oh no not that but she lives here very quietly and i doubt whether the excitement of going out is good for her  there was not much excitement at hendon hall i think he said laughing  not for you but for her perhaps in appreciating our own condition we are so apt to forget what is the condition of others to marion fay it was a strange event to have to dine at your houseand strange also to receive little courtesies such as yours it is hard for you to conceive how strongly the nature of such a girl may be effected by novelties i have almost regretted lord hampstead that i should have consented to take her there  has she said anything  oh no there was nothing for her to say you are not to suppose that any harm has been done  what harm could have been done he asked of what nature was the harm of which mrs roden was speaking could it be that marion had made any sign of altered feelings had declared in any way her liking or disliking had given outward testimony of thoughts which would have been pleasant to himor perhaps unpleasanthad he known them  no harm of course said mrs rodenonly to a nature such as hers all excitement is evil  i cannot believe that he said after a pause now and then in the lives of all of us there must come moments of excitement which cannot be all evil what would marion say if i were to tell her that i loved her  i hope you will not do that my lord  why should you hope so what right have you to hope so if i do love her is it not proper that i should tell her  but it would not be proper that you should love her  there mrs roden i take the liberty of declaring that you are altogether in the wrong and that you speak without due consideration  do i my lord  i think so why am i not to be allowed the ordinary privilege of a manthat of declaring my passion to a woman when i meet one who seems in all things to fulfil the image of perfection which i have formed for myselfwhen i see a girl that i fancy i can love  ah there is the worst it is only a fancy  i will not be accused in that way without defending myself let it be fancy or what not i love marion fay and i have come here to tell her so if i can make any impression on her i shall come again and tell her father so i am here now because i think that you can help me if you will not i shall go on without your help  what can i do  go to her with me now at once you say that excitement is bad for her the excitement will be less if you will come with me to her house  then there was a long pause in the conversation during which mrs roden was endeavouring to determine what might be her duty at this moment she certainly did not think that it would be well that lord hampstead the eldest son of the marquis of kingsbury should marry marion fay she was quite sure that she had all the world with her there were any one to know that she had assisted in arranging such a marriage that any one would certainly condemn her that would assuredly be the case not only with the young lords family not only with others of the young lords order but with all the educated world of great britain how could it be that such a one as marion fay should be a fitting wife for such a one as lord hampstead marion fay had undoubtedly great gifts of her own she was beautiful intelligent sweetminded and possessed of natural delicacyso much so that to mrs roden herself she had become as dear almost as a daughter but it was impossible that she should have either the education or the manners fit for the wife of a great english peer though her manners might be good and her education excellent they were not those required for that special position and then there was cause for other fears marions mother and brothers and sisters had all died young the girl herself had hitherto seemed to escape the scourge under which they perished but occasionally there would rise to her cheeks a bright colour which for the moment would cause mrs rodens heart to sink within her occasionally there would be heard from her not a cough but that little preparation for coughing which has become so painfully familiar to the ears of those whose fate it has been to see their beloved ones gradually fade from presumed health she had already found herself constrained to say a word or two to the old quaker not telling him that she feared any coming evil but hinting that change of air would certainly be beneficial to such a one as marion acting under this impulse he had taken her during the inclemency of the past spring to the isle of wight she was minded gradually to go on with this counsel so as if possible to induce the father to send his girl out of london for some considerable portion of the year if this were so how could she possibly encourage lord hampstead in his desire to make marion his wife  and then as to the girl herself could it be for her happiness that she should be thus lifted into a strange world a world that would be hard and ungracious to her and in which it might be only too probable that the young lord should see her defects when it would be too late for either of them to remedy the evil that had been done she had thought something of all this before having recognized the possibility of such a step as this after what she had seen at hendon hall she had told herself that it would be well at any rate to discourage any such idea in marions heart and had spoken jokingly of the gallantry of men of rank marion had smiled sweetly as she had listened to her friends words and had at once said that such manners were at any rate pretty and becoming in one so placed as lord hampstead there had been something in this to make mrs roden almost fear that her words had been taken as intending too muchthat marion had accepted them as a caution against danger not for worlds would she have induced the girl to think that any danger was apprehended but now the danger had come and it behoved mrs roden if possible to prevent the evil will you come across with me now said hampstead having sat silent in his chair while these thoughts were passing through the ladys mind  i think not my lord  why not mrs roden will it not be better than that i should go alone  i hope you will not go at all  i shall gocertainly i consider myself bound by all laws of honesty to tell her what she has done to me she can then judge what may be best for herself  do not go at any rate today lord hampstead let me beg at least as much as that of you consider the importance of the step you will be taking  i have thought of it said he  marion is as good as gold  i know she is  marion i say is as good as gold but is it likely that any girl should remain untouched and undazzled by such an offer as you can make her  touched i hope she may be as for dazzledi do not believe in it in the least there are eyes which no false lights can dazzle  but if she were touched as would no doubt be the case said mrs roden could it be well that you with such duties before you should marry the daughter of zachary fay listen to me a moment she continued as he attempted to interrupt her i know what you would say and i sympathize with much of it but it cannot be well for society that classes should be mixed together suddenly and roughly  what roughness would there be he asked  as lords and ladies are at present as dukes are and duchesses and such like there would be a roughness to them in having marion fay presented to them as one of themselves lords have married lowborn girls i know and the wives have been contented with a position which has almost been denied to them or only grudgingly accorded i have known something of that my lord and have feltat any rate i have seenits bitterness marion fay would fade and sink to nothing if she were subjected to such contumely to be marion fay is enough for her to be your wife and not to be thought fit to be your wife would not be half enough  she shall be thought fit  you can make her lady hampstead and demand that she shall be received at court you can deck her with diamonds and cause her to be seated high in honour according to your own rank but could you induce your fathers wife to smile on her in answer to this he was dumb do you think she would be contented if your fathers wife were to frown on her  my fathers wife is not everybody  she would necessarily be much to your wife take a week my lord or a month and think upon it she expects nothing from you yet and it is still in your power to save her from unhappiness  i would make her happy mrs roden  think about itthink about it  and i would make myself happy also you count my feelings as being nothing in the matter  nothing as compared with hers you see how plainly i deal with you let me say that for a time your heart will be sorethat you do in truth love this girl so as to feel that she is necessary to your happiness do you not know that if she were placed beyond your reach you would recover from that sting the duties of the world would still be open to you being a man you would still have before you many years for recovery before your youth had departed from you of course you would find some other woman and be happy with her for her if she came to shipwreck in this venture there would be no other chance  i would make this chance enough for her  so you think but if you will look abroad you will see that the perils to her happiness which i have attempted to describe are not vain i can say no more my lord but can only beg that you will take some little time to think of it before you put the thing out of your own reach if she had once accepted your love i know that you would never go back  never  therefore think again while there is time he slowly dragged himself up from his chair and left her almost without a word at parting she had persuaded himto take another week it was not that he doubted in the least his own purpose but he did not know how to gainsay her as to this small request in that frame of mind which is common to young men when they do not get all that they want angry disappointed and foiled he went downstairs and opened the front doorand there on the very steps he met marion fay  marion he said pouring all the tenderness of his heart into his voice  my lord  come in marionfor one moment then she followed him into the little passage and there they stood i had come over to ask you how you are after our little party  i am quite welland you  i have been away with my father or i should have come sooner  nayit was not necessary that you should trouble yourself  it is necessaryit is necessary or i should be troubled very much i am troubled she stood there looking down on the ground as though she were biding her time but she did not speak to him she would not come with me he said pointing up the stairs on which mrs roden was now standing she has told me that it is bad that i should come but i will come one day soon he was almost beside himself with love as he was speaking the girl was so completely after his own heart as he stood there close to her filled with her influences that he was unable to restrain himself  come up marion dear said mrs roden speaking from the landing it is hardly fair to keep lord hampstead standing in the passage  it is most unfair said marion good day my lord  i will stand here till you come down to me unless you will speak to me again i will not be turned out while you are here marion you are all the world to me i love you with my whole whole heart i had come here dear to tell you sobut she has delayed me she made me promise that i would not come again for a week as though weeks or years could change me say one word to me marion one word shall suffice now and then i will go marion can you love me  come to me marion come to me said mrs roden do not answer him now  no said marion looking up and laying her hand gently on the sleeve of his coat i will not answer him now it is too sudden i must think of words to answer such a speech lord hampstead i will go to her now  but i shall hear from you  you shall come to me again and i will tell you  tomorrow  nay but give me a day or two on friday i will be ready with my answer  you will give me your hand marion she gave it to him and he covered it with kisses only have this in your mind fixed as fate that no man ever loved a woman more truly than i love you no man was ever more determined to carry out his purpose i am in your hands think if you cannot dare to trust yourself into mine then he left her and went back to the duchess of edinburgh not thinking much of the eyes which might be looking at him     chapter iii  marions views about marriage   when lord hampstead shut the door behind him marion went slowly up the stairs to mrs roden who had returned to her drawingroom when she entered her friend was standing near the door with anxiety plainly written on her facewith almost more than anxiety she took marion by the hand and kissing her led her to the sofa i would have stopped him if i could she said  why should you have stopped him  such things should be considered more  he had made it too late for considering to be of service i knew i almost knew that he would come  you did  i can tell myself now that i did though i could not say it even to myself before there was a smile on her face as she spoke and though her colour was heightened there was none of that peculiar flush which mrs roden so greatly feared to see nor was there any special excitement in her manner there was no look either of awe or of triumph she seemed to take it as a matter of course quite as much at least as any lady amaldina could have done who might have been justified by her position in expecting that some young noble eldest son would fling himself at her feet  and are you ready with your answer marion turned her eyes towards her friend but made no immediate reply my darling girlfor you in truth are very dear to memuch thought should be given to such an appeal as that before any answer is made  i have thought  and are you ready  i think so dear mrs roden do not look at me like that if i do not say more to tell you immediately it is because i am not perhaps quite surenot sure at any rate of the reasons i may have to give i will come to you tomorrow and then i will tell you  there was room then at any rate for hope if the girl had not quite resolved to grasp at the high destiny offered to her it was still her friends duty to say something that might influence her  marion dear  say all that you think mrs roden surely you know that i know that whatever may come from you will come in love i have no mother and to whom can i go better than to you to fill a mothers place  dear marion it is thus i feel towards you what i would say to you i would say to my own child there are great differences in the ranks of men  i have felt that  and though i do in my honest belief think that the best and honestest of gods creatures are not always to be found among socalled nobles yet i think that a certain great respect should be paid to those whom chance has raised to high places  do i not respect him  i hope so but perhaps you may not show it best by loving him  as to that it is a matter in which one can perhaps hardly control oneself if asked for love it will come from you like water from a fountain unless it be so then it cannot come at all  that surely is a dangerous doctrine for a young woman  young women i think are compassed by many dangers said marion and i know but one way of meeting them  what way is that dear  i will tell you if i can find how to tell it tomorrow  there is one point marion on which i feel myself bound to warn you as i endeavoured also to warn him to him my words seemed to have availed nothing but you i think are more reasonable unequal marriages never make happy either the one side or the other  i hope i may do nothing to make him unhappy  unhappy for a moment you must make himfor a month perhaps or for a year though it were for years what would that be to his whole life  for years said marion no not for years would it be more than for days do you think  i cannot tell what may be the nature of the young mans heartnor can you but as to that it cannot be your duty to take much thought of his lasting welfare you are bound to think  oh yes of that certainlyof that above all things  i mean as to this world of what may come afterwards to one so little known we here can hardly dare to speakor even to think but a girl when she has been asked to marry a man is bound to think of his welfare in this life  i cannot but think of his eternal welfare also said marion  unequal marriages are always unhappy said mrs roden repeating her great argument  always  i fear so could you be happy if his great friends his father and his stepmother and all those highborn lords and ladies who are connected with himcould you be happy if they frowned on you  what would their frowns be to me if he smiled i should be happy if the world were light and bright to him it would certainly be light and bright to me  i thought so once marion i argued with myself once just as you are arguing now  nay mrs roden i am hardly arguing  it was just so that i spoke to myself saying that the joy which i took in a mans love would certainly be enough for my happiness but oh alas i fell to the ground i will tell you now more of myself than i have told any one for many a year more even than i have told george i will tell you because i know that i can trust your faith  yes you can trust me said marion  i also married greatly greatly as the worlds honours are concerned in mere rank i stood as a girl higher perhaps than you do now but i was lifted out of my own degree and in accepting the name which my husband gave me i assured myself that i would do honour to it at any rate by my conduct i did it no dishonourbut my marriage was most unfortunate  was he good asked marion  he was weak are you sure that lord hampstead is strong he was ficklehearted can you be sure that lord hampstead will be constant amidst the charms of others whose manners will be more like his own than yours can be  i think he would be constant said marion  because you are ready to worship him who has condescended to step down from his high pedestal and worship you is it not so  it may be that it is so said marion  ah yes my child it may be that it is so and then think of what may follownot only for him but for you also not only for you but for him also broken hearts crushed ambitions hopes all dead personal dislikes and perhaps hatred  not hatred not hatred  i lived to be hatedand why not another then she was silent and marion rising from her seat kissed her and went away to her home  she had very much to think of though she had declared that she had almost expected this offer from her lover still it could not be that the quaker girl the daughter of zachary fay messrs pogson and littlebirds clerk should not be astounded by having such an offer from such a suitor as lord hampstead but in truth the glory of the thing was not very much to her it was something no doubt it must be something to a girl to find that her own personal charms have sufficed to lure down from his lofty perch the topmost bird of them all that marion was open to some such weakness may be acknowledged of her but of the coronet of the diamonds of the lofty title and high seats of the castle and the parks and wellarranged equipages of the rich dresses of the obsequious servants and fawning world that would be gathered around her it may be said that she thought not at all she had in her short life seen one man who had pleased her ear and her eye and had touched her heart and that one man had instantly declared himself to be all her own that made her bosom glow with some feeling of triumph  that same evening she abruptly told the whole story to her father father she said lord hampstead was here today  here in this house  not in this house but i met him at our friends whom i went to see as is my custom almost daily  i am glad he came not here said the quaker  why should you be glad to this the quaker made no answer  his purpose was to have come here it was to see me that he came  to see thee  father the young lord has asked me to be his wife  asked thee to be his wife  yes indeed have you not often heard that young men may be infatuated it has chanced that i have been the cinderella for his eyes  but thou art no princess child  and therefore am unfit to mate with this prince i could not answer him at once father it was too sudden for me to find the words and the place was hardly fitting but i have found them now  what words my child  i will tell him with all respect and deferencenay i will tell him with some love for i do love himthat it will become him to look for his wife elsewhere  marion said the quaker who was somewhat moved by those things which had altogether failed with the girl herself marion must it be so  father it must certainly be so  and yet thou lovest him  though i were dying for his love it must be so  why my child why as far as i saw the young man he is good and gracious of great promise and like to be truehearted  good and gracious and truehearted oh yes and would you have it that i should bring such a one as that to sorrowperhaps to disgrace  why to sorrow why to disgrace wouldst thou be more likely to disgrace a husband than one of those painted jezebels who know no worship but that of their faded beauty thou hast not answered him marion  no father he is to come on friday for my answer  think of it yet again my child three days are no time for considering a matter of such moment bid him leave you for ten days further  i am ready now said marion  and yet thou lovest him that is not true to nature marion i would not bid thee take a mans hand because he is rich and great if thou couldst not give him thy heart in return i would not have thee break any law of god or man for the glitter of gold or tinsel of rank but the good things of this world if they be come by honestly are good and the love of an honest man if thou lovest him thyself in return is not of the less worth because he stands high in wealth and in honour  shall i think nothing of him father  yea verily it will be thy duty to think of him almost exclusively of himwhen thou shalt be his wife  then father shall i never think of him  wilt thou pay no heed to my words so as to crave from him further time for thought  not a moment father you must not be angry with your child for this my own feelings tell me true my own heart and my own heart alone can dictate to me what i shall say to him there are reasons  what reasons  there are reasons why my mothers daughter should not marry this man then there came a cloud across his brow and he looked at her as though almost overcome by his anger it seemed as though he strove to speak but he sat for a while in silence then rising from his chair he left the room and did not see her again that night  this was on a tuesday on the wednesday he did not speak to her on the subject the thursday was christmas day and she went to church with mrs roden nor did he on that day allude to the matter but on the evening she made to him a little request tomorrow father is a holiday is it not in the city  so they tell me i hate such tomfooleries when i was young a man might be allowed to earn his bread on all lawful days of the week now he is expected to spend the wages he cannot earn in drinking and shows  father you must leave me here alone after our dinner he will come for his answer  and you will give it  certainly father certainly do not question me further for it must be as i told you then he left her as he had done before but he did not urge her with any repetition of his request  this was what occurred between marion and her father but on the wednesday she had gone to mrs roden as she had promised and there explained her purpose more fully than she had before been able to do i have come you see she said smiling i might have told you all at once for i have changed nothing of my mind since first he spoke to me all so suddenly in the passage downstairs  are you so sure of yourself  quite surequite sure do you think i would hurt him  no no you would not i know do so willingly  and yet i must hurt him a little i hope it will hurt him just a little mrs roden stared at her oh if i could make him understand it all if i could bid him be a man so that it should wound him only for a short time  what wound  did you think that i could take him i the daughter of a city clerk to go and sit in his halls and shame him before all the world because he had thought fit to make me his wife never  marion marion  because he has made a mistake which has honoured me shall i mistake also so as to dishonour him because he has not seen the distance shall i be blind to it he would have given himself up for me shall i not be able to make a sacrifice to such a one as i am to sacrifice myself is all that i can do in the world  is it such a sacrifice  could it be that i should not love him when such a one comes casting his pearls about throwing sweet odours through the air whispering words which are softsounding as music in the heavens whispering them to me casting them at me turning on me the laughing glances of his young eyes how could i help to love him do you remember when for a moment he knelt almost at my feet and told me that i was his friend and spoke to me of his hearth did you think that that did not move me  so soon my childso soon  in a moment is it not so that it is done always  hearts are harder than that marion  mine i think was so soft just then that the half of his sweet things would have ravished it from my bosom but i feel for myself that there are two parts in me though the one can melt away and pass altogether from my control can gush like water that runs out and cannot be checked the other has something in it of hard substance which can stand against blows even from him  what is that something marion  nay i cannot name it i think it be another heart of finer substance or it may be it is womans pride which will suffer all things rather than hurt the one it loves i know myself no words from himno desire to see his joy as he would be joyful if i told him that i could give him all he asksno longing for all his love could do for me shall move me one tittle he shall tell himself to his dying day that the quaker girl because she loved him was true to his interests  my childmy child said mrs roden taking marion in her arms  do you think that i do not knowthat i have forgotten was it nothing to me to see mymother die and her little ones do i not know that i am not as others are free to wed not a lord like that but even one of my own standing mrs roden if i can live till my poor father shall have gone before me so that he may not be left alone when the weakness of age shall have come upon himthenthen i shall be satisfied to follow them no dream of loving had ever crossed my mind he has come and without my mind the dream has been dreamed i think that my lot will be happier so than if i had passed away without any feeling such as that i have now perhaps he will not marry till i am gone  would that hurt you so sorely  it ought not it shall not it will be well that he should marry and i will not wish to cause him evil he will have gone away and i shall hardly know of it perhaps they will not tell me mrs roden could only embrace her sobbing wiping her eyes with piteousness but i will not begrudge aught of the sacrifice she continued there is nothing i think sweeter than to deny oneself all things for love what are our lessons for but to teach us that shall i not do unto him as it would be well for me that some such girl should do for my sake if i were such as he  oh marion you have got the better part  and yetand yet i would that he should feel a little because he cannot have the toy that has pleased his eye what was it that he saw in me do you think as she asked the question she cheered up wonderfully  the beauty of your brow and eyesthe softness of your womans voice  nay but i think it was my quaker dress his eye perhaps likes things all of a colour i had too new gloves and a new frock when he saw me how well i remember his cominghow he would glance round at me till i hardly knew whether i was glad that he should observe me so muchor offended at his persistence i think that i was glad though i told myself that he should not have glanced at me so often and then when he asked us to go down to his house i did longi did longto win fathers consent to the journey had he not gone  do not think of it marion  that i will not promisebut i will not talk of it now dear mrs roden let all then be as though it had never been i do not mean to mope or to neglect my work because a young lord has crossed my path and told me that he loves me i must send him from me and then i will be just as i have been always having made this promise she went away leaving mrs roden much more flurried by the interview than was she herself when the friday came holiday as it was the quaker took himself off to the city after dinner without another word as to his daughters lover     chapter iv  lord hampstead is impatient   hampstead when he was sent away from paradise row and bade to wait till friday for an answer was disappointed almost cross and unreasonable in his feelings towards mrs roden to mrs roden altogether he attributed it that marion had deferred her reply whether the delay thus enjoined told well or ill for his hopes he could not bring himself to determine as he drove himself home his mind was swayed now in one direction and now in the other unless she loved him somewhat unless she thought it possible that she should love him she would hardly have asked for time to think of it all and yet had she really have loved him why should she have asked for time he had done for her all that a man could do for a girl and if she loved him she should not have tormented him by foolish delaysby coying her love  it should be said on his behalf that he attributed to himself no preponderance of excellence either on the score of his money or his rank he was able so to honour the girl as to think of her that such things would go for nothing with her it was not that he had put his coronet at her feet but his heart it was of that he thought when he reminded himself of all that he had done for her and told himself angrily that she should not have tormented him he was as arrogant and impatient of disappointment as any young lord of them allbut it was not however because he was a lord that he thought that marions heart was due to him  i have been over to holloway he said to his sister almost as soon as he had returned  out of the full heart the mouth speaks have you seen george asked lady frances  no i did not go to see him he of course would be at his office during the day i went about my own business  you need not be so savage with me john what was your own business at holloway  i went to ask marion fay to be my wife  you did  yes i did why should i not it seems the fashion for us all now to marry just those we fancy best  and why not have i gainsaid you if this quakers daughter be good and honest and fair to look at  that she is fair to look at i can say certainly that she is good i believe thoroughly that she is honest at any rate to me i cannot say as yet  not honest  she will not steal or pick a pocket if you mean that  what is it john why do you speak of her in this way  because i have chosen to tell you having made up my mind to do this thing i would not keep it secret as though i were ashamed of it how can i say that she is honest till she has answered me honestly  what answer has she made you she asked  noneas yet she has told me to come again another day  i like her better for that  why should you like her better just because youre a woman and think that shillyshallying and pretending not to know your own mind and keeping a fellow in suspense is becoming i am not going to change my mind about marion but i do think that mock hesitation is unnecessary and in some degree dishonest  must it necessarily be mock hesitation ought she not to be sure of herself that she can love you  certainly or that she should not love me i am not such a puppy as to suppose that she is to throw herself into my arms just because i ask her but i think that she must have known something of herself so as to have been able to tell me either to hope or not to hope she was as calm as a minister in the house of commons answering a question and she told me to wait till friday just as those fellows do when they have to find out from the clerks in the office what it is they ought to say  you will go again on friday she asked  of course i must it is not likely that she should come to me and then if she says that shed rather not i must come home once more with my tail between my legs  i do not think she will say that  how can you tell  it is the nature of a girl i think said lady frances to doubt a little when she thinks that she can love but not to doubt at all when she feels that she cannot she may be persuaded afterwards to change her mind but at first she is certain enough  i call that shillyshally  not at all the girl im speaking of is honest throughout and miss fay will have been honest should she accept you now it is not often that such a one as you john can ask a girl in vain  that is mean he said angrily that is imputing falseness and greed and dishonour to the girl i love if she has liked some fellow clerk in her fathers office better than she likes me shall she accept me merely because i am my fathers son  it was not that of which i was thinking a man may have personal gifts which will certainly prevail with a girl young and unsullied by the world as i suppose is your marion fay  bosh he said laughing as far as personal gifts are concerned one fellow is pretty nearly the same as another a girl has to be goodlooking a man has got to have something to buy bread and cheese with after that it is all a mere matter of liking and dislikingunless indeed people are dishonest which they very often are  up to this period of his life lord hampstead had never met any girl whom he had thought it desirable to make his wife it was now two years since the present marchioness had endeavoured to arrange an alliance between him and her own niece lady amaldina hauteville this though but two years had passed since seemed to him to have occurred at a distant period of his life very much had occurred to him during those two years his political creed had been strengthened by the convictions of others especially by those of george roden till it had included those advanced opinions which have been described he had annoyed and then dismayed his father by his continued refusal to go into parliament he had taken to himself ways of living of his own which gave to him the manners and appearance of more advanced age at that period two years since his stepmother still conceived high hopes of him even though he would occasionally utter in her presence opinions which seemed to be terrible he was then not of age and there would be time enough for a woman of her tact and intellect to cure all those follies the best way of curing them she thought would be by arranging a marriage between the heir to the marquisate and the daughter of so distinguished a conservative peer as her brotherinlaw lord persiflage having this high object in view she opened the matter with diplomatic caution to her sister lady persiflage had at that moment begun to regard lord llwddythlw as a possible soninlaw but was alive to the fact that lord hampstead possessed some superior advantages it was possible that her girl should really love such a one as lord hampsteadhardly possible that there should be anything romantic in a marriage with the heir of the duke of merioneth as far as wealth and rank went there was enough in both competitors she whispered therefore to her girl the name of the younger aspirantaspirant as he might be hoped to beand the girl was not opposed to the idea only let there be no falling to the ground between two stools no starving for want of fodder between two bundles of hay lord llwddythlw had already begun to give symptoms no doubt he was bald no doubt he was preoccupied with parliament and the county there was no doubt that his wife would have to encounter that touch of ridicule which a young girl incurs when she marries a man altogether removed beyond the world of romance but dukes are scarce and the man of business was known to be a man of high honour there would be no gambling no difficulties no possible question of a want of money and then his politics were the grandest known in englandthose of an old tory willing always to work for his party without desiring any of those rewards which the party wishes to divide among as select a number as possible what lord hampstead might turn out to be there was as yet no knowing he had already declared himself to be a radical he was fond of hunting and it was quite on the cards that he should take to newmarket then too his father might live for fiveandtwenty years whereas the duke of merioneth was already nearly eighty but hampstead was as beautiful as a young phoebus and the pair would instantly become famous if only from their good looks alone the chance was given to lady amaldina but only given on the understanding that she must make very quick work of her time  hampstead was coaxed down to castle hautboy for a month in september with an idea that the young lovers might be as romantic as they pleased among the lakes some little romance there was but at the end of the first week amaldina wisely told her mother that the thing wouldnt do she would always be glad to regard lord hampstead as a cousin but as to anything else there must be an end of it i shall some day give up my title and abandon the property to freddy i shall then go to the united states and do the best i can there to earn my own bread this little speech made by the proposed lover to the girl he was expected to marry opened lady amaldinas eyes to the danger of her situation lord llwddythlw was induced to spend two days in the following month at castle hautboy and then the arrangements for the welsh alliance were completed  from that time forth a feeling of illwill on the part of lady kingsbury towards her stepson had grown and become strong from month to month she had not at first conceived any idea that her lord frederic ought to come to the throne that had come gradually when she perceived or thought that she perceived that hampstead would hardly make a marriage properly aristocratic hitherto no tidings of any proposed marriage had reached her ears she lived at last in daily fear as any marriage would be the almost sure forerunner of a little lord highgate if something might happensomething which she had taught herself to regard as beneficent and fitting rather than fatalsomething which might ensure to her little lord frederic those prospects which he had almost a right to expect then in spite of all her sufferings heaven would have done something for her for which she might be thankful what will her ladyship say when she hears of my maid marion said hampstead to his sister on the christmas day before his further visit to holloway  will it matter much asked lady frances  i think my feelings towards her are softer than yours she is silly arrogant harsh and insolent to my father and altogether unprincipled in her expectations and ambitions  what a character you give her said his sister  but nevertheless i feel for her to such an extent that i almost think i ought to abolish myself  i cannot say that i feel for her  it is all for her son that she wants it and i agree with her in thinking that freddy will be better fitted than i am for the position in question i am determined to marry marion if i can get her but all the traffords unless it be yourself will be brokenhearted at such a marriage if once i have a son of my own the matter will be hopeless if i were to call myself snooks and refused to take a shilling from the property i should do them no good marions boy would be just as much in their way as i am  what a way of looking at it  how my stepmother will hate her a quakers daughter a clerk at pogson and littlebirds living at paradise row cant you see her is it not hard upon her that we should both go to paradise row lady frances could not keep herself from laughing you cant do her any permanent injury because you are only a girl but i think she will poison me it will end in her getting mr greenwood to give me some broth  john you are too terrible  if i could be on the jury afterwards i would certainly acquit them both on the ground of extreme provocation  early on the following morning he was in a fidget having fixed no hour for his visit to holloway it was not likely that she should be out or engaged but he determined not to go till after lunch all employment was out of the question and he was rather a trouble to his sister but in the course of the morning there came a letter which did for a while occupy his thoughts the envelope was addressed in a hand he did not know and was absurdly addressed to the     right honourable     the lord hampstead  i wonder who this ass is said he tearing it open the ass was samuel crocker and the letter was as follows      heathcote street    mecklenburg square    christmas day 18     my dear lord hampstead     i hope i may be excused for addressing your lordship in    this familiar manner i take occasion of this happy day    to write to your lordship on a message of peace since    i had the honour of meeting you at your noble uncles    mansion castle hautboy i have considered it one of the    greatest delights of my life to be able to boast of your    acquaintance you will not i am sure forget that we have    been fellow sportsmen and that we rode together on that    celebrated run when we killed our fox in the field just    over airey force i shall never forget the occasion or    how well your lordship went over our rough country to my    mind there is no bond of union so strong as that of sport        up strikes little davy with his musical horn     i am sure you will remember that my lord and the    beautiful song to which it belongs i remember too how    as we were riding home after the run your lordship was    talking all the way about our mutual friend george roden     he is a man for whom i have a most sincere regard both as    being an excellent public servant and as a friend of your    lordships it is quite a pleasure to see the way in which    he devotes himself to the serviceas i do also when    you have taken the queens shilling you ought to earn    it those are my principles my lord we have a couple    of young fellows there whose only object it is to get    through the day and eat their lunches i always tell them    that official hours aint their own i suppose theyll    understand me some day     but as i was saying to your lordship about george    roden there has something come up which i dont quite    understand which seems to have turned him against me    nothing has ever given me so much pleasure as when i    heard of his prospects as to a certain matterwhich    your lordship will know what i mean nothing could be    more flattering than the way ive wished him joy ever so    many times so i do also your lordship and her ladyship    because he is a most respectable young man though his    station in life isnt so high as some peoples but a    clerk in h m s has always been taken for a gentleman    which i am proud to think is my position as well as his     but as i was saying to your lordship something seems to    have gone against him as to our mutual friendship he sits    there opposite and wont speak a word to me except just    to answer a question and that hardly civil he is as    sweet as sugar to those fellows who aint at the same    desk with him as i amor i should think it was his    future prospects were making him upsetting couldnt    your lordship do something to make things up between us    againespecially on this festive occasion im sure your    lordship will remember how pleasant we were together at    castle hautboy and at the hunt and especially as we were    riding home together on that day i did take the liberty    of calling at hendon hall when her ladyship was kind    enough to see me of course there was a delicacy in    speaking to her ladyship about mr roden which nobody    could understand better than i do but i think she made me    something of a promise that she would say a word when a    proper time might come     it could only have been a joke of mine and i do joke    sometimes as your lordship may have observed but i    shouldnt think roden would be the man to be mortally    offended by anything of that sort anyway i will leave    the matter in your lordships hands merely remarking    thatas your lordship may rememberblessed are the    peacemakers for theirs is the kingdom of heaven     i have the honour to be    my dear lord hampstead    your lordships most obedient    very humble servant     samuel crocker   fretful and impatient as he was on that morning it was impossible for hampstead not to laugh at this letter he showed it to his sister who in spite of her annoyance was constrained to laugh also i shall tell george to take him to his bosom at once said he  why should george be bothered with him  because george cant help himself they sit at the same desk together as crocker has not forgotten to tell me a dozen times when a man perseveres in this way and is thickskinned enough to bear all rebuffs there is nothing he will not accomplish i have no doubt he will be riding my horses in leicestershire before the season is over an answer however was written to him in the following words      dear mr crocker     i am afraid i cannot interfere with mr roden who doesnt    like to be dictated to in such matters     yours truly     hampstead   there said he i do not think he can take that letter as a mark of friendship  in this way the morning was passed till the time came for the start to holloway lady frances standing at the hall door as he got into his trap saw that the fashion of his face was unusually serious     chapter v  the quakers eloquence   when the friday morning came in paradise row both father and daughter at no 17 were full of thought as they came down to breakfast to each of them it was a day laden with importance the fathers mind had been full of the matter ever since the news had been told to him he had received marions positive assurance that such a marriage was altogether impossible with something of impatience till she had used that argument as to her own health which was so powerful with her on hearing that he had said nothing but had gone away nor had he spoken a word on the subject since but his mind had been full of it he had lost his wifeand all his little ones as she had said but he had declared to himself with strong confidence that this child was to be spared to him he was a man whose confidence was unbounded in things as to which he had resolved it was as though he had determined in spite of fate in spite of god that his marion should live and she had grown up under his eyes if not robust by no means a weak creature she did her work about the house and never complained in his eyes she was very beautiful but he saw nothing in her colour which was not to him a sign of health he told himself that it was nothing that she having seen so many die in her own family should condemn herself but for himself he repudiated the idea and declared to himself that she should not become an early victim so thinking he exercised his mind constantly during those few days in considering whether there was any adequate cause for the refusal which marion had determined to give this man  he in truth was terribly anxious that this grand stroke of fortune should be acknowledged and accepted he wanted nothing from the young lord himselfexcept perhaps that he might be the young lords fatherinlaw but he did want it all long for it all pant for it all on behalf of his girl if all these good things came in his girls way because of her beauty her grace and her merit why should they not be accepted others not only accepted these things for their daughters but hunted for them cheated for them did all mean things in searching for themand had their tricks and their lies regarded by the world quite as a matter of coursebecause it was natural that parents should be anxious for their children he had not hunted he had not cheated the thing had come in his girls way the man had found her to be the most lovely the most attractive the most loveable among all whom he had seen and was this glory to be thrown away because she had filled her mind with false fears though she were to die must not the man take his chance with her as do other husbands in marrying other wives  he had been thinking of this and of nothing but this during the days which had intervened since lord hampstead had been in paradise row he had not said a word to his daughterhad indeed not dared to say a word to her so abhorrent to him was the idea of discussing with her the probabilities of her own living or dying and he was doubtful too whether any words coming from him at the present might not strengthen her in her resolution if the man really loved her he might prevail his words would be stronger to overcome her than any that could be spoken by her father and then too if he really loved her the one repulse would not send him back for ever it might perhaps be better that any arguments from her father should be postponed till she should have heard her lovers arguments but his mind was so filled with the whole matter that he could not bring himself to assure himself certainly that his decision was the best though he was one who rarely needed counsel from others on this occasion he did need it and now it was his purpose to ask counsel of mrs roden before the moment should have come which might be fatal to his hopes  as this was the day immediately following christmas there was no business for him in the city in order that the weary holiday might be quicker consumed they breakfasted at no 17 an hour later than was usual after breakfast he got through the morning as well as he could with his newspaper and some record of stocks and prices which he had brought with him from the city so he remained fretful doing nothing pretending to read but with his mind fixed upon the one subject till it was twelve oclock at which hour he had determined to make his visit at halfpast one they were to dine each of them having calculated without however a word having been spoken that lord hampstead would certainly not come till the ceremony of dinner would be over though the matter was so vitally important to both of them not a word concerning it was spoken  at twelve oclock he took up his hat and walked out you will be back punctually for dinner father she asked he made his promise simply by nodding his head and then left the room five minutes afterwards he was closeted with mrs roden in her drawingroom having conceived the difficulty of leading up to the subject gradually he broke into it at once marion has told thee that this young man will be here today she simply assented hast thou advised her as to what she should say  she has not seemed to want advice  how should a girl not want advice in so great a matter  how indeed but yet she has needed none  has she told thee he asked what it is in her mind to do  i think so  has she said that she would refuse the man  yes that certainly was her purpose  and given the reasons he said almost trembling as he asked the question  yes she gave her reasons  and didst thou agree with her before she could reply to this mrs roden felt herself compelled to pause when she thought of that one strongest reason fully as she agreed with it she was unable to tell the father of the girl that she did so she sat looking at him wanting words with which she might express her full concurrence with marion without plunging a dagger into the others heart then thou didst agree with her there was something terrible in the intensity and slowness of the words as he repeated the question  on the whole i did she said i think that unequal marriages are rarely happy  that was all he asked then when she was again silent he made the demand which was so important to him did she say aught of her health in discussing all this with thee  she did mr fay  and thou  it was a subject my friend on which i could not speak to her all that was said came from her her mind was so fully made up as i have said before no advice from me could avail anything with some people it is easy to see that whether you agree with them or differ from them it is impossible to turn them  but to me thou canst say whether thou hast agreed with her yes i know well that the subject is one difficult to talk of in a fathers hearing but there are things which should be talked of though the heart should break after another pause he continued is there thinkest thou sufficient cause in the girls health to bid her sever herself from these delights of life and customary habits which the lord has intended for his creatures at every separate question he paused but when she was silent he went on with other questions is there that in her looks is there that in her present condition of life which make it needful for thee her friend or for me her father to treat her as though she were already condemned by the hand of the lord to an early grave then again looking almost fiercely into her face he went on with his examination that is what thou art doing  not inot i  yes thou my friend thou with all thy womans softness in thy heart it is what i shall do unless i bring myself to tell her that her fears are vain to me she has said that that is her reason it is not that she cannot love the man has she not said as much to thee  yes truly  and art thou not assenting to it unless thou tellst her that her fancies are not only vain but wrong though thou hast not spoken the word has not thy silence assented as fully as words could do answer me at any rate to that  it is so she said  is it then necessary to condemn her art thou justified in thine own thoughts in bidding her regard herself as one doomed again there was a pause what was she to say thou art aware that in our poor household she does all that the strictest economy would demand from an active mother of a family she is never idle if she suffers i do not see it she takes her food if not with strong appetite yet regularly she is upright and walks with no languor no doctor comes near her if like others she requires change of air and scene what can give her such chance as this marriage hast thou not heard that for girls of feeble health marriage itself will strengthen them is she such that thou as her friend must bid her know that she must perish like a blighted flower must i bid her to hem and stitch her own windingsheet it comes to that if no word be said to her to turn her from this belief she has seen them all dieone after anotherone after another till the idea of death of death for herself as well as for them has gotten hold of her and yet it will be the case that one in a family shall escape i have asked among those who know and i have found that it is so the lord does not strike them all always but if she thinks that she is stricken then she will fall if she goes forth to meet death on the path death will come half way to encounter her dost thou believe of me that it is because the man is a noble lord that i desire this marriage  oh no mr fay  he will take my child away from me she will then be but little to me what want i with lords who for the few days of active life that are left to me would not change my city stool for any seat that any lord can give me but i shall know that she has had her chance in the world and has not been unnecessarily doomedto an early grave  what would you have me do  go to her and tell her that she should look forward with trust in god to such a state of health as he may vouchsafe to give her her thoughts are mostly with her god bid her not shorten his mercies bid her not to tell herself that she can examine his purposes bid her do in this as her nature bids her and if she can love this man give herself into his arms and leave the rest to the lord  but he will be there at once  if he be there what harm thou canst go when he comes to the door i shall go to her now and we shall dine together and then at once i will leave her when you see me pass the window then thou canst take thine occasion so saying without waiting for a promise he left her and went back to his own house  and marions heart had been full of many thoughts that morningsome of them so trifling in their object that she herself would wonder at herself because that they should occupy her how should she be dressed to receive her lover in what words first should she speak to himand in what sort should she let any sign of love escape from her her resolution as to her great purpose was so fixed that there was no need for further thought on that matter it was on the little things that she was intent how far might she indulge herself in allowing some tenderness to escape her how best might she save him from any great pain and yet show him that she was proud that he had loved her in what dress she might receive him in that would she sit at table with her father it was christmas time and the occasion would justify whatever of feminine smartness her wardrobe possessed as she brought out from its recess the rich silk frock still all but new in which he had first seen her she told herself that she would probably have worn it for her fathers sake had no lover been coming on the day before the christmas day she had worn it at church and the shoes with the pretty buckles and the sober but yet handsome morsel of lace which was made for her throatand which she had not been ashamed to wear at that memorable dinnerthey were all brought out it was christmas and her fathers presence would surely have justified them all and would she not wish to leave in her lovers eyes the memory of whatever prettiness she might have possessed they were all produced but when the moment came for arraying herself they were all restored to their homes she would be the simple quaker girl as she was to be found there on monday on tuesday and on wednesday it would be better that he should know how little there was for him to lose  zachary fay ate his dinner almost without a word she though she smiled on him and tried to look contented found it almost impossible to speak she uttered some little phrases which she intended to be peculiar to the period of the year but she felt that her fathers mind was intent on what was coming and she discontinued her efforts she found it hardly possible to guess at the frame of his mind so silent had he been since first he had yielded to her when she assured him of her purpose but she had assured him and he could not doubt her purpose if he were unhappy for the moment it was needful that he should be unhappy there could be no change and therefore it was well that he should be silent he had hardly swallowed his dinner when he rose from his chair and bringing in his hat from the passage spoke a word to her before he departed i am going into the city marion he said i know it is well that i should be absent this afternoon i shall return to tea god bless thee my child  marion rising from her chair kissed his lips and cheeks and accompanied him to the door it will be all well my father she said it will be all well and your child will be happy  about halfanhour afterwards there came a knock at the door and marion for a moment thought that her lover was already there but it was mrs roden who came up to her in the drawingroom am i in the way marion she asked i will be gone in a minute but perhaps i can say a word first  why should you be in the way  he is coming  yes i suppose so he said that he would come but what if he come you and he are old friends  i would not be here to interrupt him i will escape when we hear the knock oh marion  what is it mrs roden you are sad and something troubles you  yes indeed there is something which troubles me sorely this lover of yours  it is fixed dear friend fixed as fate it does not trouble me it shall not trouble me why should it be a trouble suppose i had never seen him  but you have seen him my child  yes indeed and whether that be for good or evil either to him or to me it must be accepted nothing now can alter that but i think indeed that it is a blessing it will be something to me to remember that such a one as he has loved me and for him  i would speak now of you marion  i am contented  it may be marion that in this concerning your health you should be altogether wrong  how wrong  what right have you or i to say that the lord has determined to shorten your days  who has said so  it is on that theory that you are acting  nonot on that not on that alone were i as strong as are other girlsas the very strongesti would do the same has my father been with you  yes he has  my poor father but it is of no avail it would be wrong and i will not do it if i am to die i must die if i am to live let me live i shall not die certainly because i have resolved to send this fine lover away however weak marion fay may be she is strong enough not to pine for that  if there be no need  no need what was it you said of unequal marriages what was the story that you told me of your own if i love this man of whom am i to think the most could it be possible that i should be to him what a wife ought to be to her husband could i stand nobly on his hearthrug and make his great guests welcome should i be such a one that every day he should bless the kind fortune which had given him such a woman to help him to rule his house how could i go from the littleness of these chambers to walk through his halls without showing that i knew myself to be an intruder and yet i should be so proud that i should resent the looks of all who told me by their faces that i was so he has done wrong in allowing himself to love me he has done wrong in yielding to his passion and telling me of his love i will be wiser and nobler than he if the lord will help me if my saviour will be on my side i will not do wrong i did not think that you mrs roden would turn against me  turn against thee marion i to turn against thee  you should strengthen me  it seems to me that you want no strength from others it is for your poor father that i would say a word  i would not have father believe that my health has aught to do with it you knowyou know what right i have to think that i am fit to marry and to hope to be the mother of children it needs not that he should know let it suffice for him to be told that i am not equal to this greatness a word escaped me in speaking to him and i repent myself that i so spoke to him but tell himand tell him trulythat were my days fixed here for the next fifty years were i sure of the rudest health i would not carry my birth my manners my habits into that young lords house how long would it be mrs roden before he saw some little trick that would displease him some word would be wrongly spoken some garment would be illfolded some awkward movement would tell the taleand then he would feel that he had done wrong to marry the quakers daughter all the virtues under the sun cannot bolster up love so as to stand the battery of one touch of disgust tell my father that and tell him that i have done well then you can tell him also that if god shall so choose it i shall live a strong old maid for many years to think night and day of his goodness to meof his great love  mrs roden as she had come across from her own house had known that her mission would fail to persuade another against ones own belief is difficult in any case but to persuade marion fay on such a matter as this was a task beyond the eloquence of man or woman she had made up her mind that she must fail utterly when the knock came at the door she took the girl in her arms and kissed her without further attempt she would not even bid her think of it once again as might have been so easy at parting i will go into your room while he passes she said as she did so lord hampsteads voice was heard at the door     chapter vi  marions obstinacy   lord hampstead drove himself very fast from hendon hall to the duchess of edinburgh at holloway and then jumping out of his trap left it without saying a word to his servant and walked quickly up paradise row till he came to no 17 there without pausing a moment he knocked sharply at the door going on such a business as this he did not care who saw him there was an idea present to him that he would be doing honour to marion fay if he made it known to all the world of holloway that he had come there to ask her to be his wife it was this feeling which had made him declare his purpose to his sister and which restrained him from any concealment as to his going and coming  marion was standing alone in the middle of the room with her two hands clasped together but with a smile on her face she had considered much as to this moment determining even the very words that she would use the words probably were forgotten but the purpose was all there he had resolved upon nothing had considered nothingexcept that she should be made to understand that because of his exceeding love he required her to come to him as his wife marion he said marion you know why i am here and he advanced to her as though he would at once have taken her in his arms  yes my lord i know  you know that i love you i think surely that never love was stronger than mine if you can love me say but the one word and you will make me absolutely happy to have you for my wife is all that the world can give me now why do you go from me is it to tell me that you cannot love me marion do not say that or i think my heart will break  she could not say that but as he paused for her answer it was necessary that she should say something and the first word spoken must tell the whole truth even though it might be that the word must be repeated often before he could be got to believe that it was an earnest word my lord she began  oh i do hate that form of address my name is john because of certain conventional arrangements the outside people call me lord hampstead  it is because i can be to you no more than one of the outside people that i call youmy lord  marion  only one of the outside peopleno more though my gratitude to you my appreciation my friendship for you may be ever so strong my fathers daughter must be just one of the outside people to lord hampsteadand no more  why so why do you say it why do you torment me why do you banish me at once and tell me that i must go home a wretched miserable man whywhywhy  because my lord  i can give a reasona good reasona reason which i cannot oppose though it must be fatal to me unless i can remove it a reason to which i must succumb if necessary but to which marion i will not succumb at once if you say that you cannot love me that will be a reason  if it were necessary that she should tell him a lie she must do so it would have been pleasant if she could have made him understand that she would be content to love him on condition that he would be content to leave her that she should continue to love him and that he should cease to love herunless perhaps just a littlethat had been a scheme for the future which had recommended itself to her there should be a something left which should give a romance to her life but which should leave him free in all things it had been a dream in which she had much trusted but which while she listened to the violence of his words she acknowledged to herself to be almost impossible she must tell the liebut at the moment it seemed to her that there might be a middle course i dare not love you she said  dare not love me marion who hinders you who tells you that you may not is it your father  no my lord no  it is mrs roden  no my lord this is a matter in which i could obey no friend no father i have had to ask myself and i have told myself that i do not dare to love above my station in life  i am to have that bugbear again between me and my happiness  between that and your immediate wishesyes is it not so in all things if ieven ihad set my heart upon some one below me would not you as my friend have bade me conquer the feeling  i have set my heart on one whom in the things of the world i regard as my equalin all other things as infinitely my superior  the compliment is very sweet to me but i have trained myself to resist sweetness it may not be lord hampstead it may not be you do not know as yet how obstinate such a girl as i may become when she has to think of anothers welfareand a little perhaps of her own  are you afraid of me  yes  that i should not love you  even of that when you should come to see in me that which is not lovable you would cease to love me you would be good to me because your nature is good kind to me because your nature is kind you would not illtreat me because you are gentle noble and forgiving but that would not suffice for me i should see it in your eye despite yourselfand hear it in your voice even though you tried to hide it by occasional softness i should eat my own heart when i came to see that you despised your quaker wife  all that is nonsense marion  my lord  say the word at once if it has to be saidso that i may know what it is that i have to contend with for you my heart is so full of love that it seems to be impossible that i should live without you if there could be any sympathy i should at once be happy if there be none say so  there is none  no spark of sympathy in you for mefor one who loves you so truly when the question was put to her in that guise she could not quite tell so monstrous a lie as would be needed for an answer fit for her purpose this is a matter marion in which a man has a right to demand an answerto demand a true answer  lord hampstead it may be that you should perplex me sorely it may be that you should drive me away from you and to beg you never to trouble me any further it may be that you should force me to remain dumb before you because that i cannot reply to you in proper words but you will never alter my purpose if you think well of marion fay take her word when she gives it you i can never become your lordships wife  never  never certainly never  have you told me whyall the reason why  i have told you enough lord hampstead  by heavens no you have not answered me the one question that i have asked you you have not given me the only reason which i would takeeven for a while can you love me marion  if you loved me you would spare me she said then feeling that such words utterly betrayed her she recovered herself and went to work with what best eloquence was at her command to cheat him out of the direct answer which he required i think she said you do not understand the workings of a girls heart in such a matter she does not dare to ask herself about her love when she knows that loving would avail her nothing for what purpose should i inquire into myself when the object of such inquiry has already been obtained why should i trouble myself to know whether this thing would be a gain to me or not when i am well aware that i can never have the gain  marion i think you love me she looked at him and tried to smiletried to utter some halfjoking word and then as she felt that she could no longer repress her tears she turned her face from him and made no attempt at a reply marion he said again i think that you love me  if you loved me my lord you would not torture me she had seated herself now on the sofa turning her face away from him over her shoulder so that she might in some degree hide her tears he sat himself at her side and for a moment or two got possession of her hand  marion he said pleading his case with all the strength of words which was at his command you know do you not that no moment of life can be of more importance to me than this  is it so my lord  none can be so important i am striving to get her for my companion in life who to me is the sweetest of all human beings to touch you as i do now is a joy to me even though you have made my heart so sad at the moment she struggled to get her hand away from him but the struggle was not at first successful you answer me with arguments which are to me of no avail at all they are to my thinking simply a repetition of prejudices to which i have been all my life opposed you will not be angry because i say so  oh no my lord she said not angry i am not angry but indeed you must not hold me with that she extricated her hand which he allowed to pass from his grasp as he continued his address to her  as to all that i have my opinion and you have yours can it be right that you should hold to your own and sacrifice me who have thought so much of what it is i want myselfif in truth you love me let your opinion stand against mine and neutralize it let mine stand against yours and in that we shall be equal then after that let love be lord of all if you love me marion i think that i have a right to demand that you shall be my wife  there was something in this which she did not know how to answerbut she did know she was quite sure that no word of his no tenderness either on his part or on her own would induce her to yield an inch it was her duty to sacrifice herself for himfor reasons which were quite apparent to herselfand she would do it the fortress of her inner purpose was safe although he had succeeded in breaking down the bulwark by which it had been her purpose to guard it he had claimed her love and she had not been strong enough to deny the claim let the bulwark go she was bad at lying let her lie as she might he had wit enough to see through it she would not take the trouble to deny her love should he persist in saying that it had been accorded to him but surely she might succeed at last in making him understand that whether she loved him or no she would not marry him i certainly shall never be your wife she said  and that is all  what more my lord  you can let me go and never wish me to return  i can my lord your return would only be a trouble to you and a pain to me another time do not turn your eyes too often on a young woman because her face may chance to please you it is well that you should marry go and seek a wife with judgment among your own people when you have done that then you may return and tell marion fay that you have done well by following her advice  i will come again and again and again and i will tell marion fay that her counsels are unnatural and impossible i will teach her to know that the man who loves her can seek no other wifethat no other mode of living is possible to him than one in which he and marion fay shall be joined together i think i shall persuade her at last that such is the case i think she will come to know that all her cold prudence and worldly wouldbe wisdom can be of no avail to separate those who love each other i think that when she finds that her lover so loves her that he cannot live without her she will abandon those fears as to his future fickleness and trust herself to one of whose truth she will have assured herself then he took her hand and kneeling at her knee he kissed it before she was powerful enough to withdraw it and so he left her without another word and mounting on his vehicle drove himself home without having exchanged a single word at holloway with any one save marion fay  she when she was left alone threw herself at full length on the sofa and burst into an ecstacy of tears trust herself to him yes indeed she would trust herself to him entirely only in order that she might have the joy for one hour of confessing her love to him openly let the consequences to herself afterwards be what they might as to that future injury to her pride of which she had spoken both to her father and also to her friendof which she had said so much to herself in discussing this matter with her own heartas to that he had convinced her it did not become her in any way to think of herself in this matter he certainly would be able to twist her as he would if she could stand upon no surer rock than her fears for her own happiness one kiss from him would be payment for it all but all his love all his sweetness all his truth all his eloquence should avail nothing with her towards overcoming that spirit of selfsacrifice by which she was dominated though he should extort from her all her secret that would be her strength though she should have to tell him of her failing healthher certainly failing healththough even that should be necessary she certainly would not be won from her purpose it might be sweet she thought to make him in all respects her friend of friends to tell him everything to keep no fear no doubt no aspiration a secret from him love you oh my dearest thou very pearl of my heart love you indeed oh yes do you not know that not even for an instant could i hide my love are you not aware did you not see at the moment that when you first knelt at my feet my heart had flown to you without an effort on my part to arrest it but now my beloved one now we understand each other now there need be no reproaches between us now there need be no speaking of distrust i am all yoursonly it is not fit as you know dearest that the poor quaker girl should become your wife now that we both understand that why should we be sad why should we mourn why should she not succeed in bringing things to such a pass as this and if so why should life be unhappy either to him or to her  thus she was thinking of it till she had almost brought herself to a state of bliss when her father returned to her father she said getting up and embracing his arm as he stood it is all over  what is over asked the quaker  he has been here  well marion and what has he said  what he said it is hardly for me to tell you what i saidi would you could know it all without my repeating a word of it  has he gone away contented  nay not that father i hardly expected that i hardly hoped for that had he been quite contented perhaps i might not have been so  why should you not have both been made happy asked the father  it may be that we shall be so it may be that he shall understand  thou hast not taken his offer then  oh no no father no i can never accept his offer if that be in your mind put it forth you shall never see your marion the wife of any man whether of that young lord or of another more fitted to her no one ever shall be allowed to speak to me as he has spoken  why dost thou make thyself different from other girls he said angrily  oh father father  it is romance and false sentiment than which nothing is more odious to me there is no reason why thou shouldst be different from others the lord has not marked thee out as different from other girls either in his pleasure or his displeasure it is wrong for thee to think it of thyself she looked up piteously into his face but said not a word it is thy duty to take thyself from his hands as he has made thee and to give way to no vain ecstatic terrors if as i gather from thy words this young man be dear to thee and if as i gather from this second coming of his thou art dear to him then i as thy father tell thee that thy duty calls thee to him it is not that he is a lord  oh no father  it is not i say that he is a lord or that he is rich or that he is comely to the eyes that i would have thee go to him as his wife it is because thou and he love each other as it is the ordinance of the lord almighty that men and women should do marriage is honourable and i thy father would fain see thee married i believe the young man to be good and true i could give thee to him lord though he be with a trusting heart and think that in so disposing of my child i had done well for her think of this marion if it be not already too late all this he had said standing so that he was able to leave the room without the ceremony of rising from his chair without giving her a moment for reply having his hand on the lock of the door as he uttered the last words of his counsel to her he marched off leaving her alone  it may be doubted whether at the moment she could have found words for reply so full was her heart with the feelings that were crowded there but she was well aware that all her fathers words could go for nothing of only one thing was she surethat no counsel no eloquence no love would ever induce her to become the wife of lord hampstead     chapter vii  mrs demijohns party      mrs demijohn presents her compliments to mr crocker and    begs the honour of his company to tea at nine oclock on    wednesday 31st of december to see the new year in     rivp do come c d     10 paradise row holloway    29th december 18   this note was delivered to crocker on his arrival at his office on the morning of saturday the 27th  it must be explained that crocker had lately made the acquaintance of miss clara demijohn without any very formal introduction crocker with that determination which marked his character in pursuit of the one present purport of his mind to effect a friendly reconciliation with george roden had taken himself down to holloway and had called at no 11 thinking that he might induce his friends mother to act on his behalf in a matter appertaining to peace and charity mrs roden had unhappily been from home but he had had the good fortune to encounter miss demijohn perhaps it was that she had seen him going in and out of the house and had associated him with the great mystery of the young nobleman perhaps she had been simply attracted by the easy air with which he cocked his hat and swung his glovesor perhaps it was simply chance but so it was that in the gloom of the evening she met him just round the corner opposite to the duchess of edinburgh and the happy acquaintance was commenced no doubt as in all such cases it was the gentleman who spoke first let us at any rate hope so for the sake of paradise row generally be that as it may before many minutes were over she had explained to him that mrs roden had gone out in a cab soon after dinner and that probably something was up at wimbledon as mrs roden never went anywhere else and this was not the day of the week on which her visits to mrs vincent were generally made crocker who was simplicity itself soon gave her various details as to his own character and position in life he too was a clerk in the post office and was george rodens particular friend oh yes he knew all about lord hampstead and was he might say intimately acquainted with his lordship he had been in the habit of meeting his lordship at castle hautboy the seat of his friend lord persiflage and had often ridden with his lordship in the huntingfield he knew all about lady frances and the engagement and had had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of her ladyship he had been corresponding lately with lord hampstead on the subject nohe had not as yet heard anything of marion fay the quakers daughter then clara had something to say on her side she quite understood that if she expected to be communicated with she also must communicate and moreover young mr crocker was by his age appearance and sex just such a one as prompted her to be communicative without loss of selfrespect what was the good of telling things to mrs duffer who was only an old widow without any friends and with very small means of existence she had communicated her secrets to mrs duffer simply from want of a better pair of ears into which she could pour them but here was one in telling secrets to whom she could take delight and who had secrets of his own to give in return it is not to be supposed that the friendship which arose grew from the incidents of one meeting only on that first evening crocker could not leave the fair one without making arrangements for a further interview and so the matter grew the intimacy between them was already of three days standing when the letter of invitation above given reached crockers hands to tell the very truth the proposed party was made up chiefly for crockers sake what is the good of having a young man if you cannot show him to your friends  crocker said mrs demijohn to her niece where did you pick up crocker  what questions you do ask aunt pick him up indeed  so you have picked him up as youre always a doing with young men only you never know how to keep em when youve got em  i declare aunt your vulgarity is unbearable  im not going to have any crocker in my house said the old woman unless i know where he comes from perhaps hes a counterskipper he may be a ticketofleave man for all you know  aunt jemima youre so provoking that i sometimes think i shall have to leave you  where will you go to my dear  to this question which had often been asked before clara thought it unnecessary to make any answer but returned at once to the inquiries which were not unnaturally made by the lady who stood to her in the place of a mother mr crocker aunt jemima is a clerk in the post office who sits at the same desk with george roden and is intimately acquainted both with lord hampstead and with lady frances trafford he used to be george rodens bosom friend but there has lately been some little tiff between the young men which would be so pleasant if we could make it up you have got to a speaking acquaintance with mrs roden and perhaps if you will ask them theyll come i am sure marion fay will come because you always get your money from pogson and littlebird i wish i had the cheek to ask lord hampstead having heard all this the old lady consented to receive our sporting friend from the post office and also assented to the other invitations which were given  crocker of course sent his compliments and expressed the great pleasure he would have in seeing the new year in in company with mrs demijohn as the old lady was much afflicted with rheumatism the proposition as coming from her would have been indiscreet had she not known that her niece on such occasions was well able to act as her deputy mrs roden also promised to come and with difficulty persuaded her son that it would be gracious on his part to be so far civil to his neighbours had he known that crocker also would be there he certainly would not have yielded but crocker when at the office kept the secret of his engagement to himself the quaker also and marion fay were to be there mr fay and mrs demijohn had long known each other in regard to matters of business and he for the sake of messrs pogson and littlebirds firm could not refuse to drink a cup of tea at their clients house a junior clerk from the same countinghouse one daniel tribbledale by name with whom clara had made acquaintance at kings court some two years since was also to be of the party mr tribbledale had at one time among all claras young men been the favourite but circumstances had occurred which had somewhat lessened her goodwill towards him mr littlebird had quarrelled with him and he had been refused promotion it was generally supposed at the present time in the neighbourhood of old broad street that daniel tribbledale was languishing for the love of clara demijohn mrs duffer of course was to be there and so the list of friends for the festive occasion was completed  mrs duffer was the first to come her aid indeed was required for the cutting up of the cakes and arrangements of the cups and saucers the quaker and his daughter were next appearing exactly at nine oclockto do which he protested to be the best sign of good manners that could be shown if they want me at ten why do they ask me at nine demanded the quaker marion was forced to give way though she was by no means anxious to spend a long evening in company with mrs demijohn as to that seeing of the new year in it was quite out of the question for the quaker or for his daughter the company altogether came early the only touch of fashion evinced on this occasion was shown by mr crocker the rodens with mr tribbledale at their heels appeared not long after mr fay and then the demolition of the sally lunns was commenced i declare i think he means to deceive us whispered clara to her friend mrs duffer when all the good tea had been consumed before the young man appeared i dont suppose he cares much for tea said mrs duffer they dont nowadays it isnt just for the tea that a man is expected to come said clara indignantly it was now nearly ten and she could not but feel that the evening was going heavily tribbledale had said one tender word to her but she had snubbed him expecting crocker to be there almost at once and he had retired silent into a corner george roden had altogether declined to make himself agreeableto her but as he was an engaged man and engaged to a lady of rank much could not be expected of him mrs roden and the quaker and mrs demijohn did manage to keep up something of conversation roden from time to time said a few words to marion clara who was repenting herself of her hardness to young tribbledale was forced to put up with mrs duffer when suddenly there came a thundering knock at the door and mr crocker was announced by the maid who had been duly instructed beforehand as to all peculiarities in the names of the guests  there was a little stir as there always is when a solitary guest comes in much after the appointed time of course there was rebukesuppressed rebuke from mrs demijohn mild rebuke from mrs duffer a very outburst of rebuke from clara but crocker was up to the occasion upon my word ladies i had no help for it i was dining with a few friends in the city and i couldnt get away earlier if my own ideas of happiness had been consulted i should have been here an hour ago ah roden how are you though i know you live in the same street i didnt think of meeting you roden gave him a nod but did not vouchsafe him a word hows his lordship i told you didnt i that i had heard from him the other day crocker had mentioned more than once at his office the fact that he had received a letter from lord hampstead  i dont often see him and very rarely hear from him said roden without turning away from marion to whom he was at the moment speaking  if all our young noblemen were like hampstead said crocker who had told the truth in declaring that he had been dining england would be a very different sort of place from what it is the most affable young lord that ever sat in the house of peers then he turned himself towards marion fay at whose identity he made a guess he was anxious at once to claim her as a mutual friend as connected with himself by her connection with the lord in question but as he could find no immediate excuse for introducing himself he only winked at her  are you acquainted with mr tribbledale mr crocker asked clara  never had the pleasure as yet said crocker then the introduction was effected in the civil service asked crocker tribbledale blushed and of necessity repudiated the honour i thought perhaps you were in the customs you have something of the hms cut about you tribbledale acknowledged the compliment with a bow i think the service is the best thing a man can do with himself continued crocker  it is genteel said mrs duffer  and the hours so pleasant said clara bank clerks have always to be there by nine  is a young man to be afraid of that asked the quaker indignantly ten till four with one hour for the newspapers and another for lunch see the consequence i never knew a young man yet from a public office who understood the meaning of a days work  i think that is a little hard said roden if a man really works six hours continuously is as much as he can do with any good to his employers or himself  well done roden said crocker stick up for her majestys shop roden turned himself more round than before and continued to address himself to marion  our employers wouldnt think much of us said the quaker if we didnt do better for them than that in private offices i say that the civil service destroys a young man and teaches him to think that the bread of idleness is sweet as far as i can see nothing is so destructive of individual energy as what is called public money if daniel tribbledale would bestir himself he might do very well in the world without envying any young man his seat either at the custom house or the post office mr fay had spoken so seriously that they all declined to carry that subject further mrs demijohn and mrs duffer murmured their agreement thinking it civil to do so as the quaker was a guest tribbledale sat silent in his corner awestruck at the idea of having given rise to the conversation crocker winked at mrs demijohn and thrust his hands into his pockets as much as to say that he could get the better of the quaker altogether if he chose to exercise his powers of wit and argument  soon after this mr fay rose to take his daughter away but said clara with affected indignation you are to see the old year out and the new year in  i have seen enough of the one said mr fay and shall see enough of the other if i live to be as near its close as i am to its birth  but there are refreshments coming up said mrs demijohn  i have refreshed myself sufficiently with thy tea madam i rarely take anything stronger before retiring to my rest come marion thou requirest to be at no form of welcoming the new year thou too wilt be better in thy bed as thy duties call upon thee to be early so saying the quaker bowed formally to each person present and took his daughter out with him under his arm mrs roden and her son escaped almost at the same moment and mrs demijohn having waited to take what she called just a thimbleful of hot toddy went also to her rest  heres a pretty way of seeing the new year in said clara laughing  we are quite enough of us for the purpose said crocker unless we also are expected to go away but as he spoke he mixed a tumbler of brandy and water which he divided among two smaller glasses handing them to the two ladies present  i declare said mrs duffer i never do anything of the kindalmost never  on such an occasion as this everybody does it said crocker  i hope mr tribbledale will join us said clara then the bashful clerk came out of his corner and seating himself at the table prepared to do as he was bid he made his toddy very weak not because he disliked brandy but guided by an innate spirit of modesty which prevented him always from going more than halfway when he was in company  then the evening became very pleasant you are quite sure that he is really engaged to her ladyship asked clara  i wish i were as certainly engaged to you replied the polite crocker  what nonsense you do talk mr crockerand before other people too but you think he is  i am sure of it both hampstead and she have told me so much themselves out of their own mouths  my exclaimed mrs duffer  and heres her brother engaged to marion fay said clara crocker declared that as to this he was by no means so well assured lord hampstead in spite of their intimacy had told him nothing about it but it is so mr crocker as sure as ever you are sitting there he has been coming here after her over and over again and was closeted with her only last friday for hours it was a holiday but that sly old quaker went out of the way so as to leave them together that mrs roden though shes as stiff as buckram knows all about it to the best of my belief she got it all up marion fay is with her every day its my belief theres something we dont understand yet shes got a hold of them young people and means to do just what she likes with em crocker however could not agree to this he had heard of lord hampsteads peculiar politics and was assured that the young lord was only carrying out his peculiar principles in selecting marion fay for himself and devoting his sister to george roden  not that i like that kind of thing if you ask me said crocker im very fond of hampstead and ive always found lady frances to be a pleasant and affable lady ive no cause to speak other than civil of both of them but when a man has been born a lord and a lady a lady a lady of that kind miss demijohn  oh exactlytitled you mean mr crocker  quite high among the nobs you know hampstead will be a marquis some of these days which is next to a duke  and do you know himyourself asked tribbledale with a voice of awe  oh yes said crocker  to speak to him when you see him  i had a long correspondence with him about a week ago about a matter which interested both of us very much  and how does he address you asked claraalso with something of awe  dear crockerjust that i always say my dear lord hampstead in return i look upon dear hampstead as a little vulgar you know and i always think that one ought to be particular in these matters but as i was saying when it comes to marriage people ought to be true to themselves now if i was a marquisi dont know what i mightnt do if i saw you you know clara clara pouted but did not appear to have been offended either by the compliment or by the familiarity but under any other circumstances less forcible i would stick to my order  so would i said mrs duffer marquises ought to marry marquises and dukes dukes  there it is said clara and now we must drink its health and i hope we may be all married to them we like best before it comes round again this had reference to the little clock on the mantelpiece the hands of which had just crept round to twelve oclock  i wish we might said crocker and have a baby in the cradle too  go away said clara  that would be quick said mrs duffer what do you say mr tribbledale  where my hearts fixed said tribbledale who was just becoming warm with the brandyandwater there aint no hope for this year nor yet for the one after whereupon crocker remarked that care killed a cat  you just put on your coat and hat and take me across to my lodgings see if i dont give you a chance said mrs duffer who was also becoming somewhat merry under the influences of the moment but she knew that it was her duty to do something for her young hostess and true woman as she was thought that this was the best way of doing it tribbledale did as he was bid though he was obliged thus to leave his ladylove and her new admirer together do you really mean it said clara when she and crocker were alone  of course i dohonest said crocker  then you may said clara turning her face to him     chapter viii  new years day   crocker had by no means as yet got through his evening having dined with his friends in the city and drank tea with the lady of his love he was disposed to proceed if not to pleasanter delights at any rate to those which might be more hilarious every londoner from holloway up to gower street in which he lived would be seeing the new year inand beyond gower street down in holborn and from thence all across to the strand especially in the neighbourhood of covent garden and the theatres there would be a whole world of happy revellers engaged in the same way on such a night as this there could certainly be no need of going to bed soon after twelve for such a one as samuel crocker in paradise row he again encountered tribbledale and suggested to that young man that they should first have a glass of something at the duchess and then proceed to more exalted realms in a hansom i did think of walking there this fine starlight night said tribbledale mindful of the small stipend at which his services were at present valued by pogson and littlebird but crocker soon got the better of all this ill stand sammy for this occasion said he the new year comes in only once in twelve months then tribbledale went into the duchess and after that was as indifferent while his money lasted him as was crocker himself ive loved that girl for three years said tribbledale as soon as they had left the duchess and were again in the open air  it was a beautiful night and crocker thought that they might as well walk a little way it was pleasant under the bright stars to hear of the love adventures of his new friend especially as he himself was now the happy hero for three years he asked  indeed i have crocker that glass of hot whiskeyandwater though it enhanced the melancholy tenderness of the young man robbed him of his bashfulness and loosened the strings of his tongue for three years and there was a time when she worshipped the very stool on which i sat at the office i dont like to boast  you have to be short sharp and decisive if you mean to get a girl like that to travel with you  i should have taken the ball at the hop crocker thats what i ought to have done but i see it all now shes as fickle as she is fairfickler perhaps if anything  come tribbledale i aint going to let you abuse her you know  i dont want to abuse her god knows i love her too well in spite of all its your turn now i can see that theres a great many of them have had their turns  were there now asked crocker anxiously  there was pollockyhim at the highbury gas works he came after me it was because of him she dropped me  was that going on for a marriage  right ahead i used to think pollocky is a widower with five children  oh lord  but hes the head of all the gas and has four hundred a year it wasnt love as carried her on with him i could see that she wouldnt go and meet him anywhere about the city as she did me i suppose pollocky is fifty if hes a day  and she dropped him also  or else it was he on receipt of this information crocker whistled it was something about money continued tribbledale the old woman wouldnt part  there is money i suppose  the old woman has a lot  and isnt the niece to have it asked crocker  no doubt she will because there never was a pair more loving but the old lady will keep it herself as long as she is here then there entered an idea into crockers head that if he could manage to make clara his own he might have power enough to manage the aunt as well as the niece they had a little more whiskeyandwater at the angel at islington before they got into the cab which was to take them down to the paphian musichall and after that tribbledale passed from the realm of partial fact to that of perfect poetry he would never he said abandon clara demijohn though he should live to an age beyond that of any known patriarch he quite knew all that there was against him crocker he thought might probably prevail he rather hoped that crocker might prevailfor why should not so good a fellow be made happy seeing how utterly impossible it was that he daniel tribbledale should ever reach that perfect bliss in dreaming of which he passed his miserable existence but as to one thing he had quite made up his mind the day that saw clara demijohn a bride would most undoubtedly be the last of his existence  oh no damme you wont said crocker turning round upon him in the cab  i shall said tribbledale with emphasis and ive made up my mind how to do it too theyve caged up the monument and youre so looked after on the duke of yorks that there isnt a chance but theres nothing to prevent you from taking a header at the whispering gallery of saint pauls youd be more talked of that way and the vergers would be sure to show the stains made on the stones below it was here young tribbledale fella clerk at pogson and littlebirds who dashed out his brains for love on the very day as clara demijohn got herself married im of that disposition crocker as id do anything for loveanything crocker was obliged to reply that he trusted he might never be the cause of such a fatal attempt at glory but he went on to explain that in the pursuit of love a man could not in any degree give way to friendship even though numberless lovers might fall from the whispering gallery in a confused heap of mangled bodies he must still tread the path which was open to him these were his principles and he could not abandon them even for the sake of tribbledale nor would i have you shouted tribbledale leaning out over the door of the cab i would not delay you not for a day not for an hour were tomorrow to be your bridal morning it would find me prepared my only request to you is that a boy might be called daniel after me you might tell her it was an uncle or grandfather she would never think that in her own child was perpetuated a monument of poor daniel tribbledale crocker as he jumped out of the cab with a light step in front of the paphian hall promised that in this particular he would attend to the wishes of his friend  the performances at the paphian hall on that festive occasion need not be described here with accuracy the new year had been seen well in with music dancing and wine the seeing of it in was continued yet for an hour till an indulgent policeman was forced to interfere it is believed that on the final ejection of our two friends the forlorn lover kept steady no doubt by the weight of his woe did find his way home to his own lodgings the exultant crocker was less fortunate and passed his night without the accommodation of sheets and blankets somewhere in the neighbourhood of bow street the fact is important to us as it threatened to have considerable effect upon our friends position at his office having been locked up in a cell during the night and kept in durance till he was brought on the following morning before a magistrate he could not well be in his room at ten oclock indeed when he did escape from the hands of the philistines at about two in the day sick unwashed and unfed he thought it better to remain away altogether for that day the great sin of total absence would be better than making an appearance before mr jerningham in his present telltale condition he well knew his own strength and his own weakness all power of repartee would be gone from him for the day mr jerningham would domineer over him and Æolus should the violent god be pleased to send for him would at once annihilate him so he sneaked home to gower street took a hair of the dog that bit him and then got the old woman who looked after him to make him some tea and to fry a bit of bacon for him in this ignominious way he passed new years dayat least so much of it as was left to him after the occurrences which have been described  but on the next morning the great weight of his troubles fell upon him heavily in his very heart of hearts he was afraid of Æolus in spite of his brummagem courage the wrath of the violent god was tremendous to him he knew what it was to stand with his hand on the lock of the door and tremble before he dared to enter the room there was something in the frown of the god which was terrible to him there was something worse in the gods smile he remembered how he had once been unable to move himself out of the room when the god had told him that he need not remain at the office but might go home and amuse himself just as he pleased nothing crushes a young man so much as an assurance that his presence can be dispensed with without loss to any one though crocker had often felt the mercies of Æolus and had told himself again and again that the god never did in truth lift up his hand for final irrevocable punishment still he trembled as he anticipated the dread encounter  when the morning came and while he was yet in his bed he struggled to bethink himself of some strategy by which he might evade the evil hour could he have been sent for suddenly into cumberland but in this case he would of course have telegraphed to the post office on the preceding day could he have been taken ill with a fitso as to make his absence absolutely necessary say for an entire week he well knew that they had a doctor at the post office a crafty farseeing obdurate man who would be with him at once and would show him no mercy he had tried these schemes all round and had found that there were none left with which Æolus was not better acquainted than was he himself there was nothing for it but to go and bear the brunt  exactly at ten oclock he entered the room hung his hat up on the accustomed peg and took his seat on the accustomed chair before any one spoke a word to him roden on the opposite seat took no notice of him bedad hes here anyhow this morning whispered geraghty to bobbin very audibly mr crocker said mr jerningham you were absent throughout the entire day yesterday have you any account to give of yourself there was certainly falsehood implied in this question as mr jerningham knew very well what had become of crocker crockers misadventure at the police office had found its way into the newspapers and had been discussed by Æolus with mr jerningham i am afraid that mr jerningham must have intended to tempt the culprit into some false excuse  i was horribly ill said crocker without stopping the pen with which he was making entries in the big book before him this no doubt was true and so far the trap had been avoided  what made you ill mr crocker  headache  it seems to me mr crocker youre more subject to such attacks as these than any young man in the office  i always was as a baby said crocker resuming something of his courage could it be possible that Æolus should not have heard of the days absence  there is illhealth of so aggravated a nature said mr jerningham as to make the sufferer altogether unfit for the civil service  im happy to say im growing out of them gradually said crocker then geraghty got up from his chair and whispered the whole truth into the sufferers ears it was all in the pall mall yesterday and Æolus knew it before he went away a sick qualm came upon the poor fellow as though it were a repetition of yesterdays sufferings but still it was necessary that he should say something new years day comes only once a year i suppose  it was only a few weeks since that you remained a day behind your time when you were on leave but sir boreas has taken the matter up and i have nothing to say to it no doubt sir boreas will send for you sir boreas bodkin was that great civil servant in the general post office whom men were wont to call Æolus  it was a wretched morning for poor crocker he was not sent for till one oclock just at the moment when he was going to eat his lunch that horrid sickness the combined result of the dinner in the city of mrs demijohns brandy and of the many whiskies which followed still clung to him the muttonchop and porter which he had promised himself would have relieved him but now he was obliged to appear before the god in all his weakness without a word he followed a messenger who had summoned him with his tail only too visibly between his legs Æolus was writing a note when he was ushered into the room and did not condescend to arrest himself in the progress merely because crocker was present Æolus well knew the effect on a sinner of having to stand silent and all alone in the presence of an offended deity  so mr crocker said Æolus at last looking up from his completed work no doubt you saw the old year out on wednesday night the jokes of the god were infinitely worse to bear than his most furious blasts like some other great men continued Æolus you have contrived to have your festivities chronicled in the newspapers crocker found it impossible to utter a word you have probably seen the pall mall of yesterday and the standard of this morning  i havent looked at the newspaper sir since  since the festive occasion suggested Æolus  oh sir boreas  well mr crocker what is it that you have to say for yourself  i did dine with a few friends  and kept it up tolerably late i should think  and then afterwards went to a teaparty said crocker  a teaparty  it was not all tea said crocker with a whine  i should think not there was a good deal besides tea i should say then the god left off to smile and the blasts began to blow now mr crocker i should like to know what you think of yourself after having read the accounts of your appearance before the magistrate in two newspapers i suppose i may take it for granted that you were abominably drunk out in the streets on wednesday night it is very hard for a young man to have to admit under any circumstances that he has been abominably drunk out in the streetsso that crocker stood dumb before his accuser i choose to have an answer sir i must either have your own acknowledgment or must have an official account from the police magistrate  i had taken something sir  were you drunk if you will not answer me you had better go and i shall know how to deal with you crocker thought that he had perhaps better go and leave the god to deal with him he remained quite silent your personal habits would be nothing to me sir continued Æolus if you were able to do your work and did not bring disgrace on the department but you neglect the office you are unable to do your work and you do bring disgrace on the department how long is it since you remained away a day before  i was detained down in cumberland for one day after my leave of absence  detained in cumberland i never tell a gentleman mr crocker that i do not believe himnever if it comes to that with a gentleman he must go this was hard to bear but yet crocker was aware that he had told a fib on that occasion in reference to the days hunting then sir boreas took up his pen and again had recourse to his paper as though the interview was over crocker remained standing not quite knowing what he was expected to do its of no use your remaining there said sir boreas whereupon crocker retired and with his tail still between his legs returned to his own desk soon afterwards mr jerningham was sent for and came back with an intimation that mr crockers services were no longer required at any rate for that day when the matter had been properly represented to the postmastergeneral a letter would be written to him the impression made on the minds of bobbin and geraghty was that poor crocker would certainly be dismissed on this occasion roden too thought that it was now over with the unfortunate young man as far as the queens service was concerned and could not abstain from shaking hands with the unhappy wretch as he bade them all a melancholy goodbye good afternoon said mr jerningham to him severely not condescending to shake hands with him at all  but mr jerningham heard the last words which the god had spoken on the subject and was not therefore called upon to be specially softhearted i never saw a poor devil look so sick in my life Æolus had said  he must have been very bad sir boreas  Æolus was fond of a good dinner himself and had a sympathy for convivial offences indeed for all offences he had a sympathy no man less prone to punish ever lived but what is a man to do with inveterate offenders Æolus would tear his hair sometimes in dismay because he knew that he was retaining in the service men whom he would have been bound to get rid of had he done his duty you had better tell him to go home said Æolusfor today you know  and what then sir boreas  i suppose hell sleep it off by tomorrow have a letter written to himto frighten him you know after all new years day only does come once a year mr jerningham having thus received instructions went back to his room and dismissed crocker in the way we have seen as soon as crockers back was turned roden was desired to write the letter      sir     your conduct in absenting yourself without leave from    the office yesterday is of such a nature as to make    it necessary for me to inform you that should it be    repeated i shall have no alternative but to bring your    name under the serious consideration of my lord the    postmastergeneral     i am sir    your obedient servant     signed boreas bodkin   in the same envelope was a short note from one of his brother clerks      dear crocker     you had better be here sharp at ten tomorrow mr    jerningham bids me tell you     yours truly     bart bobbin   thus crocker got through his troubles on this occasion     chapter ix  miss demijohns ingenuity   on the day on which crocker was going through his purgatory at the post office a letter reached lady kingsbury at trafford park which added much to the troubles and annoyances felt by different members of the family there it was an anonymous letter and the readerwho in regard to such mysteries should never be kept a moment in ignorancemay as well be told at once that the letter was written by that enterprising young lady miss demijohn the letter was written on new years day after the partyperhaps in consequence of the party as the rash doings of some of the younger members of the trafford family were made specially obvious to miss demijohn by what was said on that occasion the letter ran as follows      my lady marchioness     i conceive it to be my duty as a wellwisher of the family    to inform you that your stepson lord hampstead has    become entangled in what i think to be a dangerous way    with a young woman living in a neighbouring street to    this   the neighbouring street was of course a stroke of cunning on the part of miss demijohn      she lives at no 17 paradise row holloway and her name    is marion fay she is daughter to an old quaker who is    clerk to pogson and littlebird kings court great broad    street and isnt of course in any position to entertain    such hopes as these he may have a little money saved but    whats that to the likes of your ladyship and his lordship    the marquis some think she is pretty i dont now i    dont like such cunning ways of what i tell your ladyship    there isnt any manner of doubt his lordship was there    for hours the other day and the girl is going about as    proud as a peacock     its what i call a regular paradise row conspiracy and    though the quaker has lent himself to it he aint at    the bottom next door but two to the fays there is a mrs    roden living who has got a son a stuckup fellow and a    clerk in the post office i believe there isnt a bit of    doubt but he has been and got himself engaged to another    of your ladyships noble family as to that all holloway    is talking of it i dont believe there is a bus driver    up and down the road as doesnt know it its my belief    that mrs roden is the doing of it all she has taken    marion fay by the hand just as though she were her own    and now she has got the young lord and the young lady    right into her mashes if none of em isnt married yet it    wont be long so unless somebody interferes if you dont    believe me do you send to the duchess of edinburgh at    the corner and youll find that they know all about it     now my lady marchioness ive thought it my duty to    tell you all this because i dont like to see a noble    family put upon there isnt nothing for me to get out    of it myself but i do it just as one of the familys    wellwishers therefore i sign myself your very    respectful     a wellwisher   the young lady had told her story completely as far as her object was concerned which was simply that of making mischief but the business of anonymous letterwriting was one not new to her hand it is easy and offers considerable excitement to the minds of those whose time hangs heavy on their hands  the marchioness though she would probably have declared beforehand that anonymous letters were of all things the most contemptible nevertheless read this more than once with a great deal of care and she believed it altogether as to lady frances of course she knew the allegations to be true seeing that the writer was so well acquainted with the facts as to lady frances why should she be less wellinformed in reference to lord hampstead such a marriage as this with the quaker girl was exactly the sort of match which hampstead would be pleased to make then she was especially annoyed by the publicity of the whole affair that holloway and the drivers of the omnibuses and the duchess of edinburgh should know all the secrets of her husbands familyshould be able to discuss the disgrace to which her own darlings would be subjected was terrible to her but perhaps the sting that went sharpest to her heart was that which came from the fact that lord hampstead was about to be married at all let the wife be a quaker or what not let her be as low as any woman that could be found within the sound of bow bells still if the marriage ceremony were once pronounced over them that womans son would become lord highgate and would be heir to all the wealth and all the titles of the marquis of kingsburyto the absolute exclusion of the eldestborn of her own darlings  she had had her hopes in the impracticability of lord hampstead such men as that she had told herself were likely to keep themselves altogether free of marriage he would not improbably she thought entertain some abominable but not unlucky idea that marriage in itself was an absurdity at any rate there was hope as long as he could be kept unmarried were he to marry and then have a son even though he broke his neck out hunting next day no good would come of it in this condition of mind she thought it well to show the letter to mr greenwood before she read it to her husband lord kingsbury was still very illso ill as to have given rise to much apprehension but still it would be necessary to discuss this letter with him ill as he might be only it should be first discussed with mr greenwood  mr greenwoods face became flatter and his jaw longer and his eyes more like gooseberries as he read the letter he had gradually trained himself to say and to hear all manner of evil things about lady frances in the presence of the marchioness he had too accustomed himself to speak of lord hampstead as a great obstacle which it would be well if the lord would think proper to take out of the way he had also so far followed the lead of his patroness as to be deep if not loud in his denunciations of the folly of the marquis the marquis had sent him word that he had better look out for a new home and without naming an especial day for his dismissal had given him to understand that it would not be convenient to receive him again in the house in park lane but the marquis had been ill when he had thus expressed his displeasureand was now worse it might be that the marquis himself would never again visit park lane as no positive limit had been fixed for mr greenwoods departure from trafford park there he remainedand there he intended to remain for the present as he folded up the letter carefully after reading it slowly he only shook his head  is it true i wonder asked the marchioness  there is no reason why it should not be  thats just what i say to myself we know it is true about fanny of course theres that mr roden and the mrs roden when the writer knows so much there is reason to believe the rest  a great many people do tell a great many lies said mr greenwood  i suppose there is such a person as this quakerand that there is such a girl  quite likely  if so why shouldnt hampstead fall in love with her of course hes always going to the street because of his friend roden  not a doubt lady kingsbury  what ought we to do to this question mr greenwood was not prepared with an immediate answer if lord hampstead chose to get himself married to a quakers daughter how could it be helped his father would hardly have any influence over him now mr greenwood shook his head and yet he must be told mr greenwood nodded his head perhaps something might be done about the property  he wouldnt care two straws about settlements said mr greenwood  he doesnt care about anything he ought to if i were to write and ask him would he tell the truth about this marriage  he wouldnt tell the truth about anything said mr greenwood  the marchioness passed this by though she knew it at the moment to be calumny but she was not unwilling to hear calumny against lord hampstead there used to be ways she said in which a marriage of that kind could be put on one side afterwards  you must put it on one side before nowadays if you mean to do it at all said the clergyman  but howhow  if he could be got out of the way  how out of the way  wellthats what i dont know suppose he could be made to go out yachting and she be married to somebody else when hes at sea lady kingsbury felt that her friend was but little good at a stratagem but she felt also that she was not very good herself she could wish but wishing in such matters is very vain she had right on her side she was quite confident as to that there could be no doubt but that gods and men would desire to see her little lord frederic succeed to the marquisate rather than this infidel republican if this wretched radical could be kept from marrying there would evidently be room for hope because there was the factproved by the incontestable evidence of burkes peeragethat younger sons did so often succeed but if another heir were to be born then as far as she was aware burkes peerage promised her nothing its a pity he shouldnt break his neck out hunting said mr greenwood  even that wouldnt be much if he were to be married first said the marchioness  every day she went to her husband for halfanhour before her lunch at which time the nurse who attended him during the day was accustomed to go to her dinner he had had a physician down from london since his son had visited him and the physician had told the marchioness that though there was not apparently any immediate danger still the symptoms were such as almost to preclude a hope of ultimate recovery when this opinion had been pronounced there had arisen between the marchioness and the chaplain a discussion as to whether lord hampstead should be once again summoned the marquis himself had expressed no such wish a bulletin of a certain fashion had been sent three or four times a week to hendon hall purporting to express the doctors opinion of the health of their noble patient but the bulletin had not been scrupulously true neither of the two conspirators had wished to have lord hampstead at trafford park lady kingsbury was anxious to make the separation complete between her own darlings and their brother and mr greenwood remembered down to every tittle of a word and tone the insolence of the rebuke which he had received from the heir but if lord kingsbury were really to be dying then they would hardly dare to keep his son in ignorance  ive got something id better show you she said as she seated herself by her husbands sofa then she proceeded to read to him the letter without telling him as she did so that it was anonymous when he had heard the first paragraph he demanded to know the name of the writer id better read it all first said the marchioness and she did read it all to the end closing it however without mentioning the final wellwisher of course its anonymous she said as she held the letter in her hand  then i dont believe a word of it said the marquis  very likely not but yet it sounds true  i dont think it sounds true at all why should it be true there is nothing so wicked as anonymous letters  if it isnt true about hampstead its true at any rate of fanny that man comes from holloway and paradise row and the duchess of edinburgh where fanny goes for her lover hampstead is likely to follow birds of a feather flock together  i wont have you speak of my children in that way said the sick lord  what can i do is it not true about fanny if you wish it i will write to hampstead and ask him all about it in order to escape from the misery of the moment he assented to this proposition the letter being anonymous had to his thinking been disgraceful and therefore he had disbelieved it and having induced himself to disbelieve the statements made he had been drawn into expressingor at any rate to acknowledging by his silencea conviction that such a marriage as that proposed with marion fay would be very base her ladyship felt therefore that if lord hampstead could be got to acknowledge the engagement something would have been done towards establishing a quarrel between the father and the son  has that man gone yet he asked as his wife rose to leave the room  has what man gone  mr greenwood  gone how should he have gone it has never been expected that he should go by this time i dont see why he should go at all he was told that you would not again require his services up in london as far as i know that is all that has been said about going the poor man turned himself on his sofa angrily but did not at the moment give any further instructions as to the chaplains departure  he wants to know why you have not gone lady kingsbury said to the clergyman that afternoon  where am i to go to whined the unfortunate one does he mean to say that i am to be turned out into the road at a moments notice because i cant approve of what lady frances is doing i havent had any orders as to going if i am to go i suppose he will make some arrangement first lady kingsbury said what she could to comfort him and explained that there was no necessity for his immediate departure perhaps the marquis might not think of it again for another week or two and there was no knowing in what condition they might find themselves  her ladyships letter to her stepson was as follows and by return of post her stepsons answer came      my dear hampstead     tidings have reached your father that you have engaged    yourself to marry a girl the daughter of a quaker named    fay living at no 17 paradise row he the quaker is    represented as being a clerk in a countinghouse in the    city of the girl your father has heard nothing but can    only imagine that she should be such as her position would    make probable he desires me to ask you whether there    is any truth in the statement you will observe that i    express no opinion myself whether it be true or false    whether proper or improper after your conduct the other    day i should not think of interfering myself but your    father wishes me to ask for his information     yours truly     clara kingsbury   hampsteads answer was very short but quite sufficient for the purpose      my dear lady kingsbury     i am not engaged to marry miss fayas yet i think that    i may be some day soon     yours affectionately     hampstead   by the same post he wrote a letter to his father and that shall also be shown to the reader      my dear father     i have received a letter from lady kingsbury asking me as    to a report of an engagement between me and a young lady    named marion fay i am sorry that her writing should be    evidence that you are hardly yet strong enough to write    yourself i trust that it may not long be so     would you wish to see me again at trafford i do not like    to go there without the expression of a wish from you    but i hold myself in readiness to start whenever you may    desire it i had hoped from the last accounts that you    were becoming stronger     i do not know how you may have heard anything of marion    fay had i engaged myself to her or to any other young    lady i should have told you at once i do not know    whether a young man is supposed to declare his own    failures in such matters when he has failedeven to his    father but as i am ashamed of nothing in the matter i    will avow that i have asked the young lady to be my wife    but she has as yet declined i shall ask her again and    still hope to succeed     she is the daughter of a mr fay who as lady kingsbury    says is a quaker and is a clerk in a house in the city    as he is in all respects a good man standing high for    probity and honour among those who know him i cannot    think that there is any drawback she i think has all    the qualities which i would wish to find in the woman    whom i might hope to make my wife they live at no 17    paradise row holloway lady kingsbury indeed is right    in all her details     pray let me have a line if not from yourself at any rate    dictated by you to say how you are     your affectionate son     hampstead   it was impossible to keep the letter from lady kingsbury it thus became a recognized fact by the marquis by the marchioness and by mr greenwood that hampstead was going to marry the quakers daughter as to that pretence of a refusal it went for nothing even with the father was it probable that a quakers daughter the daughter of a merchants clerk out of the city should refuse to become a marchioness the sick man was obliged to express anger having been already made to treat the report as incredible because of the disgrace which would accompany it if true had he been left to himself he would have endeavoured to think as little about it as possible not to quarrel with his two eldest children was the wish that was now strongest at his heart but his wife recalled the matter to him at each of the two daily visits which she made what can i do he was driven to ask on the third morning  mr greenwood suggests began his wife not intending to irritate him having really forgotten at the moment that no suggestion coming from mr greenwood could be welcome to him  d mr greenwood he shouted lifting himself up erect from the pillows on his sofa the marchioness was in truth so startled by the violence of his movement and by the rage expressed on his haggard face that she jumped from her chair with unexpected surprise i desire said the marquis that that man shall leave the house by the end of this month     chapter x  kings court old broad street   hampstead received the letter from lady kingsbury and answered it on saturday the 3rd of january having at that time taken no active steps in regard to marion fay after the rejection of his suit on the day following christmas eight days had thus elapsed and he had done nothing he had done nothing though there was not an hour in the day in which he was not confirming his own resolve to do something by which he might make marion fay his own he felt that he could hardly go to the girl again immediately after the expression of her resolution at first he thought that he would write to her and did sit down to the table for that purpose but as he strove to produce words which might move her he told himself that the words which he might speak would be better then he rode half way to holloway with the object of asking aid from mrs roden but he returned without completing his purpose telling himself that any such aid even if it could be obtained would avail him nothing in such a contest if a man cannot succeed by his own doing surely he will not do so by the assistance of any one else and thus he was in doubt  after having written to lady kingsbury and his father he reflected that in his fathers state of health he ought to go again to trafford park if it were only for a day or for an hour he ought to see his father he knew that he was not wanted by his stepmother he knew also that no desire to see him had reached him from the marquis he was afraid that the marquis himself did not wish to see him it was almost impossible for him to take his sister to the house unless an especial demand for her attendance was made and he could not very well leave her alone for any lengthened period nevertheless he determined to make a rapid run into shropshire with the intention of returning the following day unless he found the state of his fathers health so bad as to make it expedient that he should remain he intended to hunt on the monday and the tuesday travelling from london to leighton and back but he would leave london by the night mail train from paddington on wednesday evening so as to reach trafford park house on the following morning between four and five it was a journey which he had often made before in the same manner and to which the servants at trafford were well accustomed even at that time in the morning he would walk to the park from the station which was four miles distant leaving his luggage if he had any to be sent for on the following morning but he would usually travel without luggage having all things necessary for his use in his own room at trafford  it had hitherto been his custom to acquaint his sister with his manoeuvres on these occasions having never been free in his correspondence with his stepmother he had written or telegraphed to lady frances and she had quite understood that his instructions whatever they might be were to be obeyed but lady frances was no longer a resident at trafford park and he therefore telegraphed to the old butler who had been a servant in the family from a period previous to his own birth this telegram he sent on the monday as followsshall be at trafford thursday morning 430 am will walk over let dick be up have room ready tell my father he fixed wednesday night for his journey having made up his mind to devote a portion of the wednesday morning to the business which he had on hand in reference to marion fay  it was not the proper thing he thought to go to a girls father for permission to ask the girl to be his wife before the girl had herself assented but the circumstances in this case were peculiar it had seemed to him that marions only reason for rejecting him was based on disparity in their social conditionwhich to his thinking was the worst reason that could be given it might be that the reason had sprung from some absurd idea originating with the quaker father or it might be that the quaker father would altogether disapprove of any such reason at any rate he would be glad to know whether the old man was for him or against him and with the object of ascertaining this he determined that he would pay a visit to the office in kings court on the wednesday morning he could not endure the thought of leaving londonit might be for much more than the one day intendedwithout making some effort in regard to the object which was nearest his heart  early in the day he walked into messrs pogson and littlebirds office and saw mr tribbledale seated on a high stool behind a huge desk which nearly filled up the whole place he was rather struck by the smallness and meanness of messrs pogson and littlebirds premises which from a certain nobility belonging to the quakers appearance he would have thought to be spacious and important it is impossible not to connect ideas after this fashion pogson and littlebird themselves carried in their own names no flavour of commercial grandeur had they been only known to hampstead by their name any small mercantile retreat at the top of the meanest alley in the city might have sufficed for them but there was something in the demeanour of zachary fay which seemed to give promise of one of those palaces of trade which are now being erected in every street and lane devoted in the city to business nothing could be less palatial than pogson and littlebirds countinghouse hampstead had entered it from a little court which it seemed to share with one other equally unimportant tenement opposite to it by a narrow low passage here he saw two doors only through one of which he passed as it was open having noticed that the word private was written on the other here he found himself face to face with tribbledale and with a little boy who sat at tribbledales right hand on a stool equally high of these two as far as he could see consisted the establishment of messrs pogson and littlebird could i see mr fay asked hampstead  business suggested tribbledale  not exactly that is to say my business is private  then there appeared a face looking at him over a screen about five feet and ahalf high which divided off from the small apartment a much smaller apartment having as hampstead now regarded it the appearance of a cage in this cage small as it was there was a desk and there were two chairs and here zachary fay carried on the business of his life and transacted most of those affairs appertaining to messrs pogson and littlebird which could be performed in an office messrs pogson and littlebird themselves though they had a room of their own to which that door marked private belonged were generally supposed to be walking on change as british merchants should do or making purchases of whole ships cargos in the docks or discounting bills the least of which would probably represent £10000 the face which looked over the barrier of the cage at lord hampstead was of course that of zachary fay lord hampstead he said with surprise  oh mr fay how do you do i have something i want to say to you could you spare me five minutes  the quaker opened the door of the cage and asked lord hampstead to walk in tribbledale who had heard and recognized the name stared hard at the young noblemanat his friend crockers noble friend at the lord of whom it had been asserted positively that he was engaged to marry mr fays daughter the boy too having heard that the visitor was a lord stared also hampstead did as he was bid but remembering that the inhabitant of the cage had at once heard what had been said in the office felt that it would be impossible for him to carry on his conversation about marion without other protection from the ears of the world it is a little private what i have to say remarked hampstead  the quaker looked towards the private room old mr pogson is there whispered tribbledale i heard him come in a quarter of an hour ago  perhaps thou wouldst not mind walking up and down the yard said the quaker hampstead of course walked out but on looking about him found that the court was very small for the communication which he had to make space would be required so that he might not be troubled by turning when he was in the midst of his eloquence halfadozen steps would carry him the whole length of kings court and who could tell his lovestory in a walk limited to six steps  perhaps we might go out into the street he suggested  certainly my lord said the quaker tribbledale should any one call before i return and be unable to wait for five minutes i shall be found outside the court not above fifty yards either to the right or to the left hampstead thus limited to a course not exceeding a hundred yards in one of the most crowded thoroughfares of the city began the execution of his difficult task  mr fay he said are you aware of what has passed between me and your daughter marion  hardly my lord  has she told you nothing of it  yea my lord she has in truth told me much she has told me no doubt all that it behoves a father to hear from a daughter in such circumstances i live on such terms with my marion that there are not many secrets kept by either of us from the other  then you do know  i know that your lordship tendered to her your handhonestly nobly and truly as i take it  with perfect honesty and perfect truth most certainly  and i know also that she declined the honour thus offered her  she did  is this you zachary how are you this morning this came from a stout short redfaced man who stopped them standing in the middle of the pavement  well i thank thee mr gruby at this moment i am particularly engaged that is jonathan gruby said the quaker to his companion as soon as the stout man had walked on one of the busiest men in the city you have heard probably of gruby and inderwald  hampstead had never heard of gruby and inderwald and wished that the stout man had been minding his business at that moment but as to miss fay he said endeavouring to continue to tell his lovestory  yes as to marion i hardly do know what passed between you two not having heard the reasons she gave thee  no reasons at allnothing worth speaking of between persons who know anything of the world  did she tell thee that she did not love thee my lordbecause that to my thinking would be reason enough  nothing of the kind i dont mean to boast but i dont see why she should not like me well enough  nor in sooth do i either  what zachary you walking about at this busy time of the day  i am walking about sir thomas it is not customary with me but i am walking about then he turned on his heel moved almost to dudgeon by the interruption and walked the other way sir thomas bolster my lord a very busy sort of gentleman but one who has done well in the worldnor in sooth do i either but this is a matter in which a young maiden must decide for herself i shall not bid her not to love thee but i cannot bid her to do so  it isnt that mr fay of course i have no right to pretend to any regard from her but as to that there has been no question  what did she say to thee  some trash about rank  nay my lord it is not trash i cannot hear thee speak so of thine own order without contradiction  am i to be like a king in the old days who was forced to marry any ugly old princess that might be found for him even though she were odious to him i will have nothing to do with rank on such terms i claim the right to please myself as do other men and i come to you as father to the young lady to ask from you your assistance in winning her to be my wife at this moment up came tribbledale running from the office  there is cooke there said tribbledale with much emphasis in his voice as though cookes was a very serious affair from pollock and austens  is not mr pogson within  he went out just after you cooke says that its most important that he should see some one immediately  tell him that he must wait yet five minutes longer said zachary fay frowning tribbledale awestruck as he bethought himself how great were the affairs of pollock and austen retreated back hurriedly to the court  you know what i mean mr fay continued lord hampstead  i know well what thou meanest my lord i think i know what thou meanest thou meanest to offer to my girl not only high rank and great wealth but which should be of infinitely more value to her the heart and the hand of an honest man i believe thee to be an honest man my lord  in this matter mr fay at any rate i am  in all matters as i believe and how should i being such a one as i am not be willing to give my girl to such a suitor as thee and what is it now he shrieked in his anger as the little boy off the high stool came rushing to him  mr pogson has just come back mr fay and he says that he cant find those letters from pollock and austen anywhere about the place he wants them immediately because he cant tell the prices named without seeing them  lord hampstead said the quaker almost white with rage i must pray thee to excuse me for five minutes hampstead promised that he would confine himself to the same uninteresting plot of ground till the quaker should return to him and then reflected that there were certain reasons upon which he had not calculated against falling in love with the daughter of a city clerk  we will go a little further afield said the quaker when he returned so that we may not be troubled again by those imbeciles in the court it is little however that i have to say to thee further thou hast my leave  i am glad of that  and all my sympathies but my lord i suppose i had better tell the truth  oh certainly  my girl fears that her health may fail her  her health  it is that as i think she has not said so to me openly but i think it is that her mother died earlyand her brothers and her sisters it is a sad tale my lord  but need that hinder her  i think not my lord but it must be for thee to judge as far as i know she is as fit to become a mans wife as are other girls her health has not failed her she is not robust but she does her work in looking after my household such as it is well and punctually i think that her mind is pervaded with vain terrors now i have told thee all placing full confidence in thee as in an honest man there is my house thou art welcome to go there if it seemeth thee good and to deal with marion in this matter as thy love and thy judgment may direct thee having said this he returned hurriedly to kings court as though he feared that tribbledale or the boy might again find him out  so far hampstead had succeeded but he was much troubled in his mind by what he had heard as to marions health not that it occurred to him for a moment that such a marriage as he contemplated would be undesirable because his marion might become ill he was too thoroughly in love to entertain such an idea nor is it one which can find ready entrance into the mind of a young man who sees a girl blooming with the freshness and beauty of youth it would have seemed to him had he thought about it at all that marions health was perfect but he was afraid of her obstinacy and he felt that this objection might be more binding on her than that which she put forward in reference to his rank he went back therefore to hendon hall only halfsatisfiedsometimes elated but sometimes depressed he would however go and discuss the matter with her at full length as soon as he should have returned from shropshire he would remain there only for one daythough it might be necessary for him to repeat the journey almost immediatelyso that no time might be lost in using his eloquence upon marion after what had passed between him and the quaker he thought that he was almost justified in assuring himself that the girl did in truth love him  give my father my kindest love said lady frances as her brother was about to start for the train  of course i will  and tell him that i will start at a moments notice whenever he may wish to see me  in such case of course i should take you  and be courteous to her if you can  i doubt whether she will allow me if she abuses you or insults me i must answer her  i wouldnt  you would be more ready than i am one cannot but answer her because she expects to hear something said in return i shall keep out of her way as much as possible i shall have my breakfast brought to me in my own room tomorrow and shall then remain with my father as much as possible if i leave him at all i shall get a walk there will only be the dinner as to one thing i have quite made up my mind nothing shall drive me into having any words with mr greenwoodunless indeed my father were to ask me to speak to him     chapter xi  mr greenwood becomes ambitious   mr greenwood was still anxious as to the health of the rector of appleslocombe there might be even yet a hope for him but his chance he thought would be better with the present marquisilldisposed towards him as the marquis wasthan with the heir the marquis was weary of him and anxious to get rid of himwas acting very meanly to him as mr greenwood thought having offered him £1000 as a final payment for a whole lifes attention the marquis who had ever been a liberal man had now perhaps on his deathbed become unjust harsh and cruel but he was weak and forgetful and might possibly be willing to save his money and get rid of the nuisance of the whole affair by surrendering the living this was mr greenwoods reading of the circumstances as they at present existed but the marquis could not dispose of the living while the rector was still alive nor could he even promise it to any good effect without his sons assent that lord hampstead would neither himself so bestow his patronage or allow it to be so bestowed mr greenwood was very sure there had been that between him and lord hampstead which convinced him that the young man was more hostile to him even than the father the marquis as mr greenwood thought had insulted him of latebut lord hampstead young as he was had also been insolent and what was worse he had insulted lord hampstead there had been something in the young lords eye which had assured him of the young lords contempt as well as dislike if anything could be done about the living it must be done by the marquis the marquis was very ill but it was still probable that the old rector should die first he had been given to understand that the old rector could hardly live many weeks  mr greenwood understood but little of the young lords character the marquis no doubt he knew well having lived with him for many years when he supposed his patron to be fretful and irascible because of his infirmities but to be by nature forgiving unreasonable and weak he drew an easy portrait which was like the person portrayed but in attributing revenge or harshness or pride of power to lord hampstead he was altogether wrong as regarded appleslocombe and other parishes the patronage of which would some day belong to him lord hampstead had long since made up his mind that he would have nothing to do with them feeling himself unfit to appoint clergymen to ministrations in a church to which he did not consider himself to belong all that he would leave to the bishop thinking that the bishop must know more about it than himself was his father however to make any request to him with reference to appleslocombe especially he would no doubt regard the living as bestowed before his fathers death but of all this mr greenwood could understand nothing he felt however that as the marquis had given him cause for anger so had the young lord given him cause for hatred as well as anger  daily almost hourly these matters were discussed between lady kingsbury and the chaplain there had come to be strong sympathy between them as far as sympathy can exist where the feelings are much stronger on the one side than on the other the mother of the darlings had allowed herself to inveigh very bitterly against her husbands children by his former marriage and at first had been received only half way by her confidential friend but of late her confidential friend had become more animated and more bitter than herself and had almost startled her by the boldness of his denunciations she in her passion had allowed herself more than once to express a wish that her stepsonwere dead she had hardly in truth meant as much as she impliedor meaning it had hardly thought of what she meant but the chaplain taking the words from her lips had repeated them till she was almost terrified by their iniquity and horror he had no darlings to justify him no great injury had been done to him by an unkind fortune great as were the sin of lord hampstead and his sister they could bring no disgrace upon him and yet there was a settled purpose of hatred in his words which frightened her though she could not bring herself to oppose them she in her rage had declared that it would be well that lord hampstead should break his neck out hunting or go down in his yacht at sea and she had been gratified to find that her friend had sanctioned her illwishes but when mr greenwood spoke as though something might possibly be done to further those wishes then she almost repented herself  she had been induced to say that if any power should come to her of bestowing the living of appleslocombe she would bestow it on mr greenwood were lord hampstead to die before the marquis and were the marquis to die before the old rector such power would belong to her during the minority of her eldest son there had therefore been some meaning in the promise and the clergyman had referred to it more than once or twice it is most improbable you know mr greenwood she had said very seriously he had replied as seriously that such improbabilities were of frequent occurrence if it should happen i will do so she had answered but after that she had never of her own accord referred to the probability of lord hampsteads death  from day to day there grew upon her a feeling that she had subjected herself to domination almost to tyranny from mr greenwood the man whom she had known intimately during her entire married life now appeared to assume different proportions and almost a different character he would still stand before her with his flabby hands hanging listlessly by his side and with eyes apparently full of hesitation and would seem to tremble as though he feared the effect of his own words but still the words that fell from him were felt to be bonds from which she could not escape when he looked at her from his lacklustre eyes fixing them upon her for minutes together till the minutes seemed to be hours she became afraid she did not confess to herself that she had fallen into his power nor did she realize the fact that it was so but without realizing it she was dominated so that she also began to think that it would be well that the chaplain should be made to leave trafford park he however continued to discuss with her all family matters as though his services were indispensable to her and she was unable to answer him in such a way as to reject his confidences  the telegram reached the butler as to hampsteads coming on the monday and was of course communicated at once to lord kingsbury the marquis who was now confined to his bed expressed himself as greatly gratified and himself told the news to his wife she however had already heard it as had also the chaplain it quickly went through the whole household in which among the servants there existed an opinion that lord hampstead ought to have been again sent for some days since the doctor had hinted as much to the marchioness and had said so plainly to the butler mr greenwood had expressed to her ladyship his belief that the marquis had no desire to see his son and that the son certainly had no wish to pay another visit to trafford he cares more about the quakers daughter than anything else he had saidabout her and his hunting he and his sister consider themselves as separated from the whole of the family i should leave them alone if i were you then she had said a faint word to her husband and had extracted from him something that was supposed to be the expression of a wish that lord hampstead should not be disturbed now lord hampstead was coming without any invitation  going to walk over is he in the middle of the night said mr greenwood preparing to discuss the matter with the marchioness there was something of scorn in his voice as though he were taking upon himself to laugh at lord hampstead for having chosen this way of reaching his fathers house  he often does that said the marchioness  its an odd way of coming into a sick houseto disturb it in the middle of the night mr greenwood as he spoke stood looking at her ladyship severely  how am i to help it i dont suppose anybody will be disturbed at all hell come round to the side door and one of the servants will be up to let him in he always does things differently from anybody else  one would have thought that when his father was dying  dont say that mr greenwood theres nothing to make you say that the marquis is very ill but nobody has said that hes so bad as that mr greenwood shook his head but did not move from the position in which he was standing i suppose that on this occasion hampstead is doing what is right  i doubt whether he ever does what is right i am only thinking that if anything should happen to the marquis how very bad it would be for you and the young lords  wont you sit down mr greenwood said the marchioness to whom the presence of the standing chaplain had become almost intolerable  the man sat downnot comfortably in his chair but hardly more than on the edge of it so as still to have that air of restraint which had annoyed his companion as i was saying if anything should happen to my lord it would be very sad for your ladyship and for lord frederick and lord augustus and lord gregory  we are all in the hands of god said her ladyship piously  yeswe are all in the hands of god but it is the lords intention that we should all look out for ourselves and do the best we can to avoid injustice and cruelty andandrobbery  i do not think there will be any robbery mr greenwood  would it not be robbery if you and their little lordships should be turned at once out of this house  it would be his ownlord hampsteadsof course i should have slocombe abbey in somersetshire as far as a house goes i should like it better than this of course it is much smallerbut what comfort do i ever have out of a house like this  thats true enough but why  there is no good in talking about it mr greenwood  i cannot help talking about it it is because lady frances has broken up the family by allowing herself to be engaged to a young man beneath her own station in life here he shook his head as he always did when he spoke of lady frances as for lord hampstead i look upon it as a national misfortune that he should outlive his father  what can we do  well my lady it is hard to say what will my feelings be should anything happen to the marquis and should i be left to the tender mercies of his eldest son i should have no claim upon lord hampstead for a shilling as he is an infidel of course he would not want a chaplain indeed i could not reconcile it to my conscience to remain with him i should be cast out penniless having devoted all my life as i may say to his lordships service  he has offered you a thousand pounds  a thousand pounds for the labours of a whole life and what assurance shall i have of that i dont suppose he has ever dreamed of putting it into his will and if he has what will a thousand pounds do for me you can go to slocombe abbey but the rectory which was as good as promised will be closed against me the marchioness knew that this was a falsehood but did not dare to tell him so the living had been talked about between them till it was assumed that he had a right to it if the young man were out of the way he continued there would be some chance for me  i cannot put him out of the way said the marchioness  and some chance for lord frederic and his brothers  you need not tell me of that mr greenwood  but one has to look the truth in the face it is for your sake that i have been anxiousrather than my own you must own that she would not own anything of the kind i suppose there was no doubt about the first marriage  none at all said the marchioness terrified  though it was thought very odd at the time it ought to be looked to i think no stone ought to be left unturned  there is nothing to be hoped for in that direction mr greenwood  it ought to be looked tothats all only think what it will be if he marries and has a son before anything isis settled  to this lady kingsbury made no answer and after a pause mr greenwood turned to his own grievances i shall make bold he said to see the marquis once again before lord hampstead comes down he cannot but acknowledge that i have a great right to be anxious i do not suppose that any promise would be sacred in his sons eyes but i must do the best i can to this her ladyship would make no answer and they parted not in the best humour with each other  that was on the monday on the tuesday mr greenwood having asked to be allowed an interview crept slowly into the sick mans room i hope your lordship find yourself better this morning the sick man turned in his bed and only made some feeble grunt in reply i hear that lord hampstead is coming down tomorrow my lord  why should he not come there must have been something in the tone of mr greenwoods voice which had grated against the sick mans ears or he would not have answered so sulkily  oh no my lord i did not mean to say that there was any reason why his lordship should not come perhaps it might have been better had he come earlier  it wouldnt have been at all better  i only just meant to make the remark my lord there was nothing in it  nothing at all said the sick man was there anything else you wished to say mr greenwood  the nurse all this time was sitting in the room which the chaplain felt to be uncomfortable could we be alone for a few minutes my lord he asked  i dont think we could said the sick man  there are a few points which are of so much importance to me lord kingsbury  i aint well enough to talk business and i wont do it mr roberts will be here tomorrow and you can see him  mr roberts was a man of business or agent to the property who lived at shrewsbury and whom mr greenwood especially disliked mr greenwood being a clergyman was of course supposed to be a gentleman and regarded mr roberts as being much beneath himself it was not customary for mr roberts to dine at the house and he was therefore regarded by the chaplain as being hardly more than an upper servant it was therefore very grievous to him to be told that he must discuss his own private affairs and make his renewed request as to the living through mr roberts it was evidently intended that he should have no opportunity of discussing his private affairs whatever the marquis might offer him he must take and that as far as he could see without any power of redress on his side if mr roberts were to offer him a thousand pounds he could only accept the cheque and depart with it from trafford park shaking off from his feet the dust which such ingratitude would forbid him to carry with him  he was in the habit of walking daily for an hour before sunset moving very slowly up and down the driest of the roads near the house generally with his hands clasped behind his back believing that in doing so he was consulting his health and maintaining that bodily vigour which might be necessary to him for the performance of the parochial duties at appleslocombe now when he had left the bedroom of the marquis he went out of the front door and proceeded on his walk at a somewhat quicker pace than usual he was full of wrath and his passion gave some alacrity to his movements he was of course incensed against the marquis but his anger burnt hottest against lord hampstead in this he was altogether unreasonable for lord hampstead had said nothing and done nothing that could injure his position lord hampstead disliked him and perhaps despised him but had been anxious that the marquis should be liberal in the mode of severing a connection which had lasted so long but to mr greenwood himself it was manifest that all his troubles came from the iniquities of his patrons two elder children and he remembered at every moment that lord hampstead had insulted him when they were both together he was certainly not a man to forgive an enemy or to lose any opportunity for revenge which might come in his way  certainly it would be good if the young man could be got to break his neck out huntingor good if the yacht could be made to founder or go to pieces on a rock or come to any other fatal maritime misfortune but these were accidents which he personally could have no power to produce such wishing was infantine and fit only for a weak woman such as the marchioness if anything were to be done it must be done by some great endeavour and the endeavour must come from himself then he reflected how far the marchioness would certainly be in his power if both the marquis and his eldest son were dead he did believe that he had obtained great influence over her that she should rebel against him was of course on the cards but he was aware that within the last month since the date indeed at which the marquis had threatened to turn him out of the house he had made considerable progress in imposing himself upon her as a master he gave himself in this respect much more credit than was in truth due to him lady kingsbury though she had learnt to fear him had not so subjected herself to his influence as not to be able to throw him off should a time come at which it might be essential to her comfort to do so but he had misread the symptoms and had misread also the fretfulness of her impatience he now assured himself that if anything could be done he might rely entirely on her support after all that she had said to him it would be impossible that she should throw him over thinking of all this and thinking also how expedient it was that something should be done he returned to the house when he had taken the exact amount of exercise which he supposed necessary for his health     chapter xii  like the poor cat i the adage   wishing will do nothing if a man has sufficient cause for action he should act letting i dare not wait upon i would like the poor cat i the adage never can produce results cherries will not fall into your mouth without picking if it were done when tis done then twere well it were done quickly if grapes hang too high what is the use of thinking of them neverthelesswhere theres a will theres a way but certainly no way will be found amidst difficulties unless a man set himself to work seriously to look for it with such selfgiven admonitions counsels and tags of old quotations as these mr greenwood went to work with himself on monday night and came to a conclusion that if anything were to be done it must be done at once  then came the questionwhat was the thing to be done and what at once meant when a thing has to be done which requires a special summoning of resolution it is too often something which ought not to be done to virtuous deeds if they recommend themselves to us at all we can generally make up our minds more easily it was pleasanter to mr greenwood to think of the thing as something in the future as something which might possibly get itself done for him by accident than as an act the doing of which must fall into his own hands then came the cat i the adage and the when tis done then twere well and the rest of it thursday morning between four and five o clock when it would be pitch dark with neither star nor moon in the heavens when lord hampstead would certainly be alone in a certain spot unattended and easily assailablewould thursday morning be the fittest time for any such deed as that which he had now in truth began to contemplate  when the thing presented itself to him in this new form he recoiled from it it cannot be said that mr greenwood was a man of any strong religious feelings he had been ordained early in life to a curacy having probably followed in choosing his profession the bent given to him by his family connections and had thus from circumstances fallen into the household of his present patrons uncle from that to this he had never performed a service in a church and his domestic services as chaplain had very soon become nothing  the old lord kingsbury had died very soon afterwards and mr greenwoods services had been continued rather as private secretary and librarian than as domestic chaplain he had been crafty willing and though anxious he had been able to conceal his anxiety in that respect and ready to obey when he found it necessary in this manner he had come to his present condition of life and had but few of the manners or feelings of a clergyman about him he was quite willing to take a living if it should come in his waybut to take it with a purpose that the duties should be chiefly performed by a curate he was not a religious man but when he came to look the matter in the face not on that account could he regard himself as a possible murderer without terrible doubts  as he thought of it his first and prevailing fear did not come from the ignominious punishment which is attached to and which generally attends the crime he has been described as a man flabby in appearance as one who seemed to tremble in his shoes when called upon for any special words as one who might be supposed to be devoid of strong physical daring but the true character of the man was opposed to his outward bearing courage is a virtue of too high a nature to be included among his gifts but he had that command of his own nerves that free action of blood round his heart that personal audacity coming from selfconfidence which is often taken to represent courage given the fact that he wanted an enemy out of the way he could go to work to prepare to put him out of the way without exaggerated dread of the consequences as far as this world is concerned he trusted much in himself and thought it possible that he could so look through all the concomitant incidents of such an act as that he contemplated without allowing one to escape him which might lead to detection he could so look at the matter he thought as to be sure whether this or the other plot might or might not be safe it might be that no safe plot were possible and that the attempt must therefore be abandoned these at any rate were not the dangers which made him creep about in dismay at his own intentions  there were other dangers of which he could not shake off the dread whether he had any clear hope as to eternal bliss in another life it may be doubted he probably drove from his mind thoughts on the subject not caring to investigate his own belief it is the practice of many to have their minds utterly callous in that respect to suppose that such men think this or think the other as to future rewards and punishments is to give them credit for a condition of mind to which they have never risen such a one was probably mr greenwood but nevertheless he feared something when this idea respecting lord hampstead presented itself to him it was as is some boggybo to a child some halfbelief in a spectre to a nervous woman some dread of undefined evil to an imaginative but melancholy man he did not think that by meditating such a deed by hardening his heart to the necessary resolution by steeling himself up to its perpetration he would bring himself into a condition unfitted for a life of bliss his thoughts did not take any such direction but though there might be no punishment in this worldeven though there were to be no other world in which punishment could comestill something of evil would surely fall upon him the convictions of the world since the days of cain have all gone in that direction it was thus that he allowed himself to be cowed and to be made to declare to himself again and again that the project must be abandoned  but the cat i the adage succeeded so far on the tuesday in getting the better of his scruples that he absolutely did form a plot he did not as yet quite see his way to that security which would be indispensablebut he did form a plot then came the bitter reflection that what he would do would be done for the benefit of others rather than his own what would lord frederic know of his benefactor when he should come to the throneas in such case he would doas marquis of kingsbury lord frederic would give him no thanks even were he to know itwhich of course could never be the case and why had not that woman assisted himshe who had instigated him to the doing of the deed for banquos issue have i filed my mind he said to himself over and over again not however in truth thinking of the deed with any of the true remorse to which macbeth was a prey the filing of his mind only occurred to him because the words were otherwise apt would she even be grateful when she should tell herselfas she surely would dothat the deed had been done by the partner of her confidences  when he thought of the reward which was to come to him in payment of the intended deed something like a feeling of true conscience did arise within him might it not be the case that even he callous as he was to most things should find himself unable to go down to appleslocombe and read himself in as the phrase goes as rector and pastor of the parish he thought of this as he lay in his bed and acknowledged to himself that his own audacity would probably be insufficient to carry him through such a struggle but still on the morning when he rose he had not altogether rejected the idea the young man had scorned him and had insulted him and was hateful to him but still why should he be the macbeth seeing that the lady macbeth of the occasion was untrue to him in all this he was unaware how very little his lady macbeth had really meant when she had allowed herself in his presence to express wishes as to her stepsons death  he thought he saw his plan the weapon was there ready to his handa weapon which he had not bought which could not be traced to him which would certainly be fatal if used with the assurance of which he was confident and there would be ample time for retreat but still as he arranged it all in his mind he regarded it all not as a thing fixed but as a thing which was barely possible it was thus that it might be done had the lady macbeth of the occasion really shown herself competent to such a task why should he trouble himself on such a matter why should he file his mind for banquos issue yet he looked at the pistol and at the window as he prepared to go up to her ladyships room before lunch on the wednesday morning it certainly could be done he said to himself telling himself at the same time that all that had been passing in his own mind was no more than a vague speculation a man is apt to speculate on things which have no reality to him till they become real  he had assumed the practice of going to her ladyships sittingroom upstairs without a special summons latterly to her ladyships great disgust when her quarrel had first become strong with lady frances she had no doubt received comfort from his support but now she had become weary of him and had sometimes been almost dismayed by the words he spoke to her at halfpast twelve punctually she went down to her husbands room and it was now customary with the chaplain to visit her before she did so she had more than once almost resolved to tell him that she preferred to be left alone during the morning but she had not as yet assumed the courage to do this she was aware that words had fallen from her in her anger which it was possible he might use against her were she to subject herself to his displeasure lord hampstead will be here at halfpast fourwhat you may call the middle of the nighttomorrow morning lady kingsbury said he repeating an assertion which he had already made to her two or three times as he did so he stood in the middle of the room looking down upon her with a gaze under which she had often suffered but which she did not in the least understand  of course i know hes coming  dont you think it a very improper time with a sick man in the house  he wont disturb his father  i dont know there will be the opening and the shutting of the door and the servant will be going about the passages and there will be the bringing in of the luggage  he wont have any luggage mr greenwood had been aware of this but it might be well that he should affect ignorance  it is like everything else that he does he said being anxious to induce the stepmother to speak ill of her stepson but the bent of her mind had been turned she was not conscious of the cause which had produced the change but she was determined to speak no further evil of her stepchildren before mr greenwood i suppose there is nothing to be done said mr greenwood  what should there be to be done if you do remain here i wish you would sit down mr greenwood you oppress me by standing up in that way in the middle of the room  i do not wonder that you should be oppressed he said seating himself as was his wont on the edge of a chair i am oppressed i know no one ever says a word to comfort me what am i to do if anything should happen  mr greenwood what is the use of all this  what would you think lady kingsbury if you had to live all the rest of your life on an income arising from a thousand pounds  it isnt my fault whats the good of your coming to me with all that i have had nothing to do with the arrangement which lord kingsbury has made with you you know very well that i do not dare even to mention your name to him lest he should order that you should be turned out of the house  turned out of the house he said jumping off his chair on to his legs with an alacrity which was quite unusual to him turned out of the houseas if i were a dog no man alive would stand such language  you know very well that ive always stood your friend said the marchioness alarmed by the mans impetuosity  and you tell me that im to be turned out of the house  i only say that it would be better not to mention your name to him i must go now because he will be waiting for me  he doesnt care a straw for you not a straw  mr greenwood  he cares only for his son and daughterfor the son and daughter of his first wife for those two ignoble young persons who as you have said so often are altogether unworthy of their name  mr greenwood i cannot admit this  have you not said it over and over again have you not declared how good a thing it would be that lord hampstead should die you cannot go back from all that lady kingsbury  i must go now mr greenwood she said shuffling out of the room he had altogether frightened her and as she went downstairs she determined that at whatever cost she must save herself from further private conversation with the chaplain  mr greenwood when he was thus left alone did not at once leave the room he had reseated himself and there he remained still gazing as though there had been some one for him to gaze at and still seated on the edge of his chair as though there were some one to see the affected humility of his position but in truth the gazing and the manner of sitting had become so customary to him that they were assumed without thought his mind was now full of the injury done to him by the marchioness she had made him her confidant she had poured her secret thoughts into his ears she had done her best to inspire him with her hatred and her desiresand now when she had almost taught him to be the minister of her wishes she turned upon him and upbraided him and deserted him of course when he had sympathized with her as to her illused darlings he had expected her to sympathize with him as to the hardships inflicted upon him but she cared nothing for his hardships and was anxious to repudiate the memory of all the hard words which she had spoken as to her husbands children it should not be so she should not escape from him in this manner when confidences have been made the persons making them must abide the consequences when a partnership has been formed neither partner has a right to retreat at once leaving the burden of all debts upon the other had not all these thoughts and plottings which had been so heavy on his mind since that telegram had come which had been so heavy on his soul been her doing had not the idea come from her had there not been an unspoken understanding between them that in consequence of certain mutual troubles and mutual aspirations there should be a plan of action arranged between them now she was deserting him wellhe thought that he could so contrive things that she should not do so with impunity having considered all this he got up from his chair and slowly walked down to his own room  he lunched by himself and then sat himself down with a novel as was his wont at that hour of the day there could be no man more punctual in all his daily avocations than mr greenwood after lunch there always came the novel but there was seldom much of it read he would generally go to sleep and would remain so enjoying perfect tranquillity for the best part of an hour then he would go out for his constitutional walk after which he would again take up the novel till the time came for her ladyships tea on this occasion he did not read at all but neither did he at once sleep there had been that on his mind which even though it had not been perfected banished sleep from him for some minutes there was no need of any further conversation as to safety or danger the deed whether it would or could not have been done in the manner he had premeditated certainly would not be done now certainly not now would he file his mind for banquos issue but after halfanhour of silent meditation he did sleep  when he arose and went out for a walk he felt that his heart was light within him he had done nothing by which he had compromised himself he had bound himself to no deed as he walked up and down the road he assured himself that he had never really thought of doing it he had only speculated as to the probabilitywhich is so common for men to do as to performances which they had no thought of attempting there was a great burden gone from him had he desired to get rid of lord hampstead it was in that way that he would have done itand he would so have done it that he would never have been suspected of the deed he had never intended more than that as he returned to the house he assured himself that he had never intended anything more and yet there was a great burden gone from him  at five oclock a message was brought to him that her ladyship finding herself to be rather unwell begged to be excused from asking him up to tea the message was brought by the butler himself with a suggestion that he should have tea in his own room i think i will harris he said just take a cup bythebye harris have you seen my lord today harris declared that he had seen his lordship in a tone of voice which implied that he at any rate had not been banished from my lords presence and how do you find him harris thought that the marquis was a little more like himself today than he had been for the last three days thats right i am very glad to hear that lord hampsteads coming tomorrow will be a great comfort to him  yes indeed said harris who was quite on lord hampsteads side in the family quarrels he had not been pleased with the idea of the roden marriage which certainly was unfortunate for the daughter of a marquis but he was by no means inclined to take part against the heir to the family honours  i wish he were coming at a little more reasonable hour in the day said mr greenwood with a smile but harris thought that the time of the day would do very well it was the kind of thing which his lordship very often did and harris did not see any harm in it this harris said with his hand on the lock of the door showing that he was not anxious for a prolonged conversation with the chaplain     chapter xiii  lady frances sees her lover   on the monday in that weekmonday the 5th of january on which day hampstead had been hunting and meditating the attack which he subsequently made on zachary fay in kings courtmrs vincent had paid a somewhat unusually long visit in paradise row as the visit was always made on monday neither had clara demijohn or mrs duffer been very much surprised but still it had been observed that the brougham had been left at the duchess of edinburgh for an hour beyond the usual time and a few remarks were made she is so punctual about her time generally clara had said but mrs duffer remarked that as she had exceeded the hour usually devoted to her friends company she had probably found it quite as well to stay another they dont make halfhours in any of those yards you know said mrs duffer and so the matter had been allowed to pass as having been sufficiently explained  but there had in truth been more than that in mrs vincents prolonged visit to her cousin there had been much to be discussed and the discussion led to a proposition made that evening by mrs roden to her son by which the latter was much surprised she was desirous of starting almost immediately for italy and was anxious that he should accompany her if it were to be so he was quite alive to the expediency of going with her but what is it mother he asked when she had requested his attendance without giving the cause which rendered the journey necessary then she paused as though considering whether she would comply with his request and tell him that whole secret of his life which she had hitherto concealed from him of course i will not press you he said if you think that you cannot trust me  oh george that is unkind  what else am i to say is it possible that i should start suddenly upon such a journey or that i should see you doing so without asking the reason why or can i suppose if you do not tell me but that there is some reason why you should not trust me  you know i trust you no mother ever trusted a son more implicitly you ought to know that it is not a matter of trusting there may be secrets to which a person shall be so pledged that she cannot tell them to her dearest friend if i had made a promise would you not have me keep it  promises such as that should not be exacted and should not be made  but if they have been exacted and have been made do as i ask you now and it is probable that everything will be clear to you before we return or at any rate as clear to you as it is to me after this with a certain spirit of reticence which was peculiar with him he made up his mind to do as his mother would have him without asking further questions he set himself to work immediately to make the necessary arrangements for his journey with as much apparent satisfaction as though it were to be done on his own behalf it was decided that they would start on the next friday travel through france and by the tunnel of the mont cenis to turin and thence on to milan of what further there was to befall them he knew nothing at this period  it was necessary in the first place that he should get leave of absence from sir boreas as to which he professed himself to be in much doubt because he had already enjoyed the usual leave of absence allowed by the rules of the office but on this matter he found Æolus to be very complaisant what italy said sir boreas very nice when you get there i should say but a bad time of year for travelling sudden business ehto go with your mother it is bad for a lady to go alone how long you dont know well come back as soon as you can thats all you couldnt take crocker with you could you for at this time crocker had already got into further trouble in regard to imperfections of handwriting he had been promised absolution as to some complaint made against him on condition that he could read a page of his own manuscript but he had altogether failed in the attempt roden didnt think that he could carry crocker to italy but arranged his own affair without that impediment  but there was another matter which must be arranged also it was now six weeks since he had walked with lord hampstead halfway back from holloway to hendon and had been desired by his friend not to visit lady frances while she was staying at hendon hall the reader may remember that he had absolutely refused to make any promise and that there had consequently been some sharp words spoken between the two friends there might he had then said arise an occasion on which he should find it impossible not to endeavour to see the girl he loved but hitherto though he had refused to submit himself to the demand made upon him he had complied with its spirit at this moment as it seemed to him a period had come in which it was essential to him that he should visit her there had been no correspondence between them since those königsgraaf days in consequence of the resolutions which she herself had made now as he often told himself they were as completely separated as though each had determined never again to communicate with the other months had gone by since a word had passed between them he was a man patient retentive and by nature capable of enduring such a trouble without loud complaint but he did remember from day to day how near they were to each other and he did not fail to remind himself that he could hardly expect to find constancy in her unless he took some means of proving to her that he was constant himself thinking of all this he determined that he would do his best to see her before he started for italy should he fail to be received at hendon hall then he would write but he would go to the house and make his attempt  on thursday morning the day on which hampstead arrived at trafford park he went down from london and knocking at the door asked at once for lady frances lady frances was at home and alonealone altogether having no companion with her in the house during her brothers absence the servant who opened the door the same who had admitted poor crocker and had understood how much his young mistress had been dismayed when the post office clerk had been announced was unwilling at once to show this other post office clerk into the house although he probably understood well the difference between the two comers ill go and see he said leaving george roden to sit or stand in the hall as he liked best then the man with a sagacity which certainly did him credit made a roundabout journey through the house so that the lover stationed in the hall might not know that his mistress was to be reached merely by the opening of a single door a gentleman in the hall said lady frances  mr roden my lady said the man  show him in said lady frances allowing herself just a moment for considerationa moment so short that she trusted that no hesitation had been visible and yet she had doubted much she had been very clear in explaining to her brother that she had made no promise she had never pledged herself to any one that she would deny herself to her lover should he come to see her she would not admit to herself that even her brother even her father had a right to demand from her such a pledge but she knew what were her brothers wishes on this matter and what were the reasons for them she knew also how much she owed to him but she too had suffered from that long silence she had considered that a lover whom she never saw and from whom she never heard was almost as bad as no lover at all she had beaten her feathers against her cage as she thought of this cruel separation she had told herself of the short distance which separated hendon from holloway she perhaps had reflected that had the man been as true to her as was she to him he would not have allowed himself to be deterred by the injunctions either of father or brother now at any rate when her lover was at the door she could not turn him away it had all to be thought of but it was thought of so quickly that the order for her lovers admittance was given almost without a pause which could have been felt then in half a minute her lover was in the room with her  need the chronicler of such scenes declare that they were in each others arms before a word was spoken between them the first word that was spoken came from her oh george how long it has been  it has been long to me  but at last you have come  did you expect me sooner had you not agreed with hampstead and your father that i was not to come  never mind you are here now poor papa you know is very ill perhaps i may have to go down there john is there now  is he so ill as that  john went last night we do not quite know how ill he is he does not write and we doubt whether we get at the truth i was very nearly going with him and then sir you would not have seen meat all  another month another six months another year would have made no difference in my assurance of your truth to me  that is a very pretty speech for you to make  nor i think in yours for me  i am bound of course to be just as pretty as you are but why have you come now you shouldnt have come when john had left me all alone  i did not know that you were here alone  or you would not have come perhaps but you should not have come why did you not ask before you came  because i should have been refused it would have been refused would it not  certainly it would  but as i wish to see you specially  why specially i have wanted to see you always every day has been a special want it should have been so with you also had you been as true as i am there should have been no special times  but i am going  going where are you going not for always you are leaving holloway you mean or the post office then he explained to her that as far as he knew the journey would not be for long he was not leaving his office but had permission to absent himself for a time so that he might travel with his mother as far as milan nay said he laughing why i am to do so i do not in the least know my mother has some great italian mystery of which she has never yet revealed to me any of the circumstances all i know is that i was born in italy  you an italian  i did not say that there is an old saying that you need not be a horse because you were born in a stable nor do i quite know that i was born in italy though i feel sure of it of my father i have never known anythingexcept that he was certainly a bad husband to my mother there are circumstances which do make me almost sure that i was born in italy but as my mother has been unwilling to talk to me of my earliest days i have never chosen to ask her now i shall perhaps know it all  of what else passed between them the reader need learn no details to her the day was one of exceeding joy a lover in china or waging wars in zululand or elsewhere among the distant regions is a misfortune a lover ought to be at hand ready at the moment to be kissed or scolded to wait upon you or so much sweeter still to be waited upon just as the occasion may serve but the lover in china is better than one in the next street or the next parishor only a few miles off by railwaywhom you may not see the heart recognizes the necessity occasioned by distance with a sweet softness of tender regrets but is hardened by mutiny or crushed by despair in reference to stern parents or unsuitable pecuniary circumstances lady frances had been enduring the sternness of parents and had been unhappy now there had come a break she had seen what he was like and had heard his voice and been reassured by his vows and had enjoyed the longedfor opportunity of repeating her own nothing nothing nothing can change me how was he to be sure of that while she had no opportunity of telling him that it was so no timenothing that papa can say nothing that john can do will have any effect as to lady kingsbury of course you know that she has thrown me off altogether it was nothing to him he said who might have thrown her off having her promise he could bide his time not but that he was impatient but that he knew that when so much was to be given to him at last it behoved him to endure all things rather than to be faint of heart and so they parted  she however in spite of her joy had a troubled spirit when he was gone she had declared to her brother that she was bound by no promise as to seeing or not seeing her lover but yet she was aware how much she owed to him and that though she had not promised he had made a promise on her behalf to her father but for that promise she would never have been allowed to be at hendon hall his brother had made all his arrangements so as to provide for her a home in which she might be free from the annoyances inflicted upon her by her stepmother but had done so almost with a provision that she should not see george roden she certainly had done nothing herself to infringe that stipulation but george roden had come and she had seen him she might have refused him admittance no doubt but then again she thought that it would have been impossible to do so how could she have told the man to deny her thus professing her indifference for him in regard to whom she had so often declared that she was anxious that all the world should know that they were engaged to marry each other it would have been impossible for her not to see him and yet she felt that she had been treacherous to her brother to whom she owed so much  one thing seemed to her to be absolutely necessary she must write at once and tell him what had occurred thinking of this she sat down and wrote so that she might despatch her letter by that postand what she wrote is here given      my dear john     i shall be so anxious to get news from trafford and to    hear how you found papa i cannot but think that were he    very ill somebody would have let us know the truth though    mr greenwood is crossgrained and impertinent he would    hardly have kept us in the dark     now i have a piece of news to tell you which i hope will    not make you very angry it was not my doing and i do    not know how i could have helped it your friend george    roden called today and asked to see me of course    i could have refused he was in the hall when richard    announced him and i suppose i could have sent out word to    say that i was not at home but i think you will feel that    that was in truth impossible how is one to tell a lie to    a man when one feels towards him as i do about george or    how could i even let the servants think that i would treat    him so badly of course every one knows about it i want    every one to know about it so that it may be understood    that i am not in the least ashamed of what i mean to do     and when you hear why he came i do not think that you can    be angry even with him he has been called upon for some    reason to go at once with his mother to italy they start    for milan tomorrow and he does not at all know when he    may return he had to get leave at the post office but    that sir boreas whom he talks about seems to have been    very goodnatured about giving it he asked him whether he    would not take mr crocker with him to italy but that of    course was a joke i suppose they do not like mr crocker    at the post office any better than you do why mrs roden    should have to go he does not understand all he knows is    that there is some italian secret which he will hear all    about before he comes home     now i really do think that you cannot be surprised that he    should have come to see me when he is going to take such a    journey as that what should i have thought if i had heard    that he had gone without saying a word to me about it    dont you think that that would have been most unnatural    i should have almost broken my heart when i heard that he    had started     i do hope therefore that you will not be angry with    either of us but yet i feel that i may have brought you    into trouble with papa i do not care in the least for    lady kingsbury who has no right to interfere in the    matter at all after her conduct everything i think is    over between us but i shall be indeed sorry if papa is    vexed and shall feel it very much if he says anything to    you after all your great kindness to me     your affectionate sister     fanny   i have done one other thing today said george roden when he was explaining to his mother on thursday evening all the preparations he had made for their journey  what other thing she asked guessing accurately however the nature of the thing of which he was about to speak  i have seen lady frances trafford  i thought it probable that you might endeavour to do so  i have done more than endeavour on this occasion i went down to hendon hall and was shown into the drawingroom i am sorry for hampsteads sake but it was impossible for me not to do so  why sorry for his sake she asked  because he had pledged himself to his father that i should not do so he clearly had no right to make such a pledge i could not bind myself to an assurance by keeping which i might seem to show myself to be indifferent a girl may bind herself by such a promise but hardly a man had i made the promise i almost think i must have broken it i did not make it and therefore i have no sin to confess but i fear i shall have done him a mischief with his father  and what did she say george  oh just the old story mother i suppose what she said was what i knew just as well before i went there but yet it was necessary that i should hear what she had to sayand as necessary i think that she should hear me  quite as necessary i am sure said his mother kissing his forehead     chapter xiv  mr greenwoods feelings   on that wednesday night mr greenwood did not sleep much it may be doubted whether he once closed his eyes in slumber he had indeed been saved from the performance of an act which now seemed to him to be so terrible that he could hardly believe that he had in truth contemplated it but yet he knewhe knew that it for some hours had been the purpose of his mind to do it he struggled to make himself believe that it had in truth been no more than a speculation that there had been no formed purpose that he had only amused himself by considering how he could do such a deed without detection if the deed were to be done he had simply been thinking over the blunders of others the blindness of men who had so bungled in their business as to have left easy traces for the eyes and intelligence of the world outside and had been assuring himself how much better he could manage if the necessity of such an operation were to come upon him that was all no doubt he hated lord hampsteadand had cause to do so it was thus that he argued with himself but his hatred had surely not carried him to the intention of murder  there could have been no question of real murder for why should he have troubled himself either with the danger or with the load which it would certainly have imposed on his conscience much as he hated lord hampstead it was no business of his it was that lady macbeth upstairs the mother of the darlings who had really thought of murder it was she who had spoken openly of her great desire that lord hampstead should cease to live had there been any real question of murder it would have been for her to meditate for her to think for her to plotsurely not for him certainly certainly he had contemplated no such deed as that with the object of obtaining for the comfort of his old age the enjoyment of the living of appleslocombe he told himself now that had he in truth committed such a crime had he carried out the plot which had formed itself in his brain only as a matter of speculation though he might not have been detected yet he would have been suspected and suspicion would have been as destructive to his hopes as detection of course all that had been clear enough to him throughout his machinations and therefore how could he really have intended it he had not intended it it had only been one of those castles in the air which the old build as well as the youngwhich are no more than the airy fabrics of the brain  it was thus he struggled to drive from his mind and from his eyes the phantom of the terrible deed but that he did not succeed was made evident to himself by the hot clammy drops of sweat which came out upon his brow by his wakefulness throughout the livelong night by the carefulness with which his ears watched for the sound of the young mans coming as though it were necessary that he should be made assured that the murder had in truth not been done before that hour had come he found himself to be shaking even in his bed to be drawing the clothes around him to dispel the icy cold though the sweat still stood upon his brow to be hiding his eyes under the bedclothes in order that he might not see something which seemed to be visible to him through the utmost darkness of the chamber at any rate he had done nothing let his thoughts have been what they might he had soiled neither his hands nor his conscience though everything that he had ever done or ever thought were known he was free from all actual crime she had talked of death and thought of murder he had only echoed her words and her thoughts meaning nothingas a man is bound to do to a woman why then could he not sleep why should he be hot and shiver with cold by turns why should horrid phantoms perplex him in the dark he was sure he had never meant it what must be the agony of those who do mean of those who do execute if such punishment as this were awarded to one who had done no more than build a horrid castle in the air did she sleephe wonderedshe who had certainly done more than build a castle in the air she who had wished and longed and had a reason for her wishing and her longing  at last he heard a footfall on the road which passed but some few yards distant from his window a quick cheery almost running footfall a step full of youth and life sounding crisp on the hard frozen ground and he knew that the young man whom he hated had come though he had never thought of murdering himas he told himselfyet he hated him and then his thoughts although in opposition to his own wisheswhich were intent upon sleep if sleep would only come to himran away to the building of other castles how would it have been now now at this moment if that plan which he had never really intended to carry out which had only been a speculation had been a true plan and been truly executed how would it have been with them all now at trafford park the marchioness would have been at any rate altogether satisfiedbut what comfort would there have been in that to him lord frederic would have been the heir to a grand title and to vast estatesbut how would he have been the better for that the old lord who was lying there so sick in the next room might probably have sunk into his grave with a broken heart the marquis had of late been harsh to him but there did come to him an idea at the present moment that he had for thirty years eaten the sick mans bread and the young man would have been sent without a moments notice to meet his final doom of what nature that might have been the wretched man lying there did not dare even to make a picture in his imagination it was a matter which he had sedulously and successfully dismissed from all his thoughts it was of the body lying out there in the cold not of the journey which the winged soul might make that he unwillingly drew a picture to himself he conceived how he himself in the prosecution of the plan which he had formed would have been forced to have awakened the house and to tell of the deed and to assist in carrying the body to what restingplace might have been found for it there he would have had to enact a part of which he had a few hours since told himself that he would be capable but in attempting which he was now sure that he would have succumbed to the difficulties of the struggle who would have broken the news to the father who would have attempted to speak the first word of vain consolation who would have flown to the ladys door upstairs and have informed her that death was in the houseand have given her to understand that the eldest of her darlings was the heir it would have been for him to do it all for him with a spirit weighed down to the ground by that terrible burden with which the doing of such a deed would have loaded it he would certainly have revealed himself in the struggle  but why should he allow his mind to be perplexed with such thoughts no such deed had been done there had been no murder the young man was there now in the house lighthearted after his walk full of life and youthful energy why should he be troubled with such waking dreams as these must it be so with him always for the rest of his life only because he had considered how a thing might best be done he heard a footstep in a distant passage and a door closed and then again all was silent was there not cause to him for joy in the young mans presence if his speculations had been wicked was there not time to turn for repentancefor repentance though there was so little for which repentance were needed nevertheless the night was to him so long and the misery connected with the trafford name so great that he told himself that he would quit the place as soon as possible he would take whatever money were offered to him and go how would it have been with him had he really done the deed when he found himself unable to sleep in the house in which he would not quite admit to himself that he had even contemplated it  on the next morning his breakfast was brought to him in his own room and he inquired from the servant after lord hampstead and his purposes the servant thought that his lordship meant to remain on that day and the next so he had heard harris the butler say his lordship was to see his father at eleven oclock that morning the household bulletin respecting the marquis had that morning been rather more favourable than usual the marchioness had not yet been seen the doctor would probably be there by twelve this was the news which mr greenwood got from the servant who waited upon him could he not escape from the house during the period that the young lord would be there without seeing the young lord the young lord was hateful to himmore hateful than ever he would if possible get himself carried into shrewsbury and remain there on some excuse of visiting a friend till the young lord should have returned to london he could not tell himself why but he felt that the sight of the young lord would be oppressive to him  but in this he was prevented by an intimation that was given to him early in the day before he had made preparations for his going that lord hampstead wished to see him and would wait upon him in his own room the marquis had expressed himself grateful to his son for coming but did not wish to detain him at trafford of course it is very dull for you and i think i am better  i am so glad of thatbut if you think that i am of any comfort to you i shall be delighted to stay i suppose fanny would come down if i remain here  then the marquis shook his head fanny he thought had better be away the marchioness and fanny would not be happy in the house togetherunless indeed she has given up that young man hampstead could not say that she had given up the young man i do hope she never sees him said the marquis then his son assured him that the two had never met since fanny had gone to hendon hall and he was rash enough to assure his father that there would be no such meeting while his sister was his guest at that moment george roden was standing in the drawingroom at hendon hall with lady frances in his arms  after that there arose a conversation between the father and son as to mr greenwood the marquis was very desirous that the man who had become so objectionable to him should quit the house the truth is said the marquis that it is he who makes all the mischief between me and your stepmother it is he that makes me ill i have no comfort while he is here making plots against me if they two had only known the plot which had been made hampstead thought it reasonable that the man should be sent away if only because his presence was disagreeable why should a man be kept in the house simply to produce annoyance but there must be the question of compensation he did not think that £1000 was sufficient then the marquis was unusually difficult of persuasion in regard to money hampstead thought that an annuity of £300 a year should be settled on the poor clergyman the marquis would not hear of it the man had not performed even the slight duties which had been required of him the books had not even been catalogued to bribe a man such as that by £300 a year for making himself disagreeable would be intolerable the marquis had never promised him anything he ought to have saved his money at last the father and son came to terms and hampstead sent to prepare a meeting with the chaplain  mr greenwood was standing in the middle of the room when lord hampstead entered it rubbing his fat hands together hampstead saw no difference in the man since their last meeting but there was a difference mr greenwoods manner was at first more submissive as though he were afraid of his visitor but before the interview was over he had recovered his audacity my father has wished me to see you said hampstead mr greenwood went on rubbing his hands still standing in the middle of the room he seems to think it better that you should leave him  i dont know why he should think it betterbut of course i will go if he bids me mr greenwood had quite made up his mind that it would be better for him also that he should go  there will be no good in going into that i think we might as well sit down mr greenwood they did sit down the chaplain as usual perching himself on the edge of a chair you have been here a great many years  a great many lord hampsteadnearly all my lifebefore you were born lord hampstead then as he sat gazing there came before his eyes the phantom of lord hampstead being carried into the house as a corpse while he himself was struggling beneath a portion of the weight  just so and though the marquis cannot admit that there is any claim upon him  no claim lord hampstead  certainly no claim yet he is quite willing to do something in acknowledgment of the long connection his lordship thinks that an annuity of £200 a year mr greenwood shook his head as though he would say that that certainly would not satisfy him hampstead had been eager to secure the full £300 for the wretched useless man but the marquis had declared that he would not burden the estate with a charge so unnecessarily large i say continued hampstead frowning that his lordship has desired me to say that you shall receive during your life an annuity of £200 it certainly was the fact that lord hampstead could frown when he was displeased and that at such moments he would assume a look of aristocratic impatience which was at variance with his professed political theories mr greenwood again shook his head i do not think that i need say anything farther continued the young lord that is my fathers decision he presumes that you would prefer the annuity to the immediate payment of a thousand pounds here the shaking of the head became more violent i have only in addition to ask you when it will suit you to leave trafford park lord hampstead when he had left his father had determined to use his blandest manner in communicating these tidings to the chaplain but mr greenwood was odious to him the way in which the man stood on the floor and rubbed his hands together and sat on the edge of his chair and shook his head without speaking a word were disgusting to him if the man had declared boldly his own view of what was due to him hampstead would have endeavoured to be gracious to him as it was he was anything but gracious as he asked the chaplain to name the day on which he would be prepared to leave the house  you mean to say that i am to beturned out  it is some months since you were told that my father no longer required your services  i am to be turned outlike a dogafter thirty years  i cannot contradict you when you say so but i must ask you to name a day it is not as though the suggestion were now made to you for the first time mr greenwood got up from the edge of the chair and again stood in the middle of the room lord hampstead felt himself constrained also to stand have you any answer to make to me  no i have not said the chaplain  you mean that you have not fixed upon a day  i shant go with £200 a year said the chaplain its unreasonable its brutal  brutal shouted lord hampstead  i shant stir till ive seen the marquis himself its out of the question that he should turn me out in this way how am i to live upon £200 a year i always understood that i was to have appleslocombe  no such promise was ever made to you said lord hampstead very angrily no hint of such a thing has ever been made except by yourself  i always understood it said mr greenwood and i shall not leave this till ive had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the marquis himself i dont think the marquis would ever have treated me in this wayonly for you lord hampstead  this was intolerable what was he to do with the abominable man it would be very disagreeable the task of turning him out while the marquis was still so ill and yet it was not to be endured that such a man should be allowed to hold his position in the house in opposition to the will of the owner it was he felt beneath him to defend himself against the charge madeor even to defend his father if you will not name a day i must said the young lord the man remained immovable on his seat except that he continued to rub his hands as i can get no answer i shall have to instruct mr roberts that you cannot be allowed to remain here after the last day of the month if you have any feeling left to you you will not impose upon us so unpleasant a duty while my father is ill with this he left the room while mr greenwood was still standing and rubbing his hands  two hundred pounds a year he had better go and take it he was quite aware of that but how was he to live upon £200he who had been bedded and boarded all his life at the expense of another man and had also spent £300 but at the moment this was not the thought uppermost in his mind would it not have been better that he should have carried out that project of his only that he had been merciful this young lord would not have been able to scorn him and illtreat him as he had done there were no phantoms now now he thought that he could have carried his share of the corpse into the house without flinching     chapter xv  that would be disagreeable   things at trafford on that day and on the next were very uncomfortable no house could possibly be more so there were four persons who in the natural course of things would have lived together not one of whom would sit down to table with any other the condition of the marquis of course made it impossible that he should do so he was confined to his room in which he would not admit mr greenwood to come near him and where his wifes short visits did not seem to give him much satisfaction even with his son he was hardly at his ease seeming to prefer the society of the nurse with occasional visits from the doctor and mr roberts the marchioness confined herself to her own room in which it was her intention to prevent the inroads of mr greenwood as far as it might be possible that she should be able to exclude him altogether was more than she could hope but much she thought could be done by the dint of headaches and by a resolution never to take her food downstairs lord hampstead had declared his purpose to harris as well as to his father never again to sit down to table with mr greenwood where does he dine he asked the butler generally in the family diningroom my lord said harris then give me my dinner in the breakfast parlour yes my lord said the butler who at once resolved to regard mr greenwood as an enemy of the family in this manner mr greenwood gave no trouble as he had his meat sent to him in his own sittingroom but all this made the house very uncomfortable  in the afternoon mr roberts came over from shrewsbury and saw lord hampstead i knew he would make himself disagreeable my lord said mr roberts  how did you know it  things creep out he had made himself disagreeable to his lordship for some months past and then we heard that he was talking of appleslocombe as though he were certain to be sent there  my father never thought of it  i didnt think he did mr greenwood is the idlest human being that ever lived and how could he have performed the duties of a parish  he asked my father once and my father flatly refused him  perhaps her ladyship suggested mr roberts with some hesitation  at any rate he is not to have appleslocombe and he must be made to go how is it to be done mr roberts raised his eyebrows i suppose there must be some means of turning an objectionable resident out of a house  the police of course could carry him outwith a magistrates order he would have to be treated like any other vagrant  that would be disagreeable  very disagreeable my lord said mr roberts my lord should be saved from that if possible  how if we gave him nothing to eat said lord hampstead  that would be possible but it would be troublesome what if he resolved to remain and be starved it would be seeing which would hold out the longer i dont think my lord would have the heart to keep him twentyfour hours without food we must try and save my lord from what is disagreeable as much as we can lord hampstead was in accord as to this but did not quite see his way how to effect it there were still however more than three weeks to run before the day fixed for the chaplains exit and mr roberts suggested that it might in that time be fully brought home to the man that his £200 a year would depend on his going perhaps youd better leave him to me my lord said mr roberts and i shall deal with him better when youre not here  when the time came for afternoon tea mr greenwood perceiving that no invitation came to him from the marchioness sent a note up to her asking for the favour of an interview he had a few words to say and would be much obliged to her if she would allow him to come to her on receiving this she pondered for some time before she could make up her mind as to what answer she should give she would have been most anxious to do as she had already heard that lord hampstead had done and decline to meet him at all she could not analyze her own feelings about the man but had come during the last few days to hold him in horror it was as though something of the spirit of the murderer had shown itself to her in her eyes she had talked glibly wickedly horribly of the death of the man who had seemed to stand in her way she had certainly wished for it she had taught herself to think by some ultrafeminine lack of logic that she had really been injured in that her own eldest boy had not been born heir to his fathers titles she had found it necessary to have some recipient for her griefs her own sister lady persiflage had given her no comfort and then she had sought for and had received encouragement from her husbands chaplain but in talking of lord hampsteads death she had formed no plan she had only declared in strong language that if by the hand of providence such a thing should be done it would be to her a happy chance she had spoken out where another more prudent than she would perhaps only have wished but this man had taken up her words with an apparently serious purpose which had frightened her and then as though he had been the recipient of some guilty secret he had laid aside the respect which had been usual to him and had assumed a familiarity of copartnership which had annoyed and perplexed her she did not quite understand it all but was conscious of a strong desire to be rid of him but she did not dare quite as yet to let him know that such was her purpose and she therefore sent her maid down to him with a message mr greenwood wants to see me she said to the woman will you tell him with my compliments that i am not very well and that i must beg him not to stay long  lord hampstead has been a quarrelling with mr greenwood my ladythis very morning said the maid  quarrelling walker  yes my lady there has been ever so much about it my lord says as he wont sit down to dinner with mr greenwood on no account and mr roberts has been here all about it hes to be turned away  who is to be turned away  mr greenwood my lady lord hampstead has been about it all the morning its for that my lord the marquis has sent for him and nobodys to speak to him till hes packed up everything and taken himself right away out of the house  who has told you all that walker walker however would not betray her informant she answered that it was being talked of by everybody downstairs and she repeated it now only because she thought it proper that my lady should be informed of what was going on my lady was not sorry to have received the information even from her maid as it might assist her in her conversation with the chaplain  on this occasion mr greenwood sat down without being asked i am sorry to hear that you are so unwell lady kingsbury  i have got one of my usual headachesonly its rather worse than usual  i have something to say which i am sure you will not be surprised that i should wish to tell you i have been grossly insulted by lord hampstead  what can i do  wellsomething ought to be done  i cannot make myself answerable for lord hampstead mr greenwood  no of course not he is a young man for whom no one would make himself answerable he is headstrong violent and most uncourteous he has told me very rudely that i must leave the house by the end of the month  i suppose the marquis had told him  i dont believe it of course the marquis is ill and i could bear much from him but i wont put up with it from lord hampstead  what can i do  wellafter what has passed between us lady kingsbury he paused and looked at her as he made this appeal she compressed her lips and collected herself and prepared for the fight which she felt was coming he saw it all and prepared himself also after what has passed between us lady kingsbury he said repeating his words i think you ought to be on my side  i dont think anything of the kind i dont know what you mean about sides if the marquis says youre to go i cant keep you  ill tell you what ive done lady kingsbury i have refused to stir out of this house till ive been allowed to discuss the matter with his lordship and i think you ought to give me your countenance im sure ive always been true to you when you have unburdened your troubles to my ears i have always been sympathetic when you have told me what a trouble this young man has been to you have not i alwaysalwaysalways taken your part against him he almost longed to tell her that he had formed a plan for ridding her altogether of the obnoxious young man but he could not find the words in which to do this of course i have felt that i might depend upon you for assistance and countenance in this house  mr greenwood she said i really cannot talk to you about these things my head is aching very badly and i must ask you to go  and that is to be all  dont you hear me tell you that i cannot interfere still he kept that horrid position of his upon the chair staring at her with his large open lustreless eyes mr greenwood i must ask you to leave me as a gentleman you must comply with my request  oh he said very well then i am to know that after thirty years faithful service all the family has turned against me i shall take care but he paused remembering that were he to speak a word too much he might put in jeopardy the annuity which had been promised him and at last he left the room  of mr greenwood no one saw anything more that day nor did lord hampstead encounter him again before he returned to london hampstead had arranged to stay at trafford during the following day and then to return to london again using the night mail train but on the next morning a new trouble fell upon him he received his sisters letter and learned that george roden had been with her at hendon hall he had certainly pledged himself that there should be no such meeting and had foolishly renewed this pledge only yesterday when he read the letter he was vexed chiefly with himself the arguments which she had used as to rodens coming and also those by which she had excused herself for receiving him did seem to him to be reasonable when the man was going on such a journey it was natural that he should wish to see the girl he loved and natural that she should wish to see him and he was well aware that neither of them had pledged themselves it was he only who had given a pledge and that as to the conduct of others who had refused to support him in it now his pledge had been broken and he felt himself called upon to tell his father of what had occurred after all that i told you yesterday he said george roden and fanny have met each other then he attempted to make the best excuse he could for this breach of the promise which he had made  whats the good said the marquis they cant marry each other i wouldnt give her a shilling if she were to do such a thing without my sanction hampstead knew very well that in spite of this his father had made by his will ample provision for his sister and that it was very improbable that any alteration in this respect would be made let his sisters disobedience be what it might but the marquis seemed hardly to be so much affected as he had expected by these tidings whatever you do said the marquis dont let her ladyship know it she would be sure to come down to me and say it was all my fault and then she would tell me what mr greenwood thought about it the poor man did not know how little likely it was that she would ever again throw mr greenwood in his teeth  lord hampstead had not as yet even seen his stepmother but had thought it no more than decent to send her word that he would wait upon her before he left the house all domestic troubles he knew to be bad for his stepmothers sake and for that of his sister and little brothers he would avoid as far as might be possible any open rupture he therefore went to the marchioness before he ate his dinner my father is much better he said but his stepmother only shook her head so that there was before him the task of recommencing the conversation dr spicer says so  i am not sure that mr spicer knows much about it  he thinks so himself  he never tells me what he thinks he hardly tells me anything  he is not strong enough for much talking  he will talk to mr roberts by the hour together so i hear that i am to congratulate you this she said in a tone which was clearly intended to signify both condemnation and ridicule  i am not aware of it said hampstead with a smile  i suppose it is true about the quaker lady  i can hardly tell you not knowing what you may have heard there can be no room for congratulation as the lady has not accepted the offer i have made her the marchioness laughed incredulouslywith a little affected laugh in which the incredulity was sincerei can only tell you that it is so  no doubt you will try again  no doubt  young ladies in such circumstances are not apt to persevere in their severity perhaps it may be supposed that she will give way at last  i cannot take upon myself to answer that lady kingsbury the matter is one on which i am not particularly anxious to talk only as you asked me i thought it best just to tell you the facts  i am sure i am ever so much obliged to you the young ladys father is  the young ladys father is a clerk in a merchants office in the city  so i understandand a quaker  and a quaker  and i believe he lives at holloway  just so  in the same street with that young man whom fanny hashas chosen to pick up  marion fay and her father live at no 17 paradise row holloway and mrs roden and george roden live at no 11  exactly we may understand therefore how you became acquainted with miss fay  i dont think you can but if you wish to know i will tell you that i first saw miss fay at mrs rodens house  i suppose so  hampstead had begun this interview with perfect good humour but there had gradually been growing upon him that tone of defiance which her little speeches to him had naturally produced scorn would always produce scorn in him as would ridicule and satire produce the same in return i do not know why you should have supposed so but such was the fact neither had george roden or my sister anything to do with it miss fay is a friend of mrs roden and mrs roden introduced me to the young lady  i am sure we are all very much obliged to her  i am at any rateor shall be if i succeed at last  poor fellow it will be very piteous if you too are thwarted in love  ill say goodbye my lady said he getting up to leave her  you have told me nothing of fanny  i do not know that i have anything to tell  perhaps she also will be jilted  i should hardly think so  because as you tell me she is not allowed to see him there was a thorough disbelief expressed in this which annoyed him it was as though she had expressed her opinion that the lovers were encouraged to meet daily in spite of the pledge which had been given and then the pledge had been broken and there would be a positive lie on his part if he were now to leave her with the idea that they had not met you must find it hard to keep them apart as they are so near  i have found it too hard at any rate  oh you have  they did meet yesterday  oh they did directly your back was turned  he was going abroad and he came and she has written to tell me of it i say nothing of myself lady kingsbury but i do not think you can understand how true she can beand he also  that is your idea of truth  that is my idea of truth lady kingsbury which as i said before i am afraid i cannot explain to you i have never meant to deceive you nor have they  i thought a promise was a promise she said then he left her condescending to make no further reply on that night he went back to london with a sad feeling at his heart that his journey down to trafford had done no good to any one he had however escaped a danger of which he had known nothing     chapter xvi  i do   lord hampstead did not reach his house till nearly six on the following morning and having been travelling two nights out of three allowed himself the indulgence of having his breakfast in bed while he was so engaged his sister came to him very penitent for her fault but ready to defend herself should he be too severe to her of course i am very sorry because of what you had said but i dont know how i am to help myself it would have looked so very strange  it was unfortunatethats all  was it so very unfortunate john  of course i had to tell them down there  was papa angry  he only said that if you chose to make such a fool of yourself he would do nothing for youin the way of money  george does not think of that in the least  people must eat you know  ah that would make no difference either to him or to me we must wait thats all i do not think it would make me unhappy to wait till i died if he only were content to wait also but was papa so very angry  he wasnt so very angryonly angry i was obliged to tell him but i said as little to him as possible because he is ill somebody else made herself disagreeable  did you tell her  i was determined to tell herso that she should not turn round upon me afterwards and say that i had deceived her i had made a promise to my father  oh john i am so sorry  there is no use in crying after spilt milk a promise to my father she would of course take as a promise to her and it would have been flung in my face  she will do so now  oh yesbut i can fight the battle better having told her everything  was she disagreeable  abominable she mixed you up with marion fay and really showed more readiness than i gave her credit for in what she said of course she got the better of me she could call me a liar and a fool to my face and i could not retaliate but theres a row in the house which makes everything wretched there  another row  you are forgotten in this new rowand so am i george roden and marion fay are nothing in comparison with poor mr greenwood he has been committing horrible offences and is to be turned out he swears he wont go and my father is determined he shall mr roberts has been called in and there is a question whether harris shall not put him on gradually diminished rations till he be starved into surrender hes to have £200 a year if he goes but he says that it is not enough for him  would it be much  considering that he likes to have everything of the very best i do not think it would he would probably have to go to prison or else hang himself  wont it be rather hard upon him  i think it will i dont know what it is that makes the governor so hard to him i begged and prayed for another hundred a year as though he were the dearest friend i had in the world but i couldnt turn the governor an inch i dont think i ever disliked any one so much in the world as i do mr greenwood  not mr crocker she asked  poor crocker i love crocker in comparison there is a delightful pachydermatousness about crocker which is almost heroic but i hate mr greenwood if it be in my nature to hate any one it is not only that he insults me but he looks at me as though he would take me by the throat and strangle me if he could but still i will add the other hundred a year out of my own pocket because i think he is being treated hardly only i must do it on the sly  but lady kingsbury is still fond of him  i rather think not i fancy he has made himself too free with her and has offended her however there he is shut up all alone and swearing that he wont stir out of the house till something better is done for him  there were two matters now on lord hampsteads mind to which he gave his attention the latter of which however was much the more prominent in his thoughts he was anxious to take his sister down to gorse hall and there remain for the rest of the hunting season making such short runs up to holloway as he might from time to time find to be necessary no man can have a string of hunters idle through the winter without feeling himself to be guilty of an unpardonable waste of property a customer at an eatinghouse will sometimes be seen to devour the last fragments of what has been brought to him because he does not like to abandon that for which he must pay so it is with the man who hunts it is not perhaps that he wants to hunt there are other employments in life which would at the moment be more to his taste it is his conscience which prompts himthe feeling that he cannot forgive himself for intolerable extravagance if he does not use the articles with which he has provided himself you can neglect your billiardtable your books or even your winecellarbecause they eat nothing but your horses soon eat their heads off their own shoulders if you pass weeks without getting on their backs hampstead had endeavoured to mitigate for himself this feeling of improvidence by running up and down to aylesbury but the saving in this respect was not sufficient for his conscience and he was therefore determined to balance the expenditure of the year by a regular performance of his duties at gorse hall but the other matter was still more important to him he must see marion fay before he went into northamptonshire and then he would learn how soon he might run up with the prospect of seeing her again the distance of gorse hall and the duty of hunting would admit of certain visits to holloway i think i shall go to gorse hall tomorrow he said to his sister as soon as he had come down from his room  all right i shall be ready hendon hall or gorse hallor any other hall will be the same to me now whereby she probably intended to signify that as george roden was on his way to italy all parts of england were indifferent to her  but i am not quite certain said he  what makes the doubt  holloway you know has not been altogether deserted the sun no doubt has set in paradise row but the moon remains at this she could only laugh while he prepared himself for his excursion to holloway  he had received the quakers permission to push his suit with marion but he did not flatter himself that this would avail him much he felt that there was a strength in marion which as it would have made her strong against her father had she given away her heart without his sanction so would it be but little moved by any permission coming from him and there was present to the lovers mind a feeling of fear which had been generated by the quakers words as to marions health till he had heard something of that story of the mother and her little ones it had not occurred to him that the girl herself was wanting in any gift of physical wellbeing she was beautiful in his eyes and he had thought of nothing further now an idea had been put into his head which though he could hardly realize it was most painful to him he had puzzled himself before her manner to him had been so soft so tender so almost loving that he could not but hope could hardly not think that she loved him that loving him she should persist in refusing him because of her condition of life seemed to him to be unnatural he had at any rate been confident that were there nothing else he could overcome that objection her heart if it were really given to him would not be able to support itself in its opposition to him upon such a ground of severance as that he thought that he could talk her out of so absurd an argument but in that other argument there might be something that she would cling to with persistency  but the quaker himself had declared that there was nothing in it as far as i know the quaker had said she is as fit to become a mans wife as any other girl he surely must have known had there been any real cause girls are so apt to take fancies into their heads and then will sometimes become so obstinate in their fancies in this way hampstead discussed the matter with himself and had been discussing it ever since he had walked up and down broad street with the quaker but if she pleaded her health he had what her own father had said to use as an argument with which to convince her if she spoke again of his rank he thought that on that matter his love might be strong enough as an argument against heror perhaps her own  he found no trouble in making his way into her presence she had heard of his visit to kings court and knew that he would come she had three things which she had to tell him and she would tell them all very plainly if all should be necessary the first was that love must have nothing to do in this matterbut only duty the second which she feared to be somewhat weakwhich she almost thought would not of itself have been strong enoughwas that objection as to her condition in life which she had urged to him before she declared to herself that it would be strong enough both for him and for her if they would only guide themselves by prudence but the thirdthat should be a rock to her if it were necessary a cruel rock on which she must be shipwrecked but against which his bark should surely not be dashed to atoms if he would not leave her in peace without it she would tell him that she was fit to be no mans wife  if it came to that then she must confess her own love she acknowledged to herself that it must be so there could not be between them the tenderness necessary for the telling of such a tale without love without acknowledged love it would be better that it should not be so if he would go and leave her to dream of himthere might be a satisfaction even in that to sustain her during what was left to her of life she would struggle that it should be so but if his love were too strong then must he know it all she had learned from her father something of what had passed at that interview in the city and was therefore ready to receive her lover when he came marion he said you expected me to come to you again  certainly i did  of course i have come i have had to go to my father or i should have been here sooner you know that i shall come again and again till you will say a word to me that shall comfort me  i knew that you would come again because you were with father in the city  i went to ask his leaveand i got it  it was hardly necessary for you my lord to take that trouble  but i thought it was when a man wishes to take a girl away from her own home and make her the mistress of his it is customary that he shall ask for her fathers permission  it would have been so had you looked higheras you should have done  it was so in regard to any girl that i should wish to make my wife whatever respect a man can pay to any woman that is due to my marion she looked at him and with the glance of her eye went all the love of her heart how could she say those words to him full of reason and prudence and wisdom if he spoke to her like this answer me honestly do you not know that if you were the daughter of the proudest lord living in england you would not be held by me as deserving other usage than that which i think to be your privilege now  i only meant that father could not but feel that you were honouring him  i will not speak of honour as between him and me or between me and you with me and your father honesty was concerned he has believed me and has accepted me as his soninlaw with us marion with us two all alone as we are here together all in all to each other as i hope we are to be only love can be brought in question marion marion then he threw himself on his knees before her and embraced her as she was sitting  no my lord no it must not be but now he had both her hands in his and was looking into her face now was the time to speak of dutyand to speak with some strength if what she might say was to have any avail  it shall not be so my lord then she did regain her hands and struggled up from the sofa on to her feet i too believe in your honesty i am sure of it as i am of my own but you do not understand me think of me as though i were your sister  as my sister  what would you have your sister do if a man came to her then whom she knew that she could never marry would you have her submit to his embrace because she knew him to be honest  not unless she loved him  it would have nothing to do with it lord hampstead  nothing marion  nothing my lord you will think that i am giving myself airs if i speak of my duty  your father has allowed me to come  i owe him duty no doubt had he bade me never to see you i hope that that would have sufficed but there are other duties than thata duty even higher than that  what duty marion  that which i owe to you if i had promised to be your wife  do promise it  had i so promised should i not then have been bound to think first of your happiness  you would have accomplished it at any rate  though i cannot be your wife i do not owe it you the less to think of itseeing all that you are willing to do for meand i will think of it i am grateful to you  do you love me  let me speak lord hampstead it is not civil in you to interrupt me in that way i am thoroughly grateful and i will not show my gratitude by doing that which i know would ruin you  do you love me  not if i loved you with all my heart and she spread out her arms as though to assure herself how she did love him with all her very soulwould i for that be brought even to think of doing the thing that you ask me  marion  nono we are utterly unfit for each other she had made her first declaration as to duty and now she was going on as to that second profession which she intended should be if possible the last you are as high as blood and wealth and great friends can make you i am nothing you have called me a lady  if god ever made one you are she  he has made me better he has made me a woman but others would not call me a lady i cannot talk as they do sit as they do act as they doeven think as they do i know myself and i will not presume to make myself the wife of such a man as you as she said this there came a flush across her face and a fire in her eye and as though conquered by her own emotion she sank again upon the sofa  do you love me marion  i do she said standing once more erect upon her feet there shall be no shadow of a lie between us i do love you lord hampstead i will have nothing to make me blush in my own esteem when i think of you how should it be other than that a girl such as i should love such a one as you when you ask me with words so sweet  then marion you shall be my own  oh yes i must now be yourswhile i am alive you have so far conquered me as he attempted to take her in his arms she retreated from him but so gently that her very gentleness repressed him if never loving another is to be yoursif to pray for you night and day as the dearest one of all is to be yoursif to remind myself every hour that all my thoughts are due to you if to think of you so that i may console myself with knowing that one so high and so good has condescended to regard meif that is to be yoursthen i am yours then shall i surely be yours while i live but it must be only with my thoughts only with my prayers only with all my heart  marion marion now again he was on his knees before her but hardly touching her  it is your fault lord hampstead she said trying to smile all this is your doing because you would not let a poor girl say simply what she had to say  nothing of it shall be trueexcept that you love me that is all that i can remember that i will repeat to you daily till you have put your hand in mine and call yourself my wife  that i will never do she exclaimed once again standing as god hears me now i will never say it it would be wrongand i will never say it in thus protesting she put forth her little hands clenched fast and then came again the flush across her brow and her eyes for a moment seemed to wander and then failing in strength to carry her through it all she fell back senseless on the sofa  lord hampstead finding that he alone could do nothing to aid her was forced to ring the bell and to give her over to the care of the woman who did not cease to pray him to depart i cant do nothing my lord while you stand over her that way     chapter xvii  at gorse hall   hampstead when he was turned out into paradise row walked once or twice up the street thinking what he might best do next regardless of the eyes at no 10 and no 15knowing that no 11 was absent where alone he could have found assistance had the inhabitant been there as far as he could remember he had never seen a woman faint before the way in which she had fallen through from his arms on to the sofa when he had tried to sustain her had been dreadful to him and almost more dreadful the idea that the stout old woman with whom he had left her should be more powerful than he to help her he walked once or twice up and down thinking what he had best now do while clara demijohn was lost in wonder as to what could have happened at no 17 it was quite intelligible to her that the lover should come in the fathers absence and be entertainedfor a whole afternoon if it might be so though she was scandalized by the audacity of the girl who had required no screen of darkness under the protection of which her lovers presence might be hidden from the inquiries of neighbours all that however would have been intelligible there is so much honour in having a lord to court one that perhaps it is well to have him seen but why was the lord walking up and down the street with that demented air  it was now four oclock and hampstead had heard the quaker say that he never left his office till five it would take him nearly an hour to come down in an omnibus from the city nevertheless hampstead could not go till he had spoken to marions father there was the duchess of edinburgh and he could no doubt find shelter there but to get through two hours at the duchess of edinburgh would he thought be beyond his powers to consume the time with walking might be better he started off therefore and tramped along the road till he came nearly to finchley and then back again it was dark as he returned and he fancied that he could wait about without being perceived there he is again said clara who had in the mean time gone over to mrs duffer what can it all mean  its my belief hes quarrelled with her said mrs duffer  then hed never wander about the place in that way theres old zachary just come round the corner now we shall see what he does  fainted has she said zachary as they walked together up to the house i never knew my girl do that before some of them can faint just as they please but thats not the way with marion hampstead protested that there had been no affectation on this occasion that marion had been so ill as to frighten him and that though he had gone out of the house at the womans bidding he had found it impossible to leave the neighbourhood till he should have learnt something as to her condition thou shalt hear all i can tell thee my friend said the quaker as they entered the house together  hampstead was shown into the little parlour while the quaker went up to inquire after the state of his daughter no thou canst not well see her said he returning as she has taken herself to her bed that she should have been excited by what passed between you is no more than natural i cannot tell thee now when thou mayst come again but i will write thee word from my office tomorrow upon this lord hampstead would have promised to call himself at kings court on the next day had not the quaker declared himself in favour of writing rather than of speaking the post he said was very punctual and on the next evening his lordship would certainly receive tidings as to marion  of course i cannot say what we can do about gorse hall till i hear from mr fay said hampstead to his sister when he reached home everything must depend on marion fay that his sister should have packed all her things in vain seemed to him to be nothing while marions health was in question but when the quakers letter arrived the matter was at once settled they would start for gorse hall on the following day the quakers letter having been as follows      my lord     i trust i may be justified in telling thee that there is    not much to ail my girl she was up today and about    the house before i left her and assured me with many    protestations that i need not take any special steps for    her comfort or recovery nor indeed could i see in her    face anything which could cause me to do so of course i    mentioned thy name to her and it was natural that the    colour should come and go over her cheeks as i did so i    think she partly told me what had passed between you two    but only in part as to the future when i spoke of it    she told me that there was no need of any arrangement as    everything had been said that needed speech but i guess    that such is not thy reading of the matter and that after    what has passed between thee and me i am bound to offer to    thee an opportunity of seeing her again shouldst thou wish    to do so but this must not be at once it will certainly    be better for her and may be for thee also that she    should rest awhile before she be again asked to see thee    i would suggest therefore that thou shouldst leave    her to her own thoughts for some weeks to come if thou    willst write to me and name a day some time early in    march i will endeavour to bring her round so far as to see    thee when thou comest     i am my lord    thy very faithful friend     zachary fay   it cannot be said that lord hampstead was by any means satisfied with the arrangement which had been made for him but he was forced to acknowledge to himself that he could not do better than accede to it he could of course write to the quaker and write also to marion but he could not well show himself in paradise row before the time fixed unless unexpected circumstances should arise he did send three loving words to marionhis own own dearest marion and sent them under cover to her father to whom he wrote saying that he would be guided by the quakers counsels i will write to you on the first of march he said but i do trust that if in the mean time anything should happenif for instance marion should be illyou will tell me at once as being one as much concerned in her health as you are yourself  he was nervous and illatease but not thoroughly unhappy she had told him how dear he was to her and he would not have been a man had he not been gratified and there had been no word of objection raised on any matter beyond that one absurd objection as to which he thought himself entitled to demand that his wishes should be allowed to prevail she had been very determined how absolutely determined he was not probably himself aware she had however made him understand that her conviction was very strong but this had been as to a point on which he did not doubt that he was right and as to which her own father was altogether on his side after hearing the strong protestation of her affection he could not think that she would be finally obdurate when the reasons for her obduracy were so utterly valueless but still there were vague fears about her health why had she fainted and fallen through his arms whence had come that peculiar brightness of complexion which would have charmed him had it not frightened him a dim dread of something that was not intelligible to him pervaded him and robbed him of a portion of the triumph which had come to him from her avowal                                          as the days went on at gorse hall his triumph became stronger than his fears and the time did not pass unpleasantly with him young lord hautboy came to hunt with him bringing his sister lady amaldina and after a few days vivian found them the conduct of lady frances in reference to george roden was no doubt very much blamed but the disgrace did not loom so large in the eyes of lady persiflage as in those of her sister the marchioness amaldina was therefore suffered to amuse herself even as the guest of her wicked friendeven though the host were himself nearly equally wicked it suited young hautboy very well to have free stables for his horses and occasionally an extra mount when his own two steeds were insufficient for the necessary amount of hunting to be performed vivian who had the liberal allowance of a private secretary to a cabinet minister to fall back upon had three horses of his own so that among them they got a great deal of huntingin which lady amaldina would have taken a conspicuous part had not lord llwddythlw entertained strong opinions as to the expediency of ladies riding to hounds he is so absurdly strict you know she said to lady frances  i think he is quite right said the other i dont believe in girls trying to do all the things that men do  but what is the difference in jumping just over a hedge or two i call it downright tyranny would you do anything mr roden told you  anything on earthexcept jump over the hedges but our temptations are not likely to be in that way  i think it very hard because i almost never see llwddythlw  but you will when you are married  i dont believe i shallunless i go and look at him from behind the grating in the house of commons you know we have settled upon august  i had not heard it  oh yes i nailed him at last but then i had to get david you dont know david  no special modern david  our david is not very modern he is lord david powell and my brother that is to be i had to persuade him to do something instead of his brother and i had to swear that we couldnt ever be married unless he would consent i suppose mr roden could get married any day he pleased nevertheless lady amaldina was better than nobody to make the hours pass when the men are away hunting  but at last there came a grand day on which the man of business was to come out hunting himself lord llwddythlw had come into the neighbourhood and was determined to have a days pleasure gorse hall was full and hautboy though his sister was very eager in beseeching him refused to give way to his future magnificent brotherinlaw do him all the good in the world said hautboy to put up at the pothouse hell find out all about whiskey and beer and gin and know exactly how many beds the landlady makes up lord llwddythlw therefore slept at a neighbouring hotel and no doubt did turn his spare moments to some profit  lord llwddythlw was a man who had always horses though he very rarely hunted who had guns though he never fired them and fishingrods though nobody knew where they were he kept up a great establishment regretting nothing in regard to it except the necessity of being sometimes present at the festivities for which it was used on the present occasion he had been enticed into northamptonshire no doubt with the purpose of laying some first bricks or opening some completed institution or eating some dinneron any one of which occasions he would be able to tell the neighbours something as to the constitution of their country then the presence of his ladylove seemed to make this a fitting occasion for perhaps the one days sport of the year he came to gorse hall to breakfast and then rode to the meet along with the open carriage in which the two ladies were sitting llwddythlw said his ladylove i do hope you mean to ride  being on horseback amy i shall have no other alternative  lady amaldina turned round to her friend as though to ask whether she had ever seen such an absurd creature in her life you know what i mean by riding llwddythlw she said  i suppose i do you want me to break my neck  oh heavens indeed i dont  or perhaps only to see me in a ditch  i cant have that pleasure she said because you wont allow me to hunt  i have taken upon myself no such liberty as even to ask you not to do so i have only suggested that tumbling into ditches however salutary it may be for middleaged gentlemen like myself is not a becoming amusement for young ladies  llwddythlw said hautboy coming up to his future brotherinlaw thats a tidy animal of yours  i dont quite know what tidy means as applied to a horse my boy but if its complimentary i am much obliged to you  it means that i should like to have the riding of him for the rest of the season  but what shall i do for myself if you take my tidy horse  youll be up in parliament or down at quarter sessions or doing your duty somewhere like a briton  i hope i may do my duty not the less because i intend to keep the tidy horse myself when i am quite sure that i shall not want him any more then ill let you know  there was the usual trotting about from covert to covert and the usual absence of foxes the misery of sportsmen on these days is sometimes so great that we wonder that any man having experienced the bitterness of hunting disappointment should ever go out again on such occasions the huntsman is declared among private friends to be of no use whatever the master is an absolute muff all honour as to preserving has been banished from the country the gamekeepers destroy the foxes the owners of coverts encourage them things have come to such a pass says walker to watson that i mean to give it up theres no good keeping horses for this sort of thing all this is very sad and the only consolation comes from the evident delight of those who take pleasure in trotting about without having to incur the labour and peril of riding to hounds  at two oclock on this day the ladies went home having been driven about as long as the coachmen had thought it good for their horses the men of course went on knowing that they could not in honour liberate themselves from the toil of the day till the last covert shall have been drawn at halfpast three oclock it is certainly true as to hunting that there are so many hours in which the spirit is vexed by a sense of failure that the joy when it does come should be very great to compensate the evils endured it is not simply that foxes will not dwell in every spinney or break as soon as found or always run when they do break these are the minor pangs but when the fox is found and will break and does run when the scent suffices and the hounds do their duty when the best country which the shires afford is open to you when your best horse is under you when your nerves are even somewhat above the usual markeven then there is so much of failure you are on the wrong side of the wood and getting a bad start are never with them for a yard or your horse good as he is wont have that bit of water or you lose your stirrupleather or your way or you dont see the hounds turn and you go astray with others as blind as yourself or perhaps when there comes the run of the season on that very day you have taken a liberty with your chosen employment and have lain in bed look back upon your hunting lives brother sportsmen and think how few and how far between the perfect days have been  in spite of all that was gone this was one of those perfect days to those who had the pleasure afterwards of remembering it taking it all in all i think that lord llwddythlw had the best of it from first to last said vivian when they were again talking of it in the drawingroom after they had come in from their wine  to think that you should be such a hero said lady amaldina much gratified i didnt believe you would take so much trouble about such a thing  it was what hautboy called the tidiness of the horse  by george yes i wish youd lend him to me i got my brute in between two rails and it took me halfanhour to smash a way through i never saw anything of it after that poor hautboy almost cried as he gave this account of his own misfortune  you were the only fellow i saw try them after crasher said vivian crasher came on his head and i should think he must be there still i dont know where hampstead got through  i never know where ive been said hampstead who had in truth led the way over the double rails which had so confounded crasher and had so perplexed hautboy but when a man is too forward to be seen he is always supposed to be somewhere behind  then there was an opinion expressed by walker that tolleyboy the huntsman had on that special occasion stuck very well to his hounds to which watson gave his cordial assent walker and watson had both been asked to dinner and during the day had been heard to express to each other all that adverse criticism as to the affairs of the hunt in general which appeared a few lines back walker and watson were very good fellows popular in the hunt and of all men the most unlikely to give it up  when that run was talked about afterwards as it often was it was always admitted that lord llwddythlw had been the hero of the day but no one ever heard him talk of it such a trifle was altogether beneath his notice     chapter xviii  poor walker   that famous run took place towards the end of february at which time hampstead was counting all the hours till he should again be allowed to show himself in paradise row he had in the mean time written one little letter to the quakers daughter      dearest marioni only write because i cannot keep myself    quiet without telling you how well i love you pray do not    believe that because i am away i think of you less i am    to see you i hope on monday the 2nd of march if you    would write me but one word to say that you will be glad    to see me     always your own     h   she showed this to her father and the sly old quaker told her that it would not be courteous in her not to send some word of reply as the young lord he said had been permitted by him her father to pay his addresses to her so much was due to him why should his girl lose this grand match why should his daughter not become a happy and a glorious wife seeing that her beauty and her grace had entirely won this young lords heart my lord she wrote back to himi shall be happy to see you when you come whatever day may suit you but alas i can only say what i have saidyet i am thine marion she had intended not to be tender and yet she had thought herself bound to tell him that all that she had said before was true  it was after this that lord llwddythlw distinguished himself so much so that walker and watson did nothing but talk about him all the next day its those quiet fellows that make the best finish after all said walker who had managed to get altogether to the bottom of his horse during the run and had hardly seen the end of it quite as a man wishes to see it  the day but one after this the last friday in february was to be the last of hampsteads hunting at any rate until after his proposed visit to holloway he and lady frances with him intended to return to london on the next day and then as far as he was concerned the future loomed before him as a great doubt had marion been the highest lady in the land and had he from his position and rank been hardly entitled to ask for her love he could not have been more anxious more thoughtful or occasionally more downhearted but this latter feeling would give way to joy when he remembered the words with which she had declared her love no assurance could have been more perfect or more devoted she had coyed him nothing as far as words are concerned and he never for a moment doubted but that her full words had come from a full heart but alas i can only say what i have said that of course had been intended to remove all hope but if she loved him as she said she did would he not be able to teach her that everything should be made to give way to love it was thus that his mind was filled as day after day he prepared himself for his hunting and day after day did his best in keeping to the hounds  then came that last day in february as to which all those around him expressed themselves to be full of hope gimberley green was certainly the most popular meet in the country and at gimberley green the hounds were to meet on this occasion it was known that men were coming from the pytchley and the cottesmore so that everybody was supposed to be anxious to do his best hautboy was very much on the alert and had succeeded in borrowing for the occasion hampsteads best horse even vivian who was not given to much outward enthusiasm had had consultations with his groom as to which of two he had better ride first sometimes there does come a day on which rivalry seems to be especially keen when a sense of striving to excel and going ahead of others seems to instigate minds which are not always ambitious watson and walker were on this occasion very much exercised and had in the sweet confidences of close friendship agreed with themselves that certain heroes who were coming from one of the neighbouring hunts should not be allowed to carry off the honours of the day  on this occasion they both breakfasted at gorse hall which was not uncommon with them as the hotelor pothouse as hautboy called itwas hardly more than a hundred yards distant walker was peculiarly exuberant and had not been long in the house before he confided to hautboy in a whisper their joint intention that those fellows were not to be allowed to have it all their own way suppose you dont find after all mr walker said lady amaldina as the gentlemen got up from breakfast and loaded themselves with sandwiches cigarcases and sherryflasks  i wont believe anything so horrible said walker  i should cut the concern said watson and take to stagging in surrey this was supposed to be the bitterest piece of satire that could be uttered in regard to the halcyon country in which their operations were carried on  tolleyboy will see to that said walker we havent had a blank yet and i dont think hell disgrace himself on such a day as this then they all started in great glee on their hacks their hunters having been already sent on to gimberley green  the main part of the story of that days sport as far as were concerned with it got itself told so early in the day that readers need not be kept long waiting for the details tolleyboy soon relieved these imperious riders from all dangers as to a blank at the first covert drawn a fox was found immediately and without any of those delays so perplexing to some and so comforting to others made away for some distant home of his own it is perhaps on such occasions as these that riders are subjected to the worst perils of the hunting field there comes a sudden rush when men have not cooled themselves down by the process of riding here and there and going through the usual preliminary prefaces to a run they are collected in crowds and the horses are more impatient even than their riders no one on that occasion could have been more impatient than walkerunless it was the steed upon which walker was mounted there was a crowd of men standing in a lane at the corner of the covertof men who had only that moment reached the spotwhen at about thirty yards from them a fox crossed the lane and two or three leading hounds close at his brush one or two of the strangers from the enemys country occupied a position close to or rather in the very entrance of a little hunting gate which led out of the lane into the field opposite between the lane and the field there was a fence which was not rideable as is the custom with lanes the roadway had been so cut down that there was a bank altogether precipitous about three feet high and on that a hedge of trees and stakes and roots which had also been cut almost into the consistency of a wall the gate was the only placeinto which these enemies had thrust themselves and in the possession of which they did not choose to hurry themselves asserting as they kept their places that it would be well to give the fox a minute the assertion in the interests of hunting might have been true a sportsman who could at such a moment have kept his blood perfectly cool might have remembered his duties well enough to have abstained from pressing into the field in order that the fox might have his fair chance hampstead however who was next to the enemies was not that cool hero and bade the strangers move on not failing to thrust his horse against their horses next to him and a little to the left was the unfortunate walker to his patriotic spirit it was intolerable that any stranger should be in that field before one of their own hunt what he himself attempted what he wished to do or whether any clear intention was formed in his mind no one ever knew but to the astonishment of all who saw it the horse got himself halfturned round towards the fence and attempted to take it in a stand the eager animal did get himself up amidst the thick wood on the top of the bank and then fell headlong over having entangled his feet among the boughs had his rider sat loosely he would probably have got clear of his horse but as it was they came down together and unfortunately the horse was uppermost just as it happened lord hampstead made his way through the gate and was the first who dismounted to give assistance to his friend in two or three minutes there was a crowd round with a doctor in the midst of it and a rumour was going about that the man had been killed in the mean time the enemies were riding well to the hounds with tolleyboy but a few yards behind them tolleyboy having judiciously remembered a spot at which he could make his way out of the covert into field without either passing through the gate or over the fence  the reader may as well know at once that walker was not killed he was not killed though he was so crushed and mauled with broken ribs and collarbone so knocked out of breath and stunned and mangled and squeezed so pummelled and pounded and generally misused that he did not come to himself for many hours and could never after remember anything of that days performances after eating his breakfast at gorse hall it was a week before tidings went through the shires that he was likely to live at all and even then it was asserted that he had been so altogether smashed that he would never again use any of his limbs on the morning after the hunt his widowed mother and only sister were down with him at the hotel and there they remained till they were able to carry him away to his own house wont i was almost the first intelligible word he said when his mother suggested to him her only son that now at least he would promise to abandon that desperate amusement and would never go hunting any more it may be said in praise of british surgery generally that walker was out again on the first of the following november  but walker with his misfortunes and his heroism and his recovery would have been nothing to us had it been known from the first to all the field that walker had been the victim the accident happened between eleven and twelveprobably not much before twelve but the tidings of it were sent up by telegraph from some neighbouring station to london in time to be inserted in one of the afternoon newspapers of that day and the tidings as sent informed the public that lord hampstead while hunting that morning had fallen with his horse at the corner of gimberly green that the animal had fallen on himand that he had been crushed to death had the false information been given in regard to walker it might probably have excited so little attention that the world would have known nothing about it till it learned that the poor fellow had not been killed but having been given as to a young nobleman everybody had heard of it before dinnertime that evening lord persiflage knew it in the house of lords and lord llwddythlw had heard it in the house of commons there was not a club which had not declared poor hampstead to be an excellent fellow although he was a little mad the montressors had already congratulated themselves on the good fortune of little lord frederic and the speedy death of the marquis was prophesied as men and women were quite sure that he would not be able in his present condition to bear the loss of his eldest son the news was telegraphed down to trafford park by the family lawyerwith an intimation however that as the accident had been so recent no absolute credence should yet be given as to its fatal result bad fall probably said the lawyer in his telegram but i dont believe the rest will send again when i hear the truth at nine oclock that evening the truth was known in london and before midnight the poor marquis had been relieved from his terrible affliction but for three hours it had been supposed at trafford park that lord frederic had become the heir to his fathers title and his fathers property  close inquiry was afterwards made as to the person by whom this false intelligence had been sent to the newspaper but nothing certain was ever asserted respecting it that a general rumour had prevailed for a time among many who were out that lord hampstead had been the victim was found to have been the case he had been congratulated by scores of men who had heard that he had fallen when tolleyboy was breaking up the fox and wondering why so few men had ridden through the hunt with him he was told that lord hampstead had been killed and had dropped his bloody knife out of his hands but no one would own as to having sent the telegram suspicion attached itself to an attorney from kettering who had been seen in the early part of the day but it could not be traced home to him official inquiry was made but as it was not known who sent the message or to what address or from what post town or even the wording of the message official information was not forthcoming it is probable that sir boreas at the post office did not think it proper to tell everybody all that he knew it was admitted that a great injury had been done to the poor marquis but it was argued on the other side that the injury had been quickly removed  there had however been three or four hours at trafford park during which feelings had been excited which afterwards gave rise to bitter disappointment the message had come to mr greenwood of whose estrangement from the family the london solicitor had not been as yet made aware he had been forced to send the tidings into the sick mans room by harris the butler but he had himself carried it up to the marchioness i am obliged to come he said as though apologizing when she looked at him with angry eyes because of his intrusion there has been an accident he was standing as he always stood with his hands hanging down by his side but there was a painful look in his eyes more than she had usually read there  what accidentwhat accident mr greenwood why do you not tell me her heart ran away at once to the little beds in which her darlings were already lying in the next room  it is a telegram from london  from londona telegram then her boys were safe why do you not tell me instead of standing there  lord hampstead  lord hampstead what has he done is he married  he will never be married then she shook in every limb and clenched her hands and stood with open mouth not daring to question him he has had a fall lady kingsbury  a fall  the horse has crushed him  crushed him  i used to say it would be so you know and now it has come to pass  is he  dead yes lady kingsbury he isdead then he gave her the telegram to read she struggled to read it but the words were too vague or her eyes too dim harris has gone in with the tidings i had better read the telegram i suppose but i thought youd like to see it i told you how it would be lady kingsbury and now it has come to pass he stood standing a minute or two longer but as she sat hiding her face and unable to speak he left the room without absolutely asking her to thank him for his news  as soon as he was gone she crept slowly into the room in which her three boys were sleeping a door from her own chamber opened into it and then another into that in which one of the nurses slept she leaned over them and kissed them all but she knelt at that on which lord frederic lay and woke him with her warm embraces oh mamma dont said the boy then he shook himself and sat up in his bed mamma when is jack coming he said let her train them as she would they would always ask for jack go to sleep my darling my darling my darling she said kissing him again and again trafford she said whispering to herself as she went back to her own room trying the sound of the title he would have to use it had been all arranged in her own mind how it was to be if such a thing should happen  go down she said to her maid soon afterwards and ask mrs crawley whether his lordship would wish to see me mrs crawley was the nurse but the maid brought back word that my lord did not wish to see my lady for three hours he lay stupefied in his sorrow and for three hours she sat alone almost in the dark we may doubt whether it was all triumph her darling had got what she believed to be his due but the memory that she had longed for italmost prayed for itmust have dulled her joy  there was no such regret with mr greenwood it seemed to him that fortune fate providence or what not had only done its duty he believed that he had in truth foreseen and foretold the death of the pernicious young man but would the young mans death be now of any service to him was it not too late had they not all quarrelled with him nevertheless he had been avenged  so it was at trafford park for three hours then there came a postboy galloping on horseback and the truth was known lady kingsbury went again to her children but this time she did not kiss them a gleam of glory had come there and had passed awaybut yet there was something of relief  why had he allowed himself to be so cowed on that morning that was mr greenwoods thought  the poor marquis fell into a slumber almost immediately and on the next morning had almost forgotten that the first telegram had come     chapter xix  false tidings   but there was another household which the false tidings of lord hampsteads death reached that same night the feelings excited at trafford had been very keenparental agony maternal hope disappointment and revenge but in that other household there was suffering quite as great mr fay himself did not devote much time during the day either to the morning or the evening newspapers had he been alone at messrs pogson and littlebirds he would have heard nothing of the false tidings but sitting in his inner room mr pogson read the third edition of the evening advertiser and then saw the statement given with many details we said the statement have sent over to the office of our contemporary and have corroborated the facts then the story was repeated pushing his way through a gate at gimberley green lord hampsteads horse had tumbled down and all the field had ridden over him he had been picked up dead and his body had been carried home to gorse hall now lord hampsteads name had become familiar in kings court tribbledale had told how the young lord had become enamoured of zachary fays daughter and was ready to marry her at a moments notice the tale had been repeated to old littlebird by young littlebird and at last even to mr pogson himself there had been of course much doubt in kings court as to the very improbable story but some inquiries had been made and there was now a general belief in its truth when mr pogson read the account of the sad tragedy he paused a moment to think what he would do then opened his door and called for zachary fay they who had known the quaker long always called him zachary or friend zachary or zachary fay my friend said mr pogson have you read this yet and he handed him the paper  i never have much time for the newspaper till i get home at night said the clerk taking the sheet that was offered him  you had better read it perhaps as i have heard your name mentioned i know not how properly with that of the young lord then the quaker bringing his spectacles down from his forehead over his eyes slowly read the paragraph as he did so mr pogson looked at him carefully but the quaker showed very little emotion by his face does it concern you zachary  i know the young man mr pogson though he be much out of my own rank circumstances have brought him to my notice i shall be grieved if this be true with thy permission mr pogson i will lock up my desk and return home at once to this mr pogson of course assented recommending the quaker to put the newspaper into his pocket  zachary fay as he walked to the spot where he was wont to find the omnibus considered much as to what he might best do when he reached home should he tell the sad tidings to his girl or should he leave her to hear it when further time should have confirmed the truth to zachary himself it seemed too probable that it should be true hunting to him in his absolute ignorance of what hunting meant seemed to be an occupation so full of danger that the wonder was that the hunting world had not already been exterminated and then there was present to him a feeling as there is to so many of us that the grand thing which fortune seemed to offer him was too good to be true it could hardly be that he should live to see his daughter the mother of a future british peer he had tried to school himself not to wish it telling himself that such wishes were vain and such longings wicked he had said much to himself as to the dangers of rank and titles and wealth for those who were not born to them he had said something also of that family tragedy which had robbed his own life of most of its joys and which seemed to have laid so heavy a burden on his girls spirit going backwards and forwards morning and evening to his work he had endeavoured to make his own heart acknowledge that the marriage was not desirable but he had failedand had endeavoured to reconcile the failure to his conscience by telling himself falsely that he as a father had been anxious only for the welfare of his child now he felt the blow terribly on her account feeling sure that his girls heart had been given to the young man but he felt it also on his own it might be nevertheless that the report would prove untrue had the matter been one in which he was not himself so deeply interested he would certainly have believed it to be untrue he being a man by his nature not prone to easy belief it would however be wiser he said to himself as he left the omnibus at the duchess of edinburgh to say nothing as yet to marion then he put the paper carefully into his breast coat pocket and considered how he might best hide his feelings as to the sad news but all this was in vain the story had already found its way down to paradise row mrs demijohn was as greedy of news as her neighbours and would generally send round the corner for a halfpenny evening journal on this occasion she did so and within two minutes of the time in which the paper had been put into her hands exclaimed to her niece almost with ecstasy clara what do you think that young lord who comes here to see marion fay has gone and got himself killed out hunting  lord hampstead shouted clara got himself killed laws aunt i cant believe it in her tone also there was something almost of exultation the glory that had been supposed to be awaiting marion fay was almost too much for the endurance of any neighbour since it had become an ascertained fact that lord hampstead had admired the girl marions popularity in the row had certainly decreased mrs duffer believed her no longer to be handsome clara had always thought her to be pert mrs demijohn had expressed her opinion that the man was an idiot and the landlady at the duchess of edinburgh had wittily asserted that young marquises were not to be caught with chaff there was no doubt a sense of relief in clara demijohns mind when she heard that this special young marquis had been trampled to death in the hunting field and carried home a corpse  i must go and tell the poor girl said clara immediately  leave it alone said the old woman there will be plenty to tell her let alone you but such occasions occur so rarely that it does not do not to take advantage of them in ordinary life events are so unfrequent and when they do arrive they give such a flavour of salt to hours which are generally tedious that sudden misfortunes come as godsendsalmost even when they happen to ourselves even a funeral gives a tasteful break to the monotony of our usual occupations and smallpox in the next street is a gratifying excitement clara soon got possession of the newspaper and with it in her hand ran across the street to no 17 miss fay was at home and in a minute or two came down to miss demijohn in the parlour  it was only during the minute or two that clara began to think how she should break the tidings to her friend or in any way to realize the fact that the tidings would require breaking she had rushed across the street with the important paper in her hand proud of the fact that she had something great to tell but during that minute or two it did occur to her that a choice of words was needed for such an occasion oh miss fay she said have you heard  heard what asked marion  i do not know how to tell you it is so terrible i have only just seen it in the newspaper and have thought it best to run over and let you know  has anything happened to my father asked the girl  it isnt your father this is almost more dreadful because he is so young then that bright pink hue spread itself over marions face but she stood speechless with her features almost hardened by the resolution which she had already formed within her not to betray the feelings of her heart before this other girl the news let it be what it might must be of him there was no one else so young of whom it was probable that this young woman would speak to her after this fashion she stood silent motionless conveying nothing of her feelings by her faceunless one might have read something from the deep flush of her complexion i dont know how to say it said clara demijohn there you had better take the paper and read for yourself its in the last column but one near the bottom fatal accident in the field youll see it  marion took the paper and read the words through without faltering or moving a limb why would not the cruel young woman go and leave her to her sorrow why did she stand there looking at her as though desirous to probe to the bottom the sad secret of her bosom she kept her eyes still fixed upon the paper not knowing where else to turn themfor she would not look into her tormentors face for pity aint it sad said clara demijohn  then there came a deep sigh sad she said repeating the word sad yes its sad i think if you dont mind ill ask you to leave me now oh yes theres the newspaper  perhaps youd like to keep it for your father here marion shook her head then ill take it back to aunt shes hardly looked at it yet when she came to the paragraph of course she read it out and i wouldnt let her have any peace till she gave it me to bring over  i wish youd leave me said marion fay  then with a look of mingled surprise and anger she left the room and returned across the street to no 10 she doesnt seem to me to care a straw about it said the niece to her aunt but she got up just as highty tighty as usual and asked me to go away  when the quaker came to the door and opened it with his latchkey marion was in the passage ready to receive him till she had heard the sound of the lock she had not moved from the room hardly from the position in which the other girl had left her she had sunk into a chair which had been ready for her and there she had remained thinking over it father she said laying her hand upon his arm as she went to meet him and looking up into his facefather  my child  have you heard any tidings in the city  have you heard any marion  is it true then she said seizing both his arms as though to support her  who knows who can say that it be true till further tidings shall come come in marion it is not well that we should discuss it here  is it true oh fatheroh father it will kill me  nay marion not that after all the lad was little more than a stranger to thee  a stranger  how many weeks is it since first thou sawst him and how often but two or three times i am sorry for himif it be true if it be true i liked him well  but i have loved him  nay marion nay thou shouldst moderate thyself  i will not moderate myself then she disengaged herself from his arm i loved himwith all my heart and all my strength nay with my whole soul if it be so as that paper says then i must die too oh father is it true think you  he paused a while before he answered examining himself what it might be best that he should say as to her welfare as for himself he hardly knew what he believed these papers were always in search of paragraphs and would put in the false and true alikethe false perhaps the sooner so as to please the taste of their readers but if it were true then how bad would it be to give her false hopes there need be no ground to despair he said till we shall hear again in the morning  i know he is dead  not so marion thou canst know nothing if thou wilt bear thyself like a stronghearted girl as thou art i will do this for thee i will go across to the young lords house at hendon at once and inquire there as to his safety they will surely know if aught of ill has happened to their master  so it was done the poor old man after his long days labour without waiting for his evening meal taking only a crust with him in his pocket got into a cab on that cold november evening and had himself driven by suburban streets and lanes to hendon hall here the servants were much surprised and startled by the inquiries made they had heard nothing lord hampstead and his sister were expected home on the following day dinner was to be prepared for them and fires had already been lighted in the rooms dead killed out hunting trodden to death in the field not a word of it had reached hendon hall nevertheless the housekeeper when the paragraph was shown to her believed every word of it and the servants believed it thus the poor quaker returned home with but very little comfort  marions condition during that night was very sad though she struggled to bear up against her sorrow in compliance with her fathers instructions there was almost nothing said as she sat by him while he ate his supper on the next morning too she rose to give him his breakfast having fallen asleep through weariness a hundred times during the night to wake again within a minute or two to the full sense of her sorrow shall i know soon she said as he left the house  surely some one will know he said and i will send thee word  but as he left the house the real facts had already been made known at the duchess of edinburgh one of the morning papers had a full circumstantial and fairly true account of the whole matter it was not his lordship at all said the goodnatured landlady coming out to him as he passed the door  not lord hampstead  not at all  he was not killed  it wasnt him as was hurt mr fay it was another of them young menone mr walker only son of watson walker and warren and whether he be dead or alive nobody knows but they do say there wasnt a whole bone left in his body its all here and i was agoing to bring it you i suppose miss fay did take it badly  i knew the young man said the quaker hurrying back to his own house with the paperanxious if possible not to declare to the neighbourhood that the young lord was in truth a suitor for his daughters hand and i thank thee mrs grimley for thy care the suddenness of it all frightened my poor girl  thatll comfort her up said mrs grimley cheerily from all we hear mr fay she do have reason to be anxious for this young lord i hope hell be spared to her mr fay and show himself a true man  then the quaker returned with his newswhich was accepted by him and by them all as trustworthy now my girl will be happy again  yes father  but my child has told the truth to her old father at last  had i told you any untruth  no indeed marion  i said that i am not fit to be his wife and i am not nothing is changed in all that but when i heard that he was but father we will not talk of it now how good you have been to me i shall never forgetand how tender  who should be softhearted if not a father  they are not all like you but you have been always good and gentle to your girl how good and how gentle we cannot always seecan we but i have seen it now father  as he went into the city about an hour after his proper time he allowed his heart to rejoice at the future prospects of his girl he did now believe that there would be a marriage between her and her noble lover she had declared her love to himto him her father and after that she would surely do as they would have her something had reached even his ears of the coyness of girls and it was not displeasing to him that his girl had not been at once ready to give herself with her easy promise to her lover how strong she had looked even in the midst of her sufferings on the previous evening that she should be weaker this morning less able to restrain her tears more prone to tremble as he spoke to her was but natural the shock of the grief will often come after the sorrow is over he knew that and told himself that there need be nothingneed not at least be muchto fear  but it was not so with marion as she lay all the morning convulsed almost with the violence of her emotions her own weakness was palpable to herself as she struggled to regain her breath struggled to repress her sobs struggled to move about the house and be as might be any other girl better just lie thee down till thy father return and leave me to bustle through the work said the old quaker woman who had lived with them through all their troubles then marion yielded and laid herself on the bed till the hour had come in which her father might be expected     chapter xx  never never to come again   the trouble to hampstead occasioned by the accident was considerable as was also for the first twentyfour hours his anxiety and that of his sister as to the young mans fate he got back to gorse hall early in the day as there was no more hunting after the killing of that first fox there had been a consultation as to the young man and it had been held to be best to have him taken to the inn at which he had been living as there would be room there for any of his friends who might come to look after him but during the whole of that day inquiries were made at gorse hall after lord hampstead himself so general had been the belief that he was the victim from all the towns around from peterborough oundle stilton and thrapstone there came mounted messengers with expressions of hope and condolence as to the young lords broken bones  and then the condition of their poor neighbour was so critical that they found it to be impossible to leave gorse hall on the next day as they had intended he had become intimate with them and had breakfasted at gorse hall on that very morning in one way hampstead felt that he was responsible as had he not been in the way poor walkers horse would have been next to the gate and would not have attempted the impossible jump they were compelled to put off the journey till the monday will go by the 930 train said hampstead in his telegram who in spite of poor walkers mangled body was still determined to see marion on that day on the saturday morning it became known to him and his sister that the false report had been in the london newspapers and then they had found themselves compelled to send telegrams to every one who knew them to the marquis and to the lawyer in london to mr roberts and to the housekeeper at hendon hall telegrams were also sent by lady amaldina to lady persiflage and especially to lord llwddythlw vivian sent others to the civil service generally hautboy was very eager to let everybody know the truth at the pandemonium never before had so many telegrams been sent from the little office at gimberley but there was one for which hampstead demanded priority writing it himself and himself giving it into the hands of the despatching young lady the daughter of the gimberley grocer who no doubt understood the occasion perfectly      to marion fay 17 paradise row holloway     it was not i who was hurt shall be at no 17 by three on    monday   i wonder whether they heard it down at trafford said lady amaldina to lady frances on this subject they were informed before the day was over as a long message came from mr roberts in compliance with the instructions from the marquis because if they did what a terrible disappointment my aunt will have to bear  do not say anything so horrible said lady frances  i always look upon aunt clara as though she were not quite in her right senses about her own children she thinks a great injury is done her because her son is not the heir now for a moment she will have believed that it was so this however was a view of the matter which lady frances found herself unable to discuss  hes going to get well after all said hautboy that evening just before dinner he had been running over to the inn every hour to ask after the condition of poor walker at first the tidings had been gloomy enough the doctor had only been able to say that he neednt die because of his broken bones then late in the afternoon there arrived a surgeon from london who gave something of a stronger hope the young mans consciousness had come back to him and he had expressed an appreciation for brandy and water it was this fact which had seemed so promising to young lord hautboy on the saturday there came mrs walker and miss walker and before the sunday evening it was told how the patient had signified his intention of hunting again on the first possible opportunity i always knew he was a brick said hautboy as he repeated the story because he always would ride at everything  i dont think hell ever ride again at the fence just out of gimberley wood said lord hampstead they were all able to start on the monday morning without serious concern as the accounts from the injured mans bedroom were still satisfactory that he had broken three ribs a collarbone and an arm seemed to be accounted as nothing nor was there much made of the scalp wound on his head which had come from a kick the horse gave him in the struggle as his brains were still there that did not much matter his cheek had been cut open by a stake on which he fell but the scar it was thought would only add to his glories it was the pressure of the horse which had fallen across his body which the doctors feared but hautboy very rightly argued that there couldnt be much danger seeing that he had recovered his taste for brandy and water if it wasnt for that said hautboy i dont think id have gone away and left him  lord hampstead found when he reached home on the monday morning that his troubles were not yet over the housekeeper came out and wept almost with her arms round his neck the groom and the footman and the gardener even the cowboy himself flocked about him telling stories of the terrible condition in which they had been left after the coming of the quaker on the friday evening i didnt never think id ever see my lord again said the cook solemnly i didnt amost hope it said the housemaid after hearing the quaker gentleman read it all out of the newspaper lord hampstead shook hands with them all and laughed at the misfortune of the false telegram and endeavoured to be well pleased with everything but it occurred to him to think what must have been the condition of mr fays house that night when he had come across from holloway through the darkness and rain to find out for his girl what might be the truth or falsehood of the report which had reached him  at 30 punctually he was in paradise row perhaps it was not unnatural that even then his advent should create emotion as he turned down from the main road the very potboy from the duchess rushed up to him and congratulated him on his escape i have had nothing to escape said lord hampstead trying to pass on but mrs grimley saw him and came out to him oh my lord we are so thankfulindeed we are  you are very good maam said the lord  and now lord ampstead mind and be true to that dear young lady who was wellnigh heartbroke when she heard as it were you who was smashed up  he was hurrying on finding it impossible to make any reply to this when miss demijohn seeing that mrs grimley had been bold enough to address the noble visitor to their humble street remembering how much she had personally done in the matter having her mind full of the important fact that she had been the first to give information on the subject to the row generally thinking that no such appropriate occasion as this would ever again occur for making personal acquaintance with the lord rushed out from her own house and seized the young mans hand before he was able to defend himself my lord she said my lord we were all so depressed when we heard of it  were you indeed  all the row was depressed my lord but i was the first who knew it it was i who communicated the sad tidings to miss fay it was indeed my lord i saw it in the evening telltale and went across with the paper at once  that was very good of you  thankee my lord and therefore seeing you and knowing youfor we all know you now in paradise row  do you now  every one of us my lord therefore i thought id just make bold to come out and introduce myself heres mrs duffer i hope youll let me introduce you to mrs duffer of no 15 mrs duffer lord hampstead and oh my lord it will be such an honour to the row if anything of that kind should happen  lord hampstead having with his best grace gone through the ceremony of shaking hands with mrs duffer who had come up to him and clara just at the step of the quakers house was at last allowed to knock at the door miss fay would be with him in a minute said the old woman as she showed him into the sittingroom upstairs  marion as soon as she heard the knock ran for a moment to her own bedroom was it not much to her that he was with her again not only alive but uninjured that she should again hear his voice and see the light of his countenance and become aware once more of a certain almost heavenly glory which seemed to surround her when she was in his presence she was aware that on such occasions she felt herself to be lifted out of her ordinary prosaic life and to be for a time floating as it were in some upper air among the clouds indeedalas yes but among clouds which were silverlined in a heaven which could never be her own but in which she could dwell though it were but for an hour or two in ecstasyif only he would allow her to do so without troubling her with further prayer then there came across her a thought that if only she could so begin this interview with him that it might seem to be an occasion of special joyas though it were a thanksgiving because he had come back to her safeshe might at any rate for this day avoid words from him which might drive her again to refuse his great request he already knew that she loved him must know of what value to her must be his life must understand how this had come at first a terrible crushing killing sorrow and then a relief which by the excess of its joy must have been almost too much for her could she not let all that be a thing acknowledged between them which might be spoken of as between dearest friends without any allusion for the present to that request which could never be granted  but he as he waited there a minute or two was minded to make quite another use of the interview he was burning to take her in his arms as his own to press his lips to hers and know that she returned his caress to have the one word spoken which would alone suffice to satisfy the dominating spirit of the man within him had she acceded to his request then his demand would have been that she should at once become his wife and he would not have rested at peace till he had reduced her months to weeks he desired to have it all his own way he had drawn her into his presence as soon almost as he had seen her he had forced upon her his love he had driven her to give him her heart and to acknowledge that it was so of course he must go on with his triumph over her she must be his altogether from the crown of her head to the soles of her feetand that without delay his hunting and his yacht his politics and his friendships were nothing to him without marion fay when she came into the room his heart was in sympathy with her but by no means his mind  my lord she said letting her hand lie willingly between the pressure of his two you may guess what we suffered when we heard the report and how we felt when we learnt the truth  you got my telegram i sent it as soon as i began to understand how foolish the people had been  oh yes my lord it was so good of you  marion will you do something for me  what shall i do my lord  dont call me my lord  but it is proper  it is most improper and abominable and unnatural  lord hampstead  i hate it you and i can understand each other at any rate  i hope so  i hate it from everybody i cant tell the servants not to do it they wouldnt understand me but from you it seems always as though you were laughing at me  laugh at you  you may if you like it what is it you may not do with me if it were really a joke if you were quizzing i shouldnt mind it he held her hand the whole time and she did not attempt to withdraw it what did her hand signify if she could only so manage with him on that day that he should be satisfied to be happy and not trouble her with any request marion he said drawing her towards him  sit down my lord well i wont you shant be called my lord today because i am so happy to see youbecause you have had so great an escape  but i didnt have any escape  if only she could keep him in this way if he would only talk to her about anything but his passion it seemed to me so of course father was brokenhearted about it he was as bad as i think of father going down without his tea to hendon hall and driving the poor people there all out of their wits  everybody was out of his wits  i was she said bobbing her head at him she was just so far from him she thought as to be safe from any impetuous movement and hannah was nearly as bad hannah was the old woman you may imagine we had a wretched night of it  and all about nothing said he falling into her mood in the moment but think of poor walker  yes indeed i suppose he has friends too who loved him asas some people love you but he is not going to die  i hope not who is that young woman opposite who rushed out to me in the street she says she brought you the news first  miss demijohn  is she a friend of yours  no said marion blushing as she spoke the word very firmly  i am rather glad of that because i didnt fall in love with her she introduced me to ever so many of the neighbours the landlady of the publichouse was one i think  i am afraid they have offended you among them  not in the least i never take offence except when i think people mean it but now marion say one word to me  i have said many words have i not said nice words  every word out of your mouth is like music to me but there is one word which i am dying to hear  what word she said she knew that she should not have asked the question but it was so necessary for her to put off the evil if it were only for a moment  it is whatever word you may choose to use when you speak to me as my wife my mother used to call me john the children call me jack my friends call me hampstead invent something sweet for yourself i always call you marion because i love the sound so dearly  every one calls me marion  no i never did so till i had told myself that if possible you should be my own do you remember when you poked the fire for me at hendon hall  i doi do it was wrong of me was it notwhen i hardly knew you  it was beyond measure good of you but i did not dare to call you marion then though i knew your name as well as i do now marion i have it here written all round my heart what could she say to a man who spoke to her after this fashion it was as though an angel from heaven were courting her if only she could have gone on listening so that nothing further should come of it find some name for me and tell me that it shall be written round your heart  indeed it is you know it is lord hampstead  but what name  your friendyour friend of friends  it will not do it is cold  then it is untrue to her from whom it comes do you think that my friendship is cold for you  she had turned towards him and was sitting before him with her face looking into his with her hands clasped as though in assurance of her truthwhen suddenly he had her in his arms and had pressed his lips to hers in a moment she was standing in the middle of the room though he was strong her strength was sufficient for her my lord she exclaimed  ah you are angry with me  my lord my lordi did not think you would treat me like that  but marion do you not love me  have i not told you that i do have i not been true and honest to you do you not know it all but in truth he did not know it all and now i must bid you never never to come again  but i shall come i will come i will come always you will not cease to love me  nonot thati cannot do that but you must not come you have done that which makes me ashamed of myself at that moment the door was opened and mrs roden came into the room     chapter xxi  di crinola   the reader must submit to have himself carried back some weeksto those days early in january when mrs roden called upon her son to accompany her to italy indeed he must be carried back a long way beyond that but the time during which he need be so detained shall be short a few pages will suffice to tell so much of the early life of this lady as will be necessary to account for her residence in paradise row  mary roden the lady whom we have known as mrs roden was left an orphan at the age of fifteen her mother having died when she was little more than an infant her father was an irish clergyman with no means of his own but what he secured from a small living but his wife had inherited money amounting to about eight thousand pounds and this had descended to mary when her father died the girl was then taken in charge by a cousin of her own a lady ten years her senior who had lately married and whom we have since met as mrs vincent living at wimbledon mr vincent had been well connected and welltodo in the world and till he died the household in which mary roden had been brought up had been luxurious as well as comfortable nor did mr vincent die till after his wifes cousin had found a husband for herself soon afterwards he was gathered to his fathers leaving to his widow a comfortable but not more than a comfortable income  the year before his death he and his wife had gone into italy rather on account of his health than for pleasure and had then settled themselves at verona for a wintera winter which eventually stretched itself into nearly a year at the close of which mr vincent died but before that event took place mary roden had become a wife  at verona at first at the house of her own cousinwhich was of course her own homeand afterwards in the society of the place to which the vincents had been made welcomemary met a young man who was known to all the world as the duca di crinola no young man more beautiful to look at more charming in manners more ready in conversation was then known in those parts of italy than this young nobleman in addition to these good gifts he was supposed to have in his veins the very best blood in all europe it was declared on his behalf that he was related to the bourbons and to the hapsburgh family indeed there was very little of the best blood which europe had produced in the last dozen centuries of which some small proportion was not running in his veins he was too the eldest son of his father who though he possessed the most magnificent palace in verona had another equally magnificent in venice in which it suited him to live with his duchessa as the old nobleman did not come often to verona and as the young nobleman never went to venice the father and son did not see much of each other an arrangement which was supposed to have its own comforts as the young man was not disturbed in the possession of his hotel and as the old man was reported in verona generally to be arbitrary hottempered and tyrannical it was therefore said of the young duke by his friends that he was nearly as well off as though he had no father at all  but there were other things in the history of the young duke which as they became known to the vincents did not seem to be altogether so charming though of all the palaces in verona that in which he lived was by far the most beautiful to look at from the outside it was not supposed to be furnished in a manner conformable to its external appearance it was indeed declared that the rooms were for the most part bare and the young duke never gave the lie to these assertions by throwing them open to his friends it was said of him also that his income was so small and so precarious that it amounted almost to nothing that the cross old duke at venice never allowed him a shilling and that he had done everything in his power to destroy the hopes of a future inheritance nevertheless he was beautiful to look at in regard to his outward attire and could hardly have been better dressed had he been able to pay his tailor and shirtmaker quarterly and he was a man of great accomplishments who could talk various languages who could paint and model and write sonnets and dance to perfection and he could talk of virtue and in some sort seem to believe in itthough he would sometimes confess of himself that nature had not endowed him with the strength necessary for the performance of all the good things which he so thoroughly appreciated  such as he was he entirely gained the affection of mary roden it is unnecessary here to tell the efforts that were made by mrs vincent to prevent the marriage had she been less austere she might perhaps have prevailed with the girl but as she began by pointing out to her cousin the horror of giving herself who had been born and bred a protestant to a roman catholicand also of bestowing her english money upon an italianall that she said was without effect the state of mr vincents health made it impossible for them to move or mary might perhaps have been carried back to england when she was told that the man was poor she declared that there was so much the more reason why her money should be given to relieve the wants of the man she loved it ended in their being married and all that mr vincent was able to accomplish was to see that the marriage ceremony should be performed after the fashion both of the church of england and of the church of rome mary at the time was more than twentyone and was thus able with all the romance of girlhood to pour her eight thousand pounds into the open hands of her thricenoble and thricebeautiful lover  the duchino with his young duchessina went their way rejoicing and left poor mr vincent to die at verona twelve months afterwards the widow had settled herself at the house at wimbledon from which she had in latter years paid her weekly visits to paradise row and tidings had come from the young wife which were not altogether satisfactory the news indeed which declared that a young little duke had been born to her was accompanied by expressions of joy which the other surrounding incidents of her life were not permitted at the moment altogether to embitter her baby her wellborn beautiful baby was for a few months allowed to be a joy to her even though things were otherwise very sorrowful but things were very sorrowful the old duke and the old duchess would not acknowledge her then she learned that the quarrel between the father and son had been carried to such a pitch that no hope of reconciliation remained whatever was left of family property was gone as far as any inheritance on the part of the elder son was concerned he had himself assisted in making over to a second brother all right that he possessed in the property belonging to the family then tidings of horror accumulated itself upon her and her baby then came tidings that her husband had been already married when he first met herwhich tidings did not reach her till he had left her alone somewhere up among the lakes for an intended absence of three days after that day she never saw him again the next she heard of him was from italy from whence he wrote to her to tell her that she was an angel and that he devil as he was was not fit to appear in her presence other things had occurred during the fifteen months in which they had lived together to make her believe at any rate the truth of this last statement it was not that she ceased to love him but that she knew that he was not fit to be loved when a woman is bad a man can generally get quit of her from his heartstringsbut a woman has no such remedy she can continue to love the dishonoured one without dishonour to herselfand does so  among other misfortunes was the loss of all her money there she was in the little villa on the side of the lake with no incomeand with statements floating about her that she had not and never had had a husband it might well be that after that she should caution marion fay as to the imprudence of an exalted marriage but there came to her assistance if not friendship and love in the midst of her misfortunes her brotherinlawif she had a husband or a brotherinlawcame to her from the old duke with terms of surrender and there came also a man of business a lawyer from venice to make good the terms if they should be accepted though money was very scarce with the family or the power of raising money still such was the feeling of the old nobleman in her misfortunes that the entire sum which had been given up to his eldest son should be restored to trustees for her use and for the benefit of her baby on condition that she should leave italy and consent to drop the title of the di crinola family as to that question of a former marriage the old lawyer declared that he was unable to give any certain information the reprobate had no doubt gone through some form of a ceremony with a girl of low birth at venice it very probably was not a marriage the young duchino the brother declared his belief that there had been no such marriage but she should she cling to the name could not make her title good to it without obtaining proofs which they had not been able to find no doubt she could call herself duchess had she means at command she might probably cause herself to be received as such but no property would thus be affectednor would it rob him the younger son of his right to call himself also by the title the offer made to her was not ungenerous the family owed her nothing but were willing to sacrifice nearly half of all they had with the object of restoring to her the money of which the profligate had robbed herwhich he had been enabled to take from her by her own folly and credulity in this terrible emergency of her life mrs vincent sent over to her a solicitor from london between whom and the italian man of business a bargain was struck the young wife undertook to drop her husbands name and to drop it also on behalf of her boy then the eight thousand pounds was repaid and mrs roden as she afterwards called herself went back to wimbledon and to england with her baby  so far the life of george rodens mother had been most unfortunate after that for a period of sixteen years time went with her if not altogether happily at least quietly and comfortably then there came a subject of disruption george roden took upon himself to have opinions of his own and would not hold his peace in the presence of mrs vincent to whom those opinions were most unacceptable and they were the more unacceptable because the mothers tone of mind had always taken something of the bent which appeared so strongly afterwards in her son george at any rate could not be induced to be silent norwhich was worsecould he after reaching his twentieth year be made to go to church with that regularity which was necessary for the elder ladys peace of mind he at this time had achieved for himself a place in the office ruled over by our friend sir boreas and had in this way become so much of a man as to be entitled to judge for himself in this way there had been no quarrel between mrs vincent and mrs roden but there had come a condition of things in which it had been thought expedient that they should live apart mrs roden had therefore taken for herself a house in paradise row and those weekly intervisitings had been commenced between her and her cousin  such had been the story of mrs rodens life till tidings were received in england that her husband was dead the information had been sent to mrs vincent by the younger son of the late old duke who was now a nobleman well known in the political life of his own country he had stated that to the best of his belief his brothers first union had not been a legal marriage he thought it right he had said to make this statement and to say that as far as he was concerned he was willing to withdraw that compact upon which his father had insisted if his sisterinlaw wished to call herself by the name and title of di crinola she might do so or if the young man of whom he spoke as his nephew wished to be known as duca di crinola he would raise no objection but it must be remembered that he had nothing to offer to his relative but the barren tender of the name he himself had succeeded to but very little and that which he possessed had not been taken from his brother  then there were sundry meetings between mrs vincent and mrs roden at which it was decided that mrs roden should go to italy with her son her brotherinlaw had been courteous to her and had offered to receive her if she would come should she wish to use the name of di crinola he had promised that she should be called by it in his house so that the world around might know that she was recognized by him and his wife and children she determined that she would at any rate make the journey and that she would take her son with her  george roden had hitherto learnt nothing of his father or his family in the many consultations held between his mother and mrs vincent it had been decided that it would be better to keep him in the dark why fill his young imagination with the glory of a great title in order that he might learn at last as might too probably be the case that he had no right to the nameno right to consider himself even to be his fathers son she by her follyso she herself acknowledgedhad done all that was possible to annihilate herself as a woman there was no name which she could give to her son as certainly as her own this which had been hers before she had been allured into a mock marriage would at any rate not be disputed and thus he had been kept in ignorance of his mothers story of course he had asked it was no more than natural that he should ask but when told that it was for his mothers comfort that he should ask no more he had assented with that reticence which was peculiar to him then chance had thrown him into friendship with the young english nobleman and the love of lady frances trafford had followed  his mother when he consented to accompany her had almost promised him that all mysteries should be cleared up between them before their return in the train before they reached paris a question was asked and an answer given which served to tell much of the truth as they came down to breakfast that morning early in the dark january morning he observed that his mother was dressed in deep mourning it had always been her custom to wear black raiment he could not remember that he had ever seen on her a coloured dress or even a bright ribbon and she was not now dressed quite as is a widow immediately on the death of her husband it was now a quarter of a century since she had seen the man who had so illused her according to the account which she had received it was twelve months at least since he had died in one of the grecian islands the full weeds of a mourning widow would ill have befitted her condition of mind or her immediate purpose but yet there was a speciality of blackness in her garments which told him that she had dressed herself with a purpose as of mourning mother he said to her in the train you are in mourningas for a friend then when she paused he asked again may i not be told for whom it is done am i not right in saying that it is so  it is so george  for whom then  they two were alone in the carriage and why should his question not be answered now but it had come to pass that there was a horror to her in mentioning the name of his father to him george she said it is more than twentyfive years since i saw your father  is he deadonly now  it is only nowonly the other daythat i have heard of his death  why should not i also be in black  i had not thought of it but you never saw him since he had you in his arms as a baby you cannot mourn for him in heart  do you  it is hard to say for what we mourn sometimes of course i loved him once there is still present to me a memory of what i lovedof the man who won my heart by such gifts as belonged to him and for that i mourn he was beautiful and clever and he charmed me it is hard to say sometimes for what we mourn  was he a foreigner mother  yes george he was an italian you shall know it all soon now but do not you mourn to you no memories are left were it not for the necessity of the present moment no idea of a father should ever be presented to you she vouchsafed to tell him no more at that moment and he pressed her

may differ from my own should it be so i cannot    say that i shall be prepared to yield but i will at    any rate enable you to submit the case to them with all    fairness     i have told you more than once how little i have known    of my own familythat i have known indeed nothing my    mother has seemed to me to be perversely determined not to    tell me all that which i will acknowledge i have thought    that i ought to know but with equal perversity i have    refrained from asking questions on a subject of which    i think i should have been told everything without    questioning and i am a man not curious by nature as to    the past i am more anxious as to what i may do myself    than as to what others of my family may have done before    me     when however my mother asked me to go with her to italy    it was manifest that her journey had reference to her    former life i knew from circumstances which could not    be hidden from mefrom her knowledge for instance of    italian and from some relics which remained to her of her    former lifethat she had lived for some period in this    country as my place of birth had never been mentioned to    me i could not but guess that i had been born in italy    and when i found that i was going there i felt certain    that i must learn some portion of the story of which i had    been kept in ignorance now i have learnt it all as far as    my poor mother knows it herself and as it will concern    you to know it too i must endeavour to explain to you all    the details dearest fanny i do trust that when you have    heard them you will think neither worse of me on that    accountnor better it is as to the latter that i am    really in fear i wish to believe that no chance attribute    could make me stand higher in your esteem than i have come    to stand already by my own personal character   then he told hernot perhaps quite so fully as the reader has heard it told in the last chapterthe story of his mothers marriage and of his own birth before they had reached rome where the duca di crinola at present lived and where he was at present a member of the italian cabinet the mother had told her son all that she knew having throughout the telling of the story unconsciously manifested to him her own desire to remain in obscurity and to bear the name which had been hers for fiveandtwenty years but at the same time so to manage that he should return to england bearing the title to which by his birth she believed him to be entitled when in discussing this he explained to her that it would be still necessary for him to earn his bread as a clerk in the post office in spite of his highsounding nobility and explained to her the absurdity of his sitting in mr jerninghams room at the desk with young crocker and calling himself at the same time the duca di crinola she in her arguments exhibited a weakness which he had hardly expected from her she spoke vaguely but with an assurance of personal hope of lady frances of lord hampstead of the marquis of kingsbury and of lord persiflageas though by the means of these noble personages the duca di crinola might be able to live in idleness of all this roden could say nothing in this first letter to lady frances but it was to this that he alluded when he hoped that she would not think better of him because of the news which he sent her  at present he wrote continuing his letter after the telling of the story      we are staying with my uncle as i presume i am entitled    to call him he is very gracious as also are his wife and    the young ladies who are my cousins but i think that he    is as anxious as i am that there should be no acknowledged    branch of the family senior to his own he is duca di    crinola to all italy and will remain so whether i assume    the title or not were i to take the name and to remain    in italywhich is altogether impossiblei should be    nobody he who has made for himself a great position    and apparently has ample means would not in truth be    affected but i am sure that he would not wish it he is    actuated by a sense of honesty but he certainly has no    desire to be incommoded by relatives who would as regards    the family claim to be superior to himself my dearest    mother wishes to behave well to him wishes to sacrifice    herself but is i fear above all things anxious to    procure for her son the name and title which his father    bore     as for myself you will i think already have perceived    that it is my desire to remain as i was when last i saw    you and to be as ever     yours most affectionately     george roden   lady frances was as may be imagined much startled at the receipt of this letterstartled and also pleased though she had always declared to herself that she was in every respect satisfied with her lover from the post office though she had been sure that she had never wanted him to be other than he was still when she heard of that finesounding name there did for a moment come upon her an idea that for his sake it might be well that he should have the possession of all that his birth had done for him but when she came to understand the meaning of his words as she did on the second or third reading of his letterwhen she discovered what he meant by saying that he hoped she would not think better of him by reason of what he was telling her when she understood the purport of the manner in which he signed his name she resolved that in every respect she would think as he thought and act as he wished her to act whatever might be the name which he might be pleased to give her with that would she be contented nor would she be led by any one belonging to her to ask him to change his purpose  for two days she kept the letter by her unanswered and without speaking of it to anybody then she showed it to her brother exacting from him a promise that he should not speak of it to any one without her permission it is georges secret she said and i am sure you will see that i have no right to disclose it i tell you because he would do so if he were here her brother was willing enough to make the promise which would of course be in force only till he and roden should see each other but he could not be brought to agree with his sister as to his friends view of the position  he may have what fancies he pleases about titles he said as may i but i do not think that he would be justified in repudiating his fathers name i feel it a burden and an absurdity to be born to be an earl and a marquis but i have to put up with it and though my reason and political feeling on the matter tell me that it is a burden and an absurdity yet the burden is easily borne and the absurdity does not annoy me much there is a gratification in being honoured by those around you though your conscience may be twinged that you yourself have done nothing to deserve it it will be so with him if he takes his position here as an italian nobleman  but he would still have to be a clerk in the post office  probably not  but how would he live asked lady frances  the governor you would find would look upon him in a much more favourable light than he does at present  that would be most unreasonable  not at all it is not unreasonable that a marquis of kingsbury should be unwilling to give his daughter to george roden a clerk in the post officebut that he should be willing to give her to a duca di crinola  what has that to do with earning money  the governor would probably find an income in one case and not in the other i do not quite say that it ought to be so but it is not unreasonable that it should be so then lady frances said a great deal as to that pride in her lover which would not allow him to accept such a position as that which was now suggested  there was a long discussion on the subject her brother explained to her how common it was for noblemen of high birth to live on means provided by their wives fortunes and how uncommon it was that men born to high titles should consent to serve as clerks in a public office but his common sense had no effect upon his sister who ended the conversation by exacting from him a renewed assurance of secrecy i wont say a word till he comes said hampstead but you may be sure that a story like that will be all over london before he does come  lady frances of course answered her lovers letter but of what she said it is only necessary that the reader should know that she promised that in all things she would be entirely guided by his wishes  then came his second letter to her dated on the day on which poor walker had nearly been crushed to death i am so glad that you agree with me he wrote      since my last letter to you everything here has been    decided as far as i can decide itor indeed as far as    any of us can do so there can i think be no doubt as to    the legality of my mothers marriage my uncle is of the    same opinion and points out to me that were i to claim my    fathers name no one would attempt to dispute it he alone    could do soor rather would be the person to do so if    it were done he would make no such attempt and would    himself present me to the king here as the duca di crinola    if i chose to remain and to accept the position but i    certainly will not do so i should in the first place be    obliged to give up my nationality i could not live in    england bearing an italian title except as an italian i    do not know that as an italian i should be forced to give    up my place in the post office foreigners i believe    are employed in the civil service but there would be an    absurdity in it which to me would be specially annoying i    could not live under such a weight of ridicule nor could    i live in any position in which some meagre income might    be found for me because of my nobility no such income    would be forthcoming here i can imagine that your father    might make a provision for a poor soninlaw with a grand    title he ought not to do so according to my ideas but    it might be possible that he should find himself persuaded    to such weakness but i could not accept it i should not    be above taking money with my wife if it happened to come    in my way provided that i were earning an income myself    to the best of my ability for her sake i should do what    might be best for her but not even for your sakeif you    wished it as i know you do notcould i consent to hang    about the world in idleness as an italian duke without a    shilling of my own therefore my darling i purpose to    come back as i went     your own     george roden     clerk in the post office and entitled to consider myself    as being on hms when at work from ten till four   this letter reached lady frances at hendon hall on the return of herself and her brother from gorse hall but before that time the prophecy uttered by lord hampstead as to the story being all over london had already been in part fulfilled vivian during their hunting weeks at gorse hall had been running continually up and down from london where his work as private secretary to the secretary of state had been of course most constant and important he had nevertheless managed to have three days a week in northamptonshire explaining to his friends in london that he did it by sitting up all night in the country to his friends in the country that he sat up all night in town there are some achievements which are never done in the presence of those who hear of them catching salmon is one and working all night is another vivian however managed to do what was required of him and to enjoy his hunting at the same time  on his arrival at gorse hall the day before the famous accident he had a budget of news of which he was very full but of which he at first spoke only to hampstead he could not at any rate speak of it in the presence of lady frances you have heard this havent you about george roden he asked as soon as he could get lord hampstead to himself  heard what about george roden asked the other who of course had heard it all  the italian title  what about an italian title  but have you heard it  i have heard something what have you heard  george roden is in italy  unless he has left it he has been there no doubt  and his mother hampstead nodded his head i suppose you do know all about it  i want to know what you know what i have heard has come to me as a secret your story can probably be divulged  i dont know that we are apt to be pretty close as to what we hear at the foreign office but this didnt come as specially private ive had a letter from muscati a very good fellow in the foreign office there who had in some way heard your name as connected with roden  that is very likely  and your sisters said vivian in a whisper  that is likely too men talk about anything nowadays  lord persiflage has heard direct from italy he is interested of course as being brotherinlaw to lady kingsbury  but what have they heard  it seems that roden isnt an englishman at all  that will be as he likes i take it he has lived here as an englishman for fiveandtwenty years  but of course hell prefer to be an italian said vivian it turns out that he is heir to one of the oldest titles in italy you have heard of the ducas di crinola  i have heard of them now  one of them is minister of education in the present cabinet and is likely to be the premier but he isnt the head of the family and he isnt really the duca di crinola he is called so of course but he isnt the head of the family george roden is the real duca di crinola i thought there must be something special about the man when your sister took such a fancy to him  i always thought there was something special about him said hampstead otherwise i should hardly have liked him so well  so did i he always seemed to beto mejust one of ourselves you know a fellow doesnt come out like that unless hes somebody you radicals may say what you please but silk purses dont get made out of sows ears nobody stands up for blood less than i do but by george it always shows itself you wouldnt think crocker was heir to a dukedom  upon my word i dont know i have a great respect for crocker  and now whats to be done asked vivian  how done  about di crinola lord persiflage says that he cant remain in the post office  why not  im afraid he doesnt come in for much  not a shilling  lord persiflage thinks that something should be done for him but it is so hard it should be done in italy you know i should think that they might make him extra secretary of legation so as to leave him here but then they have such a small salary as the story of george rodens birth was thus known to all the foreign office it was probable that hampsteads prophecy would be altogether fulfilled     chapter ii  true tidings   the foreign office from top to bottom was very much moved on the occasionand not without cause the title of di crinola was quite historic and had existed for centuries no duca di crinolaat any rate no respectable duca di crinolacould be in england even as a temporary visitant without being considered as entitled to some consideration from the foreign office the existing duke of that name who had lately been best known was at present a member of the italian ministry had he come he would have been entitled to great consideration but he as now appeared was not the real duca di crinola the real duke was an englishmanor an anglicized italian or an italianized englishman no one in the foreign office not even the most ancient pundit there quite knew what he was it was clear that the foreign office must take some notice of the young nobleman but in all this was not contained more than half of the real reasons for peculiar consideration this anglicized italian duca was known to be engaged to the daughter of an english marquis to a lady who if not niece was next door to being niece to the secretary of state for foreign affairs himself many years must have passed since an individual had sprung into notice so interesting in many different ways to all the body of the foreign office  and this personage was a clerk in the post office there had no doubt been a feeling in the foreign office if not of actual disgrace at any rate of mingled shame and regret that a niece of their secretary of state should have engaged herself to one so low had he been in the foreign office himself something might have been made of himbut a clerk in the post office the thing had been whispered about and talked over till there had come up an idea that lady frances should be sent away on some compulsory foreign mission so as to be out of the pernicious young mans reach but now it turned out suddenly that the young man was the duca di crinola and it was evident to all of them that lady frances trafford was justified in her choice  but what was to be done with the duca rumours reached the foreign office that the infatuated young nobleman intended to adhere to his most unaristocratic position the absurdity of a clerk of the third class in one of the branches of the post office with a salary of a hundred and seventy a year and sitting in the same room with crockers and bobbins while he would have to be called by everybody the duca di crinola was apparent to the mind of the lowest foreign office official it couldnt be so they said to each other something must be done if government pay were necessary to him could he not be transformed by a leap into the elysium of their own department where he might serve with some especial name invented for the occasion then there arose questions which no man could answer were he to be introduced into this newfangled office proposed for him would he come in as an englishman or an italian and if as an englishman was it in accordance with received rules of etiquette that he should be called duca di crinola would it be possible in so special a case to get special permission from the crown or if not could he be appointed to the foreign office as a foreigner the special permission though it was surrounded by so many difficulties yet seemed to be easier and less monstrous than this latter suggestion they understood that though he could not well be dismissed from the office which he already held it might be difficult to appoint a foreign nobleman to the performance of duties which certainly required more than ordinary british tendencies in this way the mind of the foreign office was moved and the coming of the young duke was awaited with considerable anxiety  the news went beyond the foreign office whether it was that the secretary of state himself told the story to the ladies of his household or that it reached them through private secretaries it was certainly the case that lady persiflage was enabled to write a very interesting letter to her sister and that lady amaldina took the occasion of congratulating her cousin and of informing her lover  lady kingsbury when she received the news was still engaged in pointing out to her husband the iniquity of his elder children in having admitted the visit of mr roden to hendon hall this she persisted in saying had been done in direct opposition to most solemn promises made by all the parties concerned the marquis at the time had recovered somewhat of his strength in consequence as was said among the household of the removal of mr greenwood into shrewsbury and the marchioness took advantage of this improved condition on the part of her husband to make him sensible of the abominable iniquity of which the young persons had been guilty the visit had occurred two months since but the iniquity to lady kingsburys thinking still demanded express condemnation and if possible punishment a direct and premeditated falsehood on the part of them all said lady kingsbury standing over her husband who was recumbent on the sofa in his own room  no it wasnt said the marquis who found it easier to deny the whole charge than to attempt in his weakness to divide the guilt  my dear when she was allowed to go to hendon hall was it not done on a sacred pledge that she should not see that horrid man did not hampstead repeat the promise to my own ears  how could he help his coming i wish you wouldnt trouble me about it any more  then i suppose that she is to have your leave to marry the man whenever she chooses  then he roused himself with whatever strength he possessed and begged her to leave him with much indignation she stalked out of the room and going to her apartments found the following letter which had just arrived from her sister      my dear clara     as you are down in the country i suppose the news about    fannys young man has not yet reached you   fannys young man had fanny been the housemaid it was thus that they might have spoken of her lover could it be that fanny and her young man had already got themselves married lady kingsbury when she read this almost let the letter drop from her hand so much was she disgusted by the manner in which her sister spoke of this most unfortunate affair      i heard something of it only yesterday and the rest of    the details today as it has come through the foreign    office you may be quite sure that it is true though it    is so wonderful the young man is not george roden at all    nor is he an englishman he is an italian and his proper    name and title is duca di crinola   again lady kingsbury allowed the letter almost to drop but on this occasion with feelings of a very different nature what not george roden not a miserable clerk in the english post office duca di crinolaa title of which she thought that she remembered to have heard as belonging to some peculiarly ancient family it was not to be believed and yet it came from her sister who was usually correct in all such mattersand came also from the foreign office which she regarded as the one really trustworthy source of information as to foreign matters of an aristocratic nature duca di crinola she said to herself as she went on with the reading of her letter      there is a long story of the marriage of his mother which    i do not quite understand as yet but it is not necessary    to the facts of the case the young man has been    recognized in his own country as entitled to all the    honours of his family and must be received so by us    persiflage says that he will be ready to present him at    court on his return as duca di crinola and will ask him    at once to dine in belgrave square it is a most romantic    story but must be regarded by you and me as being very    fortunate as dear fanny had certainly set her heart upon    marrying the man i am told that he inherits nothing but    the bare title some foreign noblemen are you know very    poor and in this case the father who was a mauvais    sujet contrived to destroy whatever rights of property    he had lord kingsbury probably will be able to do    something for him perhaps he may succeed in getting    official employment suited to his rank at any rate we    must all of us make the best of him for fannys sake it    will be better to have a duca di crinola among us even    though he should not have a shilling than a post office    clerk with two or three hundred a year     i asked persiflage to write to lord kingsbury but he    tells me that i must do it all because he is so busy    were my brotherinlaw well enough i think he should come    up to town to make inquiry himself and to see the young    man if he cannot do so he had better get hampstead    to take him down to trafford hampstead and this young    duchino are luckily bosom friends it tells well for    hampstead that after all he did not go so low for his    associates as you thought he did amaldina intends to    write to fanny to congratulate her     your affectionate sister     geraldine persiflage   duca di crinola she could not quite believe itand yet she did believe it nor could she be quite sure as to herself whether she was happy in believing it or the reverse it had been terrible to her to think that she should have to endure the name of being stepmother to a clerk in the post office it would not be at all terrible to her to be stepmother to a duca di crinola even though the stepson would have no property of his own that little misfortune would as far as the feelings of society went be swallowed up amidst the attributes of rank nothing would sound better than duchessa or duchessina and moreover it would be all true this was no paltry title which might be false or might have been picked up any how the other day all the world would know that the italian duke was the lineal representative of a magnificent family to whom this identical rank had belonged for many years there were strong reasons for taking the young duke and the young duchess to her heart at once  but then there were other reasons why she should not wish it to be true in the first place she hated them both let the man be duca di crinola as much as he might he would still have been a post office clerk and lady frances would have admitted his courtship having believed him at the time to have been no more than a post office clerk the sin would have been not the less abominable in the choice of her lover although it might be expedient that the sin should be forgiven and then the girl had insulted her and there had been that between them which would prevent the possibility of future love and would it not be hard upon her darlings if it should become necessary to carve out from the family property a permanent income for this italian nobleman and for a generation of italian noblemen to come and then what a triumph would this be for hampstead who of all human beings was the most distasteful to her  but upon the whole she thought it would be best to accept the duca she must indeed accept him nothing that she could do would restore the young man to his humble desk and humble name nor would the marquis be actuated by any prayer of hers in reference to the carving of the property it would be better for her to accept the young duke and the young duchess and make the best of them if only the story should at last be shown to be true  the duty was imposed on her of communicating the story to the marquis but before she did so she was surprised by a visit from mr greenwood mr roberts had used no more than the violence of argument and mr greenwood had been induced to take himself to shrewsbury on the day named for his departure if he went he would have £200 a year from the marquisand £100 would be added by lord hampstead of which the marquis need not know anything unless he went on the day fixed that £100 would not be added a good deal was said on either side but he went the marquis had refused to see him the marchioness had bade him adieu in a most formal mannerin a manner quite unbecoming those familiar suggestions which he thought had been made to him as to a specially desirable event but he had gone and as he went he told himself that circumstances might yet occur in the family which might be of use to him he too had heard the great family newsperhaps through some undersatellite of the foreign office and he came with the idea that he would be the first to make it known at trafford park  he would have asked for the marquis but he knew that the marquis would not receive him lady kingsbury consented to see him and he was ushered up to the room to which he had so often made his way without any asking i hope you are well mr greenwood she said are you still staying in the neighbourhood it was however well known at trafford that he was at shrewsbury  yes lady kingsbury i have not gone from the neighbourhood i thought that perhaps you might want to see me again  i dont know that we need trouble you mr greenwood  i have come with some news respecting the family as he said this he managed to assume the old look and stood as though he had never moved from the place since he had last been in the room  do sit down mr greenwood what news  mr george roden the clerk in the post office  but she was not going to have the tidings repeated to her by him so as to give him any claim to gratitude for having brought them you mean the duca di crinola  oh exclaimed mr greenwood  i have heard all that mr greenwood  that the post office clerk is an italian nobleman  it suited the italian nobleman for a time to be a post office clerk that is what you mean  and lady frances is to be allowed  mr greenwood i must ask you not to discuss lady frances here  oh not to discuss her ladyship  surely you must be aware how angry the marquis has been about it  oh he had not seated himself nor divested himself of that inquisitorial appearance which was so distasteful to her we used to discuss lady frances sometimes lady kingsbury  i will not discuss her now let that be enough mr greenwood  nor yet lord hampstead  nor yet lord hampstead i think it very wrong of you to come after all that took place if the marquis knew it  oh if the marquis knew it if the marquis knew all and if other people knew all if it were known how often her ladyship had spoken and how loud as to the wishedfor removal to a better world of his lordships eldest son but he could not dare to speak it out and yet it was cruel on him he had for some days felt her ladyship to be under his thumb and now it seemed that she had escaped from him oh very well lady kingsbury perhaps i had better gojust for the present and he went  this served at least for corroboration she did not dare to keep the secret long from her husband and therefore in the course of the evening went down with her sisters letter in her hand what said the marquis when the story had been read to him what duca di crinola  there cant be a doubt about it my dear  and he a clerk in the post office  he isnt a clerk in the post office now  i dont quite see what he will be then it appears that he has inherited nothing  my sister says nothing  then whats the good of his title there is nothing so pernicious in the world as a pauper aristocracy a clerk in the post office is entitled to have a wife but a poor nobleman should at any rate let his poverty die with himself  this was a view of the case which had not hitherto presented itself to lady kingsbury when she suggested to him that the young nobleman should be asked down to trafford he did not seem to see that it was at all necessary it would be much better that fanny should come back the young nobleman would he supposed live in his own countryunless indeed the whole tale was a cockandbull story made up by persiflage at the foreign office it was just the sort of thing he said that persiflage would do he had said not a word as to carving an income out of the property for the young noble couple when she left him     chapter iii  all the world knows it   the story was in truth all over london and half over england by the time that lady frances had returned to hendon hall though vivian had made a foreign office secret of the affair at gorse hall nevertheless it had been so commonly talked about during the last sunday there that hautboy had told it all to poor walker and to the walker ladies by jove fancy hautboy had said to go at once from a post office clerk to a duke its like some of those stories where a man goes to bed as a beggar and gets up as a prince i wonder whether he likes it hampstead had of course discussed the matter very freely with his sister still expressing an opinion that a man could not do other than take his fathers name and his fathers title lady frances having thus become used to the subject was not surprised to find the following letter from her friend lady amaldina when she reached her home      my dearest fanny     i am indeed delighted to be able to congratulate you on    the wonderful and most romantic story which has just    been made known to us i was never one of those who blamed    you very much because you had given your affections to    a man so much below you in rank nevertheless we all    could not but feel that it was a pity that he should be    a post office clerk now indeed you have reason to be    proud i have already read up the subject and i find that    the ducas di crinola are supposed to have the very best    blood in europe there can be no doubt that one of the    family married a bourbon before they came to the french    throne i could send you all the details only i do not    doubt that you have found it out for yourself already    another married a second cousin of that maximilian who    married mary of burgundy one of the ladies of the family    is supposed to have been the wife of the younger brother    of one of the guises though it isnt quite certain    whether they were ever married but that little blot    my dear will hardly affect you now taking the name    altogether i dont think there is anything higher in    all europe papa says that the di crinolas have always    been doing something in italy in the way of politics or    rebellion or fighting so it isnt as though they were    all washed out and no longer of any account like some of    those we read of in history therefore i do think that    you must be a very happy girl     i do feel so completely snuffed out because after all    the title of merioneth was only conferred in the time    of charles the second and though there was a lord    llwddythlw before that even he was only created by    james the first the powells no doubt are a very old    welsh family and it is supposed that there was some    relationship between them and the tudors but what is that    to be compared to the mediæval honours of the great    house of di crinola     papa seems to think that he will not have much fortune    i am one of those who do not think that a large income is    at all to be compared to good birth in the way of giving    real position in the world of course the dukes estates    are supposed to be enormous and llwddythlw even as an    eldest son is a rich man but as far as i can see there    is nothing but trouble comes from it if he has anything    to do with a provincial town in the way of rents he is    expected to lay the first brick of every church and    institute about the place if anything has to be opened    he has to open it and he is never allowed to eat his    dinner without having to make two or three speeches    before and afterwards thats what i call a great bore    as far as i can see you will be always able to have your    duke with you because he will have no abominable public    duties to look after     i suppose something will have to be done as to an    income llwddythlw seems to think that he ought to get    into parliament at least that is what he said to papa    the other day for i have not seen him myself for ever so    long he calls in the square every sunday just as we have    done lunch and never remains above two minutes last    sunday we had not heard of this glorious news but papa    did see him one day at the house and that was what he    said i dont see how he is to get into the house if he    is an italian duke and i dont know what hed get by    going there papa says that he might be employed in some    diplomatic position by his own government but i should    think that the marquis could do something for him as he    has so much at his own disposition every acre of the    merioneth property is settled uponwellwhoever may    happen to be the next heir there will sure to be an    income there always is papa says that the young dukes    are always as well off at any rate as the young ravens     but as i said before what does all this signify in    comparison with blood it does make your position my    dear quite another thing from what we had expected    you would have kept your title no doubt but where    would he have been     i wonder whether you will be married now before august i    suppose not because it doesnt seem to be quite certain    when that wicked papa of his died but i do hope that    you wont a day at last has been fixed for usthe 20th    of august when as i told you before lord david is to    run away instantly after the ceremony so as to travel    all night and open something the next morning at    aberdeen i mention it now because you will be by far    the most remarkable of all my bevy of twenty of course    your name will have been in the papers before that as    the future italian duchess that i own will be to me    a just cause of pride i think i have got my bevy all    fixed at last and i do hope that none of them will get    married before my day that has happened so often as    to be quite heartbreaking i shall cry if i find that    you are to be married first     believe me to be    your most affectionate friend and cousin     amaldina   she wrote also to her future husband on the same subject      dearest llwddythlw     it was very good of you to come last sunday but i wish    you hadnt gone away just because the graiseburys were    there they would not have eaten you though he is a    liberal     i have written to fanny trafford to congratulate her    because you know it is after all better than being a mere    post office clerk that was terribleso bad that one    hardly knew how to mention her name in society when    people talked about it i really did feel that i blushed    all over one can mention her name now because people    are not supposed to know that he has got nothing    nevertheless it is very dreadful what on earth are    they to live on i have told her about the young ravens    it was papa who said that when he first heard of this    di crinola affair i suppose a girl ought to trust in    providence when she marries a man without a shilling    that was what papa meant     papa says that you said that he ought to go into    parliament but what would he get by that perhaps    as he is in the post office they might make him    postmastergeneral only papa says that if he were to go    into parliament then he could not call himself duca di    crinola altogether it seems to be very sadthough not    quite so sad as before it is true that one of the di    crinolas married a bourbon and that others of them have    married ever so many royalties i think there ought to    be a law for giving such people something to live upon    out of the taxes how are they to be expected to live    upon nothing i asked papa whether he couldnt get it    done but he said it would be a money bill and that    you ought to take it up pray dont for fear it should    take you all august i know you wouldnt have a scruple    about putting off your own little affair if anything of    that kind were to come in the way i believe youd like    it     do stop a little longer when you come on sunday i have    ever so many things to say to you and if you can think    of anything to be done for those poor di crinolas    anything that wont take up all augustpray do it     your own     amy   one more letter shall be given the answer namely to the above from the lover to his future bride      dear amy     ill be at the square on sunday by three i will walk out    if you like but it is always raining i have to meet five    or six conservative members later on in the afternoon as    to the best thing to be done as to mr greens bill for    lighting london by electricity it would suit everybody    but some of our party i am afraid would go with them    and the government is very shillyshally i have been    going into the figures and it has taken me all the week    otherwise i would have been to see you     this di crinola affair is quite a romance i did not mean    that he ought to go into the house by way of getting an    income if he takes up the title of course he could not do    so if he takes it he must regard himself as an italian    i should think him quite as respectable earning his    bread as a clerk in a public office they tell me hes a    highspirited fellow if he is that is what he will do     yours affectionately     llwddythlw   when lord persiflage spoke of the matter to baron dossi the italian minister in london the baron quite acknowledged the position of the young duca and seemed to think that very little could be wanting to the making of the young mans fortune ah yes your excellency said the baron he has no great estates here in england you all have great estates it is very nice to have great estates but he has an uncle who is a great man in rome and he will have a wife whose uncle is a very great man in london what more should he want then the baron bowed to the minister of state and the minister of state bowed to the baron  but the surprise expressed and the consternation felt at the post office almost exceeded the feelings excited at the foreign office or among lady fannys family and friends dukes and ministers barons and princes are terms familiar to the frequenters of the foreign office ambassadors secretaries and diplomatic noblemen generally are necessarily common in the mouths of all the officials but at the post office such titles still carried with them something of awe the very fact that a man whom they had seen should be a duke was tremendous to the minds of bobbin and geraghty and when it became known to them that a fellow workman in their own room one who had in truth been no more than themselves would henceforth be called by so august a title it was as though the heavens and the earth were coming together it affected crocker in such a way that there was for a time a doubt whether his senses were not temporarily leaving himso that confinement would become necessary of course the matter had found its way into the newspapers it became known at the office on the last day of februarytwo days before the return of the rodens to london  have you heard it mr jerningham said crocker rushing into the room that morning he was only ten minutes after the proper time having put himself to the expense of a cab in his impetuous desire to be the first to convey the great news to his fellow clerks but he had been forestalled in his own room by the energy of geraghty the condition of mind created in mr jerninghams bosom by the story told by geraghty was of such a nature that he was unable to notice crockers sin in reference to the ten minutes  dchuca di crinola shouted geraghty in his broadest brogue as crocker came in determined not to be done out of the honour fairly achieved by him  by jove yes a duke said crocker a duke my own especial friend hampstead will be nowhere nowhere nowhere duca di crinola isnt it beautiful by george i cant believe it can you mr jerningham  i dont know what to believe said mr jerningham only he was always a most steady wellbehaved young man and the office will have a great loss of him  i suppose the duke wont come and see us ever said bobbin i should like to shake hands with him once again  shake hands with him said crocker im sure he wont drop out like thatmy own peculiar friend i dont think i ever was so fond of anybody as george ro the duca di crinola of course i mean by george havent i sat at the same table with him for the last two years why it was only a night or two before he started on this remarkable tour that i spent an evening with him in private society at holloway then he got up and walked about the room impetuously clapping his hands altogether carried away by the warmth of his feelings  i think you might as well sit down to your desk mr crocker said mr jerningham  oh come bother mr jerningham  i will not be spoken to in that way mr crocker  upon my word i didnt mean anything sir but when one has heard such news as this how is it possible that one should compose oneself its a sort of thing that never happened beforethat ones own particular friend should turn out to be the duca di crinola did anybody ever read anything like it in a novel wouldnt it act well cant i see the first meeting between myself and the duke at the haymarket duke i should sayduke i congratulate you on having come to your august family title to which no one living could do so much honour as yourself bancroft should do me bancroft would do me to the life and the piece should be called the dukes friend i suppose we shall call him duke here in england and duca if we happen to be in italy together eh mr jerningham  you had better sit down mr crocker and try to do your work  i cantupon my word i cant the emotion is too much for me i couldnt do it if Æolus were here himself by the way i wonder whether sir boreas has heard the news then he rushed off and absolutely made his way into the room of the great potentate  yes mr crocker said sir boreas i have heard it i read the newspapers no doubt as well as you do  but its true sir boreas  i heard it spoken of two or three days ago mr crocker and i believe it to be true  he was my friend sir boreas my particular friend isnt it a wonderful thingthat ones particular friend should turn out to be duca di crinola and he didnt know a word of it himself i feel quite sure that he didnt know a word of it  i really cant say mr crocker but as you have now expressed your wonder perhaps you had better go back to your room and do your work  he pretends he knew it three days ago said crocker as he returned to his room i dont believe a word of it hed have written to me had it been known so long ago as that i suppose he had too many things to think of or he would have written to me  go aisy crocker said geraghty  what do you mean by that its just the thing he would have done  i dont believe he ever wrote to you in his life said bobbin  you dont know anything about it we were here together two years before you came into the office mr jerningham knows that we were always friends good heavens duca di crinola i tell you what it is mr jerningham if it were ever so i couldnt do anything today you must let me go there are mutual friends of ours to whom it is quite essential that i should talk it over then he took his hat and marched off to holloway and would have told the news to miss clara demijohn had he succeeded in finding that young lady at home clara was at that moment discussing with mrs duffer the wonderful fact that mr walker and not lord hampstead had been kicked and trodden to pieces at gimberley green  but even Æolus great as he was expressed himself with some surprise that afternoon to mr jerningham as to the singular fortune which had befallen george roden i believe it to be quite true mr jerningham these wonderful things do happen sometimes  he wont stay with us sir boreas i suppose  not if he is duca di crinola i dont think we could get on with a real duke i dont know how it will turn out if he chooses to remain an englishman he cant take the title if he chooses to take the title he must be an italian then hell have nothing to live on my belief is we shant see him any more i wish it had been crocker with all my heart     chapter iv  it shall be done   lord hampstead has been left standing for a long time in marion fays sittingroom after the perpetration of his great offence and mrs roden has been standing there also having come to the house almost immediately after her return home from her italian journey hampstead of course knew most of the details of the di crinola romance but marion had as yet heard nothing of it there had been so much for him to say to her during the interview which had been so wretchedly interrupted by his violence that he had found no time to mention to her the name either of roden or of di crinola  you have done that which makes me ashamed of myself these had been marions last words as mrs roden entered the room i didnt know lord hampstead was here said mrs roden  oh mrs roden im so glad you are come exclaimed marion this of course was taken by the lady as a kindly expression of joy that she should have returned from her journey whereas to hampstead it conveyed an idea that marion was congratulating herself that protection had come to her from further violence on his part poor marion herself hardly knew her own meaninghardly had any she could not even tell herself that she was angry with her lover it was probable that the very ecstacy of his love added fuel to hers if a lover so placed as were this lovera lover who had come to her asking her to be his wife and who had been received with the warmest assurance of her own affection for himif he were not justified in taking her in his arms and kissing her when might a lover do so the ways of the world were known to her well enough to make her feel that it was so even in that moment of her perturbation angry with him how could she be angry with him he had asked her and she had declared to him that she was not angry nevertheless she had been quite in earnest when she had said that nowafter the thing that he had donehe must never never come to her again  she was not angry with him but with herself she was angry at the moment when she was in his arms she bethought herself how impossible had been the conditions she had imposed upon him that he should be assured of her love and yet not allowed to approach her as a lover that he should be allowed to come there in order that she might be delighted in looking at him in hearing his voice in knowing and feeling that she was dear to him but that he should be kept at arms length because she had determined that she should not become his wife that they should love each other dearly but each with a different idea of love it was her fault that he should be there in her presence at all she had told herself that it was her duty to sacrifice herself but she had only half carried out her duty should she not have kept her love to herselfso that he might have left her as he certainly would have done had she behaved to him coldly and as her duty had required of her she had longed for some sweetness which would be sweet to her though only a vain encouragement to him she had painted for her own eyes a foolish picture had dreamed a silly dream she had fancied that for the little of life that was left to her she might have been allowed the delight of loving and had been vain enough to think that her lover might be true to her and yet not suffer himself her sacrifice had been altogether imperfect with herself she was angrynot with him angry with him whose very footfall was music to her ears angry with him whose smile to her was as a light specially sent from heaven for her behoof angry with him the very energy of whose passion thrilled her with a sense of intoxicating joy angry with him because she had been enabled for onceonly for onceto feel the glory of her life to be encircled in the warmth of his arms to become conscious of the majesty of his strength noshe was not angry but he must be made to understandhe must be taught to acknowledgethat he must never never come to her again the mind can conceive a joy so exquisite that for the enjoyment of it though it may last but for a moment the tranquillity even the happiness of years may be given in exchange it must be so with her it had been her own doing and if the exchange were a bad one she must put up with the bargain he must never come again then mrs roden had entered the room and she was forced to utter whatever word of welcome might first come to her tongue  yes said hampstead trying to smile as though nothing had happened which called for special seriousness of manner i am here i am here and hope to be here often and often till i shall have succeeded in taking our marion to another home  no said marion faintly uttering her little protest ever so gently  you are very constant my lord said mrs roden  i suppose a man is constant to what he really loves best but what a history you have brought back with you mrs roden i do not know whether i am to call you mrs roden  certainly my lord you are to call me so  what does it mean asked marion  you have not heard he said i have not been here time enough to tell her all this mrs roden  you know it then lord hampstead  yes i know itthough roden has not condescended to write me a line what are we to call him to this mrs roden made no answer on the spur of the moment of course he has written to fanny and all the world knows it it seems to have reached the foreign office first and to have been sent down from thence to my people at trafford i suppose there isnt a club in london at which it has not been repeated a hundred times that george roden is not george roden  not george roden asked marion  no dearest you will show yourself terribly ignorant if you call him so  what is he then my lord  marion  i beg your pardon i will not do it again this time but what is he  he is the duca di crinola  duke said marion  thats what he is marion  have they made him that over there  somebody made one of his ancestors that ever so many hundred years ago when the traffords were well i dont know what the traffords were doing thenfighting somewhere i suppose for whatever they could get he means to take the title i suppose  he says not my lord  he should do so  i think so too lord hampstead he is obstinate you know but perhaps he may consent to listen to some friend here you will tell him  he had better ask others better able than i am to explain all the ins and outs of his position he had better go to the foreign office and see my uncle where is he now  he has gone to the post office we reached home about noon and he went at once it was late yesterday when we reached folkestone and he let me stay there for the night  has he always signed the old name asked hampstead  oh yes i think he will not give it up  nor his office  nor his office as he says himself what else will he have to live on  my father might do something mrs roden shook her head my sister will have money though it may probably be insufficient to furnish such an income as they will want  he would never live in idleness upon her money my lord indeed i think i may say that he has quite resolved to drop the title as idle lumber you perhaps know that he is not easily persuaded  the most obstinate fellow i ever knew in my life said hampstead laughing and he has talked my sister over to his own views then he turned suddenly round to marion and asked her a question shall i go now dearest he said  she had already told him to goto go and never to return to her but the question was put to her in such a manner that were she simply to assent to his going she would by doing so assent also to his returning for the sake of her duty to him in order that she might carry out that selfsacrifice in the performance of which she would now be so resolute it was necessary that he should in truth be made to understand that he was not to come back to her but how was this to be done while mrs roden was present with them had he not been there then she could have asked her friend to help her in her great resolution but before the two she could say nothing of that which it was in her heart to say to both of them if it pleases you my lord she said  i will not be my lord here is roden who is a real duke and whose ancestors have been dukes since long before noah and he is allowed to be called just what he pleases and i am to have no voice in it with my own particular and dearest friends nevertheless i will go and if i dont come today or the day after i will write you the prettiest little loveletter i can invent  dont she saidoh so weakly so vainlyin a manner so utterly void of that intense meaning which she was anxious to throw into her words she was conscious of her own weakness and acknowledged to herself that there must be another interview or at any rate a letter written on each side before he could be made to understand her own purpose if it must be done by a letter how great would be the struggle to her in explaining herself but perhaps even that might be easier than the task of telling him all that she would have to tell while he was standing by impetuous impatient perhaps almost violent assuring her of his love and attempting to retain her by the pressure of his hand  but i shall he said as he held her now for a moment i am not quite sure whether i may not have to go to trafford and if so there shall be the loveletter i feel conscious mrs roden of being incapable of writing a proper loveletter dearest marion i am yours and you are mine always believe me ever thine i dont know how to go beyond that when a man is married and can write about the children or the leg of mutton or whats to be done with his hunters then i dare say it becomes easy goodbye dearest goodbye mrs roden i wish i could keep on calling you duchess in revenge for all the my lordings then he left them  there was a feeling in the mind of both of them that he had conducted himself just as a man would do who was in a high goodhumour at having been permanently accepted by the girl to whom he had offered his hand marion fay knew that it was not soknew that it never could be so mrs roden knew that it had not been so when she had left home now nearly two months since and knew also that marion had pledged herself that it should not be so the young lord then had been too strong with his love a feeling of regret came over her as she remembered that the reasons against such a marriage were still as strong as ever but yet how natural that it should be so was it possible that such a lover as lord hampstead should not succeed in his love if he were constant to it himself sorrow must come of itperhaps a tragedy so bitter that she could hardly bring herself to think of it and marion had been so firm in her resolve that it should not be so but yet it was natural and she could not bring herself to express to the girl either anger or disappointment is it to be she said putting on her sweetest smile  no said marion standing up suddenlyby no means smiling as she spoke it is not to be why do you look at me like that mrs roden did i not tell you before you went that it should never be so  but he treats you as though he were engaged to you  how can i help it what can i do to prevent it when i bid him go he still comes back again and when i tell him that i can never be his wife he will not believe me he knows that i love him  you have told him that  told him he wanted no telling of course he knew it love him oh mrs roden if i could die for him and so have done with it and yet i would not wish to leave my dear father what am i to do mrs roden  but it seemed to me just now that you were so happy with him  i am never happy with himbut yet i am as though i were in heaven  marion  i am never happy i know that it cannot be that it will not be as he would have it i know that i am letting him waste his sweetness all in vain there should be some one else oh so different from me there should be one like himself beautiful strong in health with hot eager blood in her veins with a grand name with grand eyes and a broad brow and a noble figure one who in taking his name will give him as much as she takesone above all who will not pine and fade before his eyes and trouble him during her short life with sickness and doctors and all the fading hopes of a hopeless invalid and yet i let him come and i have told him how dearly i love him he comes and he sees it in my eyes and then it is so glorious to be loved as he loves oh mrs roden he kissed me that to mrs roden did not seem to be extraordinary but not knowing what to say to it at the moment she also kissed the girl then i told him that he must go and never come back to me again  were you angry with him  angry with him with myself i was angry i had given him the right to do it how could i be angry with him and what does it matterexcept for his sake if he could only understand if he would only know that i am in earnest when i speak to him but i am weak in everything except one thing he will never make me say that i will be his wife  my marion dear marion  but father wishes it  wishes you to become his wife  he wishes it why should i not be like any other girl he says how can i tell him how can i say that i am not like to other girls because of my darling my own dearest mother and yet he does not know it he does not see it though he has seen so much he will not see it till i am there on my bed unable to come to him when he wants me  there is nothing now to show him or me that you may not live to be old as he is  i shall not live to be old you know that i shall not live to be more than young have any of them lived for my fatherfor my dear fatherhe must find it out for himself i have sometimes thought that even yet i might last his timethat i might be with him to the end it might be soonly that all this tortures me  shall i tell himshall i tell lord hampstead  he must at any rate be told he is not bound to me as my father is for him there need be no great sorrow at this mrs roden shook her head must it be so  if he is banished from your presence he will not bear it lightly  will a young man love me like thata young man who has so much in the world to occupy him he has his ship and his hounds and his friends and his great wealth it is only girls i think who love like that  he must bear his sorrow as others do  but it shall be made as light as i can make itshall it not i should have done this before i should have done it sooner had he been made to go away at once then he would not have suffered why would he not go when i told him why would he not believe me when i spoke to him i should have heard all his words and never have answered him even with a smile i should not have trembled when he told me that i was there at his hearth as a friend but who thought then mrs roden that this young nobleman would have really cared for the quaker girl  i saw it marion  could you see just by looking at him that he was so different from others are his truth and his loving heart and his high honour and his pure honesty all written in his eyesto you as they are to me but mrs roden there shall be an end of it though it may kill methough it may for a little time halfbreak his heartit shall be done oh that his dear heart should be halfbroken for me i will think of it mrs roden tonight if writing may do it perhaps i may write or perhaps i may say a word that he will at least understand if not you shall tell him but mrs roden it shall be done     chapter v  marion will certainly have her way   on the day but one following there came a letter to marion from hampsteadthe loveletter which he had promised her      dear marion     it is as i supposed this affair about roden has stirred    them up down at trafford amazingly my father wants me to    go to him you know all about my sister i suppose she    will have her way now i think the girls always do have    their way she will be left alone and i have told her to    go and see you as soon as i have gone you should tell her    that she ought to make him call himself by his fathers    proper name     in my case dearest it is not the girl that is to have    her own way its the young man that is to do just as he    pleases my girl my own one my love my treasure think    of it all and ask yourself whether it is in your heart to    refuse to bid me be happy were it not for all that you    have said yourself i should not be vain enough to be happy    at this moment as i am but you have told me that you    love me ask your father and he will tell you that as it    is so it is your duty to promise to be my wife     i may be away for a day or twoperhaps for a week write    to me at traffordtrafford park shrewsburyand say    that it shall be so i sometimes think that you do not    understand how absolutely my heart is set upon youso    that no pleasures are pleasant to me no employments    useful except in so far as i can make them so by thinking    of your love     dearest dearest marion    your own     hampstead     remember there must not be a word about a lord inside the    envelope it is very bad to me when it comes from mrs    roden or from a friend such as she is but it simply    excruciates me from you it seems to imply that you are    determined to regard me as a stranger   she read the letter a dozen times pressing it to her lips and to her bosom she might do that at least he would never know how she treated this only letter that she ever had received from him the only letter that she would receive these caresses were only such as those which came from her heart to relieve her solitude it might be absurd in her to think of the words he had spoken and to kiss the lines which he had written were she now on her deathbed that would be permitted to her wherever she might lay her head till the last day should come that letter should be always within her reach my girl my own one my love my treasure how long would it last with him was it not her duty to hope that the words were silly words written as young men do write having no eagerness of purposejust playing with the toy of the moment could it be that she should wish them to be true knowing as she did that his girl his love his treasure as he called her could never be given up to him and yet she did believe them to be true knew them to be true and took an exceeding joy in the assurance it was as though the beauty and excellence of their truth atoned to her for all else that was troublous to her in the condition of her life she had not lived in vain her life now could never be a vain and empty space of time as it had been consecrated and ennobled and blessed by such a love as this and yet she must make the suffering to him as light as possible though there might be an ecstasy of joy to her in knowing that she was loved there could be nothing akin to that in him he wanted his treasure and she could only tell him that he might never have it think of it all and ask yourself whether it is in your heart to refuse to bid me be happy it was in her heart to do it though it might break her heart she would do it it was the one thing to do which was her paramount duty you have told me that you love me truly she had told him so and certainly she would never recall her words if he ever thought of her in future years when she should long have been at her restand she thought that now and again he would think of her even when that noble bride should be sitting at his tablehe should always remember that she had given him her whole heart he had bade her write to him at trafford she would obey him at once in that but she would tell him that she could not obey him in aught else tell me that it shall be so he had said to her with his sweet imperious manly words there had been something of command about him always which had helped to make him so perfect in her eyes you do not understand he said how absolutely my heart is set upon you did he understand she wondered how absolutely her heart had been set upon him no pleasures are pleasant to me no employment useful unless i can make them so by thinking of your love it was right that he as a manand such a manshould have pleasures and employments and it was sweet to her to be told that they could be gilded by the remembrance of her smiles but for her from the moment in which she had known him there could be no pleasure but to think of him no serious employment but to resolve how best she might do her duty to him  it was not till the next morning that she took up her pen to begin her allimportant letter though her resolution had been so firmly made yet there had been much need for thinking before she could sit down to form the sentences for a while she had told herself that it would be well first to consult her father but before her father had returned to her she had remembered that nothing which he could say would induce her in the least to alter her purpose his wishes had been made known to her but he had failed altogether to understand the nature of the duty she had imposed upon herself thus she let that day pass by although she knew that the writing of the letter would be an affair of much time to her she could not take her sheet of paper and scribble off warm words of love as he had done to ask or to give in a matter of love must surely she thought be easy enough but to have given and then to refusethat was the difficulty there was so much to say of moment both to herself and to him or rather so much to signify that it was not at one sitting or with a single copy that this letter could be written he must be assured no doubt of her love but he must be made to understandquite to understand that her love could be of no avail to him and how was she to obey him as to her mode of addressing him it simply excruciates me from you he had said thus debarring her from that only appellation which would certainly be the easiest and which seemed to her the only one becoming at last the letter when written ran as follows      how i am to begin my letter i do not know as you have    forbidden me to use the only words which would come    naturally but i love you too well to displease you in so    small a matter my poor letter must therefore go to you    without any such beginning as is usual indeed i love you    with all my heart i told you that before and i will not    shame myself by saying that it was untrue but i told you    also before that i could not be your wife dearest love    i can only say again what i said before dearly as i love    you i cannot become your wife you bid me to think of it    all and to ask myself whether it is in my heart to refuse    to bid you to be happy it is not in my heart to let you    do that which certainly would make you unhappy     there are two reasons for this of the first though it is    quite sufficient i know that you will make nothing when    i tell you that you ought not to choose such a one as me    for your wife because my manners of life have not fitted    me for such a position then you sometimes laugh at me    and sometimes are half angrywith that fine way you have    of commanding those that are about you but not the less    am i sure that i am right i do believe that of all human    beings poor marion fay is the dearest to you when you    tell me of your love and your treasure i do not for a    moment doubt that it is all true and were i to be your    wife your honour and your honesty would force you to be    good to me but when you found that i was not as are other    grand ladies then i think you would be disappointed i    should know it by every line of your dear face and when i    saw it there i should be brokenhearted     but this is not all if there were nothing further i    think i should give way because i am only a weak girl and    your words my own own love would get the better of me    but there is another thing it is hard for me to tell    and why should you be troubled with it but i think if i    tell it you out and out so as to make you understand the    truth then you will be convinced mrs roden could tell    you the same my dear dear father could tell you also    only that he will not allow himself to believe because of    his love for the only child that remains to him my mother    died and all my brothers and sisters have died and i    also shall die young     is not that enough i know that it will be enough knowing    that it will be enough may i not speak out to you and    tell you all my heart will you not let me do so as    though it had been understood between us that though we    can never be more to each other than we are yet we may    be allowed to love each other oh my dearest my only    dearest just for this once i have found the words in    which i may address you i cannot comfort you as i can    myself because you are a man and cannot find comfort in    sadness and disappointment as a girl may do a man thinks    that he should win for himself all that he wants for a    girl i think it is sufficient for her to feel that as    far as she herself is concerned that would have been    given to her which she most desires had not fortune been    unkind you dearest cannot have what you want because    you have come to poor marion fay with all the glory and    sweetness of your love you must suffer for a while i    who would so willingly give my life to serve you must    tell you that it will be so but as you are a man pluck    up your heart and tell yourself that it shall only be for    a time the shorter the better and the stronger you will    show yourself in overcoming the evil that oppresses you    and remember this should marion fay live to know that you    had brought a bride home to your house as it will be your    duty to do it will be a comfort to her to feel that the    evil she has done has been cured     marion     i cannot tell you how proud i should be to see your sister    if she will condescend to come and see me or would it not    be better that i should go over to hendon hall i could    manage it without trouble do not you write about it but    ask her to send me one word   such was the letter when it was at last finished and despatched as soon as it was gonedropped irrevocably by her own hand into the pillar letterbox which stood at the corner opposite to the publichouseshe told her father what she had done and why he said crossly i do not understand thee thou art flighty and fickle and knowest not thy own mind  yes father i have known my own mind always in this matter it was not fitting  if he thinks it fitting why shouldst thou object  i am not fit father to be the wife of a great nobleman nor can i trust my own health this she said with a courage and firmness which seemed to silence himlooking at him as though by her looks she forbade him to urge the matter further then she put her arms round him and kissed him will it not be better father that you and i shall remain together till the last  nothing can be better for me that will not also be best for thee  for me it will be best father let it be so and let this young man be no more thought of between us in that she asked more than could be granted to her but for some days lord hampsteads name was not mentioned between them  two days afterwards lady frances came to her let me look at you said marion when the other girl had taken her in her arms and kissed her i like to look at you to see whether you are like him to my eyes he is so beautiful  more so than i am  you are alady and he is a man but you are like him and very beautiful you too have a lover living close to us  well yes i suppose i must own it  why should you not own it it is good to be loved and to love and he has become a great noblemanlike your brother  no marion he is not thatmay i call you marion  why not he called me marion almost at once  did he so  just as though it were a thing of course but i noticed it it was not when he bade me poke the fire but the next time did he tell you about the fire  no indeed  a man does not tell of such things i think but a girl remembers them it is so good of you to come you knowdo you not  know what  that iand your brotherhave settled everything at last the smile of pleasant good humour passed away from the face of lady frances but at the moment she made no reply it is well that you should know he knows now i am sure after what i said in my letter he will not contradict me again lady frances shook her head i have told him that while i live he of all the world must be dearest to me but that will be all  why should younot live  lady frances  nay call me fanny  you shall be fanny if you will let me tell you oh i do so wish that you would understand it all and make me tell you nothing further but you must knowyou must know that it cannot be as your brother has wished if it were only less knownif he would consent and you would consentthen i think that i could be happy what is it after allthe few years that we may have to live here shall we not meet again and shall we not love each other then  i hope so  if you can really hope it then why should we not be happy but how could i hope it if with my eyes open i were to bring a great misfortune upon him if i did him an evil here could i hope that he would love me in heaven when he would know all the secrets of my heart but if he shall say to himself that i denied myselffor his sake that i refused to be taken into his arms because it would be bad for him then though there may be some one dearer then shall not i also be dear to him the other girl could only cling to her and embrace her when he shall have strong boys round his hearththe hearth he spoke of as though it were almost mineand little girls with pink cheeks and bonny brows and shall know as he will then what i might have done for him will he not pray for me and tell me in his prayers that when we shall meet hereafter i shall still be dear to him and when she knows it all she who shall lie on his breast shall i not be dear also to her  oh my sister  he will tell her i think he will tell herbecause of his truth his honour and his manliness  lady frances before she left the house had been made to understand that her brother could not have his way in the matter which was so near his heart and that the quakers daughter would certainly have hers     chapter vi  but he ishe is   george roden had come to a decision as to his title and had told every one concerned that he meant to be as he always had beengeorge roden a clerk in the post office when spoken to on this side and the other as to the proprietyor rather improprietyof his decision he had smiled for the most part and had said but little but had been very confident in himself to none of the arguments used against him would he yield in the least as to his mothers name he said no one had doubted and no one would doubt it for a moment his mothers name had been settled by herself and she had borne it for a quarter of a century she had not herself thought of changing it for her to blaze out into the world as a duchessit would be contrary to her feelings to her taste and to her comfort she would have no means of maintaining the titleand would be reduced to the necessity of still living in paradise row with the simple addition of an absurd nickname as to that no question had been raised it was only for him that she required the new appellation  as for herself the whole thing had been settled at once by her own good judgment  as for himself he said the arguments were still stronger against the absurd use of the grand title it was imperative on him to earn his bread and his only means of doing so was by doing his work as a clerk in the post office everybody admitted that it would not be becoming that a duke should be a clerk in the post office it would be so unbecoming he declared that he doubted whether any man could be found brave enough to go through the world with such a fools cap on his head at any rate he had no such courage moreover no englishman as he had been told could at his own will and pleasure call himself by a foreign title it was his pleasure to be an englishman he had always been an englishman as an inhabitant of holloway he had voted for two radical members for the borough of islington he would not stultify his own proceedings and declare that everything which he had done was wrong it was thus that he argued the matter and as it seemed no one could take upon himself to prove that he was an italian or to prove that he was a duke  but though he seemed to be if not logical at any rate rational the world generally did not agree with him wherever he was encountered there seemed to be an opinion that he ought to assume whatever name and whatever rights belonged to his father even at the post office the world was against him  i dont quite know why you couldnt do it said sir boreas when roden put it to him whether it would be practicable that a young man calling himself duca di crinola should take his place as a clerk in mr jerninghams room it may be remembered that sir boreas had himself expressed some difficulty in the matter he had told mr jerningham that he did not think that they could get on very well with a real duke among them it was thus that the matter had at first struck him but he was a brave man and when he came to look at it all round he did not see that there would be any impossibility it would be a nine days wonder no doubt but the man would be there just the samethe post office clerk inside the duke the work would be done and after a little time even he would become used to having a duke among his subordinates as to whether the duke were a foreigner or an englishmanthat he declared would not matter in the least as far as the post office was concerned i really dont see why you shouldnt try it said sir boreas  the absurdity would be so great that it would crush me sir i shouldnt be worth my salt said roden  thats a kind of thing that wears itself out very quickly you would feel odd at firstand so would the other men and the messengers i should feel a little odd when i asked some one to send the duca di crinola to me for we are not in the habit of sending for dukes but there is nothing that you cant get used to if your father had been a prince i dont think i should break down under it after the first month  what good would it do me sir boreas  i think it would do you good it is difficult to explain the goodparticularly to a man who is so violently opposed as you to all ideas of rank but  you mean that i should get promoted quicker because of my title  i think it probable that the civil service generally would find itself able to do something more for a good officer with a high name than for a good officer without one  then sir boreas the civil service ought to be ashamed of itself  perhaps sobut such would be the fact somebody would interfere to prevent the anomaly of the duca di crinola sitting at the same table with mr crocker i will not dispute it with youwhether it ought to be sobut if it be probable there is no reason why you should not take advantage of your good fortune if you have capacity and courage enough to act up to it of course what we all want in life is success if a chance comes in your way i dont see why you should fling it away this was the wisdom of sir boreas but roden would not take advantage of it he thanked the great man for his kindness and sympathy but declined to reconsider his decision  in the outer officein the room for instance in which mr jerningham sat with crocker and bobbin and geraghty the feeling was very much stronger in favour of the title and was expressed in stronger language crocker could not contain himself when he heard that there was a doubt upon the subject on rodens first arrival at the office crocker almost flung himself into his friends arms with just a single exclamation duca duca duca he had said and had then fallen back into his own seat overcome by his emotions roden had passed this by without remark it was very distasteful to him and disgusting he would fain have been able to sit down at his own desk and go on with his own work without any special notice of the occasion other than the ordinary greeting occasioned by his return it was distressing to him that anything should have been known about his father and his fathers title but that it should be known was natural the world had heard of it the world had put it into the newspapers and the world had talked about it of course mr jerningham also would talk of it and the two younger clerksand crocker crocker would of course talk of it louder than any one else that was to be expected a certain amount of misconduct was to be expected from crocker and must be forgiven therefore he passed over the ecstatic and almost hysterical repetition of the title which his father had borne hoping that crocker might be overcome by the effort and be tranquil but crocker was not so easily overcome he did sit for a moment or two on his seat with his mouth open but he was only preparing himself for his great demonstration  we are very glad to see you againsir said mr jerningham not at first quite knowing how it would become him to address his fellowclerk  thank you mr jerningham i have got back again safe  i am sure we are all delighted to hearwhat we have heard said mr jerningham cautiously  by george yes said bobbin i suppose its true isnt it such a beautiful name  there are so many things are true and so many are false that i dont quite know how to answer you said roden  but you are asked geraghty and then he stopped not quite daring to trust himself with the grand title  nothats just what im not replied the other  but he is shouted crocker jumping from his seat he is he is its quite true he is duca di crinola of course well call him so mr jerninghameh  i am sure i dont know said mr jerningham with great caution  youll allow me to know my own name said roden  no no continued crocker its all very well for your modesty but its a kind of thing which your friends cant stand we are quite sure that youre the duca there was something in the italian title which was peculiarly soothing to crockers ears a man has to be called by what he is not by what he chooses if the duke of middlesex called himself mr smith hed be duke all the samewouldnt he mr jerningham all the world would call him duke so it must be with you i wouldnt call your grace mr  you know what i mean but i wont pronounce it ever againnot for ever so much rodens brow became very black as he found himself subjected to the effects of the mans folly i call upon the whole office continued crocker for the sake of its own honour to give our dear and highlyesteemed friend his proper name on all occasions heres to the health of the duca di crinola just at that moment crockers lunch had been brought in consisting of bread and cheese and a pint of stout the pewter pot was put to his mouth and the toast was drank to the honour and glory of the drinkers noble friend with no feeling of intended ridicule it was a grand thing to crocker to have been brought into contact with a man possessed of so noble a title in his heart of hearts he reverenced the duca he would willingly have stayed there till six or seven oclock and have done all the ducas work for himbecause the duca was a duca he would not have done it satisfactorily because it was not in his nature to do any work well but he would have done it as well as he did his own he hated work but he would have sooner worked all night than see a duca do itso great was his reverence for the aristocracy generally  mr crocker said mr jerningham severely you are making yourself a nuisance you generally do  a nuisance  yes a nuisance when you see that a gentleman doesnt wish a thing you oughtnt to do it  but when a mans name is his name  never mind when he doesnt wish it you oughtnt to do it  if its a mans own real name  never mind said mr jerningham  if it shoots a gintleman to be incognito why isnt he to do as he plaises asked geraghty  if the duke of middlesex did call himself mr smith said bobbin any gentleman that was a gentleman would fall in with his views crocker not conquered but for the moment silenced seated himself in a dudgeon at his desk it might do very well for poor fellows weak creatures like jerningham bobbin and geraghty thus to be done out of their preybut he would not be cheated in that way the duca di crinola should be duca di crinola as far as he crocker could make his voice heard and all that heard him should know that the duca was his own old peculiar friend  in paradise row the world was decidedly against roden and not only were the demijohns and duffers against him but also his own mother and her friend mrs vincent on the first monday after mrs rodens return mrs vincent came to the row as usualon this occasion to welcome her cousin and to hear all the news of the family as it had been at last brought back from italy there was a great deal to be told many things had been brought to light which had had their commencement in mrs vincents days there was something of the continuation of a mild triumph for her in every word that was spoken she had been against the di crinola marriage when it had been first discussed more than a quarter of a century ago she had never believed in the duca di crinola and her want of faith had been altogether justified she did not after all those years bear hardly on her friendbut there was still that wellknown tone of gentle censure and of gentle selfapplause i told you so said the elder crow to the younger crow when does the old crow cease to remind the younger crow that it was so a sad sad story said mrs vincent shaking her head  all our stories i suppose have much in them that is sad i have got my son and no mother can have more reason to be proud of a son mrs vincent shook her head i say it is so repeated the mother and having such a son i will not admit that it has all been sad  i wish he were more ready to perform his religious duties said mrs vincent  we cannot all agree about everything i do not know that that need be brought up now  it is a matter that should be brought up every hour and every day maryif the bringing of it up is to do any good  but it was not on this matter that mrs roden now wished to get assistance from her cousincertainly not with any present view towards the amelioration of her sons religious faith that might come afterwards perhaps but it was her present object to induce her cousin to agree with her that her son should permit himself to be called by his fathers title but you think he should take his fathers name she asked mrs vincent shook her head and tried to look wise the question was one on which her feelings were very much divided it was of course proper that the son should be called by his fathers name all the proprieties of the world as known to mrs vincent declared that it should be so she was a woman too who by no means despised rank and who considered that much reverence was due to those who were privileged to carry titles dukes and lords were certainly very great in her estimation and even the humblest knight was respected by her as having been in some degree lifted above the community by the will of his sovereign and though she was always in some degree hostile to george roden because of the liberties he took in regard to certain religious matters yet she was good enough and kind enough to wish well to her own cousin had there been a question in regard to an english title she certainly would not have shaken her head but as to this outlandish italian title she had her doubts it did not seem to her to be right that an englishman should be called a duca if it had been baron or even count the name would have been less offensive and then to her mind hereditary titles as she had known them had been recommended by hereditary possessions there was something to her almost irreligious in the idea of a duke without an acre she could therefore only again shake her head he has as much right to it continued mrs roden as has the eldest son of the greatest peer in england  i dare say he has my dear but  but what  i dare say youre right only only its not just like an english peer you know  the privilege of succession is the same  he never could sit in the house of lords my dear  of course not he would assume only what is his own why should he be ashamed to take an italian title any more than his friend lord hampstead is to take an english one it is not as though it would prevent his living here many foreign noblemen live in england  i suppose he could live here said mrs vincent as though she were making a great admission i dont think that there would be any law to turn him out of the country  nor out of the post office if he chooses to remain there said mrs roden  i dont know how that may be  even if they did i should prefer that it should be so according to my thinking no man should fling away a privilege that is his own or should be ashamed of assuming a nobility that belongs to him if not for his own sake he should do it for the sake of his children he at any rate has nothing to be ashamed of in the name it belonged to his father and to his grandfather and to his ancestors through many generations think how men fight for a title in this country how they struggle for it when there is a doubt as to who may properly have inherited it here there is no doubt here there need be no struggle convinced by the weight of this argument mrs vincent gave in her adhesion and at last expressed an opinion that her cousin should at once call himself by his fathers name     chapter vii  the great question   neither were the arguments of mrs roden nor the adhesion of mrs vincent of any power in persuading george roden he answered his mother gently kindly but very firmly had anything he said been necessary to strengthen his own feeling it would have been found in his mothers determination to keep his old name surely mother if i may say so without disrespect what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander at this the mother smiled kissing her son to show that the argument had been taken in good part in this matter he continued we certainly are in a boat together if i am a duke you would be a duchess if i am doomed to make an ape of myself at the post office you must be equally ridiculous in paradise rowunless you are prepared to go back to italy and live your life there  and you  i could not live there how could i earn my bread there how could i pass my days so as to be in any degree useful what could be more mean my uncle though he has been civil and to a certain degree generous would be specially anxious not to see me in public life you and i together would have just means enough for existence i should be doomed to walk about the streets of some thirdrate italian town and call myself by my grand name would a life like that satisfy your ambition on my behalf then she thought of the girl who was in love with him of the friends whom he had made for himself of the character which belonged to him and she was driven to confess that by whatever name he might be called he must continue to live an englishmans life and to live in england nevertheless she told herself that the title would not be abolished because it might be in abeyance she might she thought still live to hear her son called by the name of which she herself had been proud till she had become thoroughly ashamed of the husband who had given it to her  but there were others besides crocker and mrs vincent and his mother and sir boreas who were much interested by george rodens condition mrs roden returned home on the 2nd of march and as may be remembered the tidings respecting her son had reached england before she came by the end of the month many persons were much exercised as to the young mans future name and some people of high rank had not only discussed the subject at great length but had written numerous letters concerning it it was manifest to lady persiflage that no further attempt should now be made to throw obstacles in the way of lady frances and her lover lady persiflage had never believed in the obstacles from the first of course theyll marry she had said to her one daughter who was now almost as good as married herself and equally trustworthy when a girl is determined like that of course nothing will stop her my sister shouldnt have let her meet the young man at first but this had been said before the young man had turned out to be an italian duke since the news had come lady persiflage had been very eager in recommending her sister to discontinue the opposition make the most of him she had said in one of her letters it is all that can be done now it is a fine name and though italian titles do not count like ours yet when they are as good as this they go for a good deal there are real records of the di crinola family and there is no manner of doubt but that he is the head of them take him by the hand and have him down at trafford if kingsbury is well enough they tell me he is quite presentable with a good figure and all thatby no means a young man who will stand shivering in a room because he doesnt know how to utter a word had he been like that fanny would never have set her heart upon him persiflage has been talking about him and he says that something will be sure to turn up if he is brought forward properly and is not ashamed of his family name persiflage will do whatever he can but that can only be if you will open your arms to him lady kingsbury did feel that she was called upon to undergo a terrible revulsion of sentiment opening her arms to the duca di crinola might be possible to her but how was she to open her arms to lady frances trafford the man whom she had seen but once might appear before her with his new title as a young nobleman of whose antecedents she was not bound to remember anything she might seem to regard him as a new arrival a noble suitor for her stepdaughters hand of whom she had not before heard but how was she to receive fanny trafford the girl whom she had locked up at königsgraaf whose letters she had stopped as they came from the post office nevertheless she consentedas far at least as her sister was concerned i shall never like fanny she had said because she is so sly girls are always called sly by their friends who want to abuse them but of course i will have them both here as you think it will be best what they are to live upon heaven only knows but of course that will be no concern of mine  as a first result of this lady persiflage asked george roden down to castle hautboy for the easter holidays there was a difficulty about this how was he to be addressed hampstead was consulted and he though he was not much in heart just then for the arrangement of such a matter advised that for the present his friends old name should be used lady persiflage therefore wrote togeorge roden esq at the general post office in this letter it was signified that lord persiflage was very anxious to make the acquaintance ofmr roden lady persiflage was also very anxious lady persiflage explained that she was aware ofwell lady frances trafford was to be at castle hautboy and that she thought might act as an inducement tomr roden the letter was very cleverly managed  though it never once mentioned the grand title it made allusions which implied that the real rank of the post office clerk was well known to every one at castle hautboy and though nothing of course was said as to any possible relations between lord persiflage as a member of the british cabinet and the clerks uncle as a member of the italian cabinet nevertheless as to this also there were allusions which were intelligible this letter was altogether very gracioussuch a one as few young men would be able to resist coming from such a person as lady persiflage but the special offer which prevailed with our post office clerk was no doubt the promise of the presence of fanny trafford in all the rest gracious as the words were there was nothing but trouble for him it was clear enough to him that lady persiflage was on the same side as crocker lady persiflage would no doubt prefer a duca di crinola to a post office clerk for lady frances and he could see also that the secretary of state for foreign affairs was on the same side the secretary of state would not have expressed a special desire to see him the post office clerk at castle hautboy and have as it were welcomed him to the possession of his brotherinlaws daughter had nothing been told of the duca di crinola he heard as much from lord hampstead who advised him to go to castle hautboy and make himself acquainted with fannys family friends it was all manifest and as it was all being done in opposition to his own firm resolution he would not have gonebut that the temptation was too great for him fanny trafford would be thereand he was quite open to the charm of the offer which was almost being made to him of lady fannys hand he arranged the matter at the office and wrote to lady persiflage accepting the invitation  so youre going to castle hautboy said crocker to him crocker was in torments at the time he had been made to understand that he would be doing quite wrong in calling the duca your grace roden if a duke at all could be only an italian dukeand not on that account your grace this had been explained by bobbin and had disturbed him the title duca was still open to him but he feared rodens wrath if he should use it too freely  how do you know asked roden  i have been there myself you knowand am in the habit of hearing from castle hautboy his father was agent on the property and of course he heard tidings if not from his father at any rate from his sisters  yes i am going to castle hautboy  hampstead will be there probably i met hampstead there a man in lord persiflages position will of course be delighted to welcome thetheduca di crinola he shrank as though he feared that roden would strike himbut he uttered the words  of course if you choose to annoy me i cannot well help myself said roden as he left the room  on his first arrival at the castle things were allowed to go quietly with him every one called him mr roden lady persiflage received him very graciously lady frances was in the house and her name was mentioned to him with the whispered intimacy which on such occasions indicates the triumph of the mans position she made no allusion either to his rank or to his office but treated him just as she might have done any other suitorwhich was exactly what he wanted lord llwddythlw had come down for his easter holidays of two days and was very civil to him lady amaldina was delighted to make his acquaintance and within three minutes was calling upon him to promise that he would not get himself married before august in consideration for her bevy if i was to lose fanny now she said i really think i should give it up altogether then before dinner he was allowed to find himself alone with fanny and for the first time in his life felt that his engagement was an acknowledged thing  all this was made very pleasant to him by the occasional use of his proper name he had been almost ashamed of himself because of the embarrassment which his supposed title had occasioned him he felt that he had thought of the matter more than it was worth the annoyances of crocker had been abominable to him it was not likely that he should encounter a second crocker but still he dreaded he hardly knew what it certainly was not probable that these people at castle hautboy should call him by a name he had never used without consulting him but still he had dreaded something and was gratified that the trouble seemed to pass by him easily lady persiflage and lady amaldina had both used his legitimate name and lord llwddythlw had called him nothing at all if he could only be allowed to go away just as he had come without an allusion from any one to the di crinola family then he should think that the people at castle hautboy were very wellbred but he feared that this was almost too much to hope he did not see lord persiflage till a moment before dinner when he specially remarked that he was introduced as mr roden very glad to see you mr roden i hope youre fond of scenery were supposed to have the finest view in england from the top of the tower i have no doubt my daughter will show it you i cant say that i ever saw it myself beautiful scenery is all very well when you are travelling but nobody ever cares for it at home thus lord persiflage had done his courtesy to the stranger and the conversation became general as though the stranger were a stranger no longer when roden found that he was allowed to give his arm to lady frances and go out and eat his dinner quietly and comfortably without any reference to the peculiarity of his position he thought that perhaps no further troubles were in store for him  the whole of the next day was devoted to the charms of love and scenery the spring weather was delightful and roden was allowed to ramble about where he pleased with lady frances every one about the place regarded him as an accepted and recognized lover as he had never been in truth accepted by one of the family except by the girl herselfas the marquis had not condescended even to see him when he had come but had sent mr greenwood to reject him scornfully as the marchioness had treated him as below contempt as even his own friend lord hampstead had declared that the difficulties would be insuperable this sudden cessation of all impediments did seem to be delightfully miraculous assent on the part of lord and lady persiflage would he understood be quite as serviceable as that of lord and lady kingsbury something had occurred which in the eyes of all the family had lifted him up as it were out of the gutter and placed him on a grand pedestal there could be no doubt as to this something it was all done because he was supposed to be an italian nobleman and yet he was not an italian nobleman nor would he allow any one to call him so as far as it might be in his power to prevent it  his visit was limited to two entire days one was passed amidst all the sweets of lovemaking with the pleasures of that no allusions were allowed to interfere on the following morning he found himself alone with lord persiflage after breakfast delighted to have had you down here you know began his lordship to this roden simply bowed i havent the pleasure of knowing your uncle personally but there isnt a man in europe for whom i have a higher respect again roden bowed ive heard all about this romance of yours from dossi you know dossi roden declared that he had not the honour of knowing the italian minister ah well you must know dossi of course i wont say whether hes your countryman or not but you must know him he is your uncles particular friend  its only by accident that i know my uncle or even learnt that he was my uncle  just so but the accident has taken place and the result fortunately remains of course you must take your own name  i shall keep the name i have lord persiflage  you will find it to be quite impossible the queen will not allow it upon hearing this roden opened his eyes but the secretary of state for foreign affairs looked him full in the face as though to assure him that though he had never heard of such a thing before such in fact was the truth of course there will be difficulties im not prepared at the present moment to advise how this should be done perhaps you had better wait till her majesty has signified her pleasure to receive you as the duca di crinola when she has done so you will have no alternative  no alternative as to what i may call myself  none in the least i should say i am thinking now in a great measure as to the welfare of my own relative lady frances something will have to be done i dont quite see my way as yet but something no doubt will be done the duca di crinola will i have no doubt find fitting employment then a little bell was rung and vivian the private secretary came into the room vivian and roden knew each other and a few pleasant words were spoken but roden found himself obliged to take his departure without making any further protests in regard to her majestys assumed wishes  about five oclock that evening he was invited into a little sittingroom belonging to lady persiflage upstairs havent i been very good to you she said laughing  very good indeed nothing could be so good as inviting me down here to castle hautboy  that was done for fannys sake but have i said one word to you about your terrible name  no indeed and now lady persiflage pray go on and be good to the end  yes she said i will be good to the endbefore all the people downstairs i havent said a word of it even to fanny fanny is an angel  according to my thinking  thats of course but even an angel likes to have her proper rank you mustnt allow yourself to suppose that even fanny trafford is indifferent to titles there are things that a man may expect a girl to do for him but there are things which cannot be expected let her be ever so much in love fanny trafford has got to become duchess of crinola  i am afraid that that is more than i can do for her  my dear mr roden it must be done i cannot let you go away from here without making you understand that as a man engaged to be married you cannot drop your title did you intend to remain single i cannot say how far your peculiar notions might enable you to prevail but as you mean to marry she too will have rights i put it to you whether it would be honest on your part to ask her to abandon the rank which she will be entitled to expect from you just you think of it mr roden and now i wont trouble you any more upon the subject  not a word more was said on the subject at castle hautboy and on the next day he returned to the post office     chapter viii  i cannot compel her   about the middle of april lord and lady kingsbury came up to london from day to day and week to week he had declared that he would never again be able to move out of his room and had gone on making up his mind to die immediately till people around him began to think that he was not going to die at all he was however at last persuaded that he might at any rate as well die in london as at trafford and therefore allowed himself to be carried up to park lane the condition of his own health was of course given to him for the reason of this movement at this peculiar period of the year it would be better for him they said to be near his london doctor no doubt the marquis believed that it was so when a man is ill nothing is so important to him as his own illness but it may be a question whether the anxiety felt by the marchioness as to other affairs of the family generally had not an effect with her in inducing her to persuade her husband the marquis had given a modified assent to his daughters marriage and she in a manner still more modified had withdrawn her opposition permission had been given to fanny to marry the duca di crinola this had been given without any reference to money but had certainly implied a promise of a certain amount of income from the brides father how else would it be possible that they should live the letter had been written to lady frances by her stepmother at the dictation of the marquis but the words absolutely dictated had not perhaps been religiously followed the father had intended to be soft and affectionate merely expressing his gratification that his girls lover should turn out to be the duca di crinola out of this the marchioness had made a stipulation the lover should be received as a lover on condition that he bore the name and title lady persiflage had told her sister that as a matter of course the name would be taken a man always takes his fathers name as a matter of course lady persiflage had said she believed that the mans absurd notions would be overcome by continual social pressure whether the social pressure would or would not prevail the man would certainly marry the girl there could therefore be no better course than that of trusting to social pressure lady persiflage was quite clear as to her course but the marchioness though yielding to her sister in much still thought that a bargain should be made it had been suggested that she should invite the young man down to trafford roden was usually called the young man at present in these family conclaves she had thought that it would be better to see him up in london lady frances would come to them in park lane and then the young man should be invited the marchioness would send her compliments to the duca di crinola nothing on earth should induce her to write the name of rodenunless it might happily come to pass that the engagement should be broken  hampstead at this time was still living at hendon his sister remained with him till the marchioness came up to town about the middle of april but no one else except george roden saw much of him since rodens return from italy his visits to hendon hall had been tacitly permitted the kingsbury and persiflage world had taken upon itself to presume that the young man was the duca di crinola and so presuming had in truth withdrawn all impediments lady frances had written to her father in answer to the letter which had reached her from the marchioness in his name and had declared that mr roden was mr roden and would remain mr roden she had explained his reasons at great length but had probably made them anything but intelligible to her father he however had simply concealed the letter when he had halfread it he would not incur the further trouble of explaining this to his wife and had allowed the matter to go on although the stipulation made was absolutely repudiated by the parties who were to have been bound by it  for roden and lady frances this was no doubt very pleasant even lady amaldina hauteville with her bevy was not more thoroughly engaged to her aristocratic lover than was lady frances to this precarious italian nobleman but the brother in these days was by no means as happy as his sister there had been a terrible scene between him and lady frances after his return from trafford he came back with marions letter in his pocketwith every word contained in it clear in his memory but still still doubting as to the necessity of obeying marions orders she had declared with whatever force of words she had known how to use that the marriage which he proposed to himself was impossible she had told him so more than once before and the telling had availed nothing her first assertion that she could not become his wife had hardly served to moderate in the least the joy which he had felt from the assurances of her affections it had meant nothing to him when she had spoken to him simply of their differences of rank he had thrown the arguments under his feet and had trampled upon them with his masterful imperious determination his whole life and energy were devoted to the crushing of arguments used towards him by those who were daily telling him that he was severed from other men by the peculiarities of his rank he certainly would not be severed from this one woman whom he loved by any such peculiarity fortifying his heart by these reflections he had declared to himself that the timid doubtings of the girl should go for nothing as she loved him he would of course be strong enough to conquer all such doubtings he would take her up in his arms and carry her away and simply tell her that she had got to do it he had a conviction that a girl when once she had confessed that she loved a man belonged to the man and was bound to obey him to watch over her to worship her to hover round her so that no wind should be allowed to blow too strongly on her to teach her that she was the one treasure in the world that could be of real value to himbut at the same time to make a property of her so that she should be altogether his ownthat had been his idea of the bond which should unite him and marion fay together as she took a joy in his love it could not be but that she would come to his call at last  she too had perceived something of thisso much that it had become necessary to her to tell him the whole truth those minor reasons though even they should have been strong enough were not she found powerful with him she tried it and acknowledged to herself that she failed the man was too wilful for her guidancetoo strong for the arguments by which she had hoped to control him then it had been necessary to tell him all the truth this she had done at last with very few words my mother died and all my brothers and sisters have died and i also shall die young very simple this had been but ah powerful as it was simple in it there had been a hard assertion of facts too strong even for his masterful nature he could not say even to himself that it was not sothat it should not be so it might be that she might be spared where others had not been spared that risk of course he was prepared to run without turning it much in his thoughts without venturing to think of the results or to make a calculation he was prepared to tell her that she too must leave all that in the hand of god and run her chance as do all human mortal beings he certainly would so argue the matter with her but he could not tell her that there was no ground for fear he could not say that though her mother had died and though her little brothers and sisters had died there was yet no cause for fear and he felt that should she persist in her resolution there would be a potency about her which it might well be that he should fail to dominate if we can live let us live together and if we must die let us dieas nearly together as may be that we should come together is the one thing absolutely essential and then let us make our way through our troubles as best we may under the hands of fate this was what he would now say to her but he knew that he could not say it with that bright look and those imperious tones which had heretofore almost prevailed with her not replying to marions letter by any written answer but resolving that the words which would be necessary might best be spoken he came back to hendon oh how softly they should be spoken with his arm round her waist he would tell her that still it should be for better or for worse i will say nothing of what may happen except thisthat whatever may befall us we will take it and bear it together with such words whispered into her ear would he endeavour to make her understand that though it might all be true still would her duty be the same  but when he reached his house intending to go on almost at once to holloway he was stopped by a note from the quaker  my dear young friend said the note from the quaker      i am desired by marion to tell thee that we have thought    it better that she should go for a few weeks to the    seaside i have taken her to pegwell bay whence i can    run up daily to my work in the city after that thou last    saw her she was somewhat unwellnot ill indeed but    flurried as was natural by the interview and i have    taken her down to the seaside in compliance with medical    advice she bids me however to tell thee that there    is no cause for alarm it will however be better for    a time at least that she should not be called upon to    encounter the excitement of meeting thee     thy very faithful friend     zachary fay   this made him nervous and for the moment almost wretched it was his desire at first to rush off to pegwell bay and learn for himself what might be the truth of her condition but on consideration he felt that he did not dare to do so in opposition to the quakers injunction his arrival there among the strangers of the little wateringplace would of course flurry her he was obliged to abandon that idea and content himself with a resolve to see the quaker in the city on the next morning but the words spoken to him afterwards by his sister were heavier to bear than the quakers letter dear john she had said you must give it up  i will never give it up he had answered and as he spoke there came across his brows an angry look of determination  dear john  what right have you to tell me to give it up what would you say to me if i were to declare that george roden should be given up  if there were the same cause  what do you know of any cause  dear dearest brother  you are taking a part against me you can be obstinate i am not more likely to give a thing up than you are yourself  it is her health  is she the first young woman that was ever married without being as strong as a milkmaid why should you take upon yourself to condemn her  it is not i it is marion herself you told me to go to her and of course she spoke to me  he paused a moment and then in a hoarse low voice asked a question what did she say to you when you spoke to her  oh johni doubt i can hardly tell you what she said but you know what she said did she not write and tell you that because of her health it cannot be as you would have it  and would you have me yield because for my sake she is afraid if george roden were not strong would you throw him over and go away  it is a hard matter to discuss john  but it has to be discussed it has at any rate to be thought of i dont think that a woman has a right to take the matter into her own hands and say that as a certainty god almighty has condemned her to an early death these things must be left to providence or chance or fate as you may call it  but if she has her own convictions  she must not be left to her own convictions it is just that she must not be allowed to sacrifice herself to a fantastic idea  you will never prevail with her said his sister taking him by the arm and looking up piteously into his face  i shall not prevail do you say that certainly i shall not prevail she was still holding his arm and still looking up into his face and now she answered him by slightly shaking her head why should you speak so positively  she could say things to me which she could hardly say to you  what was it then  she could say things to me which i can hardly repeat to you oh john believe mebelieve me it must be abandoned marion fay will never be your wife he shook himself free from her hand and frowned sternly at her do you think i would not have her for my sister if it were possible do you not believe that i too can love her who can help loving her  he knew of course that as the shoe pinched him it could not pinch her what were any other love or any other sadness as compared to his love or to his sadness it was to him as though the sun were suddenly taken out of his heaven as though the light of day were destroyed for ever from before his eyesor rather as though a threat were being made that the sun should be taken from his heaven and the light from his eyesa threat under which it might be necessary that he should succumb marion marion marion he said to himself again and again walking up and down between the lodge and the hall door whether well or ill whether living or dying she surely must be his marion and then he was ashamed of himself as he felt rather than heard that he had absolutely shouted her name aloud  on the following day he was with the quaker in london walking up and down old broad street in front of the entrance leading up to pogson and littlebirds my dear friend said the quaker i do not say that it shall never be so it is in the hands of the almighty hampstead shook his head impatiently you do not doubt the power of the almighty to watch over his creatures  i think that if a man wants a thing he must work for it  the quaker looked him hard in the face in the ordinary needs of life my young lord the maxim is a good one  it is good for everything you tell me of the almighty will the almighty give me the girl i love if i sit still and hold my peace must i not work for that as for anything else  what can i do lord hampstead  agree with me that it will be better for her to run her chance say as i do that it cannot be right that she should condemn herself if youyou her fatherwill bid her then she will do it  i do not know  you can try with herif you think it right you are her father  yesi am her father  and she is obedient to you you do not think that she should eh  how am i to say what am i to say else than that it is in gods hands i am an old man who have suffered much all have been taken from meall but she how can i think of thy trouble when my own is so heavy  it is of her that we should think  i cannot comfort her i cannot control her i will not even attempt to persuade her she is all that i have if i did think for a moment that i should like to see my child become the wife of one so high as thou art that folly has been crushed out of me to have my child alive would be enough for me now let alone titles and high places and noble palaces  who has thought of them  i did not shemy angel my white one hampstead shook his head and clenched his fist shaking it in utter disregard of the passers by as the hot fast tears streamed down his face could it be necessary that her name should be mentioned even in connection with feelings such as those which the quaker owned  thou and i my lord continued zachary fay are in sore trouble about this maiden i believe that thy love is as mine true honest and thorough for her sake i wish i could give her to theebecause of thy truth and honesty not because of thy wealth and titles but she is not mine to give she is her ownand will bestow her hand or refuse to do so as her own sense of what is best for thee may direct her i will say no word to persuade her one way or the other so speaking the quaker strode quickly up the gateway and lord hampstead was left to make his way back out of the city as best he might     chapter ix  in park lane   on monday the 20th of april lady frances returned to her fathers roof the winter had certainly not been a happy time for her early in the autumn she had been taken off to the german castle in great disgrace because of her plebeian lover and had ever since been living under so dark a cloud as to have been considered unfit for the companionship of those little darlings the young lords her halfbrothers she had had her way no doubt never having for a moment wavered in her constancy to the post office clerk but she had been assured incessantly by all her friends that her marriage with the man was impossible and had no doubt suffered under the conviction that her friends were hostile to her now she might be happy now she was to be taken back to her fathers house now she was to keep her lover and not be held to have been disgraced at all no doubt in this there was great triumph  but her triumph had been due altogether to an accidentto what her father graciously called a romance while her stepmother described it less civilly as a marvellous coincidence for which she ought to thank her stars on her bended knees the accidentor coincidence or romance as it might be calledwas of course her lovers title of this she was by no means proud and would not at all thank her stars for it on her bended knees though she was happy in her lovers presence her happiness was clouded by the feeling that she was imposing upon her father she had been allowed to ask her lover to dine at kingsbury house because her lover was supposed to be the duca di crinola but the invitation had been sent under an envelope addressed to george roden esq general post office no one had yet ventured to inscribe the dukes name and title on the back of a letter the marchioness was assured by her sister that it would all come right and had therefore submitted to have the young man asked to come and eat his dinner under the same roof with her darlings but she did not quite trust her sister and felt that after all it might become her imperative duty to gather her children together in her bosom and fly with them from contact with the post office clerkthe post office clerk who would not become a duke the marquis himself was only anxious that everything should be made to be easy he had while at trafford been so tormented by mr greenwood and his wife that he longed for nothing so much as a reconciliation with his daughter he was told on very good authorityon the authority of no less a person than the secretary of statethat this young man was the duca di crinola there had been a romance a very interesting romance but the fact remained the post office clerk was no longer george roden and would he was assured soon cease to be a post office clerk the young man was in truth an italian nobleman of the highest order and as such was entitled to marry the daughter of an english nobleman if it should turn out that he had been misinformed that would not be his fault  so it was when george roden came to dine at kingsbury house he himself at this moment was not altogether happy the last words which lady persiflage had said to him at castle hautboy had disturbed him would it be honest on your part lady persiflage had asked him to ask her to abandon the rank which she will be entitled to expect from you he had not put the matter to himself in that light before lady frances was entitled to as much consideration in the matter as was himself the rank would be as much hers as his and yet he couldnt do it not even for her sake could he walk into the post office and call himself the duca di crinola not even for her sake could he consent to live an idle useless life as an italian nobleman love was very strong with him but with it there was a sense of duty and manliness which would make it impossible for him to submit himself to such thraldom in doing it he would have to throw over all the strong convictions of his life and yet he was about to sit as a guest at lord kingsburys table because lord kingsbury would believe him to be an italian nobleman he was not therefore altogether happy when he knocked at the marquiss door  hampstead had refused to join the party he was not at present in a condition to join any social gathering but omitting him a family party had been collected lord and lady persiflage were there with lady amaldina and her betrothed the persiflages had taken the matter up very strongly so that they may have been said to have become george rodens special patrons or protectors lord persiflage who was seldom much in earnest about anything had determined that the duca di crinola should be recognized and was supposed already to have spoken a word on the subject in a very high quarter indeed vivian the private secretary was there the poor marquis himself was considered unable to come down into the diningroom but did receive his proposed soninlaw upstairs they had not met since the unfortunate visit made by the post office clerk to hendon hall when no one had as yet dreamed of his iniquity nor had the marchioness seen him since the terrible sound of that feminine christian name had wounded her ears the other persons assembled had in a measure become intimate with him lord llwddythlw had walked round castle hautboy and discussed with him the statistics of telegraphy lady amaldina had been confidential with him as to her own wedding both lord and lady persiflage had given him in a very friendly manner their ideas as to his name and position vivian and he had become intimate personal friends they could all of them accept him with open arms when he was shown into the drawingroom except lady kingsbury herself no i am not very well just at present said the marquis from his recumbent position as he languidly stretched out his hand you wont see me down at dinner god knows whether anybody will ever see me down at dinner again  not see you down at dinner said lord persiflage in another month you will be talking treason in pall mall as you have done all your life  i wish you had made hampstead come with you mr but the marquis stopped himself having been instructed that he was not on any account to call the young man mr roden he was here this morning but seemed to be in great trouble about something he ought to come and take his place at the bottom of the table seeing how ill i ambut he wont  lady kingsbury waited until her husband had done his grumbling before she attempted the disagreeable task which was before her it was very disagreeable she was a bad hypocrite there are women who have a special gift of hiding their dislikings from the objects of them when occasion requires they can smile and be soft with bitter enmity in their hearts to suit the circumstances of the moment and as they do so their faces will overcome their hearts and their enmity will give way to their smiles they will become almost friendly because they look friendly they will cease to hate because hatred is no longer convenient but the marchioness was too rigid and too sincere for this she could command neither her features nor her feelings it was evident from the moment the young man entered the room that she would be unable to greet him even with common courtesy she hated him and she had told every one there that she hated him how do you do she said just touching his hand as soon as he was released from her husbands couch she too had been specially warned by her sister that she must not call the young man by any name if she could have addressed him by his title her manner might perhaps have been less austere  i am much obliged to you by allowing me to come here said roden looking her full in the face and making his little speech in such a manner as to be audible to all the room it was as though he had declared aloud his intention of accepting this permission as conveying much more than a mere invitation to dinner her face became harder and more austere than ever then finding that she had nothing more to say to him she seated herself and held her peace  only that lady persiflage was very unlike her sister the moment would have been awkward for them all poor fanny who was sitting with her hand within her fathers could not find a word to say on the occasion lord persiflage turning round upon his heel made a grimace to his private secretary llwddythlw would willingly have said something pleasant on the occasion had he been sufficiently ready as it was he stood still with his hands in his trousers pockets and his eyes fixed on the wall opposite according to his idea the marchioness was misbehaving herself dear aunt clara said lady amaldina trying to say something that might dissipate the horror of the moment have you heard that old sir gregory tollbar is to marry letitia tarbarrel at last but it was lady persiflage who really came to the rescue of course were all very glad to see you she said youll find that if youll be nice to us well all be as nice as possible to you wont we lord llwddythlw  as far as i am concerned said the busy member of parliament i shall be delighted to make the acquaintance of mr roden a slight frown a shade of regret passed over the face of lady persiflage as she heard the name a darker and bitterer cloud settled itself on lady kingsburys brow lord kingsbury rolled himself uneasily on his couch lady amaldina slightly pinched her lovers arm lord persiflage was almost heard to whistle vivian tried to look as if it didnt signify i am very much obliged to you for your courtesy lord llwddythlw said george roden to have called him by his name was the greatest favour that could have been done to him at that moment then the door was opened and dinner announced  time and the hour run through the roughest day in this way that dinner at kingsbury house did come to an end at last there was a weight of illhumour about lady kingsbury on this special occasion against which even lady persiflage found it impossible to prevail roden whose courage rose to the occasion did make a gallant effort to talk to lady frances who sat next to him but the circumstances were hard upon him everybody else in the room was closely connected with everybody else had he been graciously accepted by the mistress of the house he could have fallen readily enough into the intimacies which would then have been opened to him but as it was he was forced to struggle against the stream and so to struggle as to seem not to struggle at last however time and the hour had done its work and the ladies went up to the drawingroom  lord llwddythlw called him mr roden this was said by the marchioness in a tone of bitter reproach as soon as the drawingroom door was closed  i was so sorry said lady amaldina  it does not signify in the least said lady persiflage it cannot be expected that a man should drop his old name and take a new one all in a moment  he will never drop his old name and take the new one said lady frances  there now said the marchioness what do you think of that geraldine  my dear fanny said lady persiflage without a touch of illnature in her tone how can you tell what a young man will do  i dont think it right to deceive mamma said fanny i know him well enough to be quite sure that he will not take the title as he has no property to support it he has talked it over with me again and again and i agree with him altogether  upon my word fanny i didnt think that you would be so foolish said her aunt this is a kind of thing in which a girl should not interfere at all it must be arranged between the young mans uncle in italy andand the proper authorities here it must depend very much upon here lady persiflage reduced her words to the very lowest whisper your uncle has told me all about it and of course he must know better than any one else its a kind of thing that must be settled for a man bybyby those who know how to settle it a man cant be this or that just as he pleases  of course not said lady amaldina  a man has to take the name my dear which he inherits i could not call myself mrs jones any more than mrs jones can call herself lady persiflage if he is the duca di crinola he must be the duca di crinola  but he wont be duca di crinola said lady frances  there now said the marchioness  if you will only let the matter be settled by those who understand it and not talk about it just at present it would be so much better  you heard what lord llwddythlw called him said the marchioness  llwddythlw always was an oaf said amaldina  he meant to be gracious said fanny and i am much obliged to him  and as to what you were saying fanny as to having nothing to support the title a foreign title in that way is not like one here at home here it must be supported  he would never consent to be burdened with a great name without any means said fanny  there are cases in which a great name will help a man to get means whatever he calls himself i suppose he will have to live and maintain a wife  he has his salary as a clerk in the post office said fanny very boldly amaldina shook her head sadly the marchioness clasped her hands together and raised her eyes to the ceiling with a look of supplication were not her darlings to be preserved from such contamination  he can do better than that my dear exclaimed lady persiflage and if you are to be his wife i am sure that you will not stand in the way of his promotion his own government and ours between them will be able to do something for him as duca di crinola whereas nothing could be done for george roden  the english government is his government said fanny indignantly  one would almost suppose that you want to destroy all his prospects said lady persiflage who was at last hardly able to restrain her anger  i believe she does said the marchioness  in the mean time the conversation was carried on below stairs if with less vigour yet perhaps with more judgment lord persiflage spoke of rodens italian uncle as a man possessing intellectual gifts and political importance of the highest order roden could not deny that the italian cabinet minister was his uncle and was thus driven to acknowledge the family and almost to acknowledge the country from what i hear said lord persiflage i suppose you would not wish to reside permanently in italy as an italian  certainly not said roden  there is no reason why you should i can imagine that you should have become too confirmed an englishman to take kindly to italian public life as a career you could hardly do so except as a follower of your uncle which perhaps would not suit you  it would be impossible  just so dossi was saying to me this morning that he thought as much but there is no reason why a career should not be open to you here as well as therenot political perhaps but official  it is the only career that at present is open to me  there might be difficulty about parliament certainly my advice to you is not to be in a hurry to decide upon anything for a month or two you will find that things will shake down into their places not a word was said about the name or title when the gentlemen went upstairs there had been no brilliancy of conversation but neither were there any positive difficulties to be incurred not a word further was said in reference to george roden or to the duca di crinola     chapter x  after all he isnt   six weeks passed by and nothing special had yet been done to arrange george rodens affairs for him in the manner suggested by lady persiflage its a kind of thing that must be settled for a man by by bythose who know how to settle it that had been her counsel when she was advocating delay no doubt things often do arrange themselves better than men or women can arrange them objections which were at first very strong gradually fade away ideas which were out of the question become possible time quickly renders words and names and even days habitual to us in this lady persiflage had not been unwise it was quite probable that a young man should become used to a grand name quicker than he had himself expected but nothing had as yet been done in the right direction when the 1st of june had come  attempts had been made towards increasing the young mans selfimportance of which he himself had been hardly aware lord persiflage had seen sir boreas bodkin and vivian had seen the private secretary of the postmastergeneral as the first result of these interviews our clerk was put to sit in a room by himself and called upon to manage some separate branch of business in which he was free from contact with the crockers and bobbins of the department it might it was thought be possible to call a man a duke who sat in a separate room even though he were still a clerk but as sir boreas had observed there were places to be given away secretaryships inspectorships surveyorships and suchlike into one of which the duke if he would consent to be a duke might be installed before long the primary measure of putting him into a room by himself had already been carried out then a step was taken of which george roden had ground to complain there was a certain club in london called the foreigners made up half of englishmen and half of men of other nations which was supposed to stand very high in the world of fashion nearly every member was possessed of either grand titles before his name or of grand letters after it something was said by vivian to george roden as to this club but no actual suggestion was made and certainly no assent was given nevertheless the name of the duca di crinola was put down in the candidate book as proposed by baron dossi and seconded by lord persiflage there it was so that all the world would declare that the young duca was the duca otherwise the name would not have been inserted there by the italian minister and british secretary of state whereas george roden himself knew nothing about it in this way attempts were made to carry out that line of action which lady persiflage had recommended  letters too were delivered to roden addressed to the duca di crinola both at holloway and at the post office no doubt he refused them when they came no doubt they generally consisted of tradesmens circulars and were probably occasioned by manoeuvres of which lady persiflage herself was guilty but they had the effect of spreading abroad the fact that george roden was george roden no longer but was the duca di crinola theres letters coming for the duker every day said the landlady of the duchess to mrs duffer of paradise row i see them myself i shant stand on any ps and qs i shall call him duker to his face paradise row determined generally to call him duker to his face and did so frequently to his great annoyance  even his mother began to think that his refusal would be in vain i dont see how youre to stand out against it george of course if it wasnt so youd have to stand out against it but as it is the fact  it is no more a fact with me than with you he said angrily  nobody dreams of giving me a title if all the world agrees you will have to yield  sir boreas was as urgent he had always been very friendly with the young clerk and had now become particularly intimate with him of course my dear fellow he said i shall be guided entirely by yourself  thank you sir  if you tell me youre george roden george roden youll be to me but i think youre wrong and i think moreover that the good sense of the world will prevail against you as far as i understand anything of the theory of titles this title belongs to you the world never insists on calling a man a lord or a count for nothing theres too much jealousy for that but when a thing is so people choose that it shall be so  all this troubled him though it did not shake his convictions but it made him think again and again of what lady persiflage had said to him down at castle hautboy will it be honest on your part to ask her to abandon the rank which she will be entitled to expect from you if all the world conspired to tell him that he was entitled to take this name then the girl whom he intended to marry would certainly be justified in claiming it it undoubtedly was the fact that titles such as these were dear to menand specially dear to women as to this girl who was so true to him was he justified in supposing that she would be different from others simply because she was true to him he had asked her to come down as it were from the high pedestal of her own rank and to submit herself to his lowly lot she had consented and there never had been to him a moment of remorse in thinking that he was about to injure her but as chance had brought it about in this way as fortune had seemed determined to give back to her that of which he would have deprived her was it right that he should stand in the way of fortune would it be honest on his part to ask her to abandon these fine names which chance was putting in her way  that it might be so should he be pleased to accept what was offered to him did become manifest to him it was within his power to call himself and to have himself called by this new name it was not only the party of the crockers others now were urgent in persuading him the matter had become so far customary to him as to make him feel that if he would simply put the name on his card and cause it to be inserted in the directories and write a line to the officials saying that for the future he would wish to be so designated the thing would be done he had met baron dossi and the baron had acknowledged that an englishman could not be converted into an italian duke without his own consentbut had used very strong arguments to show that in this case the englishman ought to give his consent the baron had expressed his own opinion that the signorina would be very much illused indeed if she were not allowed to take her place among the duchessinas his own personal feelings were in no degree mitigated to be a post office clerk living at holloway with a few hundreds ayear to spendand yet to be known all over the world as the claimant of a magnificently grand title it seemed as though a cruel fate had determined to crush him with a terrible punishment because of his specially democratic views that he of all the world should be selected to be a duke in opposition to his own wishes how often had he been heard to declare that all hereditary titles were of their very nature absurd and yet he was to be forced to become a penniless hereditary duke  nevertheless he would not rob her whom he hoped to make his wife of that which would of right belong to her fanny he said to her one day you cannot conceive how many people are troubling me about this title  i know they are troubling me but i would not mind any of themonly for papa  is he very anxious about it  i am afraid he is  have i ever told you what your aunt said to me just before i left castle hautboy  lady persiflage you mean she is not my aunt you know  she is more anxious than your father and certainly uses the only strong argument i have heard  has she persuaded you  i cannot say that but she has done something towards persuading me she has made me half think that it may be my duty  then i suppose you will take the name she said  it shall depend entirely upon you and yet i ought not to ask you i ought to do as these people bid me without even troubling you for an expression of your wish i do believe that when you become my wife you will have as complete a right to the title as has lady kingsbury to hers shall it be so  no she said  it shall not  certainly no if it be left to me  why do you answer in that way when all your friends desire it  because i believe that there is one friend who does not desire it if you can say that you wish it on your own account of course i will yield otherwise all that my friends may say on the matter can have no effect on me when i accepted the offer which you made me i gave up all idea of rank i had my reasons which i thought to be strong enough at any rate i did so and now because of this accident i will not be weak enough to go back as to what lady persiflage says about me do not believe a word of it you certainly will not make me happy by bestowing on me a name which you do not wish me to bear and which will be distasteful to yourself  after this there was no longer any hesitation on rodens part though his friends including lord persiflage the baron sir boreas and crocker were as active in their endeavours as ever for some days he had doubted but now he doubted no longer they might address to him what letters they would they might call him by what nickname they pleased they might write him down in what book they chose he would still keep the name of george roden as she had protested that she was satisfied with it  it was through sir boreas that he learnt that his name had been written down in the club candidate book as duca di crinola sir boreas was not a member of the club but had heard what had been done probably at some club of which he was a member i am glad to hear that you are coming up at the foreigners said Æolus  but i am not  i was told last night that baron dossi had put your name down as duca di crinola then roden discovered the whole truthhow the baron had proposed him and the foreign secretary had seconded him without even going through the ceremony of asking him upon my word i understood that you wished it vivian said to him upon this the following note was written to the foreign secretary      mr roden presents his compliments to lord persiflage and    begs to explain that there has been a misunderstanding    about the foreigners club mr roden feels very much the    honour that has been done him and is much obliged to lord    persiflage but as he feels himself not entitled to the    honour of belonging to the club he will be glad that his    name should be taken off mr roden takes the opportunity    of assuring lord persiflage that he does not and never    will claim the name which he understands to have been    inscribed in the club books   hes a confounded ass said lord persiflage to the baron as he did as he was bid at the club the baron shrugged his shoulders as though acknowledging that his young fellownobleman certainly was an ass there are men baron whom you cant help let you struggle ever so much this man has had stuff enough in him to win for himself a very pretty girl with a good fortune and high rank and yet he is such a fool that he wont let me put him altogether on his legs when the opportunity comes  not long after this roden called at the house in park lane and asked to see the marquis as he passed through the hall he met mr greenwood coming very slowly down the stairs the last time he had met the gentleman had been in that very house when the gentleman had received him on behalf of the marquis the marquis had not condescended to see him but had deputed his chaplain to give him whatever ignominious answer might be necessary to his audacious demand for the hand of lady frances on that occasion mr greenwood had been very imperious mr greenwood had taken upon himself almost the manners of the master of the house mr greenwood had crowed as though the dunghill had been his own george roden even then had not been abashed having been able to remember through the interview that the young lady was on his side but he had certainly been severely treated he had wondered at the moment that such a man as lord kingsbury should confide so much of his family matters to such a man as mr greenwood since then he had heard something of mr greenwoods latter history from lady frances lady frances had joined with her brother in disliking mr greenwood and all that hampstead had said to her had been passed on to her lover since that last interview the position of the two men had been changed the chaplain had been turned out of the establishment and george roden had been almost accepted into it as a soninlaw as they met on the foot of the staircase it was necessary that there should be some greeting the post office clerk bowed very graciously but mr greenwood barely acknowledged the salutation there said he to himself as he passed on thats the young man thats done all the mischief its because such as he are allowed to make their way in among noblemen and gentlemen that england is going to the dogs nevertheless when mr greenwood had first consented to be an inmate of the present lord kingsburys house lord kingsbury had in spite of his order entertained very liberal views  the marquis was not in a good humour when roden was shown into his room he had been troubled by his late chaplain and he was not able to bear such troubles easily mr greenwood had said words to him which had vexed him sorely and these words had in part referred to his daughter and his daughters lover no im not very well he said in answer to rodens inquiries i dont think i ever shall be better what is it about now  i have come my lord said roden because i do not like to be here in your house under a false pretence  a false pretence what false pretence i hate false pretences  so do i  what do you mean by a false pretence now  i fear that they have told you lord kingsbury that should you give me your daughter as my wife you will give her to the duca di crinola the marquis who was sitting in his armchair shook his head from side to side and moved his hands uneasily but made no immediate reply i cannot quite tell my lord what your own ideas are because we have never discussed the subject  i dont want to discuss it just at present said the marquis  but it is right that you should know that i do not claim the title and never shall claim it others have done so on my behalf but with no authority from me i have no means to support the rank in the country to which it belongs nor as an englishman am i entitled to assume it here  i dont know that youre an englishman said the marquis people tell me that youre an italian  i have been brought up as an englishman and have lived as one for fiveandtwenty years i think it would be difficult now to rob me of my rights nobody i fancy will try i am and shall be george roden as i always have been i should not of course trouble you with the matter were it not that i am a suitor for your daughters hand am i right in supposing that i have been accepted here by you in that light this was a question which the marquis was not prepared to answer at the moment no doubt the young man had been accepted lady frances had been allowed to go down to castle hautboy to meet him as her lover all the family had been collected to welcome him at the london mansion the newspapers had been full of mysterious paragraphs in which the future happy bridegroom was sometimes spoken of as an italian duke and sometimes as an english post office clerk of course he must marry her now the marquis had said to his wife with much anger its all your sisters doings he had said to her again he had in a soft moment given his affectionate blessing to his daughter in special reference to her engagement he knew that he couldnt go back from it now and had it been possible would have been most unwilling to give his wife such a triumph but yet he was not prepared to accept the post office clerk simply as a post office clerk i am sorry to trouble you at this moment lord kingsbury if you are not well  i aint well at all i am very far from well if you dont mind id rather not talk about it just at present when i can see hampstead then perhaps things can be settled as there was nothing further to be said george roden took his leave     chapter xi  of course there was a bitterness   it was not surprising that lord kingsbury should have been unhappy when roden was shown up into his room as mr greenwood had been with him mr greenwood had called on the previous day and had been refused admittance he had then sent in an appeal asking so piteously for an interview that the marquis had been unable to repudiate it mr greenwood knew enough of letterwriting to be able to be effective on such an occasion he had he said lived under the same roof with the marquis for a quarter of a century though the positions of the two men in the world were so different they had lived together as friends the marquis throughout that long period had frequently condescended to ask the advice of his chaplain and not unfrequently to follow it after all this could he refuse to grant the favour of a last interview he had found himself unable to refuse the favour the interview had taken place and consequently the marquis had been very unhappy when george roden was shown up into his room  the rector of appleslocombe was dead the interview was commenced by a communication to that effect from mr greenwood the marquis of course knew the facthad indeed already given the living awayhad not delayed a minute in giving it away because of some fear which still pressed upon him in reference to mr greenwood nor did mr greenwood expect to get the livingor perhaps desire it but he wished to have a grievance and to be in possession of a subject on which he could begin to make his complaint you must have known mr greenwood that i never intended it for you said the marquis mr greenwood seated on the edge of his chair and rubbing his two hands together declared that he had entertained hopes in that direction i dont know why you should then i never told you so i never thought of it for a moment i always meant to put a young man into itcomparatively young mr greenwood shook his head and still rubbed his hands i dont know that i can do anything more for you  it isnt much that you have done certainly lord kingsbury  i have done as much as i intend to do said the marquis rousing himself angrily i have explained all that by mr roberts  two hundred a year after a quarter of a century mr greenwood had in truth been put into possession of three hundred a year but as one hundred of this came from lord hampstead it was not necessary to mention the little addition  it is very wrongyour pressing your way in here and talking to me about it at all  after having expected the living for so many years  you had no right to expect it i didnt promise it i never thought of it for a moment when you asked me i told you that it was out of the question i never heard of such impertinence in all my life i must ask you to go away and leave me mr greenwood but mr greenwood was not disposed to go away just yet he had come there for a purpose and he intended to go on with it he was clearly resolved not to be frightened by the marquis he got up from his chair and stood looking at the marquis still rubbing his hands till the sick man was almost frightened by the persistency of his silence what is it mr greenwood that makes you stand thus do you not hear me tell you that i have got nothing more to say to you  yes my lord i hear what you say  then why dont you go away i wont have you stand there staring like that he still shook his head why do you stand there and shake your head  it must be told my lord  what must be told  the marchioness  what do you mean sir what have you got to say  would you wish to send for her ladyship  no i wouldnt i wont send for her ladyship at all what has her ladyship got to do with it  she promised  promised what  promised the living she undertook that i should have appleslocombe the moment it became vacant  i dont believe a word of it  she did i dont think that her ladyship will deny it it might have been so certainly and had there been no chance of truth in the statement he would hardly have been so ready to send for lady kingsbury but had she done so the promise would amount to nothing though he was sick and wretched and weak and in some matters afraid of his wife there had been no moment of his life in which he would have given way to her on such a subject as this she promised it mefor a purpose  a purpose  for a purpose my lord  what purpose mr greenwood went on staring and shaking his head and rubbing his hands till the marquis awestruck and almost frightened put out his hand towards the bell but he thought of it again he remembered himself that he had nothing to fear if the man had anything to say about the marchioness it might perhaps be better said without the presence of servants if you mean to say anything say it if notgo if you do neither one nor the other very quickly i shall have you turned out of the house  turned out of the house  certainly if you have any threat to make you had better make it in writing you can write to my lawyers or to me or to lord hampstead or to mr roberts  it isnt a threat it is only a statement she promised it mefor a purpose  i dont know what you mean by a purpose mr greenwood i dont believe lady kingsbury made any such promise but if she did it wasnt hers to promise i dont believe it but had she promised i should not be bound by it  not if you have not given it away  i have given it away mr greenwood  then i must suggest  suggest what  compensation my lord it will only be fair you ask her ladyship her ladyship cannot intend that i should be turned out of your lordships house with only two hundred a year after what has passed between me and her ladyship  what passed said the marquis absolutely rousing himself so as to stand erect before the other man  i had rather my lord you should hear it from her ladyship  what passed  there was all that about lady frances  what about lady frances  of course i was employed to do all that i could to prevent the marriage you employed me yourself my lord it was you sent me down to see the young man and explain to him how impertinent he was it isnt my fault lord kingsbury if things have got themselves changed since then  you think you ought to make a demand upon me because as my chaplain you were asked to see a gentleman who called here on a delicate matter  it isnt that i am thinking about if it had been only that i should have said nothing you asked me what it was about and i was obliged to remind you of one thing what took place between me and her ladyship was of course much more particular but it all began with your lordship if you hadnt commissioned me i dont suppose her ladyship would ever have spoken to me about lady frances  what is it all sit downwont youand tell it all like a man if you have got anything to tell the marquis fatigued with his exertion was forced to go back to his chair mr greenwood also sat downbut whether or no like a man may be doubted remember this mr greenwood it does not become a gentleman to repeat what has been said to him in confidenceespecially not to repeat it to him or to them from whom it was intended to be kept secret and it does not become a christian to endeavour to make illblood between a husband and his wife now if you have got anything to say say it mr greenwood shook his head if you have got nothing to say go away i tell you fairly that i dont want to have you here you have begun something like a threat and if you choose to go on with it you may i am not afraid to hear you but you must say it or go  mr greenwood again shook his head i suppose you wont deny that her ladyship honoured me with a very close confidence  i dont know anything about it  your lordship didnt know that her ladyship down at trafford used to be talking to me pretty freely about lord hampstead and lady frances  if you have got anything to say say it screamed the marquis  of course his lordship and her ladyship are not her ladyships own children  what has that got to do with it  of course there was a bitterness  what is that to you i will hear nothing from you about lady kingsbury unless you have to tell me of some claim to be made upon her if there has been money promised you and she acknowledges it it shall be paid has there been any such promise  mr greenwood found it very difficultnay quite impossibleto say in accurate language that which he was desirous of explaining by dark hints there had he thought been something of a compact between himself and the marchioness the marchioness had desired something which she ought not to have desired and had called upon the chaplain for more than his sympathy the chaplain had been willing to give her more than his sympathyhad at one time been almost willing to give her very much more he might possibly as he now felt have misinterpreted her wishes but he had certainly heard from her language so strong in reference to her husbands children that he had been justified in considering that it was intended to be secret as a consequence of this he had been compelled to choose between the marquis and the marchioness by becoming the confidential friend of the one he had necessarily become the enemy of the other then as a further consequence he was turned out of the houseand as he declared to himself utterly ruined now in this there had certainly been much hardship and who was to compensate him if not the marquis  there certainly had been some talk about appleslocombe during those moments of hot passion in which lady kingsbury had allowed herself to say such evil things of lady frances and lord hampstead whether any absolute promise had been given she would probably not now remember there certainly had been a moment in which she had thought that her husbands life might possibly pass away before that of the old rector and reference may have been made to the fact that had her own darling been the heir the gift of the living would then have fallen into her own hands mr greenwood had probably thought more of some possible compensation for the living than of the living itself he had no doubt endeavoured to frighten her ladyship into thinking that some mysterious debt was due to him if not for services actually rendered at any rate for extraordinary confidences but before he had forced upon her the acknowledgment of the debt he was turned out of the house now this he felt to be hard  what were two hundred ayear as a pension for a gentleman after such a lifelong service was it to be endured that he should have listened for so many years to all the abominable politics of the marquis and to the anger and disappointment of the marchioness that he should have been so closely connected and for so many years with luxury wealth and rank and then arrive at so poor an evening of his day as he thought of this he felt the more ashamed of his misfortune because he believed himself to be in all respects a stronger man than the marquis he had flattered himself that he could lead the marquis and had thought that he had been fairly successful in doing so his life had been idle luxurious and full of comfort the marquis had allowed him to do pretty well what he pleased until in an evil hour he had taken the side of the marchioness in a family quarrel then the marquis though weak in healthalmost to his deathhad suddenly become strong in purpose and had turned him abruptly out of the house with a miserable stipend hardly fit for more than a butler could it be that he should put up with such usage and allow the marquis to escape unscathed out of his hand  in this condition of mind he had determined that he owed it to himself to do or say something that should frighten his lordship into a more generous final arrangement there had been he said to himself again and again such a confidence with a lady of so high a rank that the owner of it ought not to be allowed to languish upon two or even upon three hundred ayear if the whole thing could really be explained to the marquis the marquis would probably see it himself and to all this was to be added the fact that no harm had been done the marchioness owed him very much for having wished to assist her in getting rid of an heir that was disagreeable to her the marquis owed him more for not having done it and they both owed him very much in that he had never said a word of it all to anybody else he had thought that he might be clever enough to make the marquis understand something of this without actually explaining it that some mysterious promise had been made and that as the promise could not be kept some compensation should be awardedthis was what he had desired to bring home to the mind of the marquis he had betrayed no confidence he intended to betray none he was very anxious that the marquis should be aware that as he mr greenwood was a gentleman all confidences would be safe in his hands but then the marquis ought to do his part of the business and not turn his confidential chaplain out of the house after a quarter of a century with a beggarly annuity of two hundred ayear  but the marquis seemed to have acquired unusual strength of character and mr greenwood found that words were very difficult to be found he had declared that there had been a bitterness and beyond that he could not go it was impossible to hint that her ladyship had wished to have lord hampsteadremoved the horrid thoughts of a few days had become so vague to himself that he doubted whether there had been any real intention as to the young lords removal even in his own mind there was nothing more that he could say than thisthat during the period of this close intimacy her ladyship had promised to him the living of appleslocombe and that as that promise could not be kept some compensation should be made to him was any sum of money named asked the marquis  nothing of the kind her ladyship thought that i ought to have the living  you cant have it and theres an end of it  and you think that nothing should be done for me  i think that nothing should be done for you more than has been done  very well i am not going to tell secrets that have been intrusted to me as a gentleman even though i am so badly used by those who have confided them to me her ladyship is safe with me because i sympathized with her ladyship your lordship turned me out of the house  no i didnt  should i have been treated like this had i not taken her ladyships part i am too noble to betray a secret or no doubt i could compel your lordship to behave to me in a very different manner yes my lord i am quite ready to go now i have made my appeal and i have made it in vain i have no wish to call upon her ladyship as a gentleman i am bound to give her ladyship no unnecessary trouble  while this last speech was going on a servant had come into the room and had told the marquis that the duca di crinola was desirous of seeing him the servants in the establishment were of course anxious to recognize lady frances lover as an italian duke the marquis would probably have made some excuse for not receiving the lover at this moment had he not felt that he might in this way best insure the immediate retreat of mr greenwood mr greenwood went and roden was summoned to lord kingsburys presence but the meeting took place under circumstances which naturally made the marquis incapable of entering at the moment with much spirit on the great duca question     chapter xii  lord hampstead again with mrs roden   weeks had passed by since lord hampstead had walked up and down broad street with mr fayweeks which were to him a period of terrible woe his passion for marion had so seized upon him that it had in all respects changed his life the sorrow of her alleged illhealth had fallen upon him before the hunting had been over but from that moment he had altogether forgotten his horses the time had now come in which he was wont to be on board his yacht but of his yacht he took no notice whatever i can tell you nothing about it as yet he said in the only line which he wrote to his skipper in answer to piteous applications made to him none of those who were near and dear to him knew how he passed his time his sister left him and went up to the house in london and he felt that her going was a relief to him he would not even admit his friend roden to come to him in his trouble he spent his days all alone at hendon occasionally going across to holloway in order that he might talk of his sorrow to mrs roden midsummer had come upon him before he again saw the quaker marions father had left a feeling almost of hostility in his mind in consequence of that conversation in broad street i no longer want anything on your behalf the quaker had seemed to say i care nothing now for your name or your happiness i am anxious only for my child and as i am told that it will be better that you should not see her you must stay away that the father should be anxious for his daughter was natural enough lord hampstead could not quarrel with zachary fay but he taught himself to think that their interests were at variance with each other as for marion whether she were ill or whether she were well he would have had her altogether to himself  gradually there had come upon him the conviction that there was a real barrier existing between himself and the thing that he desired to marions own words while they had been spoken only to himself he had given no absolute credit he had been able to declare to her that her fears were vain and that whether she were weak or whether she were strong it was her duty to come to him when they two had been together his arguments and assurances had convinced at any rate himself the love which he had seen in her eyes and had heard from her lips had been so sweet to him that their savour had overcome whatever strength her words possessed but these protestations these assurances that no marriage could be possible when they reached him secondhand as they had done through his sister and through the quaker almost crushed him he did not dare to tell them that he would fain marry the girl though she were dyingthat he would accept any chance or no chance if he might only be allowed to hold her in his arms and tell her that she was all his own there had come a blow he would say to himself again and again as he walked about the grounds at hendon there had come a blow a fatal blow a blow from which there could be no recoverybut still it should it ought to be borne together he would not admit to himself that because of this verdict there ought to be a separation between them two it might be that the verdict had been uttered by a judge against whom there could be no appeal but even the judge should not be allowed to say that marion fay was not his own let her come and die in his arms if she must die let her come and have what of life there might be left to her warmed and comforted and perhaps extended by his love it seemed to him to be certainly a fact that because of his great love and of hers she did already belong to him and yet he was told that he might not see herthat it would be better that she should not be disturbed by his presenceas though he were no more than a stranger to her every day he almost resolved to disregard them and go down to the little cottage in which she was living but then he remembered the warnings which were given to him and was aware that he had in truth no right to intrude upon the quakers household it is not to be supposed that during this time he had no intercourse with marion at first there came to be a few lines written perhaps once a week from her in answer to many lines written by him but by degrees the feeling of awe which at first attached itself to the act of writing to him wore off and she did not let a day pass without sending him some little record of herself and her doings it had come to be quite understood by the quaker that marion was to do exactly as she pleased with her lover no one dreamed of hinting to her that this correspondence was improper or injurious had she herself expressed a wish to see him neither would the quaker nor mrs roden have made strong objection to whatever might have been her wish or her decision they would have acceded it was by her word that the marriage had been declared to be impossible it was in obedience to her that he was to keep aloof she had failed to prevail with her own soft words and had therefore been driven to use the authority of others  but at this period though she did become weaker and weaker from day to day and though the doctors attendance was constant at the cottage marion herself was hardly unhappy she grieved indeed for his grief but only for that there would have been triumph and joy to her rather than grief the daily writing of these little notes was a privilege to her and a happiness of which she had hitherto known nothing to have a lover and such a lover was a delight to her a delight to which there was now hardly any drawback as there was nothing now of which she need be afraid to have him with her as other girls may have their lovers she knew was impossible to her but to read his words and to write loving words to him to talk to him of his future life and bid him think of her his poor marion without allowing his great manly heart to be filled too full with vain memories was in truth happiness to her why should you want to come she said it is infinitely better that you should not come we understand it all now and acknowledge what it is that the lord has done for us it would not have been good for me to be your wife it would not have been good for you to have become my husband but it will i think be good for me to have loved you and if you will learn to think of it as i do it will not have been bad for you it has given a beauty to my life she said which makes me feel that i ought to be contented to die early if i could have had a choice i would have chosen it so  but these teachings from her had no effect whatever upon him it was her idea that she would pass away and that there would remain with him no more than a fair sweet shade which would have but little effect upon his future life beyond that of creating for him occasionally a gentle melancholy it could not be she thought that for a man such as hefor one so powerful and so greatsuch a memory should cause a lasting sorrow but with him to his thinking to his feeling the lasting biting sorrow was there already there could be no other love no other marriage no other marion he had heard that his stepmother was anxious for her boy the way should be open for the child it did seem to him that a life long continued would be impossible to him when marion should have been taken away from him  oh yeshes there again said miss demijohn to her aunt he comes mostly on tuesdays thursdays and saturdays what he can be coming about is more than i can guess crocker says its all true love crocker says that the duca says  bother the duca exclaimed the old woman i dont believe that crocker and george roden ever exchange a word together  why shouldnt they exchange words and they fast friends of five years standing crocker says as lord hampstead is to be at lady amaldinas wedding in august his lordship has promised and crocker thinks  i dont believe very much about crocker my young woman you had better look to yourself or perhaps youll find when you have got yourself married that crocker has not got a roof to cover you  lord hampstead had walked over to paradise row and was seated with mrs roden when this little squabble was going on you dont think that i ought to let things remain as they are he said to mrs roden to all such questions mrs roden found it very difficult to make any reply she did in truth think that they ought to be allowed to remain as they wereor rather that some severance should be made more decided even than that which now existed putting aside her own ideas she was quite sure that marion would not consent to a marriage and as it was so and must be so it was better she thought that the young people should see no more of each other this writing of daily letterswhat good could it do to either of them to her indeed to marion with her fixed purpose and settled religious convictions and almost certain fate little evil might be done but to lord hampstead the result would be and was terribly pernicious he was sacrificing himself not only as mrs roden thought for the present moment but for many years perhapsperhaps for his future lifeto a hopeless passion a cloud was falling upon him which might too probably darken his whole career from the day on which she had unfortunately taken marion to hendon hall she had never ceased to regret the acquaintance which she had caused to her thinking the whole affair had been unfortunate between people so divided there should have been no intimacy and yet this intimacy had been due to her it is impossible that i should not see her continued lord hampstead i will see her  if you would see her and then make up your mind to part with herthat i think would be good  to see her and say farewell to her for ever  yes my lord  certainly not that i will never do if it should come to pass that she must go from me for ever i would have her in my arms to the very last  at such a moment my lord those whom nature has given to her for her friends  has not nature given me too for her friend can any friend love her more truly than i do those should be with us when we die to whom our life is of most importance is there any one to whom her life can be half as much as it is to me the husband is the dearest to his wife when i look upon her as going from me for ever then may i not say that she is the same to me as my wife  whywhywhy  i know what you mean mrs roden what is the use of asking why when the thing is done could i make it so now as though i had never seen her could i if i would would i if i could what is the good of thinking of antecedents which are impossible she has become my treasure whether past and fleeting or likely to last me for my life she is my treasure can i make a change because you ask whyand whyand why why did i ever come here why did i know your son why have i got a something here within me which kills me when i think that i shall be separated from her and yet crowns me with glory when i feel that she has loved me if she must leave me i have to bear it what i shall do where i shall go whether i shall stand or fall i do not pretend to say a man does not know himself of what stuff he is made till he has been tried but whatever may be my lot it cannot be altered by any care or custody now she is my own and i will not be separated from her if she were dead i should know that she was gone she would have left me and i could not help myself as yet she is living and may live and i will be with her i must go to her there or she must come here to me if he will permit it i will take some home for myself close to hers what will it matter now though every one should know it let them all know it should she live she will become mine if she must gowhat will the world know but that i have lost her who was to have been my wife  even mrs roden had not the heart to tell him that he had seen marion for the last time it would have been useless to tell him so for he would not have obeyed the behest contained in such an assertion ideas of prudence and ideas of health had restrained him hithertobut he had been restrained only for a time no one had dared suggest to him that he should never again see his marion i suppose that we must ask mr fay she replied she was herself more powerful than the quaker as she was well aware but it had become necessary to her to say something  mr fay has less to say to it even than i have said hampstead my belief is that marion herself is the only one among us who is strong if it were not that she is determined he would yield and you would yield  who can know as she knows said mrs roden which among us is so likely to be guided by what is right which is so pure and honest and loving her conscience tells her what is best  i am not sure of that said he her conscience may fill her as well as another with fears that are unnecessary i cannot think that a girl should be encouraged by those around her to doom herself after this fashion who has a right to say that god has determined that she shall die early mrs roden shook her head i am not going to teach others what religion demands but to me it seems that we should leave these things in gods hands that she may doubt as to herself may be natural enough but others should not have encouraged her  you mean me my lord  you must not be angry with me mrs roden the matter to me is so vital that i have to say what i think about it it does seem to me that i am kept away from her whereas by all the ties which can bind a man and a woman together i ought to be with her forms and ceremonies seem to sink to nothing when i think of all she is to me and remember that i am told that she is soon to be taken away from me  how would it be if she had a mother  why should her mother refuse my love for her daughter but she has no mother she has a father who has accepted me i do believe that had the matter been left wholly to him marion would now be my wife  i was away my lord in italy  i will not be so harsh to such a friend as you as to say that i wish you had remained there but i feeli cannot but feel  my lord i think the truth is that you hardly know how strong in such a matter as this our marion herself can be neither have i nor has her father prevailed upon her i can go back now and tell you without breach of confidence all that passed between her and me when first your name was discussed between us when first i saw that you seemed to make much of her  make much of her exclaimed hampstead angrily  yes make much of her when first i thought that you were becoming fond of her  you speak as though there had been some idle dallying did i not worship her did i not pour out my whole heart into her lap from the first moment in which i saw her did i hide it even from you was there any pretence any falsehood  no indeed  do not say that i made much of her the phrase is vile when she told me that she loved me she made much of me  when first you showed us that you loved her she continued i feared that it would not be for good  why should it not be for good  i will not speak of that now but i thought so i thought so and i told my thoughts to marion  you did  i didand i think that in doing so i did no more than my duty to a motherless girl of the reasons which i gave to her i will say nothing now her reasons were so much stronger that mine were altogether unavailing her resolutions were built on so firm a rock that they needed no persuasions of mine to strengthen them i had ever known marion to be pure unselfish and almost perfect but i had never before seen how high she could rise how certainly she could soar above all weakness and temptation to her there was never a moment of doubt she knew from the very first that it could not be so  it shall be so he said jumping up from his chair and flinging up his arms  it was not i who persuaded her or her father even you cannot persuade her having convinced herself that were she to marry you she would injure you not all her own passionate love will induce her to accept the infinite delight of yielding to you what may be best for youthat is present to her mind and nothing else on that her heart is fixed and so clear is her judgment respecting it that she will not allow the words of any other to operate on her for a moment marion fay lord hampstead is infinitely too great to have been persuaded in any degree by me                                          nevertheless mrs roden did allow herself to say that in her opinion the lover should be allowed to see his mistress she herself would go to pegwell bay and endeavour to bring marion back to holloway that lord hampstead should himself go down and spend his long hours at the little seaside place did not seem to her to be fitting but she promised that she would do her best to arrange at any rate another meeting in paradise row     chapter xiii  lord hampstead again with marion   the quaker had become as weak as water in his daughters hands to whatever she might have desired he would have given his assent he went daily up from pegwell bay to pogson and littlebirds but even then he was an altered man it had been said there for a few days that his daughter was to become the wife of the eldest son of the marquis of kingsbury and then it had been said that there could be no such marriagebecause of marions health the glory while it lasted he had borne meekly but with a certain anxious satisfaction the pride of his life had been in marion and this young lords choice had justified his pride but the glory had been very fleeting and now it was understood through all pogson and littlebirds that their senior clerk had been crushed not by the loss of his noble soninlaw but by the cause which produced the loss under these circumstances poor zachary fay had hardly any will of his own except to do that which his daughter suggested to him when she told him that she would wish to go up to london for a few days he assented as a matter of course and when she explained that she wished to do so in order that she might see lord hampstead he only shook his head sadly and was silent  of course i will come as you wish it marion had said in her letter to her lover what would i not do that you wishexcept when you wish things that you know you ought not mrs roden says that i am to go up to be lectured you mustnt be very hard upon me i dont think you ought to ask me to do things which you knowwhich you know that i cannot do oh my lover oh my love would that it were all over and that you were free  in answer to this and to other letters of the kind he wrote to her long argumentative epistles in which he strove to repress the assurances of his love in order that he might convince her the better by the strength of his reasoning he spoke to her of the will of god and of the wickedness of which she would be guilty if she took upon herself to foretell the doings of providence he said much of the actual bond by which they had tied themselves together in declaring their mutual love he endeavoured to explain to her that she could not be justified in settling such a question for herself without reference to the opinion of those who must know the world better than she did had the words of a short ceremony been spoken she would have been bound to obey him as her husband was she not equally bound now already to acknowledge his superiorityand if not by him was it not her manifest duty to be guided by her father then at the end of four carefullywritten wellstuffed pages there would come two or three words of burning love my marion my self my very heart it need hardly be said that as the wellstuffed pages went for nothing with marionhad not the least effect towards convincing her so were the few words the very food on which she lived there was no absurdity in the language of love that was not to her a gem so brilliant that it deserved to be garnered in the very treasure house of her memory all those long useless sermons were preserved because they had been made rich and rare by the expression of his passion  she understood him and valued him at the proper rate and measured him correctly in everything he was so true she knew him to be so true that even his superlatives could not be other than true but as for his reasoning she knew that that came also from his passion she could not argue the matter out with him but he was wrong in it all she was not bound to listen to any other voice but that of her own conscience she was bound not to subject him to the sorrows which would attend him were he to become her husband she could not tell how weak or how strong might be his nature in bearing the burden of the grief which would certainly fall upon him at her death she had heard and had in part seen that time does always mitigate the weight of that burden perhaps it might be best that she should go at once so that no prolonged period of his future career should be injured by his waiting she had begun to think that he would be unable to look for another wife while she lived by degrees there came upon her the full conviction of the steadfastness nay of the stubbornness of his heart she had been told that men were not usually like that when first he had become sweet to her she had not thought that he would have been like that was it not almost unmanlyor rather was it not womanly and yet hestrong and masterful as he wascould he have aught of a womans weakness about him could she have dreamed that it would be so from the first she thought that from the very first she could have abstained  of course i shall be at home on tuesday at two am i not at home every day at all hours mrs roden shall not be there as you do not wish it though mrs roden has always been your friend of course i shall be alone papa is always in the city good to you of course i shall be good to you how can i be bad to the one being that i love better than all the world i am always thinking of you but i do wish that you would not think so much of me a man should not think so much of a girlonly just at his spare moments i did not think that it would be like that when i told you that you might love me  all that tuesday morning before he left home he was not only thinking of her but trying to marshal in order what arguments he might useso as to convince her at last he did not at all understand how utterly fruitless his arguments had been with her when mrs roden had told him of marions strength he had only in part believed her in all matters concerning the moment marion was weak and womanly before him when he told her that this or the other thing was proper and becoming she took it as gospel because it came from him there was something of the old awe even when she looked up into his face because he was a great nobleman and because she was the quakers daughter there was still in spite of their perfect love something of superiority something of inferiority of position it was natural that he should commandnatural that she should obey how could it be then that she should not at last obey him in this great thing which was so necessary to him and yet hitherto he had never gone near to prevailing with her of course he marshalled all his arguments  gentle and timid as she was she had made up her mind to everything even down to the very greeting with which she would receive him his first warm kiss had shocked her she had thought of it since and had told herself that no harm could come to her from such tokens of affectionthat it would be unnatural were she to refuse it to him let it pass by as an incident that should mean nothing to hang upon his neck and to feel and to know that she was his very ownthat might not be given to her to hear his words of love and to answer him with words as warmthat could be allowed to her as for the rest it would be better that she should let it so pass by that there need be as little of contention as possible on a matter so trivial  when he came into the room he took her at once passive and unresisting into his arms marion he said marion do you say that you are ill you are as bright as a rose  rose leaves soon fall but we will not talk about that why go to such a subject  it cannot be helped he still held her by the waist and now again he kissed her there was something in her passive submission which made him think at the moment that she had at last determined to yield to him altogether marion marion he said still holding her in his embrace you will be persuaded by me you will be mine now  graduallyvery gentlyshe contrived to extricate herself there must be no more of it or his passion would become too strong for her sit down dearest she said you flurry me by all this it is not good that i should be flurried  i will be quiet tame motionless if you will only say the one word to me make me understand that we are not to be parted and i will ask for nothing else  parted no i do not think that we shall be parted  say that the day shall come when we may really be joined together when  no dear no i cannot say that i cannot alter anything that i have said before i cannot make things other than they are here we are we two loving each other with all our hearts and yet it may not be my dear dear lord she had never even yet learned another name for him than this sometimes i ask myself whether it has been my fault she was now sitting and he was standing over her but still holding her by the hand  there has been no fault why should either have been in fault  when there is so great a misfortune there must generally have been a fault but i do not think there has been any here do not misunderstand me dear the misfortune is not with me i do not know that the lord could have sent me a greater blessing than to have been loved by youwere it not that your trouble your grief your complainings rob me of my joy  then do not rob me he said  out of two evils you must choose the least you have heard of that have you not  there need be no evilno such evil as this then he dropped her hand and stood apart from her while he listened to her or else walked up and down the room throwing at her now and again a quick angry word as she went on striving to make clear to him the ideas as they came to her mind  i do not know how i could have done otherwise she said when you would make it so certain to me that you loved me i suppose it might have been possible for me to go away and not to say a word in answer  that is nonsensesheer nonsense he said  i could not tell you an untruth i tried it once but the words would not come at my bidding had i not spoken them you would read the truth in my eyes what then could i have done and yet there was not a moment in which i have not known that it must be as it is  it need not be it need not be it should not be  yes dear it must be as it is so why not let us have the sweet of it as far as it will go can you not take a joy in thinking that you have given an inexpressible brightness to your poor marions days that you have thrown over her a heavenly light which would be all glorious to her if she did not see that you were covered by a cloud if i thought that you could hold up your head with manly strength and accept this little gift of my love just for what it is worthjust for what it is worththen i think i could be happy to the end  what would you have me do can a man love and not love  i almost think he can i almost think that men do i would not have you not love me i would not lose my light and my glory altogether but i would have your love to be of such a nature that it should not conquer you i would have you remember your name and your family  i care nothing for my name as far as i am concerned my name is gone  oh my lord  you have determined that my name shall go no further  that is unmanly lord hampstead because a poor weak girl such as i am cannot do all that you wish are you to throw away your strength and your youth and all the high hopes which ought to be before you would you say that it were well in another if you heard that he had thrown up everything surrendered all his duties because of his love for some girl infinitely beneath him in the worlds esteem  there is no question of above and beneath i will not have it as to that at any rate we are on a par  a man and a girl can never be on a par you have a great career and you declare that it shall go for nothing because i cannot be your wife  can i help myself if i am brokenhearted you can help me  no lord hampstead it is there that you are wrong it is there that you must allow me to say that i have the clearer knowledge with an effort on your part the thing may be done  what effort what effort can i teach myself to forget that i have ever seen you  no indeed you cannot forget but you may resolve that remembering me you should remember me only for what i am worth you should not buy your memories at too high a price  what is it that you would have me do  i would have you seek another wife  marion  i would have you seek another wife if not instantly i would have you instantly resolve to do so  it would not hurt you to feel that i loved another  i think not i have tried myself and now i think that it would not hurt me there was a time in which i owned to myself that it would be very bitter and then i told myself that i hopedthat i hoped that you would wait but now i have acknowledged to myself the vanity and selfishness of such a wish if i really love you am i not bound to want what may be best for you  you think that possible he said standing over her and looking down upon her judging from your own heart do you think that you could do that if outward circumstances made it convenient  no no no  why should you suppose me to be harderhearted than yourself more callous more like a beast of the fields  more like a man is what i would have you  i have listened to you marion and now you may listen to me your distinctions as to men and women are all vain there are those men and women both who can love and do love and there are those who neither do nor can whether it be for good or evilwe can you and i and we do it would be impossible to think of giving yourself to another  that is certainly true  it is the same with meand will ever be so whether you live or die i can have no other wife than marion fay as to that i have a right to expect that you shall believe me whether i have a wife or not you must decide  oh dearest do not kill me  it has to be so if you can be firm so can i as to my name and my family it matters nothing could i be allowed to look forward and think that you would sit at my hearth and that some child that should be my child should lie in your arms then i could look forward to what you call a career not that he might be the last of a hundred traffords not that he might be an earl or a marquis like his forefathers not that he might some day live to be a wealthy peer would i have it sobut because he would be yours and mine now she got up and threw her arms around him and stood leaning on him as he spoke i can look forward to that and think of a career if that cannot be the rest of it must provide for itself there are others who can look after the traffordsand who will do so whether it be necessary or not to have gone a little out of the beaten path to have escaped some of the traditional absurdities would have been something to me to have let the world see how noble a countess i could find for itthat would have satisfied me and i had succeeded i had found one that would really have graced the name if it is not to be sowhy then let the name and family go on in the old beaten track i shall not make another venture i have made my choice and it is to come to this  you must wait dearyou must wait i had not thought it would be like this but you must wait  what god may have in store for me who can tell you have told me your mind marion and now i trust that you will understand mine i do not accept your decision but you will accept mine think of it all and when you see me again in a day or two then see whether you will not be able to join your lot to mine and make the best of it upon this he kissed her again and left her without another word     chapter xiv  crockers distress   when midsummer came paradise row was alive with various interests there was no one there who did not know something of the sad story of marion fay and her love it was impossible that such a one as lord hampstead should make repeated visits to the street without notice when marion returned home from pegwell bay even the potboy at the duchess of edinburgh knew why she had come and clara demijohn professed to be able to tell all that passed at the interview next day and there was the great duca matterso that paradise row generally conceived itself to be concerned on all questions of nobility both foreign and british there were the ducaites and the antiducaites the demijohn faction generally as being under the influence of crocker were of opinion that george roden being a duke could not rid himself of his ducal nature and they were loud in their expression of the propriety of calling the duke duke whether he wished it or no but mrs grimley at the duchess was warm on the other side george roden according to her lights being a clerk in the post office must certainly be a briton and being a briton and therefore free was entitled to call himself whatever he pleased she was generally presumed to enunciate a properly constitutional theory in the matter and as she was a leading personage in the neighbourhood the duca was for the most part called by his old name but there were contests and on one occasion blows had been struck all this helped to keep life alive in the row  but there had arisen another source of intense interest samuel crocker was now regularly engaged to marry miss demijohn there had been many difficulties before this could be arranged crocker not unnaturally wished that a portion of the enormous wealth which rumour attributed to mrs demijohn should be made over to the bride on her marriage but the discussions which had taken place between him and the old lady on the matter had been stormy and unsuccessful its a sort of thing that one doesnt understand at all you know crocker had said to mrs grimley giving the landlady to understand that he was not going to part with his own possession of himself without adequate consideration mrs grimley had comforted the young man by reminding him that the old lady was much given to hot brandy and water and that she could not take her money with her where she was going crocker had at last contented himself with an assurance that there should be a breakfast and a trousseau which was to cost £100 with the promise of this and the hope of what brandyandwater might do for him he had given in and the match was made had there been no more than this in the matter the row would not have been much stirred by it the row was so full of earls marquises and dukes that crockers love would have awakened no more than a passing attention but for a concomitant incident which was touching in its nature and interesting in its development daniel tribbledale junior clerk at pogson and littlebirds had fought a battle with his passion for clara demijohn like a man but manly though the battle had been love had prevailed over him he had at last found it impossible to give up the girl of his heart and he had declared his intention of punching crockers head should he ever find him in the neighbourhood of the row with the object of doing this he frequented the row constantly from ten in the evening till two in the morning and spent a great deal more money than he ought to have done at the duchess he would occasionally knock at no 10 and boldly ask to be allowed to see miss clara on one or two of these occasions he had seen her and tears had flown in great quantities he had thrown himself at her feet and she had assured him that it was in vain he had fallen back at pogson and littlebirds to £120 a year and there was no prospect of an increase moreover the betrothment with crocker was complete clara had begged him to leave the vicinity of holloway nothing he had sworn should divorce him from paradise row should that breakfast ever be given should these hated nuptials ever take place he would be heard of it was in vain that clara had threatened to die on the threshold of the church if anything rash were done he was determined and clara no doubt was interested in the persistency of his affection it was however specially worthy of remark that crocker and tribbledale never did meet in paradise row  monday 13th of july was the day fixed for the marriage and lodgings for the happy pair had been taken at islington it had been hoped that room might have been made for them at no 10 but the old lady fearing the interference of a new inmate had preferred the horrors of solitude to the combined presence of her niece and her nieces husband she had however given a clock and a small harmonium to grace the furnished sittingroomso that things might be said to stand on a sound and pleasant footing gradually however it came to be thought both by the old and the young lady that crocker was becoming too eager on that great question of the duca when he declared that no earthly consideration should induce him to call his friend by any name short of that noble title which he was entitled to use he was asked a question or two as to his practice at the office for it had come round to paradise row that crocker was giving offence at the office by his persistency when i speak of him i always call him the duca said crocker gallantly and when i meet him i always address him as duca no doubt it may for a while create a little coolness but he will recognize at last the truth of the spirit which actuates me he is the duca  if you go on doing what they tell you not to do said the old woman theyll dismiss you crocker had simply smiled ineffably not Æolus himself would dismiss him for a loyal adherence to the constitutional usages of european courts  crocker was in truth making himself thoroughly disagreeable at the post office sir boreas had had his own view as to rodens title and had been anxious to assist lord persiflage in forcing the clerk to accept his nobility but when he had found that roden was determined he had given way no order had been given on the subject it was a matter which hardly admitted of an order but it was understood that as mr roden wished to be mr roden he was to be mr roden it was declared that good taste required that he should be addressed as he chose to be addressed when therefore crocker persisted it was felt that crocker was a bore when crocker declared to roden personally that his conscience would not allow him to encounter a man whom he believed to be a nobleman without calling him by his title the office generally felt that crocker was an ass Æolus was known to have expressed himself as very angry and was said to have declared that the man must be dismissed sooner or later this had been reported to crocker sir boreas cant dismiss me for calling a nobleman by his right name crocker had replied indignantly the clerks had acknowledged among themselves that this might be true but had remarked that there were different ways of hanging a dog if Æolus was desirous of hanging crocker crocker would certainly find him the rope before long there was a little bet made between bobbin and geraghty that the office would know crocker no longer before the end of the year  alas alasjust before the time fixed for the poor fellows marriage during the first week of july there came to our Æolus not only an opportunity for dismissing poor crocker but an occasion on which by the consent of all it was admitted to be impossible that he should not do so and the knowledge of the sin committed came upon sir boreas at a moment of great exasperation caused by another source sir boreas crocker had said coming into the great mans room i hope you will do me the honour of being present at my wedding breakfast the suggestion was an unpardonable impertinence i am asking no one else in the department except the duca said crocker with what special flea in his ear crocker was made to leave the room instantly cannot be reported but the reader may be quite sure that neither did Æolus nor the duca accept the invitation it was on that very afternoon that mr jerningham with the assistance of one of the messengers discovered that crocker hadactually torn up a bundle of official papers  among many official sins of which crocker was often guilty was that of delaying papers letters had to be written or more probably copies made and crocker would postpone the required work from day to day papers would get themselves locked up and sometimes it would not be practicable to trace them there were those in the department who said that crocker was not always trustworthy in his statements and there had come up lately a case in which the unhappy one was supposed to have hidden a bundle of papers of which he denied having ever had the custody then arose a tumult of anger among those who would be supposed to have had the papers if crocker did not have them and a violent search was instituted then it was discovered that he had absolutelydestroyed the official documents they referred to the reiterated complaints of a fidgety old gentleman who for years past had been accusing the department of every imaginable iniquity according to this irritable old gentleman a diabolical ingenuity had been exercised in preventing him from receiving a single letter through a long series of years  this was a new crime wicked things were often done but anything so wicked as this had never before been perpetrated in the department the minds of the senior clerks were terribly moved and the young men were agitated by a delicious awe crocker was felt to be abominable but heroic alsoand original it might be that a new opening for great things had been invented  the fidgety old gentleman had never a leg to stand uponnot a stump but now it was almost impossible that he should not be made to know that all his letters of complaint had been made away with of course crocker must be dismissed he was at once suspended and called upon for his written explanation and i am to be married next week he said weeping to mr jerningham Æolus had refused to see him and mr jerningham when thus appealed to only shook his head what could a mr jerningham say to a man who had torn up official papers on the eve of his marriage had he laid violent hands on his bride but preserved the papers his condition to mr jerninghams thinking would have been more wholesome  it was never known who first carried the tidings to paradise row there were those who said that tribbledale was acquainted with a friend of bobbin and that he made it all known to clara in an anonymous letter there were others who traced a friendship between the potboy at the duchess and a son of one of the messengers it was at any rate known at no 10 crocker was summoned to an interview with the old woman and the match was then and there declared to be broken off what are your intentions sir as to supporting that young woman mrs demijohn demanded with all the severity of which she was capable crocker was so brokenhearted that he had not a word to say for himself he did not dare to suggest that perhaps he might not be dismissed he admitted the destruction of the papers i never cared for him again when i saw him so knocked out of time by an old woman said clara afterwards  what am i to do about the lodgings asked crocker weeping  tear em up said mrs demijohn tear em up only send back the clock and the harmonium  crocker in his despair looked about everywhere for assistance it might be that Æolus would be softerhearted than clara demijohn he wrote to lord persiflage giving him a very full account of the affair the papers he said had in fact been actually torn by accident he was afraid of the duca or he would have applied to him the duca no doubt had been his most intimate friendso he still declaredbut in such an emergency he did not know how to address the duca but he bethought himself of lord hampstead of that hunting acquaintance with whom his intercourse had been so pleasant and so genial and he made a journey down hendon lord hampstead at this time was living there all alone marion fay had been taken back to pegwell bay and her lover was at the old house holding intercourse almost with no one his heart just now was very heavy with him he had begun to believe that marion would in truth never become his wife he had begun to think that she would really die and that he would never have had the sad satisfaction of calling her his own all lightness and brightness had gone from him all the joy which he used to take in argument all the eagerness of his characterunless the hungry craving of unsatisfied love could still be called an eagerness  he was in this condition when crocker was brought out to him in the garden where he was walking mr crocker he said standing still in the pathway and looking into the mans face  yes my lord its me i am crocker you remember me my lord down in cumberland  i remember youat castle hautboy  and out hunting my lordwhen we had that pleasant ride home from airey force  what can i do for you now  i always do think my lord that there is nothing like sport to cement affection i dont know how you feel about it my lord  if there is anything to be saidperhaps you will say it  and theres another bond my lord we have both been looking for the partners of our joys in paradise row  if you have anything to say say it  and as for your friend my lord thethe you know whom i mean if i have given any offence it has only been because ive thought that as the title was certainly theirs a young lady who shall be nameless ought to have the advantage of it ive only done it because of my consideration for the family  what have you come here for mr crocker i am not just now disposed to converseon i may say any subject if there be anything  indeed there is oh my lord they are going to dismiss me for the sake of paradise row my lord pray pray interfere on my behalf then he told the whole story about the papers merely explaining that they had been torn in accident sir boreas is angry with me because i have thought it right to callyou know whomby his title and now i am to be dismissed just when i was about to take that beautiful and accomplished young lady to the hymeneal altar only think if you and miss fay was to be divided in the same way  with much lengthened explanation which was however altogether ineffectual lord hampstead had to make his visitor understand that there was no ground on which he could even justify a request but a letter you could write a letter a letter from your lordship would do so much lord hampstead shook his head if you were just to say that you had known me intimately down in cumberland of course i am not taking upon myself to say it was sobut to save a poor fellow on the eve of his marriage  i will write a letter said lord hampstead thinking of it turning over in his mind his own idea of what marriage would be to him i cannot say that we have been intimate friends because it would not be true  nono no of course not that  but i will write a letter to sir boreas i cannot conceive that it should have any effect it ought to have none  it will my lord  i will write and will say that your father is connected with my uncle and that your condition in regard to your marriage may perhaps be accepted as a ground for clemency good day to you not very quickly but with profuse thanks and the shedding of some tears poor crocker took his leave he had not been long gone before the following letter was written      sir     though i have not the honour of any acquaintance with you    i take the liberty of writing to you as to the condition    of one of the clerks in your office i am perfectly aware    that should i receive a reprimand from your hands i shall    have deserved it by my unjustifiable interference     mr crocker represents to me that he is to be dismissed    because of some act of which you as his superior officer    highly disapprove he asks me to appeal to you on his    behalf because we have been acquainted with each other    his father is agent to my uncle lord persiflage and    we have met at my uncles house i do not dare to put    this forward as a plea for mercy but i understand that    mr crocker is about to be married almost immediately    and perhaps you will feel with me that a period in    a mans life which should beyond all others be one of    satisfaction of joy and of perfect contentment may    be regarded with a feeling of mercy which would be    prejudicial if used more generally     your faithful servant     hampstead   when he wrote those words as to the period of joy and satisfaction his own heart was sore sore sore almost to breaking there could never be such joy never be such satisfaction for him     chapter xv  dismissal b b   by return of post lord hampstead received the following answer to his letter      my dear lord hampstead     mr crockers case is a very bad one but the postmaster    general shall see your appeal and his lordship will    i am sure sympathize with your humanityas do i also    i cannot take upon myself to say what his lordship will    think it right to do and it will be better therefore    that you should abstain for the present from communicating    with mr crocker     i am    your lordships very faithful servant     boreas bodkin   any excuse was sufficient to our Æolus to save him from the horror of dismissing a man he knew well that crocker as a public servant was not worth his salt sir boreas was blessedor cursedwith a conscience but the stings of his conscience though they were painful did not hurt him so much as those of his feelings he had owned to himself on this occasion that crocker must go crocker was in every way distasteful to him he was not only untrustworthy and incapable but audacious also and occasionally impudent he was a clerk of whom he had repeatedly said that it would be much better to pay him his salary and let him have perpetual leave of absence than keep him even if there were no salary to be paid now there had come a case on which it was agreed by all the office that the man must go destroy a bundle of official papers mr jerningham had been heard to declare that the law was in fault in not having provided that a man should be at once sent to newgate for doing such a thing the stupid old fools letters werent really worth anything sir boreas had said as though attempting to palliate the crime mr jerningham had only shaken his head what else could he do it was not for him to dispute any matter with sir boreas but to his thinking the old gentlemans letters had become precious documents priceless records as soon as they had once been bound by the red tape of the government and enveloped by the security of an official pigeonhole to stay away without leaveto be drunkto be obstinately idleto be impudent were great official sins but mr jerningham was used to them and knew that as they had often occurred before so would they reoccur clerks are mortal men and will be idle will be reckless will sometimes get into disreputable rows a little added severity mr jerningham thought would improve his branch of the department but knowing the nature of men the nature especially of sir boreas he could make excuses here however was a case in which no superior civil servant could entertain a doubt and yet sir boreas palliated even this crime mr jerningham shook his head and sir boreas shoved on one side so as to avoid for a day the pain of thinking about them the new bundle of papers which had already formed itself on the great crocker case if some one would tear up that what a blessing it would be  in this way there was delay during which crocker was not allowed to show his face at the office and during this delay clara demijohn became quite confirmed in her determination to throw over her engagement tribbledale with his £120 would be much better than crocker with nothing and then it was agreed generally in paradise row that there was something romantic in tribbledales constancy tribbledale was in the row every dayor perhaps rather every nightseeking counsel from mrs grimley and comforting himself with hot ginandwater mrs grimley was goodnatured and impartial to both the young men she liked customers and she liked marriages generally if he aint got no income of course hes out of the running mrs grimley said to tribbledale greatly comforting the young mans heart you go in and win said mrs grimley indicating by that her opinion that the ardent suitor would probably be successful if he urged his love at the present moment strike while the iron is hot she said alluding probably to the heat to which claras anger would be warmed by the feeling that the other lover had lost his situation just when he was most bound to be careful in maintaining it  tribbledale went in and pleaded his case it is probable that just at this time clara herself was made acquainted with tribbledales frequent visits to the duchess and though she may not have been pleased with the special rendezvous selected she was gratified by the devotion shown when mrs grimley advised tribbledale to go in and win she was perhaps in claras confidence when a girl has told all her friends that she is going to be married and has already expended a considerable portion of the sum of money allowed for her wedding garments she cannot sink back into the simple position of an unengaged young woman without pangs of conscience and qualms of remorse paradise row knew that her young man was to be dismissed from his office and condoled with her frequently and most unpleasantly mrs duffer was so unbearable in the matter that the two ladies had quarrelled dreadfully clara from the first moment of her engagement with crocker had been proud of the second string to her bow and now perceived that the time had come in which it might be conveniently used  it was near eleven when tribbledale knocked at the door of no 10 but nevertheless clara was up as was also the servant girl who opened the door for the sake of discretion oh daniel what hours you do keep said clara when the young gentleman was shown into the parlour what on earth brings you here at such a time as this  tribbledale was never slow to declare that he was brought thither by the overwhelming ardour of his passion his love for clara was so old a story and had been told so often that the repeating of it required no circumlocution had he chanced to meet her in the high street on a sunday morning he would have begun with it at once clara he said will you have me i know that that other scoundrel is a ruined man  oh daniel you shouldnt hit those as are down  hasnt he been hitting me all the time that i was down hasnt he triumphed havent you been in his arms  laws no  and wasnt that hitting me when i was down do you think  it never did you any harm  oh claraif you knew the nature of my love youd understand the harm every time he has pressed your lips i have heard it though i was in kings head court all the time  that must be a crammer daniel  i didnot with the ears of my head but with the fibres of my breast  ohah but daniel you and sam used to be such friends at the first go off  go off of what  when he first took to coming after me you remember the teaparty when marion fay was here  i tried it on just theni did i thought that maybe i might come not to care about it so much  im sure you acted it very well  and i thought that perhaps it might be the best way of touching that cold heart of yours  cold i dont know as my heart is colder than anybody elses heart  would that you would make it warm once more for me  poor sam said clara putting her handkerchief up to her eyes  why is he any poorer than me i was first at any rate i was before him  i dont know anything about firsts or lasts said clara as the ghosts of various banquos flitted before her eyes  and as for him what right has he to think of any girl hes a poor mean creature without the means of getting so much as a bed for a wife to lie on he used to talk so proud of her majestys civil service her majestys civil service has sent him away packing  not yet daniel  they have ive made it my business to find out and sir boreas bodkin has written the order today dismissalb b i know those who have seen the very words written in the punishment book of the post office  poor sam  destroying papers of the utmost importance about her majestys mail service what else was he to expect and now hes penniless  a hundred and twenty isnt so very much daniel  mr fay was saying only the other day that if i was married and settled theyd make it better for me  youre too fond of the duchess daniel  no clarano i deny that you ask mrs grimley why it is i come to the duchess so often it isnt for anything that i take there  oh i didnt know young men when they frequent those places generally do take something  if i had a little home of my own with the girl i love on the other side of the fireplace and perhaps a baby in her arms tribbledale as he said this looked at her with all his eyes  laws daniel what things you do say  i should never go then to any duchess or any marquess of granby or to any angel these were publichouses so named all standing thick together in the neighbourhood of paradise row i should not want to go anywhere thenexcept where that young woman and that baby were to be found  daniel you was always fine at poetry  try me if it isnt real prose the proof of the puddings in the eating you come and try by this time clara was in his arms and the reengagement was as good as made crocker was no doubt dismissedor if not dismissed had shown himself to be unworthy what could be expected of a husband who could tear up a bundle of her majestys mail papers and then daniel tribbledale had exhibited a romantic constancy which certainly deserved to be rewarded clara understood that the ginandwater had been consumed night after night for her sake and there were the lodgings and the clock and the harmonium ready for the occasion i suppose it had better be so daniel as you wish it so much  wish it i have always wished it i wouldnt change places now with mr pogson himself  he married his third wife three years ago  i mean in regard to the whole box and dice of it id rather have my clara with £120 than be pogson and littlebird with all the profits this gratifying assurance was rewarded and then considerably after midnight the triumphant lover took his leave  early on the following afternoon crocker was in paradise row he had been again with lord hampstead and had succeeded in worming out of the goodnatured nobleman something of the information contained in the letter from sir boreas the matter was to be left to the postmastergeneral now there was an idea in the office that when a case was left to his lordship his lordship never proceeded to extremities kings are bound to pardon if they allow themselves to be personally concerned as to punishment there was something of the same feeling in regard to official discipline as a fact the letter from sir boreas had been altogether false he had known poor man that he must at last take the duty of deciding upon himself and had used the name of the great chief simply as a mode of escape for the moment but crocker had felt that the mere statement indicated pardon the very delay indicated pardon relying upon these indications he went to paradise row dressed in his best frock coat with gloves in his hand to declare to his love that the lodgings need not be abandoned and that the clock and harmonium might be preserved  but youve been dismissed said clara  never never  it has been written in the book dismissalb b i know the eyes that have seen it  thats not the way they do it at all said crocker who was altogether confused  it has been written in the book sam and i know that they never go back from that  who wrote it nothing has been written there isnt a booknot at least like that tribbledale has invented it  oh sam why did you tear those papersher majestys mail papers what else was there to expect dismissalb b why did you do itand you engaged to a young woman nodont come nigh to me how is a young woman to go and get herself married to a young man and he with nothing to support her it isnt to be thought of when i heard those words dismissalb b i thought my very heart would sink within me  its nothing of the kind said crocker  whats nothing of the kind  i aint dismissed at all  oh sam how dare you  i tell you i aint hes written a letter to lord hampstead who has always been my friend hampstead wasnt going to see me treated after that fashion hampstead wrote and then Æolus wrotethats sir boreasand ive seen the letterthat is hampstead told me what there is in it and i aint to be dismissed at all when i heard the good news the first thing i did was to come as fast as my legs would carry me and tell the girl of my heart  clara did not quite believe him but then neither had she quite believed tribbledale when he had announced the dismissal with the terrible corroboration of the great mans initials but the crime committed seemed to her to be so great that she could not understand that crocker should be allowed to remain after the perpetration of it crockers salary was £150 and balancing the two young men together as she had often done though she liked the poetry of tribbledale she did on the whole prefer the swagger and audacity of crocker her majestys civil service too had its charms for her the post office was altogether superior to pogson and littlebirds pogson and littlebirds hours were 9 to 5 those of her majestys service were much more genteel10 namely to 4 but what might not a man do who had shown the nature of his disposition by tearing up official papers and then though the accidents of the occasion had enveloped her in difficulties on both sides it seemed to her that at the present moment the lesser difficulties would be encountered by adhering to tribbledale she could excuse herself with crocker paradise row had already declared that the match with crocker must be broken off crocker had indeed been told that the match was to be broken off when tribbledale had come to her overnight she had felt herself to be a free woman when she had given way to the voice of the charmer when she had sunk into his arms softened by that domestic picture which he had painted no pricks of conscience had disturbed her happiness whether the dismissalb b had or had not yet been written it was sure to come she was as free to wed another as was venice when her doge was deposed she could throw herself back upon the iniquity of the torn papers were crocker to complain but should she now return to her crocker how could she excuse herself with tribbledale it is all over between you and me sam she said with her handkerchief up to her eyes  all over why should it be all over  you was told it was all over  that was when all the row said that i was to be dismissed there was something in itthen though perhaps a girl might have waited till a fellow had got up upon his legs again  waiting aint so pleasant mr crocker when a girl has to look after herself  but i aint dismissed at all and there neednt be any waiting i thought that you would be suffering as well as me and so i came right away to you all at once  so i have suffered sam no one knows what i have suffered  but itll come all right now clara shook her head you dont mean that tribbledales been and talked you over already  i knew mr tribbledale before ever i saw you sam  how often have i heard you call him a poor mean skunk  never crocker never such a word never passed my lips  something very like it then  i may have said he wanted sperrit i may have said so though i disremember it but if i didwhat of that  you despised him  no crocker what i despise is a man as goes and tears up her majestys mail papers tribbledale never tore up anything at pogson and littlebirdsexcept what was to be tore tribbledale was never turned out for nigh a fortnight so that he couldnt go and show his face in kings head court tribbledale never made hisself hated by everybody that unknown abominable word which crocker had put into her mouth had roused all the woman within her so that she was enabled to fight her battle with a courage which would not have come to her aid had he been more prudent  who hates me  mr jerningham does and roden and sir boreas and bobbin she had learned all their names how can they help hating a man that tears up the mail papers and i hate you  clara  i do what business had you to say i used that nasty word i never do use them words i wouldnt even so much as look at a man whod demean himself to put such words as them into my mouth so i tell you what it is mr crocker you may just go away i am going to become daniel tribbledales wife and it isnt becoming in you to stand here talking to a young woman that is engaged to another young man  and this is to be the end of it  if you please mr crocker  well  if ever you feel inclined to speak your mind to another young woman and you carry it as far as we did and you wishes to hold on to her dont you go and tear her majestys mail papers and when she tells you a bit of her mind as i did just now dont you go and put nasty words into her mouth now if you please you may just as well send over that clock and that harmonium to daniel tribbledale esq kings head court great broad street so saying she left him and congratulated herself on having terminated the interview without much unpleasantness  crocker as he shook the dust off his feet upon leaving paradise row began to ask himself whether he might not upon the whole congratulate himself as to the end to which that piece of business had been brought when he had first resolved to offer his hand to the young lady he had certainly imagined that that hand would not be empty clara was no doubt a fine girl but not quite so young as she was once and she had a temper of her own matrimony too was often followed by many troubles paradise row would no doubt utter jeers but he need not go there to hear them he was not quite sure but that the tearing of the papers would in the long run be beneficial to him     chapter xvi  pegwell bay   july had come and nearly gone before lord hampstead again saw marion fay he had promised not to go to pegwell bayhardly understanding why such a promise had been exacted from him but still acceding to it when it had been suggested to him by mrs roden at the request as she said of the quaker it was understood that marion would soon return to holloway and that on that account the serenity of pegwell bay need not be disturbed by the coming of so great a man as lord hampstead hampstead had of course ridiculed the reason but had complied with the requestwith the promise however that marion should return early in the summer but the summer weeks had passed by and marion did not return  letters passed between them daily in which marion attempted always to be cheerful though she had as yet invented no familiar name for her noble lover yet she had grown into familiarity with him and was no longer afraid of his nobility you oughtnt to stay there she said wasting your life and doing nothing because of a sick girl youve got your yacht and are letting all the summer weather go by in answer to this he wrote to her saying that he had sold his yacht could you have gone with me i would have kept it he wrote would you go with me i would have another ready for you before you would be ready i will make no assurance as to my future life i cannot even guess what may become of me it may be that i shall come to live on board some ship so that i may be all alone but with my heart as it is now i cannot bear the references which others make to me about empty pleasures at the same time he sold his horses but he said nothing to her as to that  gradually he did acknowledge to himself that it was her doom to die earlyalmost acknowledged to himself that she was dying nevertheless he still thought that it would have been fit that they should be married if i knew that she were my own even on her deathbed he once said to mrs roden there would be a comfort to me in it he was so eager in this that mrs roden was almost convinced the quaker was willing that it should be sobut willing also that it should not be so he would not even try to persuade his girl as to anything it was his doom to see her go and he having realized that could not bring himself to use a word in opposition to her word but marion herself was sternly determined against the suggestion it was unfitting she said and would be wicked it was not the meaning of marriage she could not bring herself to disturb the last thoughts of her life not only by the empty assumption of a grand name but by the sounding of that name in her ears from the eager lips of those around her i will be your love to the end she said your own marion but i will not be made a countess only in order that a vain name may be carved over my grave god has provided a bitter cup for your lips my love she wrote again in having put it into your head to love one whom you must lose so soon and mine is bitter because yours is bitter but we cannot rid ourselves of the bitterness by pretences would it make your heart light to see me dressed up for a bridal ceremony knowing as you would know that it was all for nothing my lord my love let us take it as god has provided it it is only because you grieve that i grievefor you and my poor father if you could only bring yourself to be reconciled then it would be so much to me to have had you to love me in my last momentsto love me and to be loved  he could not but accept her decision her father and mrs roden accepted it and he was forced to do so also he acknowledged to himself now that there was no appeal from it her very weakness gave her a strength which dominated him there was an end of all his arguments and his strong phrases he was aware that they had been of no service to himthat her soft words had been stronger than all his reasonings but not on that account did he cease to wish that it might be as he had once wished since he had first acknowledged to himself his love of course i will not drive her he said to mrs roden when that lady urged upon him the propriety of abstaining from a renewal of his request had i any power of driving her as you say i would not do so i think it would be better that is all of course it must be as she shall decide  it would be a comfort to her to think that you and she thought alike about all things said mrs roden  there are points on which i cannot alter my convictions even for her comfort he answered she bids me love some other woman can i comfort her by doing that she bids me seek another wife can i do thator say that i will do it at some future time it would comfort her to know that i have no woundthat i am not lame and sick and sore and weary it would comfort her to know that my heart is not broken how am i to do that for her  nosaid mrs rodenno  there is no comfort her imagination paints for her some future bliss which shall not be so far away as to be made dim by distancein enjoying which we two shall be together as we are here with our hands free to grasp each other and our lips free to kissa heaven but still a heaven of this world in which we can hang upon each others necks and be warm to each others hearts that is to be to her the reward of her innocence and in the ecstacy of her faith she believes in it as though it were here i do thinki do thinkthat if i told her that it should be so that i trusted to renew my gaze upon her beauty after a few short years then she would be happy entirely it would be for an eternity and without the fear of separation  then why not profess as she does  a lie as i know her truth when she tells me her creed so would she know my falsehood and the lie would be vain  is there then to be no future world lord hampstead  who has said so certainly not i i cannot conceive that i shall perish altogether i do not think that if while i am here i can tame the selfishness of self i shall reach a step upwards in that world which shall come next after this as to happiness i do not venture to think much of it if i can only be somewhat noblersomewhat more like the christ whom we worshipthat will be enough without happiness if there be truth in this story he was not happy why should i look for happinessunless it be when the struggle of many worlds shall have altogether purified my spirit but thinking like thatbelieving like thathow can i enter into the sweet epicurean paradise which that child has prepared for herself  is it no better than that  what can be better what can be purerif only it be true and though it be false to me it may be true to her it is for my sake that she dreams of her paradisethat my wounds may be made whole that my heart may be cured christs lesson has been so learned by her that no further learning seems necessary i fancy sometimes that i can see the platform raised just one step above the ground on which i standand look into the higher world to which i am ascending it may be that it is given to her to look up the one rung of the ladder by mounting which she shall find herself enveloped in the full glory of perfection  in conversations such as these mrs roden was confounded by the depth of the mans love it became impossible to bid him not be of a broken heart or even to allude to those fresh hopes which time would bring he spoke to her often of his future life always speaking of a life from which marion would have been withdrawn by death and did so with a cold passionless assurance which showed her that he had almost resolved as to the future he would see all lands that were to be seen and converse with all people the social condition of gods creatures at large should be his study the task would be endless and as he said an endless task hardly admits of absolute misery if i die there will be an end of it if i live till old age shall have made me powerless to carry on my work time will then probably have done something to dim the feeling i think he said againi feel that could i but remember her as my wife  it is impossible said mrs roden  but if it were so it would be no more than a thin threadbare cloak over a womans shivering shoulders it is not much against the cold but it would be very cruel to take that little from her she looked at him with her eyes flooded with tears but she could only shake her head in sign that it was impossible  at last just at the end of july there came a request that he would go down to pegwell bay it is so long since we have seen each other she wrote and perhaps it is better that you should come than that i should go the doctor is fidgety and says so but my darling will be good to mewill he not when i have seen a tear in your eyes it has gone near to crush me that a woman or even a man should weep at some unexpected tidings of woe is natural but who cries for spilt milk tell me that gods hand though it be heavy to you shall be borne with reverence and obedience and love  he did not tell her this but he resolved that if possible she should see no tears as for that cheerfulness that reconciliation to his fate which she desired he knew it to be impossible he almost brought himself to believe as he travelled down to pegwell bay that it would be better that they should not meet to thank the lord for all his mercies was in her mind to complain with all the bitterness of his heart of the cruelty with which he was treated was in his he had told mrs roden that according to his creed there would be a better world to come for him if he could succeed in taming the selfishness of self but he told himself now that the struggle to do so had hitherto been vain there had been but the one thing which had ever been to him supremely desirable he had gone through the years of his early life forming some utopian ideasdreaming of some perfection in politics in philanthropy in social reform and the likesomething by devoting himself to which he could make his life a joy to himself then this girl had come across him and there had suddenly sprung up within him a love so strong that all these other things faded into littlenesses they should not be discarded work would be wanted for his life and for hers but here he had found the true salt by which all his work would be vivified and preserved and made holy and happy and glorious there had come a something to him that was all that he wanted it to be and now the something was fading from himwas already all but gone in such a state how should he tame the selfishness of self he abandoned the attempt and told himself that difficulties had been prepared for him greater than any of which he had dreamed when he had hoped that that taming might be within his power he could not even spare her in his selfishness he declared to himself that it was so and almost owned that it would be better that he should not go to her  yes she said when he sat down beside her on her sofa at an open window looking out on the little bay put your hand on mine dear and leave it there to have you with me to feel the little breeze and to see you and to touch you is absolute happiness  why did you so often tell me not to come  ah why but i know why it was my lord there was something half of tenderness half pleasantry in the mode of address and now he had ceased to rebel against it  why should i not come if it be a joy to you  you must not be angry now  certainly not angry  we have got through all thatyou and i have for ourselvesbut there is a sort of unseemliness in your coming down here to see a poor quakers daughter  marion  but there is we had got through all that in paradise row paradise row had become used to you and i could bear it but here they will all be sure to know who you are  who cares  that marion fay should have a lover would of itself make a stir in this little placebut that she should have a lord for her lover one doesnt want to be looked at as a miracle  the follies of others should not ruffle you and me  thats very well dearbut what if one is ruffled but i wont be ruffled and you shall come when i thought that i should go again to our own house then i thought we might perhaps dispense with the rufflingthat was all  there was a something in these words which he could not standwhich he could not bear and repress that tear which as she had said would go near to crush her if she saw it had she not plainly intimated her conviction that she would never again return to her old home here here in this very spot the doom was to come and to come quickly he got up and walked across the room and stood a little behind her where she could not see his face  do not leave me she said i told you to stay and let your hand rest on mine then he returned and laying his hand once again upon her lap turned his face away from her bear it she said bear it his hand quivered where it lay as he shook his head call upon your courage and bear it  i cannot bear it he said rising suddenly from his chair and hurrying out of the room he went out of the room and from the house on to the little terrace which ran in front of the sea but his escape was of no use to him he could not leave her he had come out without his hat and he could not stand there in the sun to be stared at i am a coward he said going back to her and resuming his chair i own it let there be no more said about it when a trouble comes to me it conquers me little troubles i think i could bear if it had been all else in all the worldif it had been my life before my life was your life i think that no one would have seen me blench but now i find that when i am really tried i fail  it is in gods hands dearest  yesit is in gods hands there is some power no doubt that makes you strong in spirit but frail in body while i am strong to live but weak of heart but how will that help me  oh lord hampstead i do so wish you had never seen me  you should not say that marion you shall not think it i am ungrateful because were it given me to have it all back again i would not sell what i have had of you though the possession has been so limited for all other imaginable treasures i will bear it oh my love i will bear it do not say again that you wish you had not seen me  for myself dearfor myself  do not say it for me i will struggle to make a joy of it a joy in some degree though my heart bleeds at the widowhood that is coming on it i will build up for myself a memory in which there shall be much to satisfy me i shall have been loved by her to have possessed whose love has been and shall be a glory to me  loved indeed my darling  though there might have been such a heaven of joy even that shall be counted as much it shall be to me during my future life as though when wandering through the green fields in some longpast day i had met a bright angel from another world and the angel had stopped to speak to me and had surrounded me with her glorious wings and had given me of her heavenly light and had spoken to me with the music of the spheres and i had thought that she would stay with me for ever but there had come a noise of the drums and a sound of the trumpets and she had flown away from me up to her own abode to have been so favoured though it had been but for an hour should suffice for a mans life i will bear it though it be in solitude  no darling not in solitude  it will be best so for me the light and the music and the azure of the wings will so remain with me the purer and the brighter ohif it had been but i will bear it no ear shall again hear a sound of complaint not yours even my darling my own mine for so short a time but yet my very own for ever and ever then he fell on his knees beside her and hid his face in her dress while the fingers of both her hands rambled through his hair you are going he said when he rose up to his feet you are going whither i cannot go  you will come you will come to me  you are going now now soon and i doubt not that you are going to joys inexpressible i cannot go till some chance may take me if it be given to you in that further world to see those and to think of those whom you have left below then if my heart be true to your heart keep your heart true to mine if i can fancy that if i can believe that it is so then shall i have that angel with me and though my eyes may not see the tints my ears will hear the musicand though the glory be not palpable as is the light of heaven there will be an inner glory in which my soul will be sanctified after that there were not many words spoken between them though he remained there till he was disturbed by the quakers coming part of the time she slept with her hand in his and when awake she was contented to feel his touch as he folded the scarf close round her neck and straightened the shawl which lay across her feet and now and again stroked her hair and put it back behind her ears as it strayed upon her forehead ever and again she would murmur a word or two of love as she revelled in the perception of his solicitude what was there for her to regret for her to whom was given the luxury of such love was not a month of it more than a whole life without it then when the father came hampstead took his leave as he kissed her lips something seemed to tell him that it would be for the last time it was not good the quaker had said that she should be disturbed yes he could come again but not quite yet  at the very moment when the quaker so spoke she was pressing her lips to his god keep you and take you my darling she whispered to him and bring you to me in heaven she noticed not at all at the moment the warm tears that were running on to her own face nor did the quaker seem to notice it when lord hampstead left the house without saying to him a word of farewell     chapter xvii  lady amaldinas wedding   the time came round for lady amaldinas marriage than which nothing more august nothing more aristocratic nothing more truly savouring of the hymeneal altar had ever been known or was ever to be known in the neighbourhood of hanover square for it was at last decided that the marriage should take place in london before any of the aristocratic assistants at the ceremony should have been whirled away into autumnal spaces lord llwddythlw himself knew but very little about itexcept this that nothing would induce him so to hurry on the ceremony as to interfere with his parliamentary duties a day in august had been mentioned in special reference to parliament he was willing to abide by that or to go to the sacrifice at any earlier day of which parliament would admit parliament was to sit for the last time on wednesday 12th august and the marriage was fixed for the 13th lady amaldina had prayed for the concession of a week readers will not imagine that she based her prayers on the impatience of love nor could a week be of much significance in reference to that protracted and dangerous delay to which the match had certainly been subjected but the bevy might escape how were twenty young ladies to be kept together in the month of august when all the young men were rushing off to scotland others were not wedded to their duties as was lord llwddythlw lady amaldina knew well how completely parliament became a mere affair of governmental necessities during the first weeks of august i should have thought that just on this one occasion you might have managed it she said to him trying to mingle a tone of love with the sarcasm which at such a crisis was natural to her he simply reminded her of the promise which he had made to her in the spring he thought it best not to break through arrangements which had been fixed when she told him of one very slippery member of the bevyslippery not as to character but in reference to the movements of her familyhe suggested that no one would know the difference if only nineteen were to be clustered round the brides train dont you know that they must be in pairs will not nine pairs suffice he asked and thus make one of them an enemy for ever by telling her that i wish to dispense with her services  but it was of no use dispense with them altogether he said looking her full in the face the twenty will not quarrel with you my object is to marry you and i dont care twopence for the bridesmaids there was something so near to a compliment in this that she was obliged to accept it and she had too begun to perceive that lord llwddythlw was a man not easily made to change his mind she was quite prepared for this in reference to her future life a woman she thought might be saved much trouble by having a husband whom she was bound to obey but in this matter of her marriage ceremonythis last affair in which she might be presumed to act as a free womanshe did think it hard that she might not be allowed to have her own way the bridegroom however was firm if thursday the 13th did not suit her he would be quite ready on thursday the 20th there wouldnt be one of them left in london said lady amaldina what on earth do you think that they are to do with themselves  but all the bevy were true to her lady amelia beaudesert was a difficulty her mother insisted on going to a faraway bavarian lake on which she had a villabut lady amelia at the last moment surrendered the villa rather than break up the bevy and consented to remain with a grumpy old aunt in essex till an opportunity should offer it may be presumed therefore that it was taken to be a great thing to be one of the bevy it is no doubt a pleasant thing for a girl to have it asserted in all the newspapers that she is by acknowledgment one of the twenty most beautiful unmarried ladies in great britain  lady frances was of course one of the bevy but there was a member of the familya connection ratherwhom no eloquence could induce to show himself either in the church or at the breakfast this was lord hampstead his sister came to him and assured him that he ought to be there sorrows she said that have declared themselves before the world are held as sufficient excuse but a man should not be hindered from his duties by secret grief  i make no secret of it i do not talk about my private affairs i do not send a towncrier to charing cross to tell the passersby that i am in trouble but i care not whether men know or not that i am unfitted for joining in such festivities my presence is not wanted for their marriage  it will be odd  let it be odd i most certainly shall not be there but he remembered the occasion and showed that he did so by sending to the bride the handsomest of all the gems which graced her exhibition of presents short of the tremendous set of diamonds which had come from the duke of merioneth  this collection was supposed to be the most gorgeous thing that had ever as yet been arranged in london it would certainly not be too much to say that the wealth of precious toys brought together would if sold at its cost price have made an ample fortune for a young newlymarried couple the families were noble and wealthy and the richness of the wedding presents was natural it might perhaps have been better had not the value of the whole been stated in one of the newspapers of the day who was responsible for the valuation was never known but it seemed to indicate that the costliness of the gifts was more thought of than the affection of the givers and it was undoubtedly true that in high circles and among the clubs the cost of the collection was much discussed the diamonds were known to a stone and hampsteads rubies were spoken of almost as freely as though they were being exhibited in public lord llwddythlw when he heard of all this muttered to his maiden sister a wish that a gnome would come in the night and run away with everything he felt himself degraded by the publicity given to his future wifes ornaments but the gnome did not come and the young men from messrs bijou and carcanet were allowed to arrange the tables and shelves for the exhibition  the breakfast was to take place at the foreign office at which the brides father was for the time being the chief occupant lord persiflage had not at first been willing that it should be so thinking that his own more modest house might suffice for the marriage of his own daughter but grander counsels had been allowed to prevail with whom the idea first arose lord persiflage never knew it might probably have been with some of the bevy who had felt that an ordinary drawingroom would hardly suffice for so magnificent an array of toilets perhaps the thought had first occurred to messrs bijou and carcanet who had foreseen the glory of spreading out all that wealth in the magnificent saloon intended for the welcoming of ambassadors but it travelled from lady amaldina to her mother and was passed on from lady persiflage to her husband of course the ambassadors will all be there the countess had said and therefore it will be a public occasion i wish we could be married at llanfihangel lord llwddythlw said to his bride now llanfihangel church was a very small edifice with a thatched roof among the mountains in north wales with which lady amaldina had been made acquainted when visiting the duchess her future motherinlaw but llwddythlw was not to have his way in everything and the preparations at the foreign office were continued  the beautifully embossed invitations were sent about among a large circle of noble and aristocratic friends all the ambassadors and all the ministers with all their wives and daughters were of course asked as the breakfast was to be given in the great banqueting hall at the foreign office it was necessary that the guests should be many it is sometimes well in a matter of festivals to be saved from extravagance by the modest size of ones rooms lord persiflage told his wife that his daughters marriage would ruin him in answer to this she reminded him that llwddythlw had asked for no fortune lord llwddythlw was one of those men who prefer giving to taking he had a feeling that a husband should supply all that was wanted and that a wife should owe everything to the man she marries the feeling is uncommon just at presentexcept with the millions who neither have nor expect other money than what they earn if you are told that the daughter of an old man who has earned his own bread is about to marry a young man in the same condition of life it is spoken of as a misfortune but lord llwddythlw was oldfashioned and had the means of acting in accordance with his prejudices let the marriage be ever so gorgeous it would not cost the dowry which an earls daughter might have expected that was the argument used by lady persiflage and it seemed to have been effectual  as the day drew near it was observed that the bridegroom became more sombre and silent even than usual he never left the house of commons as long as it was open to him as a refuge his saturdays and his sundays and his wednesdays he filled up with work so various and unceasing that there was no time left for those pretty little attentions which a girl about to be married naturally expects he did call perhaps every other day at his brides house but never remained there above two minutes i am afraid he is not happy the countess said to her daughter  oh yes mamma he is  then why does he go on like that  oh mamma you do not know him  do you  i think so my belief is that there isnt a man in london so anxious to be married as llwddythlw  i am glad of that  he has lost so much time that he knows it ought to be got through and done with without further delay if he could only go to sleep and wake up a married man of three months standing he would be quite happy if it could be administered under chloroform it would be so much better it is the doing of the thing and the being talked about and looked at that is so odious to him  then why not have had it done quietly my dear  because there are follies mamma to which a woman should never give way i will not have myself made humdrum if i had been going to marry a handsome young man so as to have a spice of romance out of it all i would have cared nothing about the bridesmaids and the presents the man then would have stood for everything llwddythlw is not young and is not handsome  but he is thoroughly noble  quite so hes as good as gold he will always be somebody in peoples eyes because hes great and grand and trustworthy all round but i want to be somebody in peoples eyes too mamma im all very well to look at but nothing particular im papas daughter which is somethingbut not enough i mean to begin and be magnificent he understands it all and i dont think hell oppose me when once this exhibition day is over ive thought all about it and i think that i know what im doing  at any rate she had her way and thoroughly enjoyed the task she had on hand when she had talked of a possible romance with a handsome young lover she had not quite known herself she might have made the attempt but it would have been a failure she could fall in love with a master of ravenswood in a novel but would have given herself by preferenceafter due considerationto the richer though less poetical suitor of good sterling gifts she did know the value and was therefore contented with her lot but this business of being married with all the most extravagant appurtenances of the hymeneal altar was to her taste  that picture in one of the illustrated papers which professed to give the hymeneal altar at st georges with the bishop and the dean and two queens chaplains officiating and the bride and the bridegroom in all their glory with a royal duke and a royal duchess looking on with all the stars and all the garters from our own and other courts and especially with the bevy of twenty standing in ten distinct pairs and each from a portrait was manifestly a work of the imagination i was there and to tell the truth it was rather a huddled matter the spaces did not seem to admit of majestic grouping and as three of these chief personages had the gout the sticks of these lame gentlemen were to my eyes very conspicuous the bevy had not room enough and the ladies in the crush seemed to feel the intense heat something had made the bishop cross i am told that lady amaldina had determined not to be hurried while the bishop was due at an afternoon meeting at three the artist in creating the special work of art had soared boldly into the ideal in depicting the buffet of presents and the bridal feast he may probably have been more accurate i was not myself present the youthful appearance of the bridegroom as he rose to make his speech may probably be attributed to a poetic license permissible nay laudable nay necessary on such an occasion the buffet of presents no doubt was all there though it may be doubted whether the contributions from royalty were in truth so conspicuous as they were made to appear there were speeches spoken by two or three foreign ministers and one by the brides father but the speech which has created most remark was from the bridegroom i hope we may be as happy as your kind wishes would have us said heand then he sat down it was declared afterwards that these were the only words which passed his lips on the occasion to those who congratulated him he merely gave his hand and bowed and yet he looked to be neither fluttered nor ill at ease we know how a brave man will sit and have his tooth taken out without a sign of pain on his browtrusting to the relief which is to come to him so it was with lord llwddythlw it might perhaps have saved pain if as lady amaldina had said chloroform could have been used  well my dear it is done at last lady persiflage said to her daughter when the bride was taken into some chamber for the readjustment of her dress  yes mamma it is done now  and are you happy  certainly i am i have got what i wanted  and you can love him coming from lady persiflage this did seem to be romantic but she had been stirred up to some serious thoughts as she remembered that she was now surrendering to a husband the girl whom she had made whom she had tutored whom she had prepared either for the good or for the evil performance of the duties of life  oh yes mamma said lady amaldina it is so often the case that the pupils are able to exceed the teaching of their tutors it was so in this case the mother as she saw her girl given up to a silent middleaged unattractive man had her misgivings but not so the daughter herself she had looked at it all round and had resolved that she could do her dutyunder certain stipulations which she thought would be accorded to her he has more to say for himself than you thinkonly he wont trouble himself to make assertions and if he is not very much in love he likes me better than anybody else which goes a long way her mother blessed her and led her away into a room where she joined her husband in order that she might be then taken down to the carriage  the bride herself had not quite understood what was to take place and was surprised to find herself quite alone for a moment with her husband my wife he said now kiss me  she ran into his arms and put up her face to him i thought you were going to forget that she said as he held her for a moment with his arm round her waist  i could not dare he said to handle all that gorgeous drapery of lace you were dressed up then for an exhibition you look now as my wife ought to look  it had to be done llwddythlw  i make no complaint dearest i only say that i like you better as you are as a girl to kiss and to embrace and to talk to and to make my own then she curtsied to him prettily and kissed him again and after that they walked out arminarm down to the carriage  there were many carriages drawn up within the quadrangle of which the foreign office forms a part but the carriage which was to take the bride and the bridegroom away was allowed a door to itselfat any rate till such time as they should have been taken away an effort had been made to keep the public out of the quadrangle but as the duties of the four secretaries of state could not be suspended and as the great gates are supposed to make a public thoroughfare this could only be done to a certain extent the crowd no doubt was thicker out in downing street but there were very many standing within the square among these there was one beautifully arrayed in frock coat and yellow gloves almost as though he himself was prepared for his own wedding when lord llwddythlw brought lady amaldina out from the building and handed her into the carriage and when the husband and wife had seated themselves the welldressed individual raised his hat from his head and greeted them long life and happiness to the bride of castle hautboy said he at the top of his voice lady amaldina could not but see the man and recognizing him she bowed  it was crockerthe irrepressible crocker he had been also in the church the narrator and he had managed to find standing room in a back pew under one of the galleries now would he be able to say with perfect truth that he had been at the wedding and had received a parting salute from the bride whom he had known through so many years of her infancy he probably did believe that he was entitled to count the future duchess of merioneth among his intimate friends     chapter xviii  crockers tale   a thing difficult to get is the thing mostly prized not the thing that is valuable two or three additional kimberley mines found somewhere among the otherwise uninteresting plains of south africa would bring down the price of diamonds amazingly it could hardly have been the beauty or the wit or the accomplishments of clara demijohn which caused mr tribbledale to triumph so loudly and with so genuine an exultation telling all broad street of his success when he had succeeded in winning the bride who had once promised herself to crocker were it not that she had all but slipped through his fingers he would never surely have thought her to be worthy of such a pæan had she come to his first whistle he might have been contented enoughas are other ordinary young men with their ordinary young women he would probably have risen to no enthusiasm of passion but as things had gone he was as another paris who had torn a helen from her menelausonly in this case an honest paris with a correct helen and from a menelaus who had not as yet made good his claim but the subject was worthy of another iliad to be followed by another Æneid by his bow and his spear he had torn her from the arms of a usurping lover and now made her all his own another man would have fainted and abandoned the contest when rejected as he had been but he had continued the fight even when lying low on the dust of the arena he had nailed his flag to the mast when all his rigging had been cut awayand at last he had won the battle of course his clara was doubly dear to him having been made his own after such difficulties as these  im not one of those who easily give way in an affair of the heart he said to mr littlebird the junior partner in the firm when he told that gentleman of his engagement  so i perceive mr tribbledale  when a man has set his affection on a young ladythat is his real affectionhe ought to stick to itor die mr littlebird who was the happy father of three or four married and marriageable daughters opened his eyes with surprise the young men who had come after his young ladies had been pressing enough but they had not died or die repeated tribbledale it is what i should have done had she become mrs crocker i should never again have been seen in the courtthe court was the little alley in which pogson and littlebirds office was heldunless they had brought my dead body here to be identified he was quite successful in his enthusiasm though mr littlebird laughed when he told the story to mr pogson not the less did they agree to raise his salary to £160 on and from the day of his marriage  yes mr fay he said to the poor old quaker who had lately been so broken by his sorrow as hardly to be as much master of tribbledale as he used to be i have no doubt i shall be steady now if anything can make a young man steady it issuccess in love  i hope thou wilt be happy mr tribbledale  i shall be happy enough now my heart will be more in the businesswhat there isnt of it at any rate with that dear creature in our mutual home at islington it was lucky about his having taken those lodgings because clara had got as it were used to them and there are one or two things such as a clock and the like which need not be moved if anything ever should happen to you mr fay pogson and littlebird will find me quite up to the business  something will happen some day no doubt said the quaker  on one occasion lord hampstead was in the court having a word to say to marions father or perhaps a word to hear im sure youll excuse me my lord said tribbledale following him out of the office  oh yes said hampstead with a smilefor he had been there often enough to have made some acquaintance with the junior clerk if there be anything i can do for you i will do it willingly  only just to congratulate me my lord you have heard ofcrocker lord hampstead owned that he had heard of crocker he has been interfering with me in the tenderest of parts lord hampstead looked serious there is a young womanthe poor victim frowned he knew not why but remitted his frown and smiled again who had promised herself to me then that rude assailant came and upset all my joy here as the narrator paused lord hampstead owned to himself that he could not deny the truth of the description perhaps continued tribbledaleperhaps you have seen clara demijohn lord hampstead could not remember having been so fortunate because i am aware that your steps have wandered in the way of paradise row then there came the frown againand then the smile wellperhaps it may be that a more perfect form of feminine beauty may be ascribed to another this was intended as a compliment more civil than true paid to marion fay on lord hampsteads behalf but for a combination of chastity and tenderness i dont think you can easily beat clara demijohn lord hampstead bowed as showing his readiness to believe such a statement coming from so good a judge for awhile the interloper prevailed interlopers do prevailsuch is the female heart but the true rock shows itself always at last she is the true rock on which i have built the castle of my happiness  then i may congratulate you mr tribbledale  yesand not only that my lord but crocker is nowhere you must own that there is a triumph in that there was a time oh how i felt it there was a time when he triumphed when he talked of my clara as though i hadnt a chance hes up a tree now my lord i thought id just tell you as you are so friendly coming among us here my lord lord hampstead again congratulated him and expressed a hope that he might be allowed to send the bride a small present  oh my lord said tribbledale it shall go with the clock and the harmonium and shall be the proudest moment of my life  when miss demijohn heard that the salary of pogson and littlebirds clerkshe called it dans screw in speaking of the matter to her aunthad been raised to £160 per annum she felt that there could be no excuse for a further change up to that moment it had seemed to her that tribbledale had obtained his triumph by a deceit which it still might be her duty to frustrate he had declared positively that those fatal words had been actually written in the book dismissalb b but she had learned that the words had not been written as yet all is fair in love and war she was not in the least angry with tribbledale because of his little ruse a lie told in such a cause was a merit but not on that account need she be led away by it from her own most advantageous course in spite of the little quarrel which had sprung up between herself and crocker crocker still belonging to her majestys civil service must be better than tribbledale but when she found that tribbledales statement as to the £160 was true and when she bethought herself that crocker would probably be dismissed sooner or later then she determined to be firm as to the £160 old mrs demijohn herself went to the office and learned the truth from zachary fay i think he is a good young man said the quaker and he will do very well if he will cease to think quite so much of himself to this mrs demijohn remarked that halfadozen babies might probably cure that fault  so the matter was settled and it came to pass that daniel tribbledale and clara demijohn were married at holloway on that very thursday which saw completed the alliance which had been so long arranged between the noble houses of powell and de hauteville there were two letters written on the occasion which shall be given here as showing the willingness to forget and forgive which marked the characters of the two persons a day or two before the marriage the following invitation was sent      dear sam     i hope you will quite forget what is past at any rate    what was unpleasant and come to our wedding on thursday    there is to be a little breakfast here afterwards and    i am sure that dan will be very happy to shake your hand    i have asked him and he says that as he is to be the    bridegroom he would be proud to have you as best man     your old sincere friend     clara demijohnfor the present   the answer was as follows      dear clara     theres no malice in me since our little tiff i have been    thinking that after all im not the man for matrimony    to sip the honey from many flowers is perhaps after    all my line of life i should have been happy to be dan    tribbledales bottleholder but that there is another    affair coming off which i must attend our lady amaldina    is to be married and i must be there our families have    been connected as you know for a great many years and    i could not forgive myself if i did not see her turned    off no other consideration would have prevented me from    accepting your very kind invitation     your loving old friend     sam crocker   there did come a pang of regret across claras heart as she read this as to the connection of the families of course crocker was lying of course it was an empty boast but there was a savour of aristocracy even in the capability of telling such a lie had she made crocker her husband she also would have been able to drag castle hautboy into her daily conversations with mrs duffer  at the time of these weddings the month of august Æolus had not even yet come to a positive and actual decision as to crockers fate crocker had been suspendedby which act he had been temporarily expelled from the office so that his time was all his own to do what he pleased with it whether when suspended he would receive his salary no one knew as a certainty the presumption was that a man suspended would be dismissedunless he could succeed in explaining away or diminishing the sin of which he had been supposed to be guilty Æolus himself could suspend but it required an act on the part of the senior officer to dismissor even to deprive the sinner of any part of his official emoluments there had been no explanation possible no diminishing of the sin had been attempted it was acknowledged on all sides that crocker hadas miss demijohn properly described itdestroyed her majestys mail papers in order that unpardonable delay and idleness might not be traced home to him he had torn into fragments a bundle of official documents his character was so well known that no one doubted his dismissal mr jerningham had spoken of it as a thing accomplished bobbin and geraghty had been congratulated on their rise in the department dismissalb b had been recorded if not in any official book at any rate in all official minds but b b himself had as yet decided nothing when crocker attended lady amaldinas wedding in his best coat and gloves he was still under suspension but trusting to the conviction that after so long a reprieve capital punishment would not be carried out  sir boreas bodkin had shoved the papers on one side and since that nothing further had been said on the matter weeks had passed but no decision had been made public sir boreas was a man whom the subordinates nearest to him did not like to remind as to any such duty as this when a case was shoved on one side it was known to be something unpalateable and yet as mr jerningham whispered to george roden it was a thing that ought to be settled he cant come back you know he said  i dare say he will said the duca  impossible i look upon it as impossible this mr jerningham said very seriously  there are some people you know rejoined the other whose bark is so much worse than their bite  i know there are mr roden and sir boreas is perhaps one of them but there are cases in which to pardon the thing done seems to be perfectly impossible this is one of them if papers are to be destroyed with impunity what is to become of the department i for one should not know how to go on with my duties tearing up papers good heavens when i think of it i doubt whether i am standing on my head or my heels  this was very strong language for mr jerningham who was not accustomed to find fault with the proceedings of his superiors he went about the office all these weeks with a visage of woe and the air of a man conscious that some great evil was at hand sir boreas had observed it and knew well why that visage was so long nevertheless when his eyes fell on that bundle of paperson the crocker bundle of papershe only pushed it a little further out of sight than it was before  who does not know how odious a letter will become by being shoved on one side day after day answer it at the moment and it will be nothing put it away unread or at least undigested for a day and it at once begins to assume ugly proportions when you have been weak enough to let it lie on your desk or worse again hidden in your breastpocket for a week or ten days it will have become an enemy so strong and so odious that you will not dare to attack it it throws a gloom over all your joys it makes you cross to your wife severe to the cook and critical to your own winecellar it becomes the black care which sits behind you when you go out a riding you have neglected a duty and have put yourself in the power of perhaps some vulgar snarler you think of destroying it and denying it dishonestly and falselyas crocker did the mail papers and yet you must bear yourself all the time as though there were no load lying near your heart so it was with our Æolus and the crocker papers the papers had become a great bundle the unfortunate man had been called upon for an explanation and had written a blundering long letter on a huge sheet of foolscap paperwhich sir boreas had not read and did not mean to read large fragments of the torn mail papers had been found and were all there mr jerningham had written a wellworded lengthy reportwhich never certainly would be read there were former documents in which the existence of the papers had been denied altogether the bundle was big and unholy and distasteful those who knew our Æolus well were sure that he would never even undo the tape by which the bundle was tied but something must be done one months payday had already passed since the suspension and the next was at hand can anything be settled about mr crocker asked mr jerningham one day about the end of august sir boreas had already sent his family to a little place he had in the west of ireland and was postponing his holiday because of this horrid matter mr jerningham could never go away till Æolus went sir boreas knew all this and was thoroughly ashamed of himself just speak to me about it tomorrow and well settle the matter he said in his blandest voice mr jerningham retreated from the room frowning according to his thinking there ought to be nothing to settle d the fellow said sir boreas as soon as the door was closed and he gave the papers another shove which sent them off the huge table on to the floor whether it was mr jerningham or crocker who was damned he hardly knew himself then he was forced to stoop to the humility of picking up the bundle  that afternoon he roused himself about three oclock he sent not for mr jerningham but for the duca when roden entered the room the bundle was before him but not opened can you send for this man and get him here today he asked the duca promised that he would do his best i cant bring myself to recommend his dismissal he said the duca only smiled the poor fellow is just going to be married you know the duca smiled again living in paradise row himself he knew that the lady née clara demijohn was already the happy wife of mr tribbledale but he knew also that after so long an interval crocker could not well be dismissed and he was not illnatured enough to rob his chief of so good an excuse he left the room therefore declaring that he would cause crocker to be summoned immediately  crocker was summoned and came had sir boreas made up his mind briefly to dismiss the man or briefly to forgive him the interview would have been unnecessary as things now were the man could not certainly be dismissed sir boreas was aware of that nor could he be pardoned without further notice crocker entered the room with that mingling of the bully and the coward in his appearance which is generally the result when a man who is overawed attempts to show that he is not afraid sir boreas passed his fingers through the hairs on each side of his head frowned hard and blowing through his nostrils became at once the Æolus that he had been named         assumes the god       affects to nod    and seems to shake the spheres   mr crocker said the god laying his hand on the bundle of papers still tied up in a lump then he paused and blew the wrath out of his nostrils  sir boreas no one can be more sorry for an accident than i am for that  an accident  well sir boreas i am afraid i shall not make you understand it all  i dont think you will  the first paper i did tear up by accident thinking it was something done with  then you thought you might as well send the others after it  one or two were torn by accident then  well  i hope youll look it over this time sir boreas  i have done nothing but look it over as you call it since you came into the department youve been a disgrace to the office youre of no use whatsoever you give more trouble than all the other clerks put together im sick of hearing your name  if youll try me again ill turn over a new leaf sir boreas  i dont believe it for a moment they tell me youre just going to be married crocker was silent could he be expected to cut the ground from under his own feet at such a moment for the young ladys sake i dont like turning you adrift on the world at such a time i only wish that she had a more secure basis for her happiness  shell be all right said crocker he will probably be thought to have been justified in carrying on the delusion at such a crisis of his life  but you must take my assurance of this said Æolus looking more like the god of storms that no wife or babyno joy or troubleshall save you again if you again deserve dismissal crocker with his most affable smile thanked sir boreas and withdrew it was said afterwards that sir boreas had seen and read that smile on rodens face had put two and two together in regard to him and had become sure that there was to be no marriage but had he lost that excuse where should he find another     chapter xix  my marion   the blow came very suddenly at last about the middle of september the spirit of marion fay flitted away from all its earthly joys and all its earthly troubles lord hampstead saw her alive for the last time at that interview which was described a few pages back whenever he proposed to go down again to pegwell bay some objection was made either by the quaker or by mrs roden on the quakers behalf the doctor it was alleged had declared that such visits were injurious to his patientor perhaps it was that marion had herself said that she was unable to bear the excitement there was no doubt some truth in this and marion had seen that though she herself could enjoy the boundless love which her lover tendered to her telling herself that though it was only for a while it was very sweet to have it so yet for him these meetings were full of agony but in addition to this there was i think a jealousy on the part of zachary fay as to his daughter when there was still a question whether the young lord should be his soninlaw he had been willing to give way and to subordinate himself even though his girl were the one thing left to him in all the world while there was an idea that she should be married there had accompanied that idea a hope almost an expectation that she might live but when it was brought home to him as a fact that her marriage was out of the question because her life was waning then unconsciously there grew up in his heart a feeling that the young lord ought not to rob him of what was left had marion insisted he would have yielded had mrs roden told him that it was cruel to separate them he would have groaned and given way as it was he simply leaned to that view of the matter which gave him the greatest preponderance with his own child it may be that she saw it too and would not wound him by asking for her lovers presence  about the middle of september she died having written to hampstead the very day before her death her letters lately had become but a few words each which mrs roden would put into an envelope and send to their destination he wrote daily assuring her that he would not leave his home for a day in order that he might go to her instantly when she would send for him to the last she never gave up the idea of seeing him againbut at last the little light flickered out quicker than had been expected  mrs roden was at pegwell bay when the end came and to her fell the duty of making it known to lord hampstead she went up to town immediately leaving the quaker in the desolate cottage and sent down a note from holloway to hendon hall i must see you as soon as possible shall i go to you or will you come to me when she wrote the words she was sure that he would understand their purport and yet it was easier to write so than to tell the cruel truth plainly the note was sent down by a messenger but lord hampstead in person was the answer  there was no need of any telling when he stood before her dressed from head to foot in black she took him by the two hands and looked into his face it is all over for her he saidthe trouble and the anguish and the sense of long dull days to come my marion how infinitely she has the best of it how glad i ought to be that it is so  you must wait lord hampstead she said  pray pray let me have no consolation waiting in the sense you mean there will be none for the one relief which will finally come to me i must of course wait did she say any word that you would wish to tell me  many many  were they for my ears  what other words should she have spoken to me they were prayers for your health  my health needs not her prayers  prayers for your souls health  such praying will be efficacious thereor would be were anything needed to make her fit for those angels among whom she has gone for me they can do nothingunless it be that in knowing how much she loved me i may strive to be as she was  and for your happiness  psha he exclaimed  you must let me do her commission lord hampstead i was to bid you remember that god in his goodness has ordained that the dead after awhile shall be remembered only with a softened sorrow i was to tell you that as a man you should give your thoughts to other things it is not from myselfit is from her  she did not know she did not understand as regards good and evil she was to my eyes perfectperfect as she was in beauty in grace and feminine tenderness but the character of others she had not learned to read but i need not trouble you as to that mrs roden you have been good to her as though you were her mother and i will love you for it while i live then he was going away but he turned again to ask some question as to the funeral might he do it mrs roden shook her head but i shall be there to this she assented but explained to him that zachary fay would admit of no interference with that which he considered to be his own privilege and his own duty  lord hampstead had driven himself over from hendon hall and had driven fast when he left mrs rodens house the groom was driving the dogcart up and down paradise row waiting for his master but the master walked on out of the row forgetting altogether the horse and the cart and the man not knowing whither he was going  the blow had come and though it had been fully expected though he had known well that it was coming it struck him now as hard almost harder than if it had not been expected it seemed to himself that he was unable to endure his sorrow now because he had been already weakened by such a load of sorrow because he had grieved so much he could not now bear this further grief as he walked on he beat his hands about unconscious that he was in the midst of men and women who were gazing at him in the streets there was nothing left to himnothing nothing nothing he felt that if he could rid himself of his titles rid himself of his wealth rid himself of the very clothes upon his back it would be better for him so that he might not seem to himself to think that comfort could be found in externals marion he said over and over again in little whispered words but loud enough for his own ears to hear the sound and then he uttered phrases which were almost fantastic in their woe but which declared what was and had been the condition of his mind towards her since she had become so inexpressibly dear to him my wife he said my own one mother of my children my woman my countess my princess they should have seen they should have acknowledged they should have known whom it was that i had brought among themof what nature should be the woman whom a man should set in a high place i had made my choiceand then that it should come to this there is no good to be done he said again it all turns to ashes and to dust the low things of the world are those which prevail oh marion that i could be with you though it were to be nowherethough the great story should have no pathetic ending though the last long eternal chapter should be a blankstill to have wandered away with you would have been something as soon as he reached his house he walked straight into the drawingroom and having carefully closed the door he took the poker in his hand and held it clasped there as something precious it is the only thing of mine he said that she has touched even then i swore to myself that this hearth should be her hearth that here we would sit together and be one flesh and one bone then surreptitiously he took the bit of iron away with him and hid it among his treasuresto the subsequent dismay of the housemaid  there came to him a summons from the quaker to the funeral and on the day named without saying a word to any one he took the train and went down to pegwell bay from the moment on which the messenger had come from mrs roden he had dressed himself in black and he now made no difference in his garments poor zachary said but little to him but that little was very bitter it has been so with all of them he said they have all been taken the lord cannot strike me again now of the highlyborn strangers grief or of the cause which brought him there he had not a word to say nor did lord hampstead speak of his own sorrow i sympathize and condole with you he said to the old man the quaker shook his head and after that there was silence between them till they parted to the few others who were there lord hampstead did not address himself nor did they to him from the grave when the clod of earth had been thrown on it he walked slowly away without a sign on his face of that agony which was rending his heart there was a carriage there to take him to the railway but he only shook his head when he was invited to enter it he walked off and wandered about for hours till he thought that the graveyard would be deserted then he returned and when he found himself alone he stood over the newly heapedup soil marion he said to himself over and over again whispering as he stood there marionmarion my wife my woman as he stood by the grave side one came softly stealing up to him and laid a hand upon his shoulder he turned round quickly and saw that it was the bereaved father mr fay he said we have both lost the only thing that either of us valued  what is it to thee who are young and hardly knew her twelve months since  months make no difference i think  but old age my lord and childishness and solitude  i too am alone  she was my daughter my own thou hadst seen a pretty face and that was all she had remained with me when those others died had thou not come  did my coming kill her mr fay  i do not say that thou hast been good to her and i would not say a hard word to thee  i did think that nothing could have added to my sorrow  no my lord no no she would have died she was her dear mothers child and she was doomed go away and be thankful that thou too hast not become the father of children born only to perish in your sight i will not say an unkind word but i would wish to have my girls grave to myself upon this lord hampstead walked off and went back to his own home hardly knowing how he reached it  it was a month after this that he returned to the churchyard and might have been seen sitting on the small stone slab which the quaker had already caused to be laid over the grave it was a fine october evening and the sombre gloom of the hours was already darkening everything around he had crept into the enclosure silently almost slily so as to insure himself that his presence should not be noted and now made confident by the coming darkness he had seated himself on the stone during the long hours that he sat there no word was formed within his lips but he surrendered himself entirely to thoughts of what his life might have been had she been spared to him he had come there for a purpose the very opposite of that but how often does it come to pass that we are unable to drive our thoughts into that channel in which we wish them to flow he had thought much of her last words and was minded to attempt to do something as she would have had him do itnot that he might enjoy his life but that he might make it useful but as he sat there he could not think of the real futurenot of the future as it might be made to take this or that form by his own efforts but of the future as it would have been had she been with him of the glorious bright beautiful future which her love her goodness her beauty her tenderness would have illuminated  till he had seen her his heart had never been struck ideas sufficiently pleasant in themselves though tinged with a certain irony and sarcasm had been frequent with him as to his future career he would leave that building up of a future family of marquisesif future marquises there were to beto one of those young darlings whose bringingup would manifestly fit them for the work for himself he would perhaps philosophize perhaps do something that might be of servicewould indulge at any rate his own views as to humanitybut he would not burden himself with a countess and a nursery full of young lords and ladies he had often said to roden had often said to vivian that her ladyship his stepmother need not trouble herself he certainly would not be guilty of making either a countess or a marchioness they of course had laughed at him and had bid him bide his time he had bided his timeas they had saidand marion fay had been the result  yeslife would have been worth the having if marion fay had remained to him it was thus he communed with himself as he sat there on the tomb from the moment in which he had first seen her in mrs rodens house he had felt that things were changed with him there had come a vision before him which filled him full of delight as he learned to know the tones of her voice and the motion of her limbs and to succumb to the feminine charms with which she enveloped him all the world was brightened up to his view here there was no pretence of special blood no assumption of fantastic titles no claim to superiority because of fathers and mothers who were in themselves by no means superior to their neighbours and yet there had been all the grace all the loveliness all the tenderness without which his senses would not have been captivated he had never known his wantbut he had in truth wanted one who should be at all points a lady and yet not insist on a right to be so esteemed on the strength of inherited privileges chance good fortune providence had sent her to himor more probably the eternal fitness of things as he had allowed himself to argue when things had fallen out so well to his liking then there had arisen difficulties which had seemed to him to be vain and absurdthough they would not allow themselves to be at once swept away they had talked to him of his station and of hers making that an obstacle which to him had been a strong argument in favour of her love against this he had done battle with the resolute purpose which a man has who is sure of his cause he would have none of their sophistries none of their fears none of their oldfashioned absurdities did she love him was her heart to him as was his to her that was the one question on which it must all depend as he thought of it all sitting there on the tombstone he put out his arm as though to fold her form to his bosom when he thought of the moment in which he became sure that it was so there had been no doubt of the fullflowing current of her love then he had aroused himself and had shaken his mane like a lion and had sworn aloud that this vain obstacle should be no obstacle even though it was pleaded by herself nature had been strong enough within him to assure him that he would overcome the obstacle  and he had overcome itor was overcoming itwhen that other barrier gradually presented itself and loomed day by day terribly large before his affrighted eyes even to that he would not yieldnot only as regarded her but himself also had there been no such barrier the possession of marion would have been to him an assurance of perfect bliss which the prospect of fardistant death would not have effected when he began to perceive that her condition was not as that of other young women he became aware of a great dangerof a danger to himself as well as to her to himself rather than to her this increased rather than diminished his desire for the possession as the ardent rider will be more intent to take the fence when it looms before him large and difficult so with him the resolution to make marion his wife became the stronger when he knew that there were reasons of prudence reasons of caution reasons of worldly wisdom why he should not do so it had become a religion to him that she should be his one then gradually her strength had become known to him and slowly he was made aware that he must bow to her decision all that he wanted in all the world he must not havenot that the love which he craved was wanting but because she knew that her own doom was fixed  she had bade him retrick his beams and take the light and the splendour of his sun elsewhere the light and the splendour of his sun had all passed from him she had absorbed them altogether he while he had been boasting to himself of his power and his manliness in that he would certainly overcome all the barriers had found himself to be weak as water in her hands she in her soft feminine tones had told him what duty had required of her and as she had said so she had done then he had stood on one side and had remained looking on till she hadgone away and left him she had never been his it had not been allowed to him even to write his name as belonging also to her on the gravestone  but she had loved him there was nothing in it all but this to which his mind could revert with any feeling of satisfaction she had certainly loved him if such love might be continued between a disembodied spirit and one still upon the earthif there were any spirit capable of love after that divorce between the soul and the bodyher love certainly would still be true to him most assuredly his should be true to her whatever he might do towards obeying her in striving to form some manly purpose for his life he would never ask another woman to be his wife he would never look for other love the black coat should be laid aside as soon as might be so that the world around him should not have cause for remark but the mourning should never be taken from his heart  then when the darkness of night had quite come upon him he arose from his seat and flinging himself on his knees stretched his arms wildly across the grave marion he said marion oh marion will you hear me though gone from me art thou not mine he looked up into the night and there before his eyes was her figure beautiful as ever with all her loveliness of halfdeveloped form with her soft hair upon her shoulders and her eyes beamed on him and a heavenly smile came across her face and her lips moved as though she would encourage him my marionmy wife  very late that night the servants heard him as he opened the door and walked across the hall and made his way up to his own room     chapter xx  mr greenwoods last battle   during the whole of that long summer nothing was absolutely arranged as to roden and lady frances though it was known to all london and to a great many persons outside of london that they were certainly to become man and wife the summer was very long to lord and lady trafford because of the necessity incumbent on them of remaining through the last dregs of the season on account of lady amaldinas marriage had lady amaldina thrown herself away on another roden the aunt would have no doubt gone to the country but her niece had done her duty in life with so much propriety and success that it would have been indecent to desert her lady kingsbury therefore remained in park lane and was driven to endure frequently the sight of the post office clerk  for george roden was admitted to the house even though it was at last acknowledged that he must be george roden and nothing more and it was found also that he must be a post office clerk and nothing more lord persiflage on whom lady kingsbury chiefly depended for seeing that her own darlings should not be disgraced by being made brothersinlaw to anything so low as a clerk in the post office was angry at last and declared that it was impossible to help a man who would not help himself it is no use trying to pick a man up who will lie in the gutter it was thus he spoke of roden in his anger and then the marchioness would wring her hands and abuse her stepdaughter lord persiflage did think that something might be done for the young man if the young man would only allow himself to be called a duke but the young man would not allow it and lord persiflage did not see what could be done nevertheless there was a general idea abroad in the world that something would be done even the mysterious savour of high rank which attached itself to the young man would do something for him  it may be remembered that the marquis himself when first the fact had come to his ears that his daughter loved the young man had been almost as ferociously angry as his wife he had assented to the carrying of her away to the saxon castle he had frowned upon her he had been a party to the expelling her from his own house but gradually his heart had become softened towards her in his illness he had repented of his harshness he had not borne her continued absence easily and had of late looked about for an excuse for accepting her lover when the man was discovered to be a duke though it was only an italian duke of course he accepted him now his wife told him daily that roden was not a duke because he would not accept his dukedomand ought therefore again to be rejected lord persiflage had declared that nothing could be done for him and therefore he ought to be rejected but the marquis clung to his daughter as the man was absolutely a duke according to the laws of all the heralds and all the courts and all the tables of precedency and usages of peerage in christendom he could not degrade himself even by any motion of his own he was the eldest and the legitimate son of the last duca di crinolaso the marquis saidand as such was a fitting aspirant for the hand of the daughter of an english peer but he hasnt got a shilling said lady kingsbury weeping the marquis felt that it was within his own power to produce some remedy for this evil but he did not care to say as much to his wife who was tender on that point in regard to the interest of her three darlings roden continued his visits to park lane very frequently all through the summer and had already arranged for an autumn visit to castle hautboyin spite of that angry word spoken by lord persiflage everybody knew he was to marry lady frances but when the season was over and all the world had flitted from london nothing was settled  lady kingsbury was of course very unhappy during all this time but there was a source of misery deeper more pressing more crushing than even the post office clerk mr greenwood the late chaplain had during his last interview with the marquis expressed some noble sentiments he would betray nothing that had been said to him in confidence he would do nothing that could annoy the marchioness because the marchioness was a lady and as such entitled to all courtesy from him as a gentleman there were grounds no doubt on which he could found a claim but he would not insist on them as his doing so would be distasteful to her ladyship he felt that he was being illtreated almost robbed but he would put up with that rather than say a word which would come against his own conscience as a gentleman with these high assurances he took his leave of the marquis as though he intended to put up with the beggarly stipend of £200 a year which the marquis had promised him perhaps that had been his intentionbut before two days were over he had remembered that though it might be base to tell her ladyships secrets the pennypost was still open to him  it certainly was the case that lady kingsbury had spoken to him with strong hopes of the death of the heir to the title mr greenwood in discussing the matter with himself went beyond that and declared to himself that she had done so with expectation as well as hope fearful words had been said so he assured himself he thanked his god that nothing had come of it only for him somethinghe assured himselfwould have come of it the whisperings in that upstairs sittingroom at trafford had been dreadful he had divulged nothing he had held his tonguelike a gentleman but ought he not to be paid for holding his tongue there are so many who act honestly from noble motives and then feel that their honesty should be rewarded by all those gains which dishonesty might have procured for them about a fortnight after the visit which mr greenwood made to the marquis he did write a letter to the marchioness i am not anxious he said to do more than remind your ladyship of those peculiarly confidential discussions which took place between yourself and me at trafford during the last winter but i think you will acknowledge that they were of a nature to make me feel that i should not be discarded like an old glove if you would tell his lordship that something should be done for me something would be done her ladyship when she received this was very much frightened she remembered the expressions she had allowed herself to use and did say a hesitating halting word to her husband suggesting that mr greenwoods pension should be increased the marquis turned upon her in anger did you ever promise him anything he asked noshe had promised him nothing i am giving him more than he deserves and will do no more said the marquis there was something in his voice which forbade her to speak another word  mr greenwoods letter having remained for ten days without an answer there came another i cannot but think that you will acknowledge my right to expect an answer he said considering the many years through which i have enjoyed the privilege of your ladyships friendship and the very confidential terms on which we have been used to discuss matters of the highest interest to us both the matters had no doubt been the probability of the accession to the title of her own son through the demise of his elder brother she understood now all her own folly and something of her own wickedness to this second appeal she wrote a short answer having laid awake over it one entire night      dear mr greenwoodi have spoken to the marquis and he    will do nothing     yours truly     c kingsbury   this she did without saying a word to her husband  then after the interval of a few days there came a third letter      my dear lady kingsbury     i cannot allow myself to think that this should be the    end of it all after so many years of social intimacy and    confidential intercourse can you yourself imagine the    condition of a gentleman of my age reduced after a life of    ease and comfort to exist on a miserable pension of £200 a    year it simply means deathdeath have i not a right to    expect something better after the devotion of a life     who has known as well as i the stumblingblocks to    your ladyships ambition which have been found in the    existences of lord hampstead and lady frances trafford    i have sympathized with you no doubtpartly because of    their peculiarities partly from sincere affection for    your ladyship it cannot surely be that your ladyship    should now treat me as an enemy because i could do no more    than sympathize     dig i cannot to beg i am ashamed you will hardly wish    that i should perish from want i have not as yet been    driven to open out my sad case to any one but yourself    do not force me to itfor the sake of those darling    children for whose welfare i have ever been so anxious     believe me to be    your ladyships most devoted and faithful friend     thomas greenwood   this epistle so frightened her that she began to consider how she might best collect together a sufficient sum of money to satisfy the man she did succeed in sending him a note for £50 but this he was too wary to take he returned it saying that he could not though steeped in poverty accept chance eleemosynary aid what he requiredand had he thought a right to askwas an increase to the fixed stipend allowed him he must he thought again force himself upon the presence of the marquis and explain the nature of the demand more explicitly  upon this lady kingsbury showed all the letters to her husband what does he mean by stumblingblocks asked the marquis in his wrath then there was a scene which was sad enough she had to confess that she had spoken very freely to the chaplain respecting her stepchildren freely what does freely mean do you want them out of the way what a question for a husband to have to ask his wife but she had a door by which she could partly escape it was not that she had wanted them out of the way but that she had been so horrified by what she had thought to be their very improper ideas as to their own rank of life those marriages which they had intended had caused her to speak as she had done to the chaplain when alone at trafford she had no doubt opened her mind to the clergyman she rested a great deal on the undoubted fact that mr greenwood was a clergyman hampstead and fanny had been stumblingblocks to her ambition because she had desired to see them married properly into proper families she probably thought that she was telling the truth as she said all this it was at any rate accepted as truth and she was condoned as to hampstead it was known by this time that that marriage could never take place and as to lady frances the marchioness was driven in her present misery to confess that as the duca was in truth a duca his family must be held to be proper  but the marquis sent for mr cumming his london solicitor and put all the letters into his handwith such explanation as he thought necessary to give mr cumming at first recommended that the pension should be altogether stopped but to this the marquis did not consent it would not suit me that he should starve said the marquis but if he continues to write to her ladyship something must be done  threatening letters to extort money said the lawyer confidently i can have him before a magistrate tomorrow my lord if it be thought well it was however felt to be expedient that mr cumming should in the first case send for mr greenwood and explain to that gentleman the nature of the law  mr cumming no doubt felt himself that it would be well that mr greenwood should not starve and well also that application should not be made to the magistrate unless as a last resort he too asked himself what was meant by stumblingblocks mr greenwood was a greedy rascal descending to the lowest depth of villany with the view of making money out of the fears of a silly woman but the silly woman the lawyer thought must have been almost worse than silly it seemed natural to mr cumming that a stepmother should be anxious for the worldly welfare of her own childrennot unnatural perhaps that she should be so anxious as to have a feeling at her heart amounting almost to a wish that chance should remove the obstacle chance as mr cumming was aware could in such a case mean onlydeath mr cumming when he put this in plain terms to himself felt it to be very horrid but there might be a doubt whether such a feeling would be criminal if backed up by no deed and expressed by no word but here it seemed that words had been spoken mr greenwood had probably invented that particular phrase but would hardly have invented it unless something had been said to justify it it was his business however to crush mr greenwood and not to expose her ladyship he wrote a very civil note to mr greenwood would mr greenwood do him the kindness to call in bedford row at such or such an houror indeed at any other hour that might suit him mr greenwood thinking much of it and resolving in his mind that any increase to his pension might probably be made through mr cumming did as he was bid and waited upon the lawyer  mr cumming when the clergyman was shown in was seated with the letters before himthe various letters which mr greenwood had written to lady kingsburyfolded out one over another so that the visitors eye might see them and feel their presence but he did not intend to use them unless of necessity mr greenwood he said i learn that you are discontented with the amount of a retiring allowance which the marquis of kingsbury has made you on leaving his service  i am mr cumming certainly i am£200 a year is not  let us call it £300 mr greenwood  well yes lord hampstead did say something  and has paid something let us call it £300 not that the amount matters the marquis and lord hampstead are determined not to increase it  determined  quite determined that under no circumstances will they increase it they may find it necessary to stop it  is this a threat  certainly it is a threatas far as it goes there is another threat which i may have to make for the sake of coercing you but i do not wish to use it if i can do without it  her ladyship knows that i am illtreated in this matter she sent me £50 and i returned it it was not in that way that i wished to be paid for my services  it was well for you that you did but for that i could not certainly have asked you to come and see me here  you could not  noi could not you will probably understand what i mean here mr cumming laid his hands upon the letters but made no other allusion to them a very few words more will i think settle all that there is to be arranged between us the marquis from certain reasons of humanitywith which i for one hardly sympathize in this caseis most unwilling to stop or even to lessen the ample pension which is paid to you  ampleafter a whole lifetime  but he will do so if you write any further letters to any member of his family  that is tyranny mr cumming  very well then is the marquis a tyrant but he will go further than that in his tyranny if it be necessary to defend either himself or any of his family from further annoyance he will do so by criminal proceedings you are probably aware that the doing this would be very disagreeable to the marquis undoubtedly it would to such a man as lord kingsbury it is a great trouble to have his own name or worse that of others of his family brought into a police court but if necessary it will be done i do not ask you for any assurance mr greenwood because it may be well that you should take a little time to think of it but unless you are willing to lose your income and to be taken before a police magistrate for endeavouring to extort money by threatening letters you had better hold your hand  i have never threatened  good morning mr greenwood  mr cumming i have threatened no one  good morning mr greenwood then the discarded chaplain took his leave failing to find the words with which he could satisfactorily express his sense of the injury which had been done him  before that day was over he had made up his mind to take his £300 a year and be silent the marquis he now found was not so infirm as he had thought nor the marchioness quite so full of fears he must give it up and take his pittance but in doing so he continued to assure himself that he was greatly injured and did not cease to accuse lord kingsbury of sordid parsimony in refusing to reward adequately one whose services to the family had been so faithful and longenduring  it may however be understood that in the midst of troubles such as these lady kingsbury did not pass a pleasant summer     chapter xxi  the registrar of state records   although lord persiflage had seemed to be very angry with the recusant duke and had made that uncivil speech about the gutter still he was quite willing that george roden should be asked down to castle hautboy of course we must do something for him he said to his wife but i hate scrupulous men i dont blame him at all for making such a girl as fanny fall in love with him if i were a post office clerk id do the same if i could  not you you wouldnt have given yourself the trouble  but when i had done it i wouldnt have given her friends more trouble than was necessary i should have known that they would have had to drag me up somewhere i should have looked for that but i shouldnt have made myself difficult when chance gave a helping hand why shouldnt he have taken his title  of course we all wish he would  fanny is as bad as he is she has caught some of hampsteads levelling ideas and encourages the young man it was all kingsburys fault from the first he began the world wrong and now he cannot get himself right again a radical aristocrat is a contradiction in terms it is very well that there should be radicals it would be a stupid donothing world without them but a man cant be oil and vinegar at the same time this was the expression made by lord persiflage of his general ideas on politics in reference to george roden and his connection with the trafford family but not the less was george roden asked down to castle hautboy lady frances was not to be thrown over because she had made a fool of herselfnor was george roden to be left out in the cold belonging as he did now to lady frances lord persiflage never approved very much of anybodybut he never threw anybody over  it was soon after the funeral of marion fay that roden went down to cumberland during the last two months of marions illness hampstead and roden had been very often together not that they had lived together as hampstead had declared himself unable to bear continued society his hours had been passed alone but there had not been many days in which the friends had not seen each other for a few minutes it had become a habit with hampstead to ride over to paradise row when roden had returned from the office at first mrs roden also had been therebut latterly she had spent her time altogether at pegwell bay nevertheless lord hampstead would come and would say a few words and would then ride home again when all was over at pegwell bay when the funeral was at hand and during the few days of absolutely prostrating grief which followed it nothing was seen of himbut on the evening before his friends journey down to castle hautboy he again appeared in the row on this occasion he walked over and his friend returned with him a part of the way you must do something with yourself roden said to him  i see no need of doing anything special how many men do nothing with themselves  men either work or play  i do not think i shall play much  not for a time certainly you used to play but i can imagine that the power of doing so will have deserted you  i shant hunt if you mean that  i do not mean that at all said rodenbut that you should do something there must be some occupation or life will be insupportable  it is insupportable said the young man looking away so that his countenance should not be seen  but it must be supported let the load be ever so heavy it must be carried you would not destroy yourself  nosaid the other slowly no i would not do that if any one would do it for me  no one will do it for you not to have some plan of active life some defined labour by which the weariness of the time may be conquered would be a weakness and a cowardice next door to that of suicide  roden said the lord your severity is brutal  the question is whether it be true you shall call it what you likeor call me what you like but can you contradict what i say do you not feel that it is your duty as a man to apply what intellect you have and what strength to some purpose  then by degrees lord hampstead did explain the purpose he had before him he intended to have a yacht built and start alone and cruise about the face of the world he would take books with him and study the peoples and the countries which he visited  alone asked roden  yes aloneas far as a man may be alone with a crew and a captain around him i shall make acquaintances as i go and shall be able to bear them as such they will know nothing of my secret wound had i you with meyou and my sister let us supposeor vivian or any one from here who had known me i could not even struggle to raise my head  it would wear off  i will go alone and if occasion offers i will make fresh acquaintances i will begin another life which shall have no connection with the old oneexcept that which will be continued by the thread of my own memory no one shall be near me who may even think of her name when my own ways and manners are called in question he went on to explain that he would set himself to work at once the ship must be built and the crew collected and the stores prepared he thought that in this way he might find employment for himself till the spring in the spring if all was ready he would start till that time came he would live at hendon hallstill alone he so far relented however as to say that if his sister was married before he began his wanderings he would be present at her marriage  early in the course of the evening he had explained to roden that his father and he had conjointly arranged to give lady frances £40000 on her wedding can that be necessary asked roden  you must live and as you have gone into a nest with the drones you must live in some sort as the drones do  i hope i shall never be a drone  you cannot touch pitch and not be defiled youll be expected to wear gloves and drink fine wineor at any rate to give it to your friends your wife will have to ride in a coach if she dont people will point at her and think shes a pauper because she has a handle to her name they talk of the upper ten thousand it is as hard to get out from among them as it is to get in among them though you have been wonderfully stout about the italian title youll find that it will stick to you then it was explained that the money which was to be given would in no wise interfere with the darlings whatever was to be added to the fortune which would naturally have belonged to lady frances would come not from her father but from her brother  when roden arrived at castle hautboy lord persiflage was there though he remained but for a day he was due to be with the queen for a montha duty which was evidently much to his taste though he affected to frown over it as a hardship i am sorry roden he said that i should be obliged to leave you and everybody elsebut a government hack you know has to be a government hack this was rather strong from a secretary of state to a clerk in the post office but roden had to let it pass lest he should give an opening to some remark on his own repudiated rank i shall be back before you are gone i hope and then perhaps we may arrange something the only thing that roden wished to arrange was a day for his own wedding as to which as far as he knew lord persiflage could have nothing to say  i dont think you ought to be sorry lady frances said to her lover as they were wandering about on the mountains he had endeavoured to explain to her that this large income which was now promised to him rather impeded than assisted the scheme of life which he had suggested to himself  not sorrybut disappointed if you know the difference  not exactly  i had wanted to feel that i should earn my wifes bread  so you shall if a man works honestly for his living i dont think he need inquire too curiously what proportion of it may come from his own labour or from some other source if i had had nothing we should have done very well without the coachas poor hampstead calls it but if the coach is there i dont see why we shouldnt ride in it  i should like to earn the coach too said roden  this sir will be a lesson serviceable in teaching you that you are not to be allowed to have your own way in everything  an additional leave of absence for a month had been accorded to roden he had already been absent during a considerable time in the spring of the year and in the ordinary course of events would not have been entitled to this prolonged indulgence but there were reasons deemed to be sufficient he was going to meet a cabinet minister he was engaged to marry the daughter of a marquis and it was known that he was not simply george roden but in truth the duca di crinola he had suffered some qualms of conscience as to the favour to be thus shown him but had quieted them by the idea that when a man is in love something special ought to be done for him he remained therefore till the foreign secretary returned from his royal service and had by that time fixed the period of his marriage it was to take place in the cold comfortless month of march it would be a great thing he had said to have hampstead present at it and it was hampsteads intention to start on his long travels early in april i dont see why people shouldnt be married in cold weather as well as in hot said vivian brides need not go about always in muslin  when lord persiflage returned to castle hautboy he had his plan ready arranged for relieving his future halfnephewinlawif there be such a relationshipfrom the ignominy of the post office i have her majestys permission he said to roden to offer you the position of registrar of state records to the foreign office  registrar of state records to the foreign office  fifteen hundred a year said his lordship going off at once to this one point of true vital importance i am bound to say that i think i could have done better for you had you consented to bear the title which is as completely your own as is that mine by which i am called  dont let us go back to that my lord  oh nocertainly not only this if you could be brought to think better of itif fanny could be induced to make you think better of itthe office now offered to you would i think be more comfortable to you  how so  i can hardly explain but it would there is no reason on earth why it should not be held by an italian we had an italian for many years librarian at the museum and as an italian you would of course be entitled to call yourself by your hereditary title  i shall never be other than an englishman  very well one man may lead a horse to water but a thousand cannot make him drink i only tell you what would be the case the title would no doubt give a prestige to the new office it is exactly that kind of work which would fall readily into the hands of a foreigner of high rank one cannot explain these things but it is so the £1500 a year would more probably become £2000 if you submitted to be called by your own proper name everybody knew that lord persiflage understood the civil service of his country perfectly he was a man who never worked very hard himself or expected those under him to do so but he liked common sense and hated scruples and he considered it to be a mans duty to take care of himselfof himself first of all and then perhaps afterwards of the service  neither did roden nor did lady frances give way a bit the more for this they were persistent in clinging to their old comparatively humble english name lady frances would be lady frances to the end but she would be no more than lady frances roden and george roden would be george roden whether a clerk in the post office or registrar of state records to the foreign office so much the next new bride declared with great energy to the last new bride who had just returned from her short wedding tour having been hurried home so that her husband might be able to lay the first stone of the new bridge to be built over the menai straits lady llwddythlw with all the composed manners of a steady matron was at castle hautboy and used all her powers of persuasion never mind my dear what he says lady llwddythlw urged what you should think of is what will be good for him he would be somebodyalmost as good as an under secretary of statewith a title he would get to be considered among the big official swells there is so much in a name of course youve got your rank but you ought to insist on it for his sake  lady frances did not give way in the least nor did any one venture to call the duca by his title formally or openly but as lord hampstead had said it stuck to him the women when they were alone with him would call him duca joking with him and it was out of the question that he should be angry with them for their jokes he became aware that behind his back he was always spoken of as the duke and that this was not done with any idea of laughing at him the people around him believed that he was a duke and ought to be called a duke of course it was in joke that lady llwddythlw always called lady frances duchessina when they were together because lady frances had certainly not as yet acquired her right to the name but it all tended to the same point he became aware that the very servants around him understood it they did not call him your grace or my lord or make spoken allusion to his rank but they looked it all that obsequiousness due to an hereditary nobleman which is dear to the domestic heart was paid to him he found himself called upon by lady persiflage to go into the diningroom out of his proper place there was a fair excuse for this while the party was small and confined to few beyond the family as it was expected that the two declared lovers should sit together but when this had been done with a larger party he expostulated with his hostess my dear mr roden she saidi suppose i must call you so  its my name at any rate  there are certain points on which as far as i can see a man may be allowed to have his wayand certain points on which he may not  as to his own name  yes on the matter of your name i do not see my way how to get the better of you just at present though on account of my near connection with fanny i am very anxious to do so but as to the fact of your rank there it is whenever i see youand i hope i shall see you very ofteni shall always suppose that i see an italian nobleman of the first class and shall treat you so he shrugged his shoulders feeling that he had nothing else to do if i were to find myself in the society of some man calling himself by a title to which i knew that he had no righti should probably call him by no name but i should be very careful not to treat him as a nobleman knowing that he had no right to be so treated what can i do in your case but just reverse the position  he never went back to the post officeof course what should a registrar of state records to the foreign office do in so humble an establishment he never went back for the purposes of work he called to bid farewell to sir boreas mr jerningham crocker and others with whom he had served i did not think we should see much more of you said sir boreas laughing  i intended to live and die with you said roden  we dont have dukes or at any rate we dont keep them like to like is a motto which i always find true when i heard that you were living with a young lord and were going to marry the daughter of a marquis and had a title of your own which you could use as soon as you pleased i knew that i should lose you then he added in a little whisper you couldnt get crocker made a duke could youor a registrar of records  mr jerningham was full of smiles and bows pervaded thoroughly by a feeling that he was bidding farewell to an august nobleman though for negative reasons he was not to be allowed to gratify his tongue by naming the august name crocker was a little shybut he plucked up his courage at last i shall always know what i know you know he said as he shook hands with the friend to whom he had been so much attached bobbin and geraghty made no allusions to the title but they too as they were severally greeted were evidently under the influence of the nobility of their late brother clerk  the marriage was duly solemnized when march came in the parish church of trafford there was nothing grandno even distant imitation of lady amaldinas glorious cavalcade hampstead did come down and endeavoured for the occasion to fit himself for the joy of the day his ship was ready for him and he intended to start now in a week or two as it happened that the house was not sitting lord llwddythlw at the instigation of his wife was present one good turn deserves another lady llwddythlw had said to him and the darlings were there in all their glory loud beautiful and unruly lady kingsbury was of course present but was too much in abeyance to be able to arouse even a sign of displeasure since that reference to the stumbling blocks had reached her husband and since those fears with which mr greenwood had filled her she had been awed into quiescence  the bridegroom was of course married under the simple name of george rodenand we must part with him under that name but it is the belief of the present chronicler that the aristocratic element will prevail and that the time will come soon in which the registrar of state records to the foreign office will be known in the purlieus of downing street as the duca di crinola
