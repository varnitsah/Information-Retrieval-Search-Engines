sunshine near the end of dufferin avenue which skirts the elevated ground above the city of quebec  behind her rose the heights of abraham where the dying wolfe wrested canada from france in front churches banks offices and dwellings curiously combining the old and the very new rose tier on tier to the great red frontenac hotel at which she was staying  it is a picturesque city that climbs back from its noble river supreme perhaps in its situation among canadian towns and still retaining something of the exotic stamp set upon it by its first builders whose art was learned in the france of long ago  from where she sat mrs keith could not see the ugly wooden wharves her glance rested on the flood that flowed towards her still and deep through a gorge lined with crags and woods and then widening rapidly washed the shores of a low green island  opposite her white houses shone on the levis ridge and beyond this a vast sweep of country steeped in gradations of colour that ended in ethereal blue rolled away towards the hills of maine  quebec was then filled with distinguished guests  british royalty had visited it with many who belonged to the great world in london and some who aspired to do so canada had become fashionable and in addition to english folk of station westerners and americans of note had gathered in the ancient city  the ceremonies were over but the company had not all dispersed  the two ladies were elderly  they had played their part in the drama of life one of them in a strenuous manner and now they were content with the position of lookers on  so far however nothing had occurred since breakfast to excite their interest and by and by mrs keith turned to her companion with characteristic briskness  i think ill go to montreal by the special boat tonight she said the hotels crowded the towns full and you keep meeting people whom you know or have heard about  i came here to see canada but find it hard to realize that im not in london im tired of the bustle  mrs ashborne smiled  she had met margaret keith by chance in quebec but their acquaintance was of several years standing  tired she said  that is surely a new sensation for you  ive often envied you your energy  age had touched mrs keith lightly though she had long been a childless widow and had silvery hair  tall and finely made with prominent nose and piercing eyes she was marked by a certain stateliness and a decided manner  she was blunt without rudeness and though often forceful was seldom arrogant  careless of her dress as she generally was margaret keith bore the stamp of refinement and breeding  ah she said i begin to feel im old  but will you come to montreal with me tonight  i suppose id better though the boat takes longer than the train and i hear that the place viger is full  i dont know anything about the other hotels they mightnt be comfortable  theyll no doubt be able to offer us all that we require and i never pamper myself mrs keith replied  in fact its now and then a relief to do something thats opposed to the luxuriousness of the age  this was a favourite topic but she broke off as a man came towards her carrying one or two small parcels which apparently belonged to the girl at his side  he was a handsome man tall and rather spare with dark eyes and a soldierly look  his movements were quick and forceful but a hint of what mrs keith called swagger somewhat spoiled his bearing  she thought he allowed his selfconfidence to be seen too plainly  the girl formed a marked contrast to him she was short and slender her hair and eyes were brown while her prettiness for one could not have called her beautiful was of an essentially delicate kind  it did not strike one at first sight but grew upon her acquaintances  her manner was quiet and reserved and she was plainly dressed in white but when she turned and dismissed her companion her pose was graceful  then she handed mrs keith some letters and papers  i have been to the post office and captain sedgwick made them search for our mail she said  it came some time ago but there was a mistake through its not being addressed to the hotel  mrs keith took the letters and gave mrs ashborne an english newspaper but the girl went on the bobcat has torn a hole in the basket and im afraid its trying to get at the mink  tell some of the hotel people to take it out at once and see that the basket is sent to be mended  the girl withdrew and mrs ashborne looked up  did i hear aright she said a bobcat  you did  i am making a collection of the smaller american animals and a bobcat is something like a big english ferret  it has high hindquarters and walks with a curious jump which i suppose is why it got its name  im not sure it lives in canada and an american got this one for me  i find natural history interesting  margaret keith was known to be eccentric and her companion laughed i should imagine you found it expensive and arent some of the creatures savage  millicent looks after them and i always beat the sellers down fortunately i can afford to indulge in my caprices and you can consider this my latest fad if you like  i am subject to no claims and my means are hardly large enough to make me an object of interest to sycophantic relatives  is your companion fond of attending to wild animals mrs ashborne inquired  i have wondered where you got her  you have had a number but she is different from the rest  i suppose you mean she is too good for the post mrs keith suggested  however i dont mind telling you that she is eustace grahams daughter you must have heard of him  eustace graham  wasnt he in rather bad odouronly tolerated on the fringe of society  i seem to recollect some curious tales about him  latterly he was outside the fringe indeed i dont know how he kept on his feet so long but he went downhill fast towards the end  a plucker of plump pigeons an expensive friend to smart young subalterns and boys about town  cards bets loans arranged and that kind of thing  all the same he had his good points when i first knew him  but after such a life as his daughter must have led do you consider her a suitable person to take about with you  what do your friends think  they have to receive her now and then  i cant say that i have much cause to respect my friends opinions and im not afraid of the girls contaminating me mrs keith replied besides millicent who lost her mother early lived with her aunts until a few months before her fathers death  i expect eustace felt more embarrassed than grateful when she came to take care of him but to do him justice he would see that none of the taint of his surroundings rested on the girl  he did wrong but i think he paid for it and it is better to be charitable  she broke off and glanced down at the big liner with creamcoloured funnel that was slowly swinging across the stream as she resumed i must send millicent to buy our tickets for montreal  the hotel will be crowded before long with that steamers noisy passengers  do you know anything about captain sedgwick who brought you your letters her companion asked  not much  distinguished himself somewhere and holds a government post in a west african colony  came home on furlough and seems to have had some part in the state functions here  im inclined to think hes a soldier of fortune a man with a humble beginning determined to get on  isnt that mrs chudleigh hes now talking to  mrs ashborne was shortsighted but margaret keiths eyes were better and she noticed the stylish woman whom sedgwick had joined  yes she said  a widow i believe though one would not suspect it from her clothes  she seems to know some of my friends but i met her here for the first time a few days ago  she married very young and her husband who died in a few years left her a good deal of money he was a merchant in calcutta  shes too smart and advanced for my taste but her people have some standing  it looks as if she were attracted by sedgwick shes undoubtedly gracious to him  then its an opportunity he wont miss  the mans an adventurer  sedgwick and his companion passed out of sight and mrs ashborne opened the morning post from which she presently looked up  a marriagebetween blanche newcombe and captain challonerat thornton holme in shropshire she read out  do you know the bride  i know bertram challoner better mrs keith replied and was silent for a minute or two musing on former days  then she went on his mother was an old friend of mine a woman of imagination with strong artistic tastes and bertram resembles her  it was his father the colonel who forced him into the army and im somewhat astonished that he has done so well  they were all soldiers i understand  but wasnt there some scandal about a cousin  richard blake said mrs keith making room for millicent graham her companion who rejoined them  its getting an old story and i always found it puzzling  so far as one could judge dick blake should have made an excellent officer his mother the colonels sister was true to the challoner strain his father a reckless irish sportsman  but what was the story  i havent heard it  after blake broke his neck when hunting the colonel brought dick up and as a matter of course sent him into the army  he became a sapper and entering the indian service met his cousin bertram who was in the line somewhere on the frontier  they were both sent with an expedition into the hills and there was a night attack  it was important that an advanced post should be defended and dick had laid out the trenches  in the middle of the fight an officer lost his nerve the position was stormed and the expedition terribly cut up owing to the darkness and confusion there was a doubt about who had led the retreat but dick was blamed and made no defence  in spite of this he was acquitted at the inquiry perhaps because he was a favourite and colonel challoner was well known upon the frontier but the opinion of the mess was against him  he left the service and the challoners never speak of him  i once met lieutenant blake millicent broke in with a flush in her face  though he only spoke a word or two to me he did a very chivalrous thing one that needed courage and coolness  i find it hard to believe he could be a coward  so do i mrs keith agreed  still i must say that i havent seen him since he was a boy  i met him once said mrs ashborne  there was a man in the hotel yesterday who strongly reminded me of him but i think he must have left last night  i have forgotten my letters but i know from whom they come and theyll no doubt give me some news of the wedding mrs keith remarked and while she opened them millicent sat looking down on the glistening river with her thoughts far away  she was reconstructing a scene from the past and she could picture with vivid distinctness the small untidy drawingroom of a london flat in which she sat alone and halfdismayed one evening soon after she had joined her father  a few beautiful objects of art were scattered amongst the shabby furniture there were stains of wine on the fine eastern rug an inlaid table was scraped and damaged and one chair had a broken leg  all she saw spoke of neglect and vanished prosperity  hoarse voices and loud laughter came from an adjoining room and a smell of cigar smoke accompanied them  sitting at the piano she restlessly turned over some music and now and then played a few bars to divert her troubled thoughts  until a few weeks before she had led a peaceful life in the country and the finding her father of such doubtful character and habits had been a painful surprise  she was interrupted by the violent opening of the door and a group of excited men burst into the room  they were shouting with laughter at a joke which made her blush and one dragged a companion in by the arm another breaking off from rude horseplay came towards her with a drunken leer  she shrank from his hot face and wineladen breath as she drew back wondering how she could reach her father who stood in the doorway trying to restrain his guests  then a young man sprang forward with disgust and anger in his brown face and she felt that she was safe  he looked clean and wholesome by contrast with the rest and his movements were swift and athletic  millicent could remember him very well for she had often thought of lieutenant blake with gratitude  just as the tipsy gallant stretched out his hand to seize her the electric light went out there was a brief scuffle in the darkness the door banged and when the light flashed up again only blake and her father were in the room afterwards her father told her with a look of shame in his handsome dissipated face that he had been afraid of something of the kind happening and she must leave him  millicent refused for worn as he was by many excesses his health was breaking down and when he fell ill she nursed him until he died  she had not seen lieutenant blake since  by and by mrs keiths voice broke in upon her recollections  its possible we may see bertram and the new mrs challoner  she is going out with him but they are to travel by the canadian pacific route and spend some time in japan before proceeding to his indian station referring to the date of her letter she resumed they may have caught the boat that has just come in shes one of the railway empresses and theres an allan liner due tomorrow  now i think well go to the hotel and try to get a list of the passengers  she rose and they walked slowly back along the avenue     chapter ii  millicent renews an acquaintance  dusk was falling on the broad river and the bold ridge behind the city stood out sharp and black against a fading gleam in the western sky when richard blake hurried along the wharf  close at hand a big sidewheel steamer spotlessly white with tiers of decks that towered above the sheds and blazed with light was receiving the last of her passengers and on reaching the gangway blake stood aside to let an elderly lady pass  she was followed by her maid and a girl whose face he could not see  it was a few minutes after the sailing time and as the lady stepped on board a rope fell with a splash  there was a shout of warning as the bows caught by the current began to swing out into the stream and the end of the gangway slipped along the edge of the wharf  it threatened to fall into the river the girl was not on board yet and blake leaped upon the plank  seizing her shoulder he drove her forward until a seaman reaching out drew her safe on deck  then the paddles splashed and as the boat forged out into the stream the girl turned and thanked blake  he could not see her clearly because an overarching deck cast a shadow upon her face  glad to have been of assistance but i dont think you could have fallen in he said  the guyrope they had on the gangway might have held it up  turning away he entered the smokeroom where he spent a while over an english newspaper that devoted some space to social functions and the doings of people of importance noticing once or twice with a curious smile mention of names he knew  he had the gift of making friends and before he went to india had met a number of men and women of note who had been disposed to like him  then he had won the good opinion of responsible officers on the turbulent frontier and made acquaintances that might have been valuable  now however he had done with all that he was banished from the world they moved in and if they ever remembered him it was no doubt as one who had gone under  shaking off these thoughts he joined some americans in a game of cards and it was late at night when he went out into the moonlight as the boat steamed up lake st peter  a long plume of smoke trailed across the cloudless sky the water glistened with silvery radiance and looking over the wide expanse he could see dark trees etched faintly on the blue horizon  ahead the lights of three rivers twinkled among square black blocks of houses and tall sawmill stacks  a few passengers were strolling about but the english newspaper had made him restless and to wish to be alone so descending to a quieter deck he was surprised to see the girl he had assisted sitting in a canvas chair near the rail  close by stood several large baskets from which there rose an angry snarling  what is this he asked with the careless abruptness which usually characterized him  with your permission  he raised a lid while the girl watched him with amusement  looks like a menagerie on a small scale he remarked  are these animals yours  no she answered they belong to mrs keith  mrs keith he said sharply  the lady i saw at the frontenac with the autocratic manners and a roman nose  its curious but she reminds me of somebody i knew and the names the same  i wonder  he broke off and millicent graham studied him as he stood in the moonlight  she did not think he recognized her and perhaps he was hardly justified in supposing that his timely aid at the gangway dispensed with the need for an introduction but she liked his looks which she remembered well  she had no fear of this mans presuming too far he had a humorous goodnatured air and his surprise when she mentioned mrs keith had roused her interest  yes she said i believe it was my employer you knew  he did not follow this lead but asked are you supposed to sit up all night and watch the animals for her  only for an hour or two  the steamboat people refused to have them in the saloon and the maid should have relieved me  she was tired however with packing and running errands all day and i thought id let her sleep a while  then it cant be much of an intrusion if i try to make you more comfortable  let me move your chair nearer the deckhouse where youll be out of the wind but ill first see if i can find another rug  he left her without waiting for a reply and returning with a rug placed her chair in a sheltered spot after which he leaned against the rails  so you are mrs keiths companion he remarked  it strikes me as rather unfeeling of her to keep you here in the cold  he indicated the baskets  but whats her object in buying these creatures  caprice said millicent smiling  some of them are savage and they cost a good deal  i cant imagine what she means to do with them and i dont think she knows  one of them however has been growling all day and as its apparently unwell it mustnt be neglected  if it growls any more ill feel tempted to turn yonder hose upon it or try some other drastic remedy  please dont cried millicent in alarm  but you mustnt think mrs keith is inconsiderate  i have much to thank her for but she gets very enthusiastic over her hobbies  do you know if she ever goes down to a little place in shropshire  she does i have been with her  once she took me to your old home then the colour crept into millicents face  you dont seem to remember me lieutenant blake  blake who had learned selfcontrol did not start though he came near doing so as he recalled a scene he had taken part in some years earlier  he had just risen from a diningtable where the talk had been of favourite dancers and the turf and the wine had circulated too freely and entered a small drawingroom with several men whom his host was assisting in a career of dissipation  as they came in a girl rose from the piano and on seeing her blake felt a sense of awkwardness and shame  she looked very fresh and pretty untainted he thought by her surroundings and the annoyance in her fathers face suggested that he had not expected to find her there  blake saw that she shrank from his noisy companions in alarm  one of them who had drunk too deep not noticing that she was startled and imagining that she was a fit subject for rough gallantry pursued her as she tried to escape but blake with a quick movement reached a switch and cut off the light  next moment he seized the offender and hustled him out of the room  he had saved an awkward situation and was afterwards thanked by the man he had roughly handled  it would have been inexcusable if i had forgotten you he answered with a smile  still i couldnt quite place you until a few moments ago when you faced the light  but you were wrong in one thing im no longer lieutenant blake  she appreciated the frankness which had prompted this warning and saw that she had made a tactless blunder but she looked at him steadily  i forgot she said forgive me  i heard ofwhat happened in indiabut i felt that there must have been some mistake  she hesitated for a moment  i think so now  blake made a sudden movement and then leaned back against the rails im afraid that an acquaintance which lasted three or four minutes could hardly enable you to judge first impressions are often wrong you know  anyhow i dont complain of the opinion of gentlemen who knew more about me  millicent saw that the subject must be dropped and resuming said at our first meeting i had no opportunity of thanking you and you gave me none tonight  its curious that while ive only met you twice on both occasions you turned up just when you were needed  is it a habit of yours  thats a flattering thing to hint  the man whos always on hand when hes wanted is an estimable person  its not quite what i meant she answered laughing  what struck me most was that you dont seem to like gratitude  one ought to like it  its supposed to be rare but on the whole i havent found that so  he studied her with an interest which she noticed but could not resent the girl had changed and gained something since their first meeting and he thought it was a knowledge of the world  she was he felt neither tainted nor hardened by what she had learned but her fresh childish look which suggested ignorance of evil had gone and could not come back  indeed he wondered how she had preserved it in her fathers house  this was not a matter he could touch upon but by and by she referred to it  i imagine she said shyly that on the evening when you came to my rescue in london you were surprised to find meso unprepared so incapable of dealing with the situation  that is true blake answered with some awkwardness  a bachelor dinner you know after a big race meeting at which we had backed several winners  one has to make allowances  millicent smiled rather bitterly  you may guess that i had to make them often in those days but it was on the evening we were speaking of that my eyes were first opened and i was startled  but you must understand that it was not by my fathers wish i came to london and stayed with himuntil the end  he urged me to go away but his health had broken down and he had no one else to care for him  when he was no longer able to get about everybody deserted him and he felt it  blake was stirred to compassion  graham had no doubt suffered nothing he had not deserved but the man had once been a social favourite and it was painful to think of his dying alone in poverty his extravagance and the shifts by which he evaded his creditors were known and blake could imagine how hard he would be pressed when he lay sick and helpless  it must have been a harrowing experience for a young girl to nurse him and at the same time to grapple with financial difficulties  i was truly sorry to hear of his death he said  your father was once a very good friend to me  but if i may ask how was it he let you come to his flat  i forced myself upon him millicent answered with a grateful glance my mother died long ago and her unmarried sisters took care of me they lived very simply in a small secluded country house two oldfashioned evangelicals gentle but austere studying small economies giving all they could away  in winter we embroidered for missionary bazaars in summer we spent the days in a quiet walled garden  it was all very peaceful but i grew restless and when i heard that my fathers health was failing i felt i must go to him  my aunts were grieved and alarmed but they said they dare not hinder me if i thought it my duty  stirred by troubled memories and perhaps encouraged by the sympathy he showed she had spoken on impulse without reserve and blake listened with pity  the girl brought up subject to wholesome puritanical influences in such surroundings as she had described must have suffered a cruel shock when suddenly plunged into the society of the rakes and gamblers who frequented her fathers flat  could you not have gone back when you were no longer needed he asked  no she said it would not have been fair  i had changed since i left my aunts  they were very sensitive and i think the difference they must have noticed in me would have jarred on them  i should have brought something alien into their unworldly life  it was too late to return i had to follow the path i had chosen  blake mused a while watching the lights of three rivers fade astern and the broad white wake of the paddles stream back across the glassy surface of the lake  the girl must have learned much of human failings since she left her sheltered home but he thought the sweetness of character which could not be spoiled by knowledge of evil was greatly to be admired  he was however a man of action and not a philosopher  well he said i appreciate your letting me talk to you but its cold and getting late and you have sat on deck long enough  ill see that somebody looks after the animals  millicent felt dubious though she was sleepy and tired  if anything happened to her pets mrs keith would not forgive me  ill engage that something will happen to some of them very soon unless you promise to go to your room blake said laughing  then he called a deckhand  what have you to do  stand here until the watch is changed  then you can keep an eye on these baskets  if any of the beasts inside them makes an alarming noise send to my room the second forward port side  look me up before we get to montreal  thats all right said the man and blake held out his hand to millicent as she rose  now he said you can go to rest with a clear conscience  she left him with a word of thanks wondering whether she had been indiscreet and why she had told him so much  she knew nothing to his advantage except one chivalrous action and she had not desired to arouse his pity but he had an honest face and had shown an understanding sympathy which touched her because she had seldom experienced it  he had left the army with a stain upon his name but she shrank from judging harshly and felt that he had not merited his disgrace  then she forgot him and went to sleep  blake stayed on deck some time thinking about her but presently decided that this was an unprofitable occupation  he was a marked man with a lonely road to travel and though he found some amusement by the way it led him apart from the society of women of the kind he most cared for     chapter iii  the cousins  dinner was over at the windsor in montreal and mrs keith who found the big hotel rather noisy and uncomfortably warm was sitting with mrs ashborne in the square between it and st catharines street  a cool air blew uphill from the river and the patch of grass with its fringe of small dusty trees had a certain picturesqueness in the twilight  above it the wooded crest of the mountain rose darkly against the evening sky lights glittered behind the network of thin branches and fluttering leaves along the sidewalk and the dome of the cathedral bulked huge and shadowy across the square  down hill towards st jamess rose towering buildings with the roughhewn front of the canadian pacific depot prominent among them and the air was filled with the clanging of street cars and the tolling of locomotive bells  once or twice however when the throb of the traffic momentarily subsided music rose faint and sweet from the cathedral and mrs keith who heard the uplifted voices and knew what they sang turned to listen  she had heard them before through her open window in the early morning when the city was silent and its busy toilers slept and now it seemed to her appropriate that the voices could not be wholly drowned by its hoarse commercial clamour  the square served as a cool retreat for the inhabitants of crowded tenements and those who had nowhere else to go but margaret keith was not fastidious about her company  she was interested in the unkempt emigrants who waiting for a westbound train lay upon the grass surrounded by their tired children and she had sent millicent down the street to buy fruit to distribute among the travellers she liked to watch the french canadian girls who slipped quietly up the broad cathedral steps  they were the daughters of the rank and file but their movements were graceful and they were tastefully dressed  then the blueshirted sinewy men who strolled past smoking roused her curiosity  they had not acquired their free springy stride in the cities these were adventurers who had met with strange experiences in the frozen north and the lonely west  some of them had hard faces and a predatory air but that added to their interest  margaret keith liked to watch them all and speculate about their mode of life that pleasure could still be enjoyed though as she sometimes told herself with humorous resignation she could no longer take a very active part in things  by and by however something that appealed to her in a more direct and personal way occurred for a man came down the steps of the windsor and crossed the welllighted street with a very pretty english girl he carried himself well and had the look of a soldier his figure was finely proportioned but his handsome face suggested sensibility rather than decision of character and his eyes were dreamy  his companion so far as mrs keith could judge by her smiling glance as she laid her hand upon his arm when they left the sidewalk was proud of and much in love with him  whom are you looking at so hard mrs ashborne inquired  bertram challoner and his bride said mrs keith  theyre coming towards us yonder  then a curious thing happened for a man who was crossing the street seemed to see the challoners and turning suddenly stepped back behind a passing cab  they had their backs to him when he went on but he looked round as if to make sure he had not been observed before he entered the hotel  that was strange said mrs ashborne  it looked as if the fellow didnt want to meet our friends  who can he be  how can i tell mrs keith rejoined  i think ive seen him somewhere but thats all i know  looking round as millicent joined them she noticed her puzzled expression  the girl had obviously seen the strangers action but mrs keith did not wish to pursue the subject then  next moment challoner came up and greeted her heartily while his wife spoke to mrs ashborne  we only arrived this afternoon and must have missed you at dinner he said  we may go west tomorrow though we havent decided yet  ive no doubt we shall see you again tonight or at breakfast  after a few pleasant words the challoners passed on and mrs keith looked after them thoughtfully  bertram has changed in the last few years she said  i heard he had malaria in india which perhaps accounts for it but he shows signs of his mothers delicacy  she was not strong and i always thought he had her highlystrung nervous temperament though he must have learned to control it in the army  he couldnt have got in unless the doctors were satisfied with him said mrs ashborne  thats true but both mental and physical traits have a way of lying dormant while were young and of developing later  bertram has shown himself a capable officer but to my mind he looked more like a soldier when he was at sandhurst than he does now  a few minutes later mrs chudleigh came out of the hotel with sedgwick and stopped to speak to mrs keith  i came up by the last train and heard that you were here  captain sedgwick travelled with me but hes going on to toronto tomorrow  i suppose you have seen the challoners  such a number of english people in the town  but isnt this a curious place to spend the evening  its cool said mrs keith  i like fresh air  mrs chudleigh glanced towards millicent who was distributing a basket of peaches among a group of untidy emigrant children  thats a charming picture isnt it  miss graham fits the part very well but i suppose youre responsible  there was a sneer in her tone and sedgwick broke in miss grahams a very nice girl you can see that shes sorry for the dirty little beggars  they dont look as if theyd had a happy time and a liners crowded steerage isnt a luxurious place  since you feel so pitiful it would be more to the purpose if you gave them something mrs chudleigh rejoined  a good idea said sedgwick coolly  ill carry it out  he crossed the grass and scattered a few small coins among the children who clustered round him after which he stood talking to millicent while mrs chudleigh watched him with an impatience she did not try to hide  its a new role for sedgwick she remarked  when he has finished we are going into the cathedral to hear the music  im fond of churches and we spent the afternoon in notre dame  mrs ashborne said it was worth seeing and conversation languished for the next three or four minutes after which mrs chudleigh moved forward imperiously and took sedgwick away  mrs keith turned to her companion with an amused expression  i daresay you noticed that he didnt mind keeping her waiting  i thought he meant to flout her when he acted on her suggestion and i half expected something of a scene said mrs ashborne  the woman has a temper  mrs keith smiled  the man is a fortune hunter but hes taking the right way  shes used to admiration and her other suitors have no doubt deferred to her  its a change to be defied instead of courted and though it makes her angry i imagine it strengthens his hold  if he shows his is the firmer hand shell give in  youre taking it for granted that shes in love with him  it looks like it mrs keith replied  he has his attractions and has done one or two dashing things of the kind that catches the public eye  however i have some english letters to write and i think well go in  next evening about an hour before sunset challoner and his wife leaned upon the rails of a wooden gallery built out from the rock on the summit of the green mountain that rises close behind montreal  it is a viewpoint that visitors frequent and they gazed with appreciation at the wide landscape  wooded slopes led steeply down to the stately colleges of mcgill and the rows of picturesque houses along sherbrook avenue lower yet the city shining in the clear evening light spread across the plain dominated by its cathedral dome and the towers of notre dame  green squares with trees in them checkered the blocks of buildings along its skirts where a haze of smoke hung about the wharves the great river gleamed in a broad silver band  on the farther bank the plain ran on again fading from green to grey and purple until it melted into the distance and the hills on the vermont frontier cut faintly blue against the sky  how beautiful this world is challoner exclaimed  i have seen grander sights and there are more picturesque cities than montrealim looking forward to showing you the work of the moguls in indiabut happiness such as ive had of late casts a glamour over everything  it wasnt always so with me ive had my bad hours when i was blind to beauty  though blanche challoner was very young and much in love she ventured a smiling rebuke  you shouldnt wish to remember them im afraid bertram theres a melancholy strain in you and i dont mean to let you indulge in it besides how could you have had bad hours  you have been made much of and given everything you could wish for since you were a boy  indeed i sometimes wonder how you escaped from being spoiled  when i joined it i hated the army that sounds like high treason doesnt it  however i got used to things and made art my hobby instead of my vocation  you wont mind if i confess that a view of this kind makes me long to paint  oh no i intend to encourage you  you mustnt waste your talent when we stay among the rockies we will spend the days in the most beautiful places we can find and i shall take my pleasure in watching you at work  but didnt your fondness for sketching amuse the mess  i used to be chaffed about it and repaid my tormentors by caricaturing them  on the whole they were very goodnatured  i expect they admired the drawings they ought to have done  you have talent  indeed i never quite understood why you became a soldier  i think it was from a want of moral courage you have seen that determination is not among my virtues challoner replied  its as much to the purpose that you dont know my father very well  though hes fond of pictures he looks upon artists and poets as a rather effeminate and irresponsible set and i must own that he has met one or two unfavourable specimens  then he couldnt imagine the possibility of a son of his not being anxious to follow the family profession and knowing how my defection would grieve him i let him have his way there has always been a challoner fighting or ruling in india since john companys time  they must have been fine men by their portraits  theres one of a major henry challoner i fell in love with  he was with outram wasnt he  you have his look though theres a puzzling difference  i think these men were bluffer and blunter than you are  youre gentler and more sensitive in a way finer drawn  my sensitiveness has not been a blessing said challoner soberly  but it makes you lovable blanche declared  there must have been a certain ruthlessness about those old challoners which you couldnt show  after all their pictures suggest that their courage was of the unimaginative physical kind  a shadow crept into challoners face but he banished it  i am happy in having a wife who wont see my faults  then he added humorously after all however thats not good for one  blanche gave him a tender smile but he did not see it for he was gazing at a man who came down the steps from the neighbouring cable railway  the newcomer was about thirty years of age of average height and strongly made  his face was deeply sunburned and he had eyes of a curious darkblue with a twinkle in them and dark lashes though his hair was fair  as he drew nearer blanche was struck by something that suggested the family likeness of the challoners  he had their firm mouth and wide forehead but by no means their somewhat austere expression  he looked as if he went careless through life and could be readily amused  then he saw bertram and starting made as if he would pass the entrance to the gallery and blanche turned her surprised glance upon her husband  bertrams hand was tightly closed on the glasses he held and his face was tense and flushed but he stepped forward with a cry of dick  the newcomer moved towards him and blanche knew he was the man who had brought dishonour upon her husbands family  this is a fortunate meeting bertram said and his voice was cordial though rather strained  then he turned to his wife  blanche heres my cousin dick blake  blake showed no awkwardness  indeed on the whole he looked amused but his face grew graver as he fixed his eyes on mrs challoner  though im rather late youll let me wish you happiness he said i believe it will be yours  bertrams a very good fellow i have much to thank him for  there was a sincerity and a hint of affection in his tone which touched blanche  she had been prepared to suspend her judgment and be charitable but she found that she pitied the man  he had failed in his duty in time of stress but he had suffered for it and it must be hard to be an outcast  blake saw her compassion and was moved by it  but how did you come here bertram asked  where have you been since  he stopped abruptly and blake laughed  since you surreptitiously said goodbye to me at peshawur  well after that i went to penang and from there to queensland  stayed a time at a pearlfishing station among the kanakas and then came to england for a few months  but how did you manage bertram inquired with some diffidence  it raises a point you wouldnt let me talk about at peshawur but ive often felt guilty because i didnt insist  travelling about as you have done is expensive  not to me blake rejoined with a twinkle  ive turned adventurer and i have the blake gift of getting along without money  he added in an explanatory aside to blanche for two or three generations we kept open house and a full stable in ireland on a revenue derived from rents which were rarely paid and if i hadnt been too young when a disaster gave the creditors their chance id have given them a sporting run  but what did you do when you left england bertram broke in  went to east africa after that to this country where i tried my hand at prairie farming  found it decidedly monotonous and sold the homestead at a profit  then i did some prospecting and now im here on business  on business bertram exclaimed  you could never be trusted to get proper value for a shilling  ive learned to do so lately and thats not going far  if youre in commerce in this country you must know how to put down fifty cents and take up a dollars worth  anyhow im here to meet an american whose acquaintance i made farther west  hes a traveller in paints and varnishes and a very enterprising person as well as an unusually good sort  but ive told you enough about myself i want your news  blanche who had been watching him thought it cost her husband an effort to fall in with his cousins casual mood  blake however seemed quite at ease and she was growing interested in him  he reminded her of the challoner portraits in the dark oak gallery at sandymere but she thought him lighter more brilliant and in a sense more human than those stern soldiers  then she remembered his irish father which explained something  they talked a while about english friends and relatives and then blake said rather abruptly  and the colonel  well said bertram  i heard that you saw him dick  i did for half an hour  i felt it was my duty though the interview was hard on both  he was fair as he always was and tried to hide his feelings  i couldnt blame him because he failed  bertram looked away and blakes face was troubled  there was a hint of emotion in his voice as he went on turning to blanche  whatever he may think of me colonel challoner is a man i have a sincere respect for and i owe him more than i can ever repay  he brought me up after my fathers death and started me like a son in an honourable career  then his tone grew lighter  its one of my few virtues that i dont forget my debts  he made as if he would leave them  and now ive kept you some time my american friend hasnt turned up yet and i may be here a few days where are you staying  ill look you up before i leave  we go west tomorrow morning  come down and have dinner with us at the windsor bertram said and when mrs challoner seconded the request they went up the steps to the platform from which the cable train started     chapter iv  challoner resumes his journey  blake who had known hardship enjoyed an excellent dinner and the society of his cousins wife whose good opinion he rapidly gained  he would not have blamed her had she treated him with cold politeness but instead of this she was gentle and quietly cordial  she had seen his affection for her husband and made him feel that he had her sympathy without being openly pitiful  he was quick to appreciate her tact and it had its effect on him  after dinner mrs keith took blanche away and the men found a quiet corner in the rotunda where they sat talking for a time  at length blake glanced at his watch  i have an appointment to keep and must go in a few minutes  make my excuses to your wife i shall not see her again  it would be better because theres no reason why she should be reminded of anything unpleasant now  shes a good woman bertram and im glad she didnt shrink from me  it would have been a natural thing but i believe she was sorry and anxious to make all the allowances she could  challoner was silent for a few moments his face showing signs of strain  i dont deserve her dick the thought of it troubles me  she doesnt know me for what i really am  rot blake exclaimed  its your misfortune that youre a sentimentalist with a habit of exaggerating things but if you dont indulge in your weakness too much youll go a long way  you showed the true challoner pluck when you smoked out that robbers nest in the hills and the pacification of the frontier valley was a very smart piece of work  when i read about the business i never thought you would pull it off with the force you had  it must have impressed the authorities and youll get something better than your majors commission before long  i understand that youre already looked upon as a coming man  it was a generous speech but it was justified for challoner had shown administrative as well as military skill in the affairs his cousin mentioned  he however still looked troubled and his colour was higher than usual  dick he said i wish you would let me give you a lift in the only way i can  you know you had never any idea of economy and im afraid you must find it hard to get along  no said blake curtly its impossible  your father made me a similar offer and i couldnt consent  i suppose i have the blakes carelessness about money but what i get from my mothers little property keeps me on my feet  he laughed as he went on its lucky that your people knowing the family failing arranged matters so that the principal could not be touched  besides ive a plan for adding to my means  bertram dropped the subject  dick was often rather casual and inconsequent but there was a stubborn vein in him  when he took the trouble to think a matter out he was apt to prove immovable  anyway you will let me know how you get on  i think not  what good would it do  the challoners gave me a fair start and i disappointed them  while im grateful its better that they should have nothing more to do with me  think of your career keep your wife proud of youshe has good reason for being so and let me go my way and drop out of sight again  im a common adventurer and have been mixed up in matters that fastidious people would shrink from which may happen again  still i manage to get a good deal of pleasure out of the life which suits me in many ways  he rose holding out his hand  goodbye bertram  we may run across each other somewhere again  ill always be glad to do so challoner said with feeling  be sure i wont forget you dick  blake turned away but when he left the hotel his face was sternly set it had cost him something to check his cousins friendly advances and break the last connexion between himself and the life he once had led but he knew it must be broken and felt no pang of envious bitterness for many years bertram had been a good and generous friend and blake sincerely wished him well  the challoners left by the pacific express next morning and during the evening captain sedgwick stood talking to millicent who had stopped a few moments in passing near a pillar in the entrance hall of the hotel  it was characteristic of him that he wore evening dress though a number of the other guests did not but it displayed his fine symmetrical figure  he was a handsome soldierly man with a boldness of manner which sometimes passed for dash and sometimes prejudiced fastidious people against him  now he was watching millicent whom he admired with a smile  i didnt know you and mrs keith were leaving the frontenac until you had gone he said and his tone suggested that he wished to explain why he had not accompanied them  you didnt give me an opportunity of speaking to you until just now but i noticed that you looked disturbed at dinner  i daresay i did millicent answered ruefully  i should be distressed to think there was any serious cause for it  millicent laughed  mrs keith believes its serious enough and im in disgrace  one of the animals bit the bobcat and now the creatures missing  a catastrophe  but does the absurd old woman hold you responsible for her ferocious pets  i was told to see that her maid took the unfortunate animal to a veterinary surgeon  judkins was frankly mutinous the hotel porters were busy with some baggage and there was not a cab on the rank  i told her to put the basket down while she looked for a hack near the station and then crossed the street as i saw one coming  when i got back the basket had gone but a boy gave me a note on a scrap of torn paper  it said dont worry the beast is in safe hands  youll get it back tonight  most mysterious sedgwick remarked  but its unpleasant to think you should have to suffer from the foibles of the creatures owner  millicent felt that he was too intimate for their brief acquaintance and that in keeping her behind the pillar where the semiprivacy of their position suggested confidential relations he was hardly showing good taste  indeed she realized that there was often something lacking in his manners though he had a certain charm and was much sought after at the hotel  i must go she said  mrs keith wants me  sedgwick moved aside with a bow which millicent thought need not have been made and afterwards crossed the floor to the lounge where mrs chudleigh was waiting  she was a rather striking highcoloured woman with eyes that had a hard sparkle and when her face was in repose unusually firm lips  she wore the latest and most pronounced type of dinner dress with a few jewels of value but they gave her no air of ostentation  i thought you were never coming she said impatiently  why did you stay talking to that girl so long  miss graham  shes amusing and hasnt many acquaintances in the hotel  im inclined to think her employer keeps a tight hand on her  shes pretty in an unformed way which is more to the purpose mrs chudleigh rejoined  i heard the old woman abusing the manager because one of her ridiculous pets is missing  but this is of no consequence you were going to tell me about your african plans  there are good reasons why i should do so  i havent forgotten that my advancement is largely due to you  mrs chudleigh laughed  if you hint as much in public it may come to a sudden end  you ought to know that promotion is now made on merit  im modest  my merits an uncertain quantity but theres no doubt about your influence  id sooner trust to it  the remark was justified  he had shown courage and ability in controlling rebellious tribes and settling disputes with french officials on the frontier of the african colony but mrs chudleigh had worked well for him  she had many friends men of importance in political and military circles were to be met in her london drawingroom but she was clever and those she obtained favours from did not always realize how far they had yielded to her powers of persuasion  never mind that she said  give me an opportunity and ill exert my powers im fond of using them  moving other peoples hands and making up their minds for them is a fascinating game but i must have something to act upon  i understand were both ambitious  well im in charge of a strip of frontier territory but so far ive had the veto of a cautious and vacillating superior to contend with  the climate however is breaking down his health and he cant keep his post much longer i want full control  now to the north of my malariahaunted district theres a belt of dry and valuable country inhabited by industrious mohammedans  the french have their eye upon it but our people know its worth  though our respective spheres of influence are badly defined neither side has found an excuse for occupying the coveted region  ah said mrs chudleigh  you intend to make an excuse  if i can but it will have to be a good one  that is we must give the french no reasonable grounds for objecting but when we enter the country in question we stay there  its risky  if you get into difficulties or the french are clever enough to spoil your game youll be disgraced  thats a hazard i recognize  if i fail our authorities will disown me but it cant be allowed to count  mrs chudleigh admired his daring which was what had first attracted her  his shortcomings were not hidden he now and then offended her more cultivated taste but he could boldly seize an opportunity and she thought he would go a long way  there was force in him  but the excuse she asked  i cant tell you exactly what it will be but theres an unruly tribe between us and the territory we want and theyre inclined to give trouble  he paused with a meaning smile  it may be necessary to subjugate them and if we enter their country well no doubt find ourselves compelled to move farther north  something however must be left to chance  when one is ready to act an occasion often presents itself  and the benefit to england  cant be doubted  well have pushed the frontier back and opened up trade  its a region thats rich in useful products and as soon as it is ours new factories will spring up wherever theres a suitable spot along the rivers  ive already thought out a route for a light railway  mrs chudleigh was satisfied  she believed in colonial expansion but her views were honest in a sense  where her country stood to gain the rights of small native races did not count and she argued with some reason that they were better off under civilized rule but she would have intrigued for no scheme that did not further british interests  i daresay she answered thoughtfully something can be done  im content with that and perhaps we have said enough  those rubies of yours are very fine but they owe a good deal to their background how they gleam on the satiny whiteness they rest upon  this was a transgression but it was one that she could pardon  the mans taste was defective but he had charm and she let him lead her into intimate personal talk  in the meanwhile a group of men were engaged in conversation at the opposite end of the hall  one was a sawmill owner another served the hudsons bay company in the northern wilds the third was a young keeneyed american quick in his movements and concise in speech  youre in lumber arent you he said taking a strip of wood from his pocket and handing it to the mill owner  what would you call this  cedar sawn from a good log  thats so red cedar  you know something about that material  i ought to considering how much of it ive cut  the lumber man held up his right hand from which the two middle fingers were missing lost those twenty years ago when i worked in my first onehorse mill and i could show you a number of other scars  very well the american took out another strip  the same stuff sir  how would you say it had been treated  the sawmiller carefully examined the piece of wood  its not french polish but i havent seen varnish as good as this  except that its clear and shows the grain its more like some rare old japanese lacquer  it is varnish  try to scrape it with your knife  the other failed to make a mark on it and the american looked at him with a smile  what would you think of it as a business proposition  if not too dear it ought to drive every other highgrade varnish off the market  do you make the stuff  were not ready to sell it yet cant get hold of the raw material in quantities and were not satisfied about the best flux  ill give you my card  he did so and it bore the address of a paint and varnish factory in connecticut with the words represented by cyrus p harding at the bottom  well said the lumber man you seem to have got hold of a good thing mr harding but if youre not open to sell it what has brought you over here  im looking round we deal in all kinds of paints and miss no chance of a trade  then im going way up northwest  is there anything doing in my line there  not much said the hudsons bay man  you may sell a few kegs along the railroad track but as soon as you leave it youll find no paint required  the settlers use logs or shiplap and leave them in the raw the trip wont pay you  anyhow ill see the country and find out something about the coniferous gums  theyre soft and resinous  dont you get the material you make good varnish of from the tropics  harding laughed  you people dont know your own resources  theres most everything a white man needs right on this american continent if hell take the trouble to look for it  lumber changes some of its properties with the location in which it grows i guess  we have pines in florida but when you get right up to their northern limit youll find a difference  theres something in that the sawmiller agreed  if youre going up to their northern limit youll see some of the roughest and wildest country on this earth remarked the hudsons bay agent  its almost impossible to get through in summer unless you stick to the rivers and to cross it in winter with the dogsledges is pretty tough work  so ive heard said harding  now im going to take a smoke  will you come along  they declined and when he left them one smiled at the other  theyre smart people across the frontier but to send a man into the northern timberbelt looking for paint trade openings or resin they can make varnish of is about the limit to commercial enterprise     chapter v  mrs keith gets a surprise  harding was taking out a cigar in the vestibule when a man brushed past him wearing big mittens and a loose black cloak such as oldfashioned frenchcanadians sometimes use  why blake he cried  what have you got on  have you been serenading somebody  i cant stop the other answered with a grin  open that door for me quick  a porter held back the door but as blake slipped through harding seized his cloak  hold on i want a talk with you  ive been waiting all day  blake made an effort to break loose and as he did so the bobcat dropped from beneath his arm and fell spitting and snarling to the ground  its fur was torn and matted tufts were hanging loose and the creature had a singularly disreputable and ferocious appearance  blake made an attempt to recapture it but evading him easily it ran along the floor with a curious hopping gait and disappeared among the pillars  then he turned to his friend with a rueful laugh  you see what youve done  its gone into the rotunda where everybody is  harding looked at him critically  you seem sober  what made you get yourself up like an italian opera villain and go round the town with a wild beast under your arm  ill tell you later  what we have to do now is to catch the thing  its time said harding drily  the circus is beginning  mens laughter and womens shrieks rose from the entrance hall which in a canadian hotel serves as general meeting place and lounge somebody shouted orders in french there was a patter of running feet and then a crash as of chairs being overturned  blake sprang in and harding who followed divided between amusement and impatience looked on at an animated scene  two porters were chasing the bobcat which now and then turned upon them savagely while several waiters who kept at a judicious distance tried to frighten it into a corner by flourishing their napkins  women fled out of the creatures way men hastily moved chairs and tables to give the pursuers room and some of the more energetic joined in the chase  at one end of the room mrs keith stood angrily giving instructions which nobody attended to millicent who was close by looked hot and unhappy but for all that her eyes twinkled when a waiter colliding with a chair went down with a crash and the bobcat sped away from him in a series of awkward jumps  at length blake managed to seize it with his mittened hands and after rolling it in a cloth and giving it to a porter advanced towards mrs keith his face red with exertion but contrite and the cloak which had come unhooked hanging down from one shoulder  she glanced at him in a puzzled halfdisturbed manner when he stopped  the cat is safe he said  the man i gave it to will put it with the other animals  if he holds it firmly i dont think it can bite him  as im told you dropped it in the vestibule i feel im entitled to an explanation mrs keith replied in a formal tone looking hard at him i gave the cat to my maid this morning sending miss graham to see it delivered to a man in the town and it disappeared  how did it come into your possession  through no fault of miss grahams  i happened to notice your maid trying to carry an awkwardly shaped hamper and miss graham looking for a cab  it struck me the thing was more of a mans errand and i undertook it  its curious that you knew what the errand was unless miss graham told you  mrs keith looked sternly at millicent who blushed  i have been led to believe that you made her acquaintance without my knowledge on board the steamer by which we came up  that said blake respectfully is not quite correct  i was formally presented to miss graham in england some time ago  however as i saw a car coming along st catharines while your maid was looking for a hack and there was no time to explain i scribbled a note on a bit of a letter and gave it to a boy and then took the cat to a taxidermist  to a taxidermist  why  it struck me that he ought to know something about the matter anyhow he was the nearest approach to a vet that i could find  mrs keith looked at him thoughtfully  you seem to have a curious way of reasoning  but what did the man say  his first remark was nom dune pipe and he added something more which i couldnt catch but when we became friends he promised to engage the services of a dogfancier friend of his  you imagined that a dogfancier would specialize in cats  millicents eyes twinkled but mrs keiths face was serious and blakes perfectly grave  i dont know that i argued the matter out  to tell the truth i undertook the thing on impulse  so it seems  you considered it necessary to make friends with the frenchcanadian taxidermist  not necessary perhaps  blake appeared to reflect  still its a way of mine and the fellow interested me by the tragic manner in which he broke his pipe when i first showed him the cat  his indignation was superb  mrs keith gave him a look of rather grim amusement  i see but you havent told me what became of my hamper  the hamper was unfortunately smashed  the car was not allowed to stop where i wished to get off and i had to jump  i miscalculated the speed and fell down after which as there was a good deal of traffic a transfer wagon ran over the hamper luckily without hurting the animal inside  i left it at a basket shop and that explains the cloak  my friend the taxidermist insisted on lending it and his winter gloves to me  one looks rather conspicuous walking through the streets with a bobcat on ones arm  then to blakes astonishment mrs keith broke into a soft laugh  i understand it all she said  it was a prank one would expect you to play  though its a very long time since i saw you you havent changed dick  now take that ridiculous cloak off and come back and talk to me  when blake returned millicent had gone and mrs keith noticed the glance he cast about the room  i sent miss graham away she said  you have been here some days why didnt you tell me who you were  ill confess that i knew you  you have changed much less than i have but i wasnt sure you would be willing to acknowledge me  then you were very wrong  one may be forgiven a first offence and i never quite agreed with the popular opinion about what you were supposed to have done  it wasnt like you there must have been something that did not come out  thank you blake said quietly  she gave him a searching glance  cant you say something for yourself  i think not he answered  the least said the soonest mended  but for the sake of others  so far as i know only one person was much troubled about my disgrace im thankful my father died before it came  your uncle felt it very keenly  he was furious when the first news arrived and refused to believe you were to blame  then when major allardyce wrote he scarcely spoke for the rest of the day and it was a long time before he recovered from the blow i was staying at sandymere  he loved you dick and i imagined he expected you to do even better than his son  blake mused for a few moments and mrs keith could not read his thoughts  then he said bertram is a very good fellow and has brains why should his people think less of him because he likes to paint  but ive been sorry for the colonel more sorry than ive felt for myself  there was a softness that appealed to mrs keith in his darkblue eyes she had been fond of dick blake in his younger days and firmly believed in him  now she could not credit his being guilty of cowardice  well she said you have i trust a long life before you and if you have been at fault you must make amends  there are people who would be glad to see you reinstated  he made a sign of grave dissent  that cant happen in the way you mean  i closed the door of the old life against my return with my own hands and you dont gain distinction as the challoners think of it in business  what business have you gone into  blakes eyes gleamed humorously  at present im in the paint line  paint mrs keith exclaimed  yes but not common paint  we use the highest grade of lead and the purest linseed oil  varnish also of unapproachable quality guaranteed to stand exposure to any climate  theres nothing to equal our products in north america  do you seriously mean that you are going about selling these things  well said blake drily im trying to do so and i booked an order for two kegs yesterday but it isnt to be paid for until arrival when i shall not be here  cant i induce you to give us a trial  your house must need painting now and then and well ship you the stuff to liverpool in airtight drums  once you have tried it youll use nothing else  mrs keith laughed  dick youre a marvel and im glad adversity hasnt soured you but you wont make enough to keep you in neckties at any business you take up  its ludicrous to think of your running about with paint samples but theres something pathetic in it that spoils my amusement  her face softened and she changed her tone im a rather rich old woman dick and your mother was a very dear friend of mine  you must let me help you to something better  thank you he answered with a flush  but you cant give me money its curious that several of my friends have wanted to do sofirst the colonel then bertram and now you  not flattering is it  suggests that you doubt my talents or that i look like a deserving object of charity  youre incorrigible  it was the blakes misfortune that they could never be serious but i admire your pluck  we have our failings but im boring you and ill come back by and by if youll allow me  my american partner has been waiting for a word with me since this morning  and you kept him waiting  that was a true blake  but go to the man and then tell the hotel people to give you places at my table  i want to see your friend  hell feel as honoured as i do blake said and left her  harding was leaning back in his chair in the smokingroom with a frown on his face when blake joined him  he had a nervous alert look and was dressed with fastidious neatness  you have come along at last he remarked in an ironical tone  feel like getting down to business or shall we put it off again  sorry i couldnt come earlier blake replied  somehow or other i couldnt get away  things kept turning up to occupy me  its a way they seem to have  your trouble is that youre too diffuse you spread yourself out too much  you want to fix your mind on one thing and that will have to be business as soon as we leave here  i dare say youre right  my interests apt to wander but if you take advantage of every opportunity that offers you get most out of life concentrations good but if you concentrate on a thing and then dont get it you begin to think what a lot of other things youve missed  harding made a gesture of resignation  guess you must be humoured ill wait until youre through  thats a nice girl you stole the bobcat from but if she were a sister of mine id choke off that army man whos been trotting round after her most of the day  whats the matter with captain sedgwick  he has a greedy eye  hell play any game he goes into for his own hand  not an unusual plan but theres generally a code of rules and if its going to pay him sedgwick will break them  anyhow as it looks as if mrs chudleigh had him earmarked why cant he let the girl alone  blake who had taken a protective interest in millicent was somewhat disturbed but would not admit it  oh he said our army men arent ascetics but i dare say the fellows a harmless philanderer and youre a bit of a puritan  im married and dont forget it snapped harding  mariannathats mrs hardingis living in a tworoom tenement making her own dresses and cooking on a gasoline stove sos to give me my chance of finding the gum  and im here in an expensive hotel where ive made about five dollars commission in three days and written our people several folios about the iniquities of the canadian tariff which is all ive done  we have got to pull out as soon as possible  did you get any information from the hudsons bay man  i learned something about our route through the timberbelt and the kind of camp outfit well want the temperatures often fifty below in winter  then i was in revillons looking at their cheaper furs and in a store where they supply especially light handsledges snowshoes and patent cooking cans  we must have these things good and i estimate theyll cost six hundred dollars  six hundred dollars will make a big hole in our capital  im afraid so but we cant run the risk of freezing to death and we may have to spend all winter in the wilds  thats true i dont go back until i find the gum  hardings tone was resolute and when he leaned forward musing with knitted brows blake knowing his story gave him a sympathetic glance he had entered the paint factory when a very young man and had studied chemistry in his scanty spare time with the object of understanding his business better  he found the composition of varnishes an interesting subject and as the best gums employed came from the tropics and were expensive he began to experiment with the exudations from american trees  his employers hinted that he was wasting his time since the limits to the use of these products were already known but harding continued trying to test a theory that the texture and hardness of the gums might depend upon climatic temperature  by chance a resinous substance which had come from the far north fell into his hands and he found that when combined with an african gum it gave astonishing results  before this happened however his employers had sent him out on the road and as they were sceptical about his discovery and he would not take them fully into his confidence they merely promised to keep his place open for a time  now he was going to search for the gum at his own expense  well order the outfit in the morning he said presently glancing towards a man who sat across the room  do you think that fellow clarke can hear  ive a notion that hes been watching us  does it matter  you must bear in mind that we have a valuable secret and i understand he lives somewhere in the country we are going through  as he spoke the hudsons bay agent came in with the sawmiller who said to the man whom harding suspected of listening that was good stuff you gave me a dose of  it fixed my ague though i had the shakes bad last night  clarke rose and strolled with them to a seat nearer where blake and harding sat  its a powerful drug and must be used with discretion if you feel you need it ill give you another dose  its an indian remedy and i learned the secret up in the timberbelt but i spent some time experimenting before i was satisfied about its properties  sedgwick who was passing stopped and lighted a cigar  then you get on with indians  i do clarke said shortly  it isnt difficult when you grasp their point of view  then your experience doesnt tally with mine and i know something about the primitive races  their point of view is generally elusive  i can credit it  clarkes tone was sneering  you people dont try to understand them you cant come down to it  standing firm on your colour prejudice and official traditions you expect the others to agree with you  its an indefensible policy  he turned to the hudsons bay agent  you ought to know something about the matter  on the whole the hudsons bay treat the indians well there was a starving lad you picked up suffering from snowblindness near jackpine river and sent back safely to his tribe  thats so but i cant tell how you knew  i dont remember having talked about the thing and my clerk has never left the factory  there wasnt another white man within a weeks journey  i heard all the same  you had afterwards some better furs than usual brought in  the agent looked surprised  some of these people are grateful but although ive been in the country twelve years i dont pretend to understand them  they understand you  the proof of it is that you can keep your factory open in a district where furs are rather scarce and have had very few mishaps  you can take that as a compliment  there was something significant in clarkes tone which blake remarked while sedgwick feeling that he was being left out strolled on  then you know the jackpine the agent asked  pretty well though its not easy to reach  i came down it one winter from the wildgoose hills  id put in the winter with a band of stonies  the northern stonies  did you find them easy to get on with  they knew some interesting things clarke answered drily  i went there to study  ah said the agent  what plain folk for want of a better name call the occult  but its fortunate theres a barred door between white men and the indians mysticism  it has been opened to a white man once or twice  just so  he stepped through into the darkness and never came out again  there was an instance i could mention  civilized folk would have no use for him afterwards harding broke in  we want sane normal men on this continent  neurotics hoodoos and fakirs are worse than a plague theres contagion in their fooling  how would you define them  those who dont fit in with your ideas of the normal  i know a clean straight man when i meet him and thats enough for me  i imagine that cleverer people are now and then deceived said clarke who moved away  thats a man i want to keep clear of harding remarked to blake theres something wrong about him hes not wholesome  he rose its a fine night lets walk up the mountain     chapter vi  harding grows confidential  next morning blake and his partner breakfasted at mrs keiths table and during the afternoon drove up the mountain with her and one or two others  the city was unpleasantly hot and the breeze that swept its streets blew clouds of sand and cement about for montreal is subject to fits of feverish constructional activity and on every other block buildings were being torn down and replaced by larger ones of concrete and steel  leaving its outskirts the carriage climbed the road which winds in loops through the shade of overhanging trees  wide views of blue hills and shining river opened up through gaps in the foliage the air had lost its humid warmth and grew fresh and invigorating  reaching the level summit they dismissed the hacks and found a seat near the edge of a steep wooded slope  the strip of tableland is not remarkably picturesque but it is thickly covered with trees and one can look out across a vast stretch of country traversed by the great river  by and by the party scattered and mrs keith was left with harding  they were in many ways strangely assorted companions the elderly english lady accustomed to the smoother side of life and the young american who had struggled hard from boyhood but they were sensible of a mutual lilting  mrs keith had a trace of the grand manner which had its effect on harding he showed a naive frankness she found attractive  besides his talk and conduct were marked by a laboured correctness which amused and pleased her  she thought he had taken some trouble to acquire it  so you had to leave your wife at home she said presently  wasnt that rather hard for both of you  it was hard enough he replied with feeling  what made it worse was that i hadnt many dollars to leave with her but i had to go  the man who will take no chances has to stay at the bottom  then if its not an impertinence your means are small  your interest is a compliment maam and what you say is true  we had two hundred dollars when we were married  you wouldnt consider that much to begin on  no said mrs keith whose marriage settlement had made over to her valuable property  still of course it depends upon what one expects  after all i think my poorest friends have been happiest  we had only one trouble making the dollars go round harding told her with grave confidence  it was worst in the hot weather when other people could move out of town and it hurt me to see marianna looking white and tired  i used to wish i could send her to one of the summerboarders farms up in the hills though i guess she wouldnt have gone without me  shes brave and when my chance came she saw that i must take it  she sent me off with smiles but i knew what they cost  she will smile more brightly when you come back and courage to face a hard task is a great gift  so you consider this trip to the northwest your opportunity  you must expect to sell a good deal of paint  harding looked up with a sudden twinkle  ill own to you maam that ive another object  the company will pay my commission on any orders i get at the settlements but this is my venture not theirs  im going up into the wilds to look for a valuable raw material  ah said mrs keith  i suspected something like this  its difficult to imagine dick blakes going into anything so sober and matter of fact as the paint business  have you known him long  i met him a year ago and we spent two or three weeks together  but was that long enough to learn much about him  do you know his history  harding gave her a direct glance  do you  yes she said i gather that he has taken you into his confidence  now you set me free to talk  when i asked him to be my partner he told me why he had left the army  that was the square thing and it made me keen on getting him  then you were not deterred by what you learned  not at all  i knew it was impossible that blake should have done what he was charged with  i thought so but i know him better than you do mrs keith said gravely  what made you jump to the conclusion  you shall judge whether i hadnt good reason  i was in one of our lake ports collecting accounts and blake had come with me  it was late at night when i saw my last customer at his hotel and i had a valise halffull of silver currency and bills  going back along the waterfront where the secondrate saloons are i thought that somebody was following me  the lights didnt run far along the street i hadnt seen a patrol and as i was passing a dark block a man jumped out  i got a blow on the shoulder that made me sore for a week but the fellow had missed my head with the sandbag and i slipped behind a telegraph post before he could strike again  still things looked ugly  the man whod been following came into sight and i was between the two  then blake ran up the street and i was mighty glad to see him  he had two men to tackle and one had a sandbag while i guess the other had a pistol  but you were there  that made it equal  no said harding  id been near knocked out with the sandbag and could hardly keep my feet  besides id my employers money in the valise and it was my business to take care of it  mrs keith made a sign of agreement  i beg your pardon  you were right  blake got after the first thief like a panther  he was so quick i didnt quite see what happened but the man reeled halfway across the street before he fell and when his partner saw blake coming for him he ran  then when the trouble was over a patrol came along and he and blake helped me back to my hotel  knowing i had the money hed got uneasy when i was late  harding paused and looked meaningly at his companion  later i was asked to believe that the man who went for those two toughs with no weapon but his fists ran away under fire  the thing didnt seem possible  and so you trust blake in spite of his story  the northwest is a hard country in winter and i may find myself in a tight place before ive finished my search harding answered with grave quietness  but if that happens ill have a partner i can trust my life to beside me  whats more mrs harding whos a judge of character feels im safe with him  mrs keith was moved his respect for his wifes judgment and his faith in his comrade appealed to her  though my opinion of blake is not generally held i believe you are right she said  and now tell me something about your journey  while they talked millicent and blake sat in the sunshine on the slope of the hill  beneath them a wide landscape stretched away towards the ottawa valley the road to the lonely north and the girl who had never left the confines of civilization felt a longing to see the trackless wilds  the distance drew her  your way lies up yonder she said  i suppose you are thinking about it  are you looking forward to the trip  not so much as harding is blake replied  hes a bit of an enthusiast and ive been in the country before  its a singularly rough one and i anticipate our meeting with more hardships than dollars  which doesnt seem to daunt you  no said blake not to a great extent  hardship is not a novelty to me and i dont think im avaricious  the fact is im a good deal better at spending than gathering  its undoubtedly easier the girl rejoined  but while i like mr harding i shouldnt consider him a type of the romantic adventurer  youre right in a sense and wrong in another  hardings out for dollars and i believe hell get them if theyre to be had  hell avoid adventures so far as he can but if theres trouble to be faced it wont stop him  then he has left a safe employment broken up his home and set off on this long journey for the sake of a woman who is trying to hold out on a very few dollars in a couple of poor rooms until his return  hes taking risks which i believe may be serious in order that she may have a brighter and fuller life  is there no romance in this  what blake said about his comrades devotion to his wife appealed to the girl  marriage had apparently not lessened his tender thought for her and millicent wondered whether she was capable of inspiring such a feeling  she had found life hard and so far had shrunk from the few men who had cultivated her acquaintance  indeed she felt contaminated as she remembered the advances made by one  on the face of it looking for openings in the paint business doesnt seem to be a very risky matter she suggested  it depends a good deal on how its done blake answered with a laugh with harding a business opening is a comprehensive term  millicent mused for a moment or two  she liked blake and he improved upon acquaintance  he had a whimsical humour and a dash of reckless gallantry  it was not to his credit that he had frequented her fathers house and he was supposed to be in disgrace but she had cause to know that he was compassionate and chivalrous  though you have not been with us long we shall be duller when you have gone she told him  well he said in a sense thats nice to hear but its with mixed feelings one leaves friends behind  his tone grew serious  ive lost some good ones  i can imagine your making others easily but havent you retained one or two  i think for instance you could count on mrs keith  ah he said i owe a good deal to her  a little charity such as she shows goes a very long way  millicent did not answer and he watched her as she sat looking out into the distance with grave brown eyes  her face was gentle he thought there was pity for him in it and felt strongly drawn to her but he remembered that he was a man with a tainted name and must travel a lonely road  she was conscious of his scrutiny but took no offence at it  perhaps we had better change our place she said by and by  the sun is rather strong now the wind has gone  some of the others joined them and soon afterwards they walked down the winding road to the city when they sat outside the hotel after dinner blake asked harding if he had enjoyed the afternoon  i did said harding with earnestness  id only one regret that mrs harding wasnt here to share it with me  your friends are charming ladies of a stamp marianna and i so far havent had much chance to meet  then his face grew very resolute as he added but she shall have her opportunity  if things go right with us shell get her share of all thats best in lifeand with that at stake we have to make things right  two days later harding got some letters he had been waiting for and as there was now nothing to keep them in montreal blake said goodbye to mrs keith next morning  though she was gracious to him he felt a strong sense of disappointment at finding her alone but when he was going out he met millicent in the hall  she wore her hat and the flush of colour in her face indicated that she had been walking fast  im glad i didnt miss you but i had an errand to do she said you are going now by the vancouver express  yes said blake stopping beside a pillar i was feeling rather gloomy until i saw you  hardings at the station and its depressing to set off on a long journey feeling that nobody minds your going  mrs keith will mind said millicent  im sure she was very friendly and gave you her good wishes  blake looked at her with a smile  somehow they didnt seem enough  i think i wanted yours  she coloured but met his glance  then she said you have them  i havent forgotten what happened one evening in london and i wish you a safe journey and success  thank you he answered with feeling  it will be something to remember that you have wished me well  then as his eyes rested upon her he forgot that he was a marked man  she looked very fresh and desirable there was a hint of regret and pity in her face and a trace of shyness in her manner  i suppose i cant ask you to think of me now and then it would be too much he went on  but wont you give me something of yours some trifle to keep as a memento  millicent hesitated and then took a tiny bunch of flowers from the lace at the neck of her white dress  will these do she asked and added with a smile they wont last very long  they will last a long time well taken care of but what you said had a sting  did you mean that you wouldnt give me anything more enduring  no she said shyly not that altogether  i think i meant that they would last as long as you might care to remember our acquaintance  blake bowed  my memorys good  when i come back i will show you your gift as a token  but i shall be in england then  i bore that in mind  it is not very far off and im a wanderer  well she said with faint confusion unless you hurry you will miss your train  goodbye and good fortune  he took the hand she gave him and held it a moment  i wonder whether your last wish will ever be realized if so i shall come to thank you even in england  then he turned and went out with hurried steps wondering what had led him to break through the reserve he had prudently determined to maintain  what he had said might mean nothing but it might mean much he had seen millicent graham for a few minutes in her fathers house and afterwards met her every day during the week spent in montreal but brief as their friendship had been he had yielded to her charm  had he been free to seek her love he would eagerly have done so but he was not free  he was an outcast engaged in a desperate attempt to repair his fortune  miss graham knew this and had probably taken his remarks for what they were worth as a piece of sentimental gallantry but something in her manner suggested a doubt and the trouble was that he did not wish her to regard them in this light  it looked as if he had made a fool of himself but he had promised to show her the flowers again some day and he carefully placed them in his pocket book  the train was ready to start when he found harding impatiently waiting him on the platform and a few moments later the long cars were swiftly rolling west     chapter vii  mrs chudleigh gathers information  it was a fine morning when mrs keith sat on the saloon deck of a river boat steaming with the ebb tide down the st lawrence  the terraced heights of quebec had faded astern ahead a blaze of sunshine rested on the river up which a big liner with crowded decks and her smoketrail staining the clear blue sky moved majestically  to starboard dark pinewoods with here and there a sawmill stack were faintly marked upon the lofty bank to port rose rugged hills with wooden villages at their feet  the light wind that rippled the blue water was pleasantly cool and mrs keith laying down the book she had been reading looked about with languid enjoyment  i suppose im neglecting my opportunities but this is very delightful and i dont think they have anything finer than the river in canada she said  its width impresses one the french villages with their church spires are so picturesquei wonder how many churches there are in this part of the country  one sees them everywhere  you were urged to see the ontario forests and the prairie millicent remarked  one cannot do everything and im not insatiable  im getting too old to stand the shaking in the hot and dusty cars and i cant accustom myself to going to bed in public without undressing  no doubt its a matter of prejudice but ive been used to more room for taking my clothes off than they give you behind the flapping curtain  millicent laughed as she remembered their experiences during a journey on a crowded express  getting up is worse she said  however they told us it was very pretty and generally cool at saguenay  then youll have somebody to talk to as mrs chudleigh is coming  but didnt she make up her mind rather suddenly  i thought so since she didnt speak of going until i sent you for the tickets  still sedgwick was sent to ottawa where she doesnt know anybody which may have had something to do with it  millicent who looked very pretty in her light summer dress as she leaned back in a deckchair did not reply  sun and wind had brought a fine warm colour into her face but her brown eyes were grave for there was a point upon which she must try to form a correct judgment and she distrusted her inexperience  she was young and had a natural love of pleasure as well as a certain longing for excitement and a willingness to take a risk which she had inherited from her gambling father  mrs keith had prevented her indulging these tendencies and the girl thrust for the most part into the society of older people suffered at times from a feeling of depressing monotony  then she had met captain sedgwick who paid her rather marked attention at quebec and at first had been attracted by the handsome soldier and flattered by his singling her out among women of higher station and maturer beauty but the attraction did not last long there was a vein of sound sense in millicent and when she tested sedgwick by it he did not ring true and when mrs chudleigh openly claimed him as her property she acquiesced  afterwards she met blake on board the steamer and the gratitude and admiration which a chivalrous act of his had roused suddenly revived  moreover she was sorry for him and felt that he had been unjustly blamed while though it was generally hidden by his careless manner she thought she saw in him a strong sincerity  now she wondered whether she was foolish in letting her thoughts dwell on him and if he would soon forget her recalling his words when he said goodbye she knew he had been stirred but before this she had been conscious of a certain restraint in his manner which had only broken down at the last moment  by and by mrs keith disturbed her reflections  it looks as if we were to be favoured with mrs chudleighs society she remarked with ironical amusement  mine appears to have become more valuable during the last few days  millicent saw mrs chudleigh moving towards them followed by a steward carrying a folding chair and a maid who brought a book a bunch of flowers an ornamental leather bag and several other odds and ends mrs chudleigh was elaborately attired but the large plumed hat and dress cut in the extreme of the current fashion became her  she made a stately progress along the deck with her burdened attendants in her train and it took a few minutes to arrange her belongings to her satisfaction  then she sank into the big chair with marked grace of movement and smiled at mrs keith  a delightful morning  i ought to have been writing letters but the sunshine brought me out  mrs keith agreed and mrs chudleigh went on i have enjoyed this visit greatly and find canada a most interesting country  in fact i wish i could stay another month or two but of course when one has duties  as mrs chudleigh had neither husband nor children margaret keith wondered what her duties were unless she considered the taking a part in a round of social amusements as such  after all she remarked i imagine that one doesnt see very much of the real canada from the frontenac or a big hotel in montreal  true said mrs chudleigh  i must confess that i didnt come out to study the country though im charmed with all ive seen  im afraid i belong to a frivolous set and find a change refreshing  then several old friends of mine were going to take a part in the celebrations at quebeccaptain sedgwick among others  is captain sedgwick a very old friend mrs keith asked willing to give the other the lead she seemed to wish for  oh yes i met him first as a subaltern in india when he was very raw and troubled by a seriousness he has since grown out of but i thought he would make his mark  mrs keith pondered the explanation  she could not imagine her companions patronizing a callow young lieutenant but this was not important  admitting that a hint might have been intended for millicents benefit mrs chudleighs boldness in laying claim to the man by suggesting that she had come out for his sake was puzzling  it was not in good taste but although mrs chudleighs position was assured there was something of the audacity of the adventuress about her  margaret keith however had no admiration for sedgwick whom she thought of as secondrate and she was glad to believe that millicent did not wish to dispute the womans right to him  are you going home soon she asked  before long i think  there is a round of visits i have promised to make and i may stay some time with the fosters in shropshire near colonel challoners place  i believe he is a friend of yours  he is  have you met him  once i found him charming  a very fine oldfashioned gentleman and i understand a famous soldier  somebody told me he never quite got over his nephews disgrace and seemed to think it reflected upon the whole family  very foolish of course but one can admire his sense of honour  mrs keith began to understand why her companion had sought her  she wished to speak about richard blake and mrs keith was forced to acquiesce since he had been seen in her company  i suppose you know the nephew was in montreal she said  to tell the truth i do  i saw him talking to bertram challoner whom i met in london and the family likeness struck me  then i saw his name in the hotel register  no doubt you studied him after that  what opinion did you form  mrs chudleigh gave her a look of thoughtful candour  i was puzzled and interested  i dont know him but he did not look the man to run away  he is not mrs keith declared  i knew him as a boy and even then he was marked by reckless daring  whats more i noticed very little change in him  its strange  mrs chudleighs tone was sympathetically grave  i feel much as you do  after all it may have been one of the affairs about which the truth never quite comes out  what do you wish to suggest by that  nothing in particular ive no means of forming an accurate conclusion  but the regimental honour was threatened and a scapegoat needed  a mistake may have been made by somebody of greater importance  one hears of some curious things  thats true mrs keith drily agreed  i believe in dick blake but it must be admitted that he made no defence  mrs chudleigh pondered this  one meets men capable of making a great sacrifice though theyre by no means numerous  i suppose colonel challoner really felt it a heavy blow  those who know him cant doubt it though he never speaks of the matter  it must have been a shock  apart from whatever affection he had for his nephew there was in a sense the stigma reflected upon himselfan old man who has bravely won distinction and retains some influence  im told he has friends in administrative circles and that his opinion on indian subjects still carries weight  i believe so said mrs keith  he certainly holds his opinions firmly and was once looked upon as an authority on frontier defence indeed he gave up his command because he could not get some drastic change which events subsequently proved needful adopted  his honesty is remembered by men who hold him in esteem  all you have said bears out my impression of him  i must renew our acquaintance when i am in shropshire  are you staying here long  mrs keith was glad to change the subject but while they talked a steward appeared with a letter for millicent which he explained had been sent on board the steamer at quebec  as the girl laid down the opened envelope mrs chudleigh recognized sedgwicks writing and her face grew contemptuously hard  then she laughed and started a different topic which she continued for a time  when she went away mrs keith turned to millicent  i wonder whether i have told her too much though its hard to see what use she can make of it  innocent or not dick blake is a favourite of mine and when i speak of him im apt to be unguarded  of course its obvious that she joined us on purpose to talk about him  one would have imagined it was captain sedgwick  she dragged him in rather pointedly  oh no  that was by the way and perhaps intended to put me off the scent  shes a scheming woman  but she has not learned much from you  she has learned two things mrs keith answered thoughtfully first that i dont believe dick blake failed in his duty and secondly that colonel challoner has some influence  i think she was particularly interested in the latter point  ive been incautious and let my tongue run away with me  then she took up her book while millicent read her letter  though young and to some extent inexperienced her judgment was generally sound and she had come to see how sedgwick really regarded her  she had pleased his eye and he was a man who would boldly grasp at what delighted him but love would not be permitted to interfere with his ambitions  he wrote in a tone of forced and insincere sentiment and his words brought a blush into millicents face as well as a rather bitter smile into her eyes  by and by she tore the sheet into pieces and dropped them over the steamers rail  that affair was ended  as the fragments of paper fluttered astern mrs keith looked up  you are treating somebodys letter very unceremoniously  perhaps i am said millicent  its from captain sedgwick  ah exclaimed mrs keith  has he anything of interest to say  he mentions that he is going back to africa sooner than he expected because the officer above him has suffered so much from the climate that he has asked to be relieved of his post  captain sedgwick believes this will give him a chance of advancement  then ive no doubt hell make the most of it  i suppose he doesnt waste much pity on his unfortunate chief  the mans personal interest stands first with him  isnt that the usual thing with men  there are exceptions  colonel challoner for instance threw up his career when he found he was forced to act against his convictions and ive a suspicion that another man i know made as great a sacrifice however sedgwick will make every effort to get the vacant post and i wonder whether he told mrs chudleigh how matters stood  she may have had a letter before you did  millicent knew her employers penetration but did not understand the drift of her remarks  i dare say he wrote to her  she told us they were old friends  but why should it interest you  it does mrs keith rejoined  i have a habit of putting things together and drawing my conclusions though of course im now and then mistaken  whether im right or not in the present instance time will show but i must try to watch the woman when we go home  then she added sharply as you have torn it up you dont mean to answer sedgwicks letter  no said millicent with a trace of colour i dont think it needs a reply  mrs keith made a sign of agreement  on the whole she said pointedly i should imagine that to be a wise decision  on reaching saguenay mrs keith spent the first morning sitting outside her hotel  rugged mountains with dark belts of pines straggling up their sides were spread about her but she gave the wild grandeur of the landscape scanty attention as she consulted the engagement book in her hand  it contained a list of the friends she wished to entertain and the visits she had thought of making in england during the winter and she wondered which could be shortened and whom she could put off because it might be desirable to spend some time in shropshire  margaret keith was a strongwilled woman who had led a busy life but now when she had resolved to retire into the background and rest it looked as if she might again be forced to take an active part in affairs  she had enjoyed her canadian trip but during the last week or two it had begun to lose its interest and she was conscious of a call to be up and doing  she suspected mrs chudleigh she doubted sedgwick and she was disturbed by the way the unfortunate affair on the indian frontier had cropped up again  somehow she felt colonel challoners peace was threatened which could not be permitted  for many years she had cherished a warm liking for him and long ago when he was a young lieutenant she could have made him hers  family arrangements complicated by the interests of landed property had however stood in the way  challoner was not free to marry as he pleased he had been taught that the desire of the individual must be subordinated to the welfare of the line and when he first met margaret keith who was beautiful then it was too late for him to rebel  she let him go but he had always had a place in her heart and now they were firm and trusted friends  during her stay at saguenay mrs chudleigh made two or three attempts to extract some further information about the challoners but without success and one day soon after she had left mrs keith sent millicent for a list of steamer sailings  this place is very pretty but we have been here some time and im beginning to think of home she said  one of the empresses sails next week said millicent returning with the card  mr gordon told me this morning that mrs chudleigh went in the salmatian the day before he left quebec  did she mrs keith rejoined  well perhaps you had better write to the montreal office about our berths  then for the call had grown clearer she smiled as the girl went away and added it might be wiser to keep the woman in sight     chapter viii  the prairie  a strong breeze swept the wide plain blowing fine sand about when blake plodded beside the jaded indian pony that drew his redriver cart  it was loaded with preserved provisions camp stores and winter clothes and he had bought it and the pony because that seemed cheaper than paying for transport  the settlement for which he was bound stands near the northern edge of the great sweep of grass which stretches across central canada and means of communication between it and the outer world were scarce  harding accordingly had agreed to the purchase of the animal with the idea of selling it afterwards to one of the settlers  since leaving the railroad they had spent four days upon the trail which sometimes ran plain before them marked by dints of wheels among the wiry grass and sometimes died away leaving them at a loss in a wilderness of sand and short poplar scrub through which blake steered by compass  now it was late in the afternoon and the men were tired of battling with the wind which buffeted their sunburned faces with sharp sand  they were crossing one of the high steppes of the middle prairie towards the belt of pines and muskegs which divides it from the barrens of the north  the broad stretch of fertile loam where prosperous wooden towns are rising fast among the wheatfields lay to the south of them and the arid tract they journeyed through had so far no attraction for even the adventurous homestead preemptor  they found it a bleak and cheerless country crossed by the ravines of a few sluggish creeks the water of which was unpleasant to drink and dotted at long intervals by ponds bitter with alkali  in places stunted poplar bluffs cut against the sky but for the most part there was only a rolling waste of dingy grass  the trail was heavy the wheels sank deep in sand as they climbed a low rise and to make things worse the rounded whiteedged clouds which had scudded across the sky since morning were gathering in threatening masses  this had happened every afternoon but now and then the cloud ranks had broken to pour out a furious deluge and a blaze of lightning  harding anxiously studied the sky  i guess were up against another thunderstorm he said  my opinion of the midcontinental climate is singularly mean but id put this strip of canada near the limit  our texan northers are fierce when they come along but here it blows all the time  well make camp if you like i dont feel very fresh blake replied  not here snapped harding where i stop i sleep and ive no use for sheltering under the cart  last time we tried it the pony stampeded and the wheel went over my foot  the tents no good youd want a chain to stop its blowing away  well go on until we bring up to lee of a big solid bluff  very well blake agreed  i daresay we ought to find one in the hollow we got a glimpse of from the last rise but we havent had to put up with much discomfort yet  its a matter of opinion you havent limped forty miles on a bad foot but im not complaining harding rejoined in fact ive most been happy since we left the depot  its something to feel that you have started doing nothing takes the sand out of me  blake had once or twice suggested that his comrade should ride but the pony was overburdened and harding refused  he explained that they could not expect to sell it in a wornout condition but his partner suspected him of sympathy for the patient beast  they crossed the ridge and seeing a wavy line of trees in the wide hollow quickened their pace  the soil was firmer the scrub the wheels crushed through was short and the trail led smoothly down a slight descent  this was comforting because half the sky was barred with leaden cloud and the parched grass gleamed beneath it lividly white while the light that struck a ridgetop here and there had a sinister luridness  it was getting cold and the wind was dropping which was not a favourable sign  pushing the cart through the softer places dragging the jaded pony by the head they hurried on and at length plunged through a creek with the trees close in front  a few minutes later they tethered the pony to lee of the cart and set up their tent  then while blake was rummaging out provisions and harding searching the bluff for dry sticks they heard a beat of hoofs and a man rode up leading a second horse  he got down and throwing a bundle off his saddle hobbled the beasts before he turned to blake  from the south  youre for sweetwater he said  blake told him he had guessed correctly and asked how far they had still to go  you ought to make it in a day and a half said the other  ill ride in with you run a store and hotel there but feel i want to get out on the prairie now and then and as a horse was missing i went after him a looker isnt he  blake admired the animal and suggested that the stranger had better join them instead of cooking a separate supper  the fellow who told them that his name was gardner had a goodhumoured sunburned face and an honest look  the prairie was now wrapped in inky gloom and there was an impressive stillness except for the occasional rustle of a leaf but when harding came out of the bluff with a load of wood a puff of icy wind suddenly stirred the grass  the harsh rustle it made was followed by a deafening crash and a jagged streak of lightning fell from the leaden clouds then the air was filled with the roar of driving hail  it swept the wood rending leaves and smashing twigs while the men crouched inside the straining tent and a constant blaze of lightning flickered about the grass  by and by the thunder died away and the hail gave place to torrential rain while the slender trees rocked in the blast and small branches drove past the tent  this lasted some minutes after which the rain ceased suddenly and a fierce red light streamed along the saturated grass from the huge sinking sun harding who had brought the wood into the tent took it out and with the strangers help soon made a fire  it was getting dark though a band of transcendental green still burned upon the prairies western edge when they finished supper and sitting round the fire took out their pipes  the hobbled horses were quietly grazing near them  thats undoubtedly a fine animal blake remarked  is it yours  no it belongs to clarkes englishman  whos he  its a curious way to speak of a fellow  it fits him said the other  guess hes clarkes hide and bones and thats all therell be when the doctor has done with him  hes a sucker the doctor taught farming and then sold land to  then whos the doctor harding inquired  thats not so easy to answer but hes a man you want to be friends with if you stay near the settlement  teaches farming to tenderfoot young englishmen and americans finds them land and stock to start with and makes a mighty good thing out of it  goes to montreal now and then but whether its to look up fresh suckers or on the jag is more than i know  we met a fellow called clarke at the windsor not long since  whats he like  gardner described him and harding said thats the man  then i cant see what he was doing at the windsor an opium joint would have been more in his line  does the fellow live at sweetwater blake asked  has a farm and runs it well about three miles back but hes away pretty often in the north and at a settlement on the edge of the bush country  dont know what he does there and theyre a curious crowd dubokars russians of sorts i guess  blake had seen the dubokars in other parts of canada and had found them an industrious people leading from religious convictions a remarkably primitive life  there were however fanatics among them and he understood that these now and then led their followers into outbreaks of emotional extravagance  they make good settlers as a rule he said  but as they dont speak english how does the fellow get on with them  told me he was a philologist when i asked him then he allowed two or three of them were mystics and he was something in that line  he was a doctor once and got fired out of england for something he shouldnt have done  anyhow the dubokars are like the rest of us good bad and pretty mixed and the crowd back of sweetwater belong to the last at first some of them didnt believe it was right to work horses and made the women drag the plough and theyd one or two other habits that brought the northwest police down on them  after that theyve given no trouble but they get on a jag of some kind now and then  blake nodded  he knew that the fanatic with untrained and unbalanced mind is liable under the influence of excitement to indulge in crude debauchery but it was strange that a man of culture such as clarke appeared to be should take a part in these excesses  he had however no interest in the fellow and turned the talk on to other matters and when it got cold they went to sleep  starting early next morning they reached sweetwater after an uneventful journey and found it by no means an attractive place  south of it rolling prairie ran back greyish white with withered grass to the skyline to the north straggling poplar bluffs and scattered jackpines crowned the summits of the ridges  a lake gleamed in a hollow a slow creek wound across the foreground in a deep ravine and here and there in the distance one could see an outlying farm  a row of houses followed the crest of the ravine the side of which formed a dumping ground for domestic refuse  some were built of small logs and some of shiplap lumber which had cracked with exposure to the sun but all had a neglected and povertystricken air  the land was poor and the settlement located too far from a market  with leaden thunderclouds hanging over it the place looked as desolate as the sadcoloured waste  following the deeplyrutted street which had a narrow plank sidewalk they reached the imperial hotel a somewhat pretentious doublestoreyed building of unpainted wood with a verandah in front of it  here gardner took the pony from them and gave them a room which had no furniture except a chair and two rickety iron beds  before he went out he indicated a printed list of the things they were not allowed to do  harding studied it with a sardonic smile  i dont see much use in prohibiting folks from washing their clothes in the bedrooms when they dont give you any water he remarked this place must be about the limit in the way of cheap hotels  it isnt cheap said blake ive seen the tariff but on the whole i like the fellow who keeps it  they found their supper better than they had reason to expect and afterwards sat out on the verandah with the proprietor and one or two of the settlers who boarded at the hotel  the sun had set and now and then a heavy shower beat upon the shingled roof but the western sky was clear and flushed with vivid crimson towards which the prairie rolled away in varying tones of blue  lights shone in the windows behind the verandah and from one which stood open a hoarse voice drifted out singing in a maudlin fashion snatches of an old musichall ditty  its that fool bensonclarkes englishman gardner explained found hed got into my bed with his boots on after falling down in a muskeg  its not the first time hes played that trick when he gets worse than usual he makes straight for my room  why do you give him the liquor harding inquired  i dont said gardner drily  hes a pretty regular customer but he never gets too much at this hotel  and there isnt another  thats so gardner agreed but he offered no explanation and blake changed the subject  unless youre fond of farming life in these remote districts is trying he remarked  the loneliness and monotony are apt to break down men who are not used to it  turns some of them crazy and kills off a few agreed a farmer who appeared to be well educated  after all worse things might happen to them  its conceivable said blake  but what particular things were you referring to  i was thinking of men who go to the devil while theyre alive theres a fellow in this neighbourhood whos doing something of the kind  rot exclaimed a thick voice and a mans figure appeared against the light at the open window  devilsh a myth allegorolical gentleman everybody knowsh  hard word thatallegorolical  bad word too reminds you of things in the rivers down in florida  must be some in the creek here seen them in my homestead  you go to bed said gardner sternly  nosh a bit replied the other  who you talking to  he leaned forward in danger of falling through the window  lemme out  its not all drink gardner explained  he has something like shakes and ague now and then  says he got it in india  the other disappeared and a few moments afterwards reeled out of the door and held himself upright by one of the verandah posts  now im here dont let me interrupt he said  nice place if this post would keep still  warned by a sign from gardner the others ignored him and harding remarked to the farmer you hadnt finished what you were saying when he disturbed you  i dont know that it was of much importance speaking of degenerates werent we  we have a curious example of the neurotic here a fellow who makes a good many dollars by victimizing farmers who are forced to borrow when they lose a crop as well as young fools from england and by way of amusement studies modern magic and indulges in refined debauchery  it strikes me as a particularly unhallowed combination  no sensible man has any use for hoodoo tricks and the folks who practise them harding said  theyre frauds from the start  dont know what youre talking about benson broke in  not all tricks  seen funny things in the east thingsh decent men better leave alone  letting go the post he lurched forward and as the light fell upon his face blake started  he had been puzzled by something familiar in the voice and now he knew the man whom he had no wish to meet  he was too late in hitching his chair back into the shadow for benson had seen him and stopped with an excited cry  blake of the sappers  want to cut your old friendsh  whatsh you doing here  its a mutual surprise benson blake replied and the other holding on by a chair back smiled at him genially  often wondered where you went to after you left peshawur old man though you got the sack for it it wasnt your fault the ghazees broke our line that night  said so to the colonelcan see him now sitting there looking very sick and cut up and bolsover acting adjutant blinking like an owl  be quiet blake said in alarm for the man had been a lieutenant of native infantry when they had met on the hill campaign  benson however was not to be deterred and addressed the rest this gentleman old friend of mine never agreed with solemn old colonel but they wouldnt listen to me  very black night in india ghazees coming yelling up the hill nothing would stop them  rifles cracking nepalese compny busy with the bayonet and in the thick of it the bugle goes  raising a hand to his mouth he gave a shrill imitation of the call cease fire and then lost his balance and fell over the chair with a crash  leave him to me said gardner who seized the fallen man and with some difficulty lifted him to his feet  after he pushed him through the door there were sounds of a scuffle and two or three minutes later gardner came back with a bruise upon his face  hes quiet now and the bartender will put him to bed he said  there was silence for the next few moments for the group on the verandah had been impressed by the scene then a man came up the steps he was dressed in old brown overalls and carried a riding quirt but harding recognized him as the man they had met at the windsor in montreal  have you got benson here he asked  sure said gardner  hes left his mark on my cheek  why dont you look after the fool  anyhow you must have come pretty quietly i didnt hear you until you were half way up the steps  light boots clarke answered smiling i bought them from you  i dont know that i need hold myself responsible for benson but i found he wasnt in when i rode past his place and it struck me that he might get into trouble if he got on a jag  he turned and nodded to blake  so you have come up here  i may see you tomorrow but if bensons all right im going home now  he went into the hotel and soon afterwards they heard him leave by another door     chapter ix  clarke makes a suggestion  at breakfast next morning blake and harding found the farmer who had spent the night at the hotel at their table and afterwards sat for a time on the verandah talking to him  when they mentioned their first objective point and asked if he could give them any directions for reaching it he looked thoughtful  i only know that its remarkably rough country thick pine bush on rolling ground with some bad muskegs and small lakes he said  you would find things easier if you could hire an indian or two and a canoe when you strike the river  the boys here seldom go up so far but clarke could help you if he liked  hes been north and knows the indians  were willing to pay him for any useful help harding replied  be careful said the farmer  if youre on a prospecting trip keep your secret close  theres another thing i might mention  he turned to blake  if youre a friend of bensons take him along with you  i suppose i am in a way though its a long time since i met him but why do you recommend our taking him  i hate to see a man go to pieces as bensons doing and clarkes ruining the fellow  he must have got two or three thousand dollars out of him one way or another and isnt satisfied with that  lent him money on mortgage to start a foolish stockraising speculation and keeps him well supplied with drink  the fellows weak but he has his good points  but whats clarkes object  it isnt very clear but a man whos seldom sober is easily robbed and bensons place is worth something clarke sees its properly farmed however you must use your judgment about anything he tells you ive given you warning  he went away and blake sat silent for a time  though they had not been intimate friends he had known benson when the latter was a wild young subaltern and it did not seem fitting to leave him in the clutches of a man who was ruining him in health and fortune  he would sooner not have met the man at all but since they had met there was so far as he could see only one thing to be done  if you dont mind id like to take benson with us he said to harding  the american looked doubtful  we could do with another white man but i guess your friend isnt the kind we want  he may give us trouble and you cant count on much help from a whiskytank  however if you wish it you can bring him  soon afterwards benson came out from the diningroom  he was two or three years younger than blake and had a muscular figure but he looked shaky and his face was weak and marked by dissipation  smiling in a deprecatory way he lighted a cigar  im afraid i made a fool of myself last night he said  if i made any unfortunate allusions you must overlook them  you must have seen that i wasnt altogether responsible  i did blake answered drily  if we are to remain friends you had better understand that i cant tolerate any further mention of the matter you talked about  sorry said benson who gave him a keen glance  though i dont think you have much cause to be touchy about it ill try to remember  then id like you to know my partner mr harding who has agreed to a suggestion im going to make  we want you to come with us on a trip to the northern bush  thanks said benson who shook hands with harding  i wonder what use you think i would be  to tell the truth i havent considered whether you would be of any use or not but you had better come  the trip will brace you up and you look as if you needed it  bensons face grew red  your intentions may be good but you virtuous and respectable people sometimes show a meddlesome thoughtfulness which degenerates like myself resent  besides i suspect your offer has come too late  i dont think you have much reason for taunting me with being respectable blake rejoined with a grim smile  anyway i want you to come with us  tilting his chair back benson looked heavily about  when i was new to the country i often wished to go north  there are caribou and moose up yonder great sights when the rivers break up in spring and a sledge trip across the snow must be a thing to remember  the wilds draw you but im afraid my nerves not good enough  a man must be fit in every way to cross the timber belt  then why arent you fit  why have you let that fellow clarke suck the life and energy out of you as well as rob you of your money  you hit hard but i expect i deserve it and ill try to explain benson indicated the desolate settlement with a gesture of weariness  ugly frame houses straggled weatherscarred and dilapidated along one side of the unpaved street while unsightly refuse dumps disfigured the slopes of the ravine in front  there was no sign of activity but two or three untidy loungers leaned against a rude shack with pool room painted on its dirty window  all round the rolling prairie stretched back to the horizon washed in dingy drab and grey  the prospect was dreary and depressing  this place benson resumed hasnt much to offer one in the way of relaxation and for a man used to something different life at a lonely homestead soon loses its charm  unless hes a keen farmer hes apt to go to bits  then why dont you quit harding asked  where could i go  a man with no profession except the one he hasnt the means to follow is not much use at home and all my money is sunk in my place here  as things stand i cant sell it  he turned to blake  i left the army because a financial disaster i wasnt responsible for stopped my allowance and i was in debt  eventually about two thousand pounds were saved out of the wreck and i came here with that feeling badly hipped which was one reason why i took to whisky and clarke who engaged to teach me farming saw i got plenty of it  now he has his hands on all thats mine but he keeps me fairly supplied with cash and it saves trouble to leave things to him  when benson stopped blake made a sign of comprehension for he knew that somewhat exceptional qualities are required of the man who undertakes the breaking of virgin prairie in the remoter districts  he must have unflinching courage and stubbornness and be able to dispense with all the comforts and amenities of civilized life  no interests are offered him beyond those connected with his task for half the year he must toil unremittingly from dawn to dark and depend upon his own resources through the long bitter winter  for society he may have a hired hand and the loungers in the saloon of the nearest settlement which is often a days ride away and they are not as a rule men of culture or pleasing manners  for the strong in mind and body it is nevertheless a healthful life but benson was not of sufficiently tough fibre  now see here said harding  im out for dollars and this is a business trip but blake wants to take you and im agreeable  if you can stand for two or three months hard work in the open and very plain living youll feel yourself a match for clarke when you get back though theres no reason why you should tell a stranger like myself how you stand if youd sooner not i know something of business and might see a way out of your difficulties  benson hesitated  he would have resented an attempt to use his troubles as a text for improving remarks since he already knew his failings  what he desired was a means of escaping their consequences and the american whose tone was reassuringly matter of fact seemed to offer it  he began an explanation and with the help of a few leading questions made his financial position fairly clear  well said harding clarke has certainly got a tight hold on you but i guess its possible to shake him off  as things stand however it seems to me he has most to gain from your death  he couldnt count on that to do the fellow justice hed hardly go so far but theres some truth in what you say  benson looked disturbed and irresolute but after a few moments he abruptly threw his cigar away and leaned forward with a decided air  if youll have me ill go with you  youre wise harding said quietly  shortly afterwards benson left them and harding said to blake now you had better go along and see if you can learn anything from clarke about our road  hes a rogue but thats no reason we shouldnt make him useful  if he can help us pay him and be careful what you say remember that he was watching you at the windsor and ive a suspicion that he was standing in the shadow near the stairs when benson talked last night  borrowing a saddle blake rode over to clarkes homestead which had a wellkept prosperous look and found its owner in a small room furnished as an office  files of papers and a large map of the western provinces hung upon one wall the floor was uncovered and a rusty stove stood in the middle of it but clarke was seated at a handsome american desk  he wore old overalls and the soil upon his boots suggested that he had been engaged in fall ploughing  as benson came in he looked up and the light fell upon his face  it was deeply lined and of a curious dead colour but while it bore a sensual stamp and something in it hinted at cruelty it was blake felt the face of a clever and determined man  ah he said you have ridden over for a talk  glad to see you have a cigar  blake who took one explained his errand and clarke seemed to consider  then he took out a small handdrawn map and passed it to his visitor  i wont ask why you are going north as i daresay its a secret he remarked  however though its too valuable for me to lend it you this will show you your way through the timber belt  he cleared the other end of the desk  sit here and make a note of the features of the country  it took blake some time but he had been taught such work and did it carefully  when he had finished clarke resumed ill give you a few directions and you had better take them down but youll want a canoe and one or two indians  i daresay i could enable you to get them but i think the service is worth fifty dollars  id be glad to pay it when we come back blake answered cautiously its possible that we mightnt find the indians and we might leave the water and strike overland  as you like clarke said with a smile  ill give you the directions before you go but theres another matter i want to talk about  he fixed his eyes on blake  you are a nephew of colonel challoners  i am but i cant see what connexion this has  clarke stopped him  its not an impertinence  hear me out  you were a lieutenant of engineers and served in india where you left the army  that is correct but its not a subject im disposed to talk about  so i imagined clarke said drily  still i would like to say that there is some reason for believing you to be a badly treated man  you have my sympathy  thank you said blake  i must remind you that i have given you no grounds for offering it  a painful subject  but are you content to quietly suffer injustice  i dont admit an injustice  besides i dont see what you can know about the matter  a proper line to take with an outsider like myself but i know you were turned out of the army for a fault you did not commit  blakes face set sternly  its hard to understand how you arrived at that flattering conclusion  i wont explain but im convinced of its correctness clarke rejoined watching him  one would imagine that the most important matter is that you were driven out of a calling you liked and were sent here ruined in repute and fortune  are you satisfied with your lot havent you the courage to insist upon being reinstated  my reinstation would be difficult blake said curtly  he would have left the house only that he was curious to learn where the others suggestions led and how much he knew  there was a moments silence and then clarke went on  a young man of ability with means and influence behind him has a choice of careers in england and theres another point to be considered you might wish to marry  that of course is out of the question now  it will no doubt remain so blake replied with the colour creeping into his set face  then you have given up all idea of clearing yourself  the thing may be easier than you imagine if properly handled  clarke paused and added significantly in fact i could show you a way in which the matter could be straightened out without causing serious trouble to anybody concerned that is if you are disposed to take me into your confidence  blake got up filled with anger and uneasiness  he had no great faith in hardings scheme his life as a needy adventurer had its trials and it had been cunningly hinted that he could change it when he liked but he had no intention of doing so  this was an old resolve but it was disconcerting to feel that an unscrupulous fellow was anxious to meddle with his affairs for clarke had obviously implied the possibility of putting some pressure upon colonel challoner  blake shrank from the suggestion  it was not to be thought of  i have nothing more to say on the subject he answered sternly  it must be dropped  somewhat to his surprise clarke acquiesced goodhumouredly after a keen glance at him  as you wish he said  however that neednt prevent my giving you the directions i promised particularly as it may help me to earn fifty dollars  i believe benson spent some time with you this morning are you taking him  blake started  he wondered how the man could have guessed but he admitted that benson was going  you may find him a drag but thats your affair said clarke in a tone of indifference  now sit down and make a careful note of what i tell you  believing that the information might be of service blake did as he was told and then took his leave  when he had gone clarke sat still for a time with a curious smile  blake had firmly declined to be influenced by his hints but clarke had half expected this and what he had learned about the young mans character cleared the ground     chapter x  benson gives trouble  it was nearly dark when blake and harding led two packhorses through a thin spruce wood with benson lagging a short distance behind  they had spent some time crossing a wide stretch of rolling country dotted with clumps of poplar and birch which was still sparsely inhabited and now they had reached the edge of the timber belt that cuts off the prairie from the desolate barrens  the spruces were gnarled and twisted by the wind a number of them were dead and many of the rest leaned unsymmetrically athwart each other  the straggling wood had no beauty and in the fading light wore a dreary forbidding look fortunately however it was thin enough for the travellers to pick their way among the fallen branches and patches of muskeg for the ground was marsh and their feet sank among the withered needles  by and by blake checked his pony and waited until benson came up  the man moved with a slack heaviness and his face was worn and tense  he was tired with the journey for excess had weakened him and now the lust for drink which he had stubbornly fought against had grown overwhelming  i can go no faster  push on and ill follow your tracks he said in a surly tone  it takes time to get into condition and i havent walked much for several years  neither have i harding answered cheerfully im more used to riding in elevators and the street cars but this sort of thing soon makes you fit  youre not troubled with my complaint benson rejoined and when blake started the pony deliberately dropped behind  hes in a black mood well leave him to himself harding remarked so far hes braced up better than i expected but when a mans been tanking steadily its pretty drastic to put him through the total deprivation cure  i wonder blake said thoughtfully whether it is a cure we have both seen men who made some effort to save themselves go down  though im a long way from being a philanthropist i hate this waste of good material  perhaps its partly an economic objection because i used to get savage in india when any of the tommies lives were thrown away by careless handling  it was your soldiers business to be made use of wasnt it  yes said blake frowning but theres a difference between that and the other thing  its the needless waste of life and talent that annoys me  on the frontier we spent men freely which is the best word for it because we tried to get something in return a rebel hill fort seized a raid turned back  if benson had killed himself in breaking a horse or by an accident with a harvesting machine one couldnt complain but to see him do so with whisky is another matter  harding nodded  blake was not given to serious conversation indeed he was rather casual as a rule but harding who was shrewd saw beneath the surface a love of order and what he thought of as constructive ability  i guess youre right but your speaking of india reminds me of something i want to mention  ive been thinking over what clarke said to you  his games obvious and it might have been a profitable one he wanted you to help him in squeezing colonel challoner  he knows now that he applied to the wrong man  thats so its my point  suppose the fellow goes to work without you  it looks as if hed learned enough to make him dangerous  he can do nothing  let him trump up any plausible theory he likes it wont stand for a moment after i deny it  true said harding gravely  but if you were out of the way hed have a free hand  since you wouldnt join him youre a serious obstacle  blake laughed  im glad i am and as i come of a healthy stock theres reason to believe ill continue one  harding said nothing more and they went on in silence through the gathering darkness  the spruces were losing shape and getting blacker though through openings here and there they could see a faint line of smoky red on the horizon  a cold wind wailed among the branches and the thud of the tired horses feet rang dully among the shadowy trunks at length reaching a strip of higher ground the men pitched camp and turned out the hobbled horses to graze among the swamp grass that lined a muskeg  after supper they sat beside their fire and by and by benson took his pipe from his mouth  ive had enough of this and im only a drag on you he said  give me grub enough to see me through and ill start back for the settlement first thing in the morning  dont be a fool blake said sharply  youll get harder and feel the march less every day  are you willing to let clarke get hold of you again  i dont want to go  im driven i cant help myself  blake felt sorry for him  he imagined that benson had made a hard fight but he was being beaten by his craving  still it seemed unwise to show any sympathy  you want to wallow like a hog for two or three days that youll regret all your life he said  you have your chance of breaking free now be a man and take it  hold out a little longer and youll find it easier  benson regarded him with a mocking smile  im inclined to think the jag you so feelingly allude to will last a week that is if i can raise dollars enough from clarke to keep it up  you maynt understand that im willing to barter all my future for it  yes said harding grimly we understand all right  yours is not a singular case the trouble is that its too common  but well quit talking about it  you cant go  he was in no mood to handle the subject delicately they were alone in the wilds and the situation made for candour  there was only one way in which they could help the man and he meant to take it  benson turned to him angrily  your permissions not required im a free man  are you harding asked  it strikes me as a very curious boast improving the occasions a riling thing but there was never a slave in dixie tighter bound than you  thats an impertinence benson rejoined flushing as unsatisfied longing drove him to fury  what business is it of yours to preach to me  confound you who are you  i tell you i wont have it  give me food enough to last until i reach sweetwater and let me go  as he spoke a haughty ring crept into his voice and blake was moved to compassion because he recognized it and found it ludicrous  benson who would not have used that tone in his normal state belonged by right of birth to a ruling caste and no doubt felt that he had been treated with indignity by a man of lower station  harding however answered quietly  i am a paint factory drummer who has never had the opportunities you have enjoyed but so long as were up here in the wilds the only thing that counts is that were men with the same weaknesses and feelings because thats so and youre hard up against it i and my partner mean to see you through  you cant unless im willing  man dont you realize that talkings of no use  the thing im driven by wont yield to words  whats more to the purpose i didnt engage to go all the way with you  now ive had enough im going back to the settlement  very well  you were right in claiming that there was no engagement of any kind  so far we have found you in grub but were not bound to do so and if you leave us you must shift for yourself  harding addressed blake who sat nearest the provisions  youll see that your friend doesnt touch those stores  there was silence for a moment or two and benson whose face was marked with baffled desire and scarcely controlled fury glared at the others  blakes expression was pitiful but his lips were resolutely set hardings eyes were very keen and determined  then benson made a sign of resignation  it looks as if i were beaten  i may as well go to sleep  he wrapped his blanket round him and lay down near the fire and soon afterwards the others crept into the tent  benson would be warm enough where he lay and they felt it a relief to get away from him  day was breaking when blake rose and threw fresh wood on the fire and as a bright flame leaped up driving back the shadows he saw that benson was missing  this however did not disturb him because the man had been restless and they had now and then heard him moving about at night  when the fire had burned up and he filled the kettle without his seeing anything of his friend he began to grow anxious and called loudly  there was no answer and he could hear no movement in the bush  the dark spruces had grown sharper in form he could see some distance between the trunks but everything was still  then harding came out of the tent  you had better look if the horses are there he suggested  blake failed to find them near the muskeg but as the light got clearer he saw tracks leading through the bush  following these for a distance he came upon the indian pony still hobbled but the other a powerful range horse had gone  mounting the pony he rode back to camp where he found harding looking grave  the fellows gone and taken some provisions with him he said  he left this for us  it was a strip of paper apparently torn from a pocketbook with a few lines written on it  benson said he regretted having to leave them in such an unceremonious fashion but they had given him no choice and added that he would leave the horse hobbled at a spot about two days ride away  he seems to think hes showing us some consideration in not riding the beast down to the settlement blake remarked with a dubious smile feeling strongly annoyed with himself for not taking more precautions with the cunning which the lust for drink breeds in its victims benson had outwitted him by feigning acquiescence  anyhow he added ill have to go after him  we must have the horse for one thing but i suppose well lose four days  this is rough on you  yes agreed harding you must get after him but dont mind about me  the mans a friend of yours and i like him he wasnt quite responsible last night  i wouldnt feel happy if we let him fall back into the clutches of that cunning brute  now well get breakfast youll need it  they made a hasty meal and during it blake said if you dont mind waiting ill follow him half way to sweetwater if necessary  you see i havent much expectation of overtaking him before he leaves the horse  its the faster beast and we dont know when he started  thats so said harding  still youre tough and i guess the first hard days ride will be enough for your partner  five minutes later blake was picking his way as fast as possible through the wood  it was a cool morning and when he had gone a few miles the ground was fairly clear  by noon he was in more open country where there were long stretches of grass and after a short rest he pushed on fast  bright sunshine flooded the waste that now stretched back to the south sprinkled with clumps of bush that showed a shadowy blue in the distance  in those he passed the birch and poplar leaves glowed in flecks of vivid lemon among the white stems but blake rode hard his eyes turned steadily on the misty skyline  it was only broken by clusters of small trees nothing moved on the wilderness he pushed across  he felt tired when evening came but he must find water before he camped and he pressed on  benson was a weak fool who would no doubt give them further trouble but they had taken him in hand and blake had made up his mind to save him from the rogue who preyed upon his failings  it was getting late when he saw a faint trail of smoke curl up against the sky from a distant bluff and on approaching it he checked the jaded pony  later he dismounted and picketing the animal moved cautiously round the edge of the wood  passing a projecting tongue of smaller brush he saw as he had expected benson sitting beside a fire and stopped a moment to watch him  the mans face was weary his pose was slack and it was obvious that the life he had led had unfitted him for a long hard ride  he looked forlorn and dejected but he started as blake moved forward and his eyes had an angry gleam  so you have overtaken me i thought myself safe from you he said  you were wrong blake replied  if it had been needful id have gone after you to clarkes  but im hungry and ill cook my supper at your fire  he glanced at the provisions scattered about  you havent had much of a meal  its a long drink i want said benson looking steadily at him  blake who let this pass prepared his supper and offered the other a portion  try some of that he said indicating the light flapjacks fizzling among the pork in the fryingpan  it strikes me as a good deal more tempting than the stuff you have been eating  benson thrust the food aside and blake finished it before he took out his pipe  now he said you can go to sleep when you wish  i expect youre tired and its a long ride back to camp  you seem to count upon my going back with you benson remarked mockingly  i do dont you mean to come  do you suppose its likely after ive ridden all this way  blake laid down his pipe and looked hard at the man  you force me to take a line im not cut out for  think a moment  you have land and stock worth a good deal of money which my partner believes can be saved from the rogue whos stealing it from you  you are a young man and if you pull yourself together and pay off his claims you can sell out and look for another opening wherever you like but you know what will happen if you go on as you are doing a year or two longer  have you no friends and relatives in england you owe something to  is your life worth nothing that youre willing to throw it away  its all true benson admitted moodily  do you think i cant see where im drifting  the trouble is that ive gone too far to stop  try said blake  its very well worth while  benson was silent for a few moments and then looked up with a curious expression  youre wasting time dick  ive sunk too far  go back in the morning and leave me to my fate  when i go back you are coming with me  bensons nerves were on edge and his selfcontrol broke down confound you he cried let me alone  you have reached the limit once for all ill stand no more meddling  very well blake answered quietly you have left me only one recourse and you cant blame me for taking it  whats that  superior strength  youre a heavier man than i am and ought to be a match for me but you have lost your nerve and grown soft and flabby with drink  its your own doing and now you have to take the consequences  if you compel me ill drag you back to camp with the pack lariat  do you mean that  bensons face grew flushed and his eyes glittered  try me and see  savage as he was benson realized that his companion was capable of making his promise good  the man looked hard and very muscular and his expression was determined  this is insufferable he cried  blake coolly filled his pipe  theres no other remedy  before i go to sleep ill picket the horses close beside me and if you steal away on foot during the night ill ride you down a few hours after daybreak  i think you understand me and theres nothing more to be said  he tried to talk about other matters and found it hard for benson tormented by his craving made no response  darkness crept in about them and the prairie grew shadowy  the leaves in the bluff rustled in a faint cold wind and the smoke of the fire drifted round the men for a while benson sat moodily watching his companion and then wrapping his blanket round him lay down and turned away his head  it was now very dark outside the flickering light of the fire and by and by blake who felt the strain of the situation strolled towards the horses and chose a restingplace beside their pickets  waking in the cold of daybreak he saw benson asleep and made breakfast before he called him  they ate in silence and then blake led up the pony  i think well make a start he said as cheerfully as he could  for a moment or two benson hesitated standing with hands clenched and baffled desire in his face but blake looked coolly resolute and he mounted     chapter xi  harding grows suspicious  benson gave blake no further trouble and when they rode up to the camp apparently on good terms with one another harding made no reference to what had occurred  he greeted them pleasantly and soon afterwards they sat down to a meal he had been cooking  when they had finished and lighted their pipes benson said a remark was made the other night which struck me as quite warranted  it was pointed out that i had contributed nothing to the cost of this trip  it was very uncivil of harding to mention it blake answered with a grin  still you see circumstances rather forced him  they did  you might have put it more harshly with truth  but i want to suggest that you let me take a share in your venture  sorry said harding i cant agree to that  benson sat smoking in silence for the next minute or two  then he said i think i understand and cant blame you  you havent much cause for trusting me  i didnt mean harding began but benson stopped him  i know  its my weakness youre afraid of  however you must let me pay my share of the provisions and any transport we may be able to get thats all i insist on now if you feel more confidence in me later i may reopen the other question  he paused and added you are two very good fellows  i think i can promise not to play the fool again  perhaps wed better talk about something else blake suggested  they broke camp early next morning and benson struggled manfully with his craving during the next week or two which they spent in pushing farther into the forest  it was a desolate waste of small stunted trees many of which were dead and stripped of half their branches while wide belts had been scarred by fire  harding found the unvarying sombre green of the needles strangely monotonous but the ground was comparatively clear and the party made progress until at length when the country grew more broken they fell in with three returning prospectors  if youll trade your horses we might make a deal said one when they camped together  you cant take them much fartherthe countrys too roughand we could sell out to one of the farmers near the settlements  blake was glad to come to terms and afterwards another of the men said weve been out two months on a general prospecting trip  its the toughest country to get through i ever struck  his worn and ragged appearance bore this out and harding asked are there minerals up yonder  were not in that line its a forest product were looking for  we found indications of gold copper and one or two other metals besides petroleum but didnt see anything that looked worth taking up considering the cost of transport you want to strike it pretty rich before what you find will pay as a business proposition  so i should imagine  petroleums a cheap product to handle when youre a long way from a market isnt it  give us plenty of it and well make a market  its an idea of mine that theres no part of this country that hasnt something worth working in it if you can get cheap fuel  where the lands too poor for farming you often find minerals and ore that wont pay for transport can be reduced on the spot so long as you have natural resources that can be turned into power  with an oil well in good flow wed soon start some profitable industry and put up a city that would bring a railroad in  show our business men a good opening and youll get the dollars while there are folks across the frontier who have a mighty keen scent for oil  have you done much prospecting harding asked  the other smiled  whenever i can get dollars enough for an outfit i go off on the trail  theres a fascination in the thing that gets hold of youyou cant tell what you may strike and the prizes are big however i allow that after seven or eight years of it im poorer than when i started at the game  blake made a sign of comprehension  he knew the sanguine nature of the westerner and his belief in the richness of his country and he had felt the call of the wilderness  there was in truth a fascination in the silent waste that drew the adventurous into its rugged fastnesses and that a number of them did not come back seldom deterred the others  we want to get as far north as the timber limit if we can he said i understand there are no hudsons bay factories near our line but we were told we might find some stony indians  theres one bunch of them the prospector replied  they ramble about after fish and furs but theyve a kind of basecamp where a few generally stop  theyre a mean crowd and often short of food but if theyve been lucky you might get supplies  now and then they put up a lot of dried fish and kill some caribou  he told blake roughly where the indian encampment lay and after talking for a while they went to sleep  next morning the prospectors who took the horses started for the south while blakes party pushed on north with loads that severely tried their strength  after a few days laborious march they reached a stream and found a few indians who were willing to take them some distance down it  it was a relief to get rid of the heavy packs and rest while the canoe glided smoothly through the straggling forest and the labour of hauling her across the numerous portages was light compared with the toil of the march blake however had misgivings they were making swift progress northwards but it would be different when they came back  rivers and lakes would be frozen then which might make travelling easier if they could pick up the hand sledges they had cached but there was a limit to the provisions they could transport and unless fresh supplies could be obtained they would have a long distance to traverse on scanty rations in the rigours of the arctic winter  after a day or two the indians who were going no farther landed them and they entered a belt of very broken country across which they must push to reach a larger stream  the ground was rocky pierced by ravines and covered with clumps of small trees  there were stony tracts they painfully picked their way across steep ridges to be clambered over and belts of quaggy muskeg they must skirt and the days march grew rapidly shorter  benson however gave them no trouble the man was getting hard and was generally cheerful while when he had an occasional fit of moroseness as he fought with the longing that tormented him they left him alone  still at times they were daunted by the rugged sternness of the region they were steadily pushing through and the thought of the long return journey troubled them  one night when it was raining they sat beside their fire in a desolate gorge  a cold wind swept between the thin spruce trunks that loomed vaguely out of the surrounding gloom as the red glare leaped up and wisps of acrid smoke drifted about the camp  there was a lake up the hollow and now and then the wild and mournful cry of a loon rang out the men were tired and somewhat dejected as they sat about the blaze with their damp blankets round them but by and by blake who had been feeling drowsy looked up  what was that he asked  the others could hear nothing but the sound of running water and the wail of the wind  since leaving the indians they had seen no sign of life and believed they were crossing uninhabited wilds  blake could not tell what had suddenly roused his attention but in former days he had developed his perceptive faculties by close night watching on the indian frontier where any relaxing of his vigilance might have cost his life  something he thought was moving in the bush and he felt uneasy  then he rose as a stick cracked and harding called out as a shadowy figure appeared on the edge of the light  blake laughed but his uneasiness did not desert him when he recognized clarke  the fellow was not to be trusted and had come upon them in a startling manner  moving coolly forward he sat down by the fire  i suppose you were surprised to see me he remarked  thats so harding answered and added nothing further while benson whose face wore a curious strained expression did not speak  well said clarke who filled his pipe i daresay i made a rather dramatic entrance falling upon you so to speak out of the dark  ive a suspicion that you enjoy that kind of thing harding rejoined youre a man with the dramatic feeling guess you find it useful now and then  clarkes eyes twinkled but it was not with wholesome humour  they were keen but he looked old and forbidding as he sat with the smoke blowing about him and the ruddy firelight on his face  theres some truth in your remark and i take it as a compliment but my arrivals easily explained  i saw your fire in the distance and curiosity brought me along  what are you doing up here  going on a visit to my friends the stonies  though its a long way i look them up now and then  from what ive heard of them they dont seem a very attractive lot blake interposed  but we havent offered you any supper  benson you might put on the fryingpan  no thanks said clarke  im camped with two halfbreeds a little way back  the stonies as you remark are not a polished set but were on pretty good terms and its their primitiveness that makes them interesting  you can learn things civilized folk dont know much about from these people  in my opinion its knowledge thats not worth much to a white man harding remarked contemptuously  guess you mean the secrets of their medicinemen  what isnt gross superstition is trickery  there you are wrong  they have some tricks rather clever ones though thats not unusual with the professors of a more advanced occultism but living as they do in direct contact with nature in her most savage mood they have found clues to things that we regard as mysteries  anyhow they have discovered a few effective remedies that arent generally known yet to medical science  he spoke with some warmth and had the look of a genuine enthusiast but harding laughed  medical science hasnt much to say in favour of hoodoo practices so far as i know  but i understand you are a doctor  i was pretty well known in london  then said harding bluntly what brought you to sweetwater  if you havent heard i may as well tell you because the thing isnt a secret at the settlement  clarke turned and his eyes rested on blake  im by no means the only man who has come to canada under a cloud  there was a famous policecourt affair i figured in and though nothing was proved against me my practice afterwards fell to bits  as a matter of fact i was absolutely innocent of the offence i was charged with  i had acted without much caution out of pity and laid myself open to an attack that was meant to cover the escape of the real criminal  blake who thought he spoke the truth felt some sympathy but clarke went on in a few weeks i was without patients or friends driven out from the profession i loved and in which i was beginning to make my mark  it was a blow i never altogether recovered from and the generous impulse which got me into trouble was the last i yielded to  his face changed growing hard and malevolent and blake now felt strangely repelled  it looked as if the man had been soured by his misfortunes and turned into an outlaw who found a vindictive pleasure in making such reprisals as he found possible upon society at large this conclusion was borne out by what blake had learned at the settlement  nobody made any comment and there was silence for a few minutes while the smoke whirled about the group and the drips from the dark boughs above fell upon the brands  then clarke asked benson a question or two and afterwards talked casually with the others until he rose to go  i shall start at daybreak and your way lies to the east of mine he said  youll find travelling easier when the snow comes i wish you good luck  though the loneliness of the wilds had now and then weighed upon them they felt relieved when he left and soon afterwards benson went to sleep but blake and harding continued talking for a time  thats a man i have no use for the american remarked  i suppose it struck you that he made no attempt to get your friend back  i noticed it  he may have thought it wouldnt succeed and didnt wish to show his hand  benson already looks a different man i saw the fellow studying him  he could have drawn him away by the sight of a whisky flask or a hint of a jag in camp  my opinion is that he didnt want him  thats curious said blake  he seems to have stuck to benson pretty closely no doubt with the object of fleecing him and you think hes not altogether ruined yet  if what he told me is correct there are still some pickings left on him  i dont suppose the explanation is that clarke has some conscience and feels he has robbed him enough  harding laughed  he has as much pity as a hungry wolf in fact to my mind hes the more dangerous brute because ive a feeling that he delights in doing harm  theres something cruel about the man getting fired out of his profession must have warped his nature  then there was another point that struck me whys he going so far to stay with those indians  its puzzling blake said thoughtfully  he hinted that he was interested in their superstitions and i think there was some truth in it  meddling with these things seems to have a fascination for neurotic people and as the fellows a sensualist he may find some form of indulgence that wouldnt be tolerated near the settlements  all this however doesnt quite seem to account for the thing  ive another idea said harding  clarkes known as a crank and takes advantage of it to cover his doings  at first i thought of the whisky trade but taking up prohibited liquor would hardly be worth his while though i daresay he has some with him to be used for gaining his indian friends good will  hes on the trail of something and its probably minerals  what the prospector told us suggested it to me  you may be right  anyway it doesnt seem to concern us  well said harding gravely im troubled about his leaving benson alone when one could have understood his trying to take him away  the fellow had some good reasoni wish i knew  he rose to throw more wood upon the fire and they changed the subject     chapter xii  the muskeg  it was a fortnight later when the party entered a hollow between two low ranges  the hills receded as they progressed the basin widened and grew more difficult to traverse for the ground was boggy and thickly covered with small rotting pines  every here and there some had fallen and lay in horrible tangles among pools of mire  a sluggish creek wound through the hollow and the men had often to cross it while as they plodded through the morass they found their loads intolerably heavy  still clarkes directions had plainly indicated this valley as their road and they stubbornly pushed on camping where they could find a dry spot  they were generally wet to the waist and their temper began to give way under the strain while blake was annoyed to find his sleep disturbed when he lay down in damp clothes beside the fire at nights  sometimes he was too hot and sometimes he lay awake shivering for hours  he had however suffered from malarial fever in india without having it badly and supposed that it had again attacked him now that he was feeling the hardships of the march  saying nothing to his companions he patiently trudged on though his head throbbed and he was conscious of a depressing weakness and the ground grew softer as they proceeded the creek no longer kept within its banks but spread in shallow pools the rotting trees were giving place to tall grass and reeds  the valley had turned into a very wet muskeg but after making one or two attempts they failed to find a better road among the hills that shut it in  the rocky sides of the knolls were seamed by ravines and covered with banks of stones and short brush through which it was very difficult to force a passage  then one day blake who felt his head reel staggered and sat down heavily  im sorry i cant keep on my feet he said  think its malaria ive got  for a moment or two his companions gazed at him in dismay  his face was flushed his eyes glittered and moving feebly he sank further down with his back against a stone  he looked seriously ill but harding realizing that the situation must be grappled with resolutely pulled himself together  you cant lie there the grounds too wet he said  its drier on yonder hummock and well have to get you across to it  if you can stand up and lean on us well fix you comfortably in camp in a few minutes  when blake had shakily risen they unstrapped his pack and afterwards with much trouble helped him to reach a small stony knoll where they made a fire and spread their blankets on a bundle of reeds for him to lie on  thanks he said in a listless voice  i found it hard to keep my eyes open all morning and now i think ill go to sleep  ill no doubt feel better tomorrow  by and by he fell asleep but his rest was broken for he moved his limbs and muttered now and then  it was a heavy grey afternoon with a cold wind rippling the leaden pools and rustling the reeds and the watchers felt dejected and alarmed  neither had any medical knowledge and they were a very long way from the settlements  rocky hillsides and wet muskegs which they could not cross with a sick companion shut them off from all help their provisions were not plentiful and the rigorous winter would soon set in  they scarcely spoke to one another as the afternoon wore away but when supper time came harding roused blake and tried to give him a little food  he could not eat however and soon sank into restless sleep again and his companions sat disconsolately beside the fire as night closed in  their clothes were damp and splashed with mud for they had to cross a patch of very soft muskeg to gather wood among a clump of rotting spruces  the wind was searching the reeds clashed and rustled drearily and they could hear the splash of the ripples on a neighbouring pool it was all depressing and as in turn they kept watch in the darkness their hearts sank  next morning blake who made an attempt to get up was obviously worse and though he insisted irritably that he would be all right again in a day or two the others felt dubious  how often must i tell you that the thing will wear off he said you neednt look so glum  i thought i was looking pretty cheerful harding objected with a forced laugh  anyway ive been working off my best stories for the last hour and i really think that one about the cincinnati man  its located in half a dozen different places blake rejoined  you overdo the thing and the way benson grins at your threadbare jokes would worry me if i were well  do you suppose im a fool and dont know what you think  he raised himself on his elbow speaking angrily  try to understand that this is merely common malaria ive had it several times and it seldom bothers you much when youre out of the tropics  why bertramyouve seen my cousinwas down with it a week at sandymere temperature very high old fool of a family doctor looking serious and fussing  then he got up all right one morning and rode to hounds next day  very good fellow bertram sos his father if anybody speaks against my cousin let him look out for me  he paused and resumed with a vacant air getting off the subject wasnt i  cant think with this pain in my head and back but dont worry  leave me alone ill soon be on my feet again  lying down he turned away from them and they exchanged glances for it looked as if their comrades brain were getting clouded  blake who dozed part of the time said nothing during the next few hours and late in the afternoon an indian reached the camp  he carried a dirty blue blanket and a few skins and was dressed in ragged white mens clothes  in a few words of broken english he made them understand that he was tired and short of food and they gave him a meal  when he had finished it they fell into conversation and benson who understood him best told harding that he had been trapping in the neighbourhood  his tribe lived some distance off and though there were some stonies not far away he would not go to them for supplies  they were he said quarrelsome people  harding looked interested when he heard this and made benson ask exactly where the stony village lay and when he had been told he lighted his pipe and said nothing for the next half hour  rain had begun to fall and though they had built a rude shelter of earth and stones to keep off the wind in place of the tent which had been abandoned to save weight the raw damp seemed to reach their bones  it was not the place to nurse a fever patient in and harding was getting anxious  he had led his comrade into the adventure and felt responsible for him moreover he had a strong affection for the helpless man  blake was very ill and something must be done to save him but for a time harding could not see how help could be obtained then an idea crept into his mind and he got benson to ask the indian a few more questions about the locality  when they were answered he began to see his way but he waited until supper was over before he spoke of his plan  it was getting dark and raining hard blake was asleep the indian sitting silent and the fire crackled noisily throwing up a wavering light against the surrounding gloom  i suppose i neednt consider you a friend of clarkes harding remarked  theres no reason why i should feel grateful to him though i cant blame him for all my misfortunes benson replied  that clears the ground  well it must have struck you that the fellows account of the whereabouts of the stony camp doesnt agree with what the prospectors and this indian told us  he fixed the locality further west and a good deal farther off from where we are now  looks as if he didnt want us to reach the place  hes a scheming brute but i cant see his object in deceiving us  well leave that point for a minute  you must allow its curious that when we asked him for the easiest way he sent us through these hills and muskegs particularly as you have learned from the indian that we could have got north with much less trouble had we headed further west  if thats true it has an ugly look benson answered thoughtfully  very well im going to put the thing before you as i see it  clarke has lent you money and has a claim on your homestead which will increase in value as the settlement grows while sooner or later theyll bring a railroad in  now after what you once told me i dont think theres any reason why you shouldnt pay him off in a year or two if you keep steady and work hard but while you were in his clutches that looked very far from probable  you might have put it more plainlyi was drinking myself to death bensons face grew stern  you suggest that this is what the fellow wished  you can form your own opinion  my point is that it would suit him if you didnt come back from this trip  with nobody to dispute his statements hed prove he had a claim to all you own  benson started  i believe he would stick at nothing you may be right  but im only one of the party what would he gain if you and blake came to grief  that said harding is not so clear  he glanced at his companion searchingly and seeing that he suspected nothing decided not to enlighten him  benson seemed to have overcome his craving but there was a possibility that he might relapse upon his return to the settlement and betray the secret in his cups  harding thought clarke a dangerous man of unusual ability and abnormal character  he had learned from benson something of blakes history and had seen a chance of extorting money from colonel challoner  indeed clarke had made overtures to blake on the subject with the pretext of wishing to ascertain whether the latter was willing to seek redress and had met with an indignant rebuff  this much was a matter of fact but harding surmised that the man finding blake more inclined to thwart than assist him would be glad to get rid of him  with blake out of the way the challoners father and son would be at his mercy and it unfortunately looked as if his wishes might be gratified harding however meant to make a determined effort to save his comrade  i dont understand what youre leading up to benson remarked  its thisi suspect clarke intended us to get entangled among these muskegs where wed have no chance of renewing our provisions and misled us about the stony village which he didnt wish us to reach well he has succeeded in getting us into trouble and now he has to help us out  the fellow is a doctor  benson looked up eagerly  youre going to bring him here  its a daring plan because it will be difficult to make him come  hell come if he values his life said harding drily  the indian will take me to the village and perhaps see me through if i offer him enough he seems to have some grudge against the stonies  ill have to drop in upon the doctor late at night when none of his indian friends are about  but wholl look after blake  he cant be left  thats your part  youd run more risk than i would and im his partner  id hate to stay benson protested and added with feeling you know how im indebted to blake  its your place said harding  now you had better try to arrange the thing with the indian  it took some time but the man proved amenable  he frankly owned that he would not have ventured near the stony camp alone and hinted at some quarrel between its inhabitants and his tribe originating benson gathered over a dispute about trapping grounds but he was ready to accompany the white man if the latter went well armed  thats fixed we start at daybreak said harding  ill lie down now its your watch  five minutes later he was sound asleep and awoke quietly determined and ready for the march in the cold of dawn  he was a man of the cities bred to civilized life and had a just appreciation of the risks he ran since he meant to abduct the doctor who was dangerous to meddle with from an indian village where he was apparently held in some esteem  the stonies living far remote had so harding understood escaped the chastening influence of an occasional visit from the patrols of the northwest police  moreover there was a possibility that clarke might prove too clever for him  it was certainly a strange adventure for a business man but he believed that blake would perish unless help was obtained  he shook hands with benson who wished him a sincere goodluck and then with the indian leading struck out through the muskeg towards the shadowy hills     chapter xiii  clarkes summons  harding who knew there was no time to lose had cause to remember the forced march he made to the stony village  the light was faint and the low ground streaked with haze as they floundered through the muskeg sinking deep in the softer spots and splashing through shallow pools when they reached the first hill bench he was hot and breathless and their path led sharply upwards over banks of ragged stones which had a trick of slipping down when they trod on them  it was worse where they were large and he stumbled into the hollows between  then they struggled through short pinescrub crawled up a wet gorge where thick willows grew and afterwards got entangled among thickets of thorny canes  hardings clothes were badly torn and his boots giving out his breath was laboured and his heart beat painfully but he pressed on upwards without slackening his pace  it was exhausting toil and until he entered the northwest he had undergone no physical training and seldom tried his muscles being left to shift for himself at an unusually early age had prevented his even playing any outdoor games  his career had been a humble one but it had taught him selfreliance and when he was thrown into the company of men brought up in a higher station he was not surprised that they accepted him as an equal and comrade  there was however nothing assertive in the man he knew his powers and their limitations  now he clearly recognized that he had undertaken a big thing but the need was urgent and he meant to see it through  he was of essentially practical temperament a man of action and it was necessary that he should keep up with his indian guide as long as possible  therefore he braced himself for the arduous task  in the afternoon they reached a tableland where travelling was slightly easier but when they camped without a fire among the rocks one of hardings feet was bleeding and he was very weary  walking was painful for the first hour after they started again at dawn but by and by his galled foot troubled him less and he doggedly followed the indian up and down deep ravines and over rough stony slopes  then they reached stunted timber thicklymassed tangled pines with many dead trees among them and a number which had fallen barring the way  the indian seemed tireless harding could imagine his muscles having been toughened into something different from ordinary flesh and blood  he was feeling distress but for the present there was only one thing for him to do and that was to march  he saw it clearly with his shrewd sense and though his wornout body revolted his resolution did not flinch  they forced a way through thickets they skirted precipitous rocks passed clusters of ragged pines and plunged down ravines  in the afternoon the sun was hot and when it got low a cold wind buffeted them as they crossed the height of land but although hardings side ached as well as his bleeding feet the march went on  then just before dark he had a glimpse of a wide valley fading into the blue distance with water shining in its midst and grey blurs of willows here and there  the prospect however faded swiftly from his sight and he found himself limping across a stony ridge into a belt of drifting mist  half an hour afterwards he threw himself down exhausted beside a fire in a sheltered hollow  late at night they stopped a few minutes to listen and look about on the outskirts of the indian village  thick willows stretched close up to it with mist that moved before a light wind drifting past them and the blurred shapes of conical tepees showed dimly through the vapour the night was dark but still and harding thought a sound would carry some distance but while he felt his heart beating there was nothing to be heard  he had seen dogs about the indian encampments farther south and was horribly afraid of hearing a warning bark but nothing broke the silence and he supposed that clarkes friends were unable to find food enough for sledgeteams  this was reassuring because the odds against him were heavy enough knowing as he did that the indians sense of hearing is remarkably keen  feeling that his magazine pistol was loose he signed to his guide and they moved cautiously forward  the ground was fortunately clear and their footsteps made little noise though now and then tufts of dry grass which harding trod upon rustled with what seemed to him alarming distinctness  still nobody challenged them and reaching the centre of the village they stopped again  the nearest of the tepees was only thirty or forty yards away though others ran back into the mist and as harding stood listening with tingling nerves he clearly recognized the difficulty of his enterprise  in the first place there was nothing to indicate which tent clarke occupied and it was highly undesirable that harding should choose the wrong one and rouse an indian from his slumbers  then it was possible that the man shared a tepee with some of his hosts in which case harding would place himself at his mercy by entering it  clarke was a dangerous man and his stony friends were people with rudimentary ideas and barbarous habits harding glanced at his guide but the man stood very still and he could judge nothing about his feelings from his attitude  pulling himself together with an effort harding went on  fortune favoured him for as he made towards a tepee without any particular reason for doing so except that it stood a little apart from the rest he saw a faint streak of light shine out beneath the curtain this suggested that it was occupied by the white man and it was now an important question whether he could reach it silently enough to surprise him  beckoning the indian to fall behind he crept forward with his heart beating painfully and stopped a moment just outside the entrance  it was obvious that he had not been heard but he could not tell whether clarke was alone  then the indian who had crept up behind him dragged the doorway open and harding hastily stepping in stood ragged unkempt and strung up blinking in the unaccustomed light  the tent had an earth floor with a layer of reeds and grass thrown down on one side  it was frail and hinted at changing times and poverty for the original skin cover had been patched and eked out with the products of civilization in the shape of cotton flour bags and old sacking  in the later repairs sewing twine had been used instead of sinews  a wooden case stood open near the reeds and harding saw that it contained glass jars and what looked like laboratory apparatus a common tin kerosene lamp hung from the junction of the frame poles which met at the point of the cone  a curious smell which reminded him of the paint factory filled the tent though he could not recognize it  harding could not tell whether he noted all this at once or if it afterwards impressed itself upon him by degrees because as he entered clarke who sat beside the case looked up  it was harding thought a good test of his nerve but his face was imperturbable and he showed no surprise  there was silence for a moment or two while the indian stood motionless with his axe shining as it caught the light and hardings lips grew firmly set  then clarke spoke  so you have turned back  you found the muskeg too difficult to cross and i suppose this fellow showed you the way here  harding who was worn out crossed the floor to the heap of reeds and sat down facing clarke  we have come for you and must start at once  my partner is very sickfever he thinksand youll have to cure him  youre presuming on my consent  yes said harding sternly im counting right on that  it wouldnt be wise of you to refuse  i dont agree with you  a shout or a shot would bring in my friends and youd find yourself in a very unpleasant position  you had better understand that the northwest police have never visited this place and nobody troubles about what goes on up here while i believe im a person of some influence  he indicated hardings guide  then though i dont know what hes doing in this neighbourhood this fellow belongs to a tribe the stonies have a grudge against  on the whole i think you have been very rash  i guess youre clever enough to see that since ive taken some chances in coming im not likely to be bluffed off now  but well let that go the most important thing is that blake will die unless he gets proper treatment  clarke regarded him with a mocking smile  its a matter of indifference to me whether blake dies or not  no said harding i allow it isnt quite so  on the whole you would sooner he did die  hes in the way  he could not tell whether this shot had reached the mark for though clarkes eyes were steadily fixed on him the mans face was inscrutable  if youre right its strange you should urge me to prescribe for him  there are some precautions i mean to take said harding drily however i havent come here to argue  for reasons of your own you sent us into a belt of country which you thought we couldnt get through  my notion is that you expected us to be held up there until our stores ran out and winter set in when these stonies would no doubt have moved on  well part of what you wished has happened but the matter is taking a turn you couldnt have looked for  you led us into difficulties and now youre going to get us out  i guess delay means dangerget ready to start  then the indian raised his hand in warning  footsteps approached the tepee with something strangely stealthy in their tread and clarke turning his head listened with a curious expression  then he looked at harding and as the steps drew nearer the americans lips set tight his pose grew tense but it was more expressive of determination than alarm  for a few moments none of the party moved and then the attitude of all relaxed as the footsteps passed and grew indistinct  clarke broke into a faint smile  that was not an ordinary stony but a gentleman of my profession with similar interests going about his business  there are reasons why he should undertake it in the dark  you were right in supposing that you were in some danger  harding felt a shiver  he had the repugnance of the healthyminded man of affairs from any form of meddling with what he vaguely thought of as the occult but in that remote grim solitude he could not scoff at it  understand this he said curtly  i mean to save my partner i staked my life on doing so and since i guess youre not ready to go so far as that ive a pretty strong pull on you  but ive said enough youre coming with menowand if you make any attempt to rouse your friends youll have a chance of learning something about the other world at first hand a few seconds afterwards  clarke saw that it was not an idle threat  the american meant what he said and he hurriedly put a few things together and made them into a pack  then he turned to harding with a gesture of ironical resignation  im ready  the indian laid a firm hand on his arm and harding who took out his pistol extinguished the lamp  your interest in keeping quiet is as strong as mine he sternly reminded clarke  he set his teeth as they passed a tepee at a few yards distance  he could see the dark gap of the doorway and had a nervous fancy that eyes were following his movements for now he had succeeded in the more difficult part of his errand he was conscious of strain  indeed he feared he was getting shaky and the danger was not yet over  they were not clear of the village and a noisy stumble would bring the indians out  unless they reached camp in the next few days he thought blake would die and the journey was a long and arduous one  still he was determined that if disaster overtook him the plotter who had betrayed them should not escape  harding was a respecter of law and social conventions but now he had suddenly become primitive under heavy stress  they passed the tepee unnoticed but the tension he felt did not slacken because there was another they could not avoid  nobody however called to them and he felt easier as they drew away from the row of shadowy tents  then moving very cautiously they reached the thick willow bluff where they were comparatively safe and harding who found it hard to hold himself in hand feared that he might grow limp with the reaction  difficult as his task had looked it had been successfully carried out  get on he said to clarke and walking faster they plunged into the open waste     chapter xiv  the cure  it was noon when harding returned to camp ragged and exhausted with clarke limping after him in an even more pitiable state  the latter had suffered badly from the hurried march but his conductor would brook no delay and the grim hints he had been given encouraged him to the utmost exertion he was capable of  blake was alive but when harding bent over him he feared that help had come too late  his skin looked harsh and dry his face had grown hollow and his thick strong hair had turned lank and was falling out  his eyes were vacant and unrecognizing when he turned them upon harding  heres your patient the american said to clarke  we expect you to cure him and you had better get to work at once  then his face grew troubled as he asked benson how long has he been like that  the last two days said benson  im afraid hes very bad  harding sat down with a smothered groan  every muscle seemed to ache he could scarcely hold himself upright and his heart was heavy  he would miss blake terribly it was hard to think of going on without him but he feared that this was inevitable  he was filled with a deep pity for the helpless man but after a few moments his weary face grew stern  he had done all that he was able and now clarke whom he believed to be a man of high medical skill must do his part  if he were unsuccessful it would be the worse for him  had you much trouble benson asked as he laid out a meal  no said harding i suppose i was fortunate because the thing was surprisingly easy  of course clarke did not want to come  then i dont see how you overcame his objections  harding broke into a dry smile  in the kind of game i played with the doctor your strength depends upon how much youre willing to lose and i put down all i had upon the table  that beat him because he wasnt willing to stake as much  you mean your life said benson  ive no doubt you were in some danger but was it so serious  it would have been if id shot him and i think he saw i meant that whats more i may have to do so yet  hardings tone was quietly matter of fact but benson no longer wondered at clarkes submission  he had been a soldier and had faced grave risks but he was inclined to think that even before he had weakened it by excess his nerve had never been so good as this city drummers  well he said im fond of blake and recognize my debt to him while we were once comrades in an adventure that was more dangerous than this but im not sure that id have been ready to go as far as you in a way though you were quite justified the fellow no doubt set a trap for us but if hes to have a fair chance we had better give him something to eat  if hes as hungry as you are he needs it  he called clarke who had been busy examining blake to join them by the fire  weariness had deepened the lines on the doctors face and there were puffy pouches under his eyes  he was obviously exhausted and scarcely able to move but there was something malignant in his look  he ate greedily without speaking and then glanced up at the others  well said benson whats your opinion  your friends state is dangerous and he was right in his conclusions about what was the matter with him  how he came to suffer from a severe attack of malaria in this bracing climate i cant determine and after all its not an important point  he cant live much longer at his present temperature  and the remedy  one of two is indicated and the choice is difficult because both are risky  then theyre risky to you as well as to your patient harding grimly reminded him  clarke made a contemptuous gesture which was not without a touch of dignity  his manner was now severely professional  one course would be to put him into the coldest water we can find its drastic treatment and sometimes effective but theres a strong probability of its killing him  you had better mention the other  the administration of a remedy of my own which ill admit few doctors would venture to use  its almost as dangerous as the first course and in case of success recovery is slower  harding pondered this for a moment or two  he distrusted the man and believed he would feel no compunction about poisoning blake should he consider it safe to do so but he thought he had convinced him of the contrary  i must leave you to decide but if the results unfortunate ill hold you responsible he said  if you doubt my professional skill or good faith why do you put your partner in my charge  ive some confidence in your sense of selfinterest harding rejoined  youll serve the latter best by curing blake  after giving him a curious glance clarke got up  ill try the draught and it had better be done now  there is no time to lose  he moved towards blake who lay with halfclosed eyes breathing with apparent difficulty and making feeble restless movements  stooping beside him he took out a very small bottle and after carefully letting a few drops fall into a spoon with some trouble got the sick man to swallow them  then he sat down and turned to harding  i cant predict the result  we must wait an hour then i may be able to form some opinion  harding lighted his pipe and though he found it strangely hard to sit still smoked steadily  his mouth grew dry with the strain he was bearing but he refilled the pipe as it emptied and bit savagely on its stem crushing the wood between his teeth  there was so far as he could see no change in blake and he was stirred by a deep pity and a daunting sense of loneliness  he knew now that he had grown to love the man blakes quick resourcefulness had overcome many of the obstacles they had met with his whimsical humour had lightened the toilsome march and often when they were wet and worn out he had banished their dejection by a jest  now it looked as if they would hear his cheerful laugh no more and harding felt that if the worst came he would in a sense be accountable for his partners death  it was his sanguine expectations that had drawn blake into the wilds  benson who seemed to find the suspense equally trying made no remark and there was nothing to be learned from clarkes impassive face harding could only wait with all the fortitude he could muster but he long remembered that momentous hour  they were all perfectly still there was no wind a heavy grey sky overhung them and the smoke of the fire went straight up  the gurgle of running water came softly through the silence  at length when harding felt the tension becoming unendurable clarke who glanced at his watch reopened the small bottle  well try again he said gravely and harding thought he detected anxiety in his tone  the dose was given and harding feeling the urgent need of action if he were to continue calm got up and wandered about the muskeg  coming back after a time he looked at clarke who merely shook his head though his face now showed signs of uneasiness  harding sat down again and refilled his pipe noticing that the stem was nearly bitten through  he gathered from the doctors expression that they would soon know what to expect and he feared the worst  now however he was growing cool his eyes were very stern and his lips had set in an ominously determined fashion  benson who glanced at him once or twice thought it boded trouble for the doctor if things went badly the american had a ruthless air  at length clarke moving silently but quickly bent over his patient felt his pulse and listened to his breathing and harding leaned eagerly forward  blake seemed less restless his face which had been furrowed was relaxing there was a faint damp on it  he moved and sighed but the sigh was somehow reassuring and then turning his head weakly closed his eyes  a few moments later clarke stood up stretching out his arms with a gesture of deep weariness  i believe your partner has turned the corner he said  he must sleep as long as he is able  harding crept away conscious of a relief so overpowering that he was afraid he might do something foolish and disturb his comrade if he remained  scarcely noticing where he was going he plunged into the swamp and ploughed through it smashing down the reeds and splashing in the pools  quick movement was balm to his rawedged nerves for the suspense of the last two hours had tried him very hard  when he returned to camp rather wet and muddy clarke who made him a sign demanding silence was sitting by his patients side and harding saw that blake was sound asleep  then with a sense of thankfulness too deep for expression he set about preparing the evening meal  now he could eat with appetite  before he and benson had finished their repast clarke joined them and answering a question said i believe the worst dangers over though theres a possibility of a relapse  hell need careful attention for several days  longer i think said harding  anyhow youll have to make up your mind to stop while it strikes us as necessary  my times valuable and you run some risk in keeping me  you must recognize that theres a likelihood of the stonies picking up my trail  if they get here theyll run up against all the trouble theyll have any use for harding rejoined  however i told our guide who seems pretty smart at such matters to take precautions and i understand he fixed things so it would be hard to follow our tracks  you may remember that he took us across all the bare rocks he could find and made us wade up a creek  besides as you seem to have played on your friends superstitions they maynt find anything remarkable in your disappearing mysteriously  youre a capable man clarke told him with an air of resignation anyway i find this case appeals to my professional interest  for one thing its curious that the malaria should attack him in a severe form after a lengthy absence from the tropical jungles where he caught it by the way how long is it since he left india  harding shrewdly returned an evasive answer  he did not think it desirable that clarke should learn too much about his comrades connexion with india  i cant fix the date but its some time  however i understand he was afterwards in an unhealthy part of africa which may account for the thing  i dont think hes been in this country more than a year or two  did he ever speak of having malaria here  it is apt to return within a rather elastic period  not so far as i can recollect said harding  seeing that he could extract no useful information from him clarke abandoned the attempt and discussed the case from a medical point of view  then he said as were not out of the wood yet and i dont expect ill be needed for a while id better get some sleep  you must waken me if theres any sign of a change  drawing his blanket round him he lay down on a bed of branches and reeds and when his deep regular breathing indicated that he was asleep harding looked at benson  i guess hell do all thats possible for his own sake  it strikes me hes a pretty good doctor  i understand he once promised to become a famous one benson replied though i left you to deal with the matter i kept my eye on him and my idea is that while he wouldnt have scrupled much about letting blake die if it had suited his purpose as soon as you showed him the danger of that course his professional feelings came uppermost  in fact i believe blake couldnt have got better treatment in montreal or london  now the fellow has taken his case up hell make a cure  but ill keep the first watch you need a rest  in a few minutes harding was fast asleep and when he relieved benson late at night he found clarke at his post  shortly afterwards blake opened his eyes and asked a few intelligent questions in a weak voice before he went to sleep again  next morning he was obviously improving but although a strong man often recovers rapidly from an attack of malarial fever clarke stayed several days and gave harding a number of careful instructions on parting  i dont think that can do much harm said harding looking him in the face  your suspicions die hard clarke rejoined with a mocking laugh  thats so said harding coolly  as soon as you leave this camp i lose my hold on you  however ive given you the indian as guide and hell see you safe to about a days march from your friends village and ive put up food enough for the journey  considering everything thats all the fee i need offer you  there wouldnt be much use in urging my claim clarke acquiesced  then what about benson  i noticed you didnt seem particularly anxious to renew your acquaintance  are you willing to leave him with us  clarke smiled in an ironical manner  why do you ask when you mean to keep him  so far as im concerned youre welcome to the man i make you a present of him  have you had enough of this trip yet or are you going on  were going ahead you can do what you like about it  and now while i admire the way you pulled my partner through theres not much more to say  i wish you a safe journey and goodmorning  he waved his hand and turned back towards the fire while clarke following the indian moved forward across the muskeg  a week later they broke camp and finding a somewhat better path along the hillside went on by easy stages towards the north     chapter xv  mrs chudleigh finds a clue  on a dark november morning when a blustering wind drove the rain against the windows thomas foster sat stripping the lock of a favourite gun in the room he called his study at hazlehurst in shropshire  the shelves on the handsome panelled walls contained a few works on agriculture horsebreeding and british natural history but two racks were filled with guns and fishing rods and the table foster was seated at had a vice clamped to its edge  he had once had a commodious gunroom but had given it up under pressure from his wife who thought she could make a better use of it since hazlehurst was small and she had numerous guests but the study was his private retreat  a hacksaw a few files a wire brush and a bottle of rangoon oil were spread out in front of him the latter standing for the sake of cleanliness on the cover of the field  foster was a redfaced country gentleman who found his greatest interest in outdoor sports and was characterized by some native shrewdness and a genial but rather abrupt manner  he laid down his tools and looked up with an air of humorous resignation as his wife came in  mrs foster was a slender vivacious woman fond of society  put that greasy thing away for a few minutes and listen to me she said sitting down opposite him  i am listening im inclined to think its my normal state foster answered with a smile  the greasy thing cost forty guineas and i wouldnt trust it to jenkins after young jimmy dropped it in a ditch jenkins can rear pheasants with any keeper ive met but hes no good at a gun  you shouldnt have taken jimmy out hes not strong enough yet  so it seems he gave us some trouble in getting him back to the cart after he collapsed in the wood but it wasnt my fault  he was keen on coming  mrs foster made a sign of agreement  jimmy was her cousin lieutenant walters lately invalided home from india  perhaps you were not so much to blame but that was not what i came to talk about she said  then i suppose you want my approval of some new plans  go ahead with any arrangements you wish to make but as far as possible leave me out  though it was a very wet spring i never saw the pheasants more plentiful glad i stuck to the handrearing though jenkins wanted to leave the birds alone in the higher woods  of course now weve cleared out the vermin  oh never mind his wife broke in  you would talk about such things all day  the question is  it strikes me its  when are we going to have the house to ourselves  though i dont interfere much ive lately felt that im qualifying for a hotelkeeper  you have been unusually patient and im getting rather tired of entertaining people but margaret keith says shed like to come down you dont mind her  not a bit if she doesnt insist on bringing a menagerie  it was cats last time but i hear shes now gone in for wild animals  if she turns up with her collection well probably lose pattinson he had all he could stand on the last occasion  still megs good fun ready to meet you on any ground keen as a razor  but what about mrs chudleigh  is she going  she hasnt mentioned it  in fact i was wondering  whether shed stop if you pressed her  try it and see  anyhow shes not in my way and the place seems to meet with her approval  but whats she after  it cant be young jimmy hes hardly worth powder and shot from her point of view  youre rather coarse but i agree mrs foster answered  jimmys too young and hasnt much beside his pay  his admirations respectfully platonic but its largely on his account i thought of asking her to remain  im grateful to her for amusing the poor fellow because as he cant get about with the others hed have been left a good deal to himself if she hadnt taken him up  shes excellent company when she exerts herself and she talks and reads to him with great goodnature  do what you wish  perhaps i shouldnt have spoken so freely about a friend of yours  i dont know whether i quite consider her a friend or not mrs foster thoughtfully replied  she was staying at mabels when i was there but we didnt become intimate  in fact i think i asked her down because she made me feel she wanted to come  a delicate hint sometimes goes a long way  still theres no doubt she has brightened jimmy up and one feels sorry for him  mrs foster went out and finding her guest asked her to stay on which after a few demurs mrs chudleigh agreed to do and on being left alone smiled in a satisfied manner  she had played her cards cleverly in obtaining a footing at hazlehurst which was a pleasant house to stay at and thought that with good luck she might win the game she had begun  she was a hard and somewhat unscrupulous woman but a tender look crept into her eyes as she thought of the man whose prospects she meant to improve  left a widow at an early age by the death of an elderly angloindian whom she had married under pressure from her parents she had spent some years in social enjoyments before she met sedgwick with whom she fell in love  she was clever enough to recognize his faults but she liked his bold ambitious nature  though he had no private means and she was rich she knew her money would not count for much against the prospects of a brilliant career  the man had real ability and meant to make his mark and in this she was anxious to assist him  she was even willing to defer their marriage until he had had an opportunity of displaying his talents in the administration of the west african territory he had lately returned to and her object was to secure his appointment to the post left vacant by the retirement of his superior  during the evening she sat with lieutenant walters in the conservatory there were other guests at hazlehurst and mrs foster had asked some of her neighbours to join them in an informal dance  coloured lamps hung among the plants throwing a soft light upon clustering blossoms and forcing up delicate foliage in black silhouette  here and there lay belts of shadow out of which came voices and a smell of cigar smoke but near where mrs chudleigh sat screened by a palm a french window opened into the hall  the halflight that fell sideways upon her face suited her for it failed to reveal the hardness of her lips and eyes and made her look gentler  walters who was charmed with her had no suspicion that she had cultivated his society merely because she thought he might prove useful  on hearing what regiment he belonged to she had marked him down for study  im afraid im selfish in keeping you here though i know how goodnatured you are he said by and by  you might have been enjoying yourself instead of letting me bore you  mrs chudleigh gave him a gracious smile  ive lost my enthusiasm for dancing and need a rest now and then  besides i like a talk with interesting people  thats a thing im seldom credited with being  youre making fun of me  far from it she assured him  if you are very modest ill confess that your knowing places and people ive seen in past days enhances the interest  were you long in india  three years  in some respects i was sorry to leave but the doctors decided it would be twelve months before i was fit for work again and i felt very much at a loose end when i got home  i cant dance i cant ride and i mustnt walk far in fact there seems to be nothing that i am allowed to do  id have found my helplessness harder only that you have taken pity on me  but you are getting stronger ive noticed a marked improvement since i came  but we were speaking of india  you were on the northwest frontier were you not  yes he said and looked round as a man passed the window  whos that  ive seen most of lucys neighbours but i dont know him  the man moved into the light and stood gazing towards them absentmindedly as if thinking of something  walters noticed his white hair and thin face the keenness of his blue eyes the firmness of his mouth and the erectness of his figure  that is colonel challoner mrs chudleigh replied  ah said walters i thought i recognized the stamp  foster told me he lived a few miles off but ill have to move on if he comes in here  why mrs chudleigh asked in wellsimulated surprise though she saw the opportunity she had been waiting for was now offered her  i knew his son and nephew served with them in india for a time walters answered with some embarrassment  thats why foster warned me to keep out of challoners way  he seemed to think it would be considerate  challoner passed on and mrs chudleigh fixed her eyes on walters  i see  you must have taken part in a certain unfortunate affair on the frontier in which the hill men get the best of it  the blood crept into walters face but he answered simply i did  it is not a subject one talks about  thats natural one can understand the feelings of the mess but the thing isnt quite a secret and i daresay you break through your reserve now and then  surely you dont refuse your confidence to your friends  her manner was reproachful as though she felt hurt because he could not trust her and he looked confused  i couldnt doubt that anything i said would be safe with you but its a painful subject  besides you obviously know something about the matter  i do but not much  i knew bertram challoner and have met richard blake  then at one time i heard a good deal about the frontier and that makes me curious  she paused and gave him a look he could not resist  i want to know what really happened wont you tell me  you can rely upon my treating it in the strictest confidence  walters felt reluctant but he was grateful to her and flattered by her preference  she was a handsome woman and much sought after but she had often devoted an hour to enlivening his forced idleness when there were more exciting occupations open to her  i couldnt refuse you anything after the way you have helped me through a rather trying time he declared  when one has been pretty active it isnt easy to resign oneself to being laid upon the shelf and you cheered me up when i most needed it  well i was with the expedition and we had shelled an old hill fort to bits and laid a heavy fire on two or three villages with the object of keeping their inhabitants quiet but it hadnt that effect  all their friends came down to help in cutting us off as we went home and im still surprised that they didnt succeed  they sniped our camp every night and had a number of brushes with the rearguard as we hurried back through the hills but it wasnt until we were nearly clear that things got badly threatening and we had to make a stand  i believe the idea was that we must hold our ground until help arrived  but am i boring you  oh no said mrs chudleigh  please dont stop  well we were awkwardly placed in the bottom of a pass but there was a small steep hill that strengthened our position and blake made the trenches  he did it well in the daylight because there was no time to lose with marksmen we couldnt see firing at him from among the rocks  i must say that although they made very good shooting and got several of his men he never flinched  he was not a nervous man was he  one wouldnt have imagined so after seeing him coolly doing his work with the bullets flattening on the stones all round but ill confess i could never understand what happened afterwards  the orders were that the hill must be held at any cost but as our line was long we couldnt send up many men  blake stayed with his few sappers we had a gun from the mule battery and there was challoner myself and two more officers with a handful of native infantry  it was about two in the morning when the fellows made their rush a band of ghazees leading it and ill own that we were all a little overstrung  forced marches on half rations and lying awake night after night expecting an attack are wearing  for all that it was a strong position and though there were not many of them we felt we could trust the men  the hill was hard to climb except by a ravine the gun did not command and blake had laid a mine there  challoner held the ridge immediately above  what is your opinion of bertram challoner  is he a good officer  one of the best  hes what you could call conscientious took his duties seriously and knew more about the scientific side of his business than any of us  in a way that was curious because i imagine that he hadnt much natural aptitude for soldiering and while he was cool in action one felt he had to work himself up to it  nobody doubted his pluck but ive seen him looking rather white after a hot brush  a nervous temperament held well in hand mrs chudleigh suggested but go on im sorry i interrupted you  there was a challenge a yell from the stabbed sentry and the beggars were upon us  no time to think the face of the hill swarmed with them  the gunners only fired one round before they were cut down and the mine did not explode  it was a thick dark night and we were horribly outnumbered but the orders were to hold onwe could send for support if very hard pressed but we mustnt yield a yard of ground it was hot work in front of the trench upon the ridgethey poured into it at one end but for a time we stayed as well  then  walters broke off and looked at his companion with appeal  ive been talking too freely said more than i should have done in fact  you had better admit that you dont find all this interesting  it wouldnt be true mrs chudleigh declared determined not to be put off  im extremely interested and you must keep your promise tell me all you can  he made a gesture of resignation  well there was an order givenin a white mans voiceand the bugle called us off  somebody had ventured to disobey instructions and after that the fight was over we got away as best we could  they rolled over us like a wave as we went downhill and there were not many of us when we reached the bottom then some gurkhas came up and held them a bit with the steel a gun opened and somehow the main camp was saved though our ranks were thin at the next muster  there was an inquiry of course  did you give evidence  i had to said walters ruefully  i confined my answers as much as possible to yes sir and no but one can make a good deal out of these if the questions are judiciously framed  the bugler was killed so they could learn nothing from him but watson was forced to declare that the order came from near the ravine where blake should have fired the mine  after some badgering from the colonel i had to admit that that was my opinion  there were other points against blake and he did not try to clear himself  it was a very bad business and i remember that challoner broke down after his examination  but blake was not cashiered  no to tell the truth i think some influence was at work  colonel challoner was known and respected on the frontier and he had powerful friends though of course that sort of thing is not supposed to count  anyhow the official verdict was not guilty but nobody had much confidence in it and blake had to leave us  in spite of everything i was sorry for the man and felt that he might have made things look better if he had tried  it was very sad said mrs chudleigh  you have my thanks for the story  i can understand that it was painful to tell  then she changed the subject and soon afterwards a man came in and claimed her for a dance     chapter xvi  mrs keith enters the field  a day or two after the dance mrs chudleigh was sitting with lieutenant walters in a recess of the big hall when she heard a car coming up the drive  it stopped a voice she thought familiar rose from the vestibule and her face hardened as foster came in with mrs keith and millicent graham  then mrs foster who did not notice that there was anybody else about moved forward to meet the newcomers and led them through the hall  you looked surprised walters remarked when the others had disappeared  didnt you know these people were coming  i think you meant displeased and you were right said mrs chudleigh who was capable of boldly correcting a mistake  we made such a pleasant friendly party here that i felt the presence of anybody else would be rather a nuisance  she laughed as she went on of course it was a very selfish view to take especially as i know mrs keith and now i recollect mrs foster did say some friends were coming down though she didnt tell me who they were  walters left her by and by but she sat still to think  it was most likely by chance that mrs keith had decided to visit hazlehurst just then but there was a possibility that it was due to design  during their conversation on the canadian river boat she had incautiously mentioned that she was going to shropshire and mrs keith was an intimate friend of the challoners  mrs chudleigh had no wish to be subjected to the keen old womans observation but after all mrs keith had no knowledge of her plans and would accordingly find it difficult to interfere with them  still she must be careful and avoid any cause for suspicion  tea was being brought in when mrs keith and millicent returned to the hall and for a few moments mrs chudleigh sat watching the girl  the house was old and the dark panelling formed a good background for millicents delicate beauty which was of the blonde type  mrs chudleigh had to admit that she was pretty and though she tried to think of her as unformed there was something in her face that hinted at strength of character  foster who was as a rule indifferent to womens society obviously found her interesting for he was talking to her with animation and mrs chudleigh realized that the girl was capable of exciting the admiration of wellmatured men  for all that she did not consider her a dangerous rival because she knew there was a cold calculating vein in sedgwick which would prevent his indulging unduly in romantic weaknesses  selfinterest bound him to her and she tried to overlook his occasional sentimental vagaries  indeed the indifference he now and then displayed strengthened his hold on her then she rose to meet mrs keith who was coming her way  we shall have an opportunity of renewing a pleasant acquaintance she said  you are looking well and miss graham is as fresh and pretty as when i last saw her  mrs keith glanced at millicent  yes she said i think so and she is really a very nice girl  then her eyes twinkled with dry amusement  im not sure that you expected to see me  it was obvious to mrs chudleigh that she had betrayed her feelings on her companions arrival  nothing seemed to escape mrs keiths attention  i did not she admitted  indeed ill confess that i was somewhat startled when you came in  you see i imagined that you were still in canada  i didnt stay very long after you  one or two things turned up that brought me back  but you have no family ties have you  i have some old friends  now and then im vain enough to believe that one of them needs me  as they spoke mrs foster joined them  colonel challoner is eager to see you margaret she interposed  he excused himself for not coming this evening because greythorpe is staying with him for a day or two but he made me promise to bring you over tomorrow  she turned to mrs chudleigh  you must join us have you met greythorpe  hes down here now and then  it seemed to mrs chudleigh that fortune was favouring her  after a long parliamentary career during which he had been distinguished by his sound sense and the moderation of his views greythorpe had been entrusted with an office in connexion with the administration of colonial affairs  what was more to the purpose he seemed to be a friend of colonel challoners whose assistance mrs chudleigh thought she had means of securing in the plan she was working out  i should be delighted she declared  i dont know mr greythorpe except by reputation and as it happened i hadnt an opportunity of speaking to colonel challoner on the evening when he was here though i once met him  seeing that mrs keith was watching her she was glad of the chance of explaining that she had not renewed her acquaintance with the colonel as she had now spent a fortnight with mrs foster who knew him well this should disarm any suspicion that mrs keith might entertain  i dont know why were standing when theres room for all of us in the recess said their hostess who led the way towards it and they dropped into casual conversation when tea was brought them  the evening passed pleasantly for mrs chudleigh who possessed some charm of manner exerted herself to be agreeable to the newcomers nevertheless she was looking forward to the next days visit with eagerness and wondering how she could best make use of the opportunity  at sandymere three miles away colonel challoner spent the evening in his library with his guest  it was a large and simply furnished room but there was a tone of austere harmony in all its appointments  the dark oak table rows of old books in faded leather bindings antique lamps and straightbacked chairs were in keeping with the severe lines of the sombre panels and the heavy square moulding of the ceiling two or three wax candles in an old silver holder stood on a small table by the wide hearth on which a cheerful wood fire burned but most of the room was shadowy  the sense of empty space and gloom had however no effect upon the two elderly men who sat with a cigar box and decanter in front of them engaged in quiet confidential talk  challoner was whitehaired straight and spare with aquiline features and piercing eyes greythorpe broadshouldered and big with a heavyjawed thoughtful face  they had been fast friends since they had met a number of years ago when challoner was giving evidence before a parliamentary commission  so you have not heard from blake after the day he came here greythorpe said by and by  never directly challoner replied  on the whole it is better so though i regret it now and then  a weakness on my part perhaps but i was fond of dick and expected much from him  however it seems that bertram and margaret keith met him in montreal and she is coming here tomorrow  a very sad affair  greythorpe mused  a promising career cut short and a life ruined by a moments failure of nerve  the price paid for it was a heavy one  still i found the matter difficult to understand because so far as i could tell there was nothing in blakes character that made such a failure possible  then its known that personal courage was always a characteristic of your family  his mother was my sister  you have seen her portrait  greythorpe made a sign of assent  he knew the picture of the woman with the proud determined face  and the other side  was the strain equally virile he asked  you shall judge said challoner  you and margaret keith are the only people to whom i have ever spoken freely of these things  i am sure of your discretion and sympathy  he crossed the floor and opening a cabinet came back with a photograph which he gave to his companion  dicks father  he was famous as a daring rider across an irish stonewall country and was killed when taking a dangerous leap  greythorpe studied the face which was of irish type with bold eyes in which a reckless twinkle showed  on the whole it suggested an ardent and somewhat irresponsible temperament  no sign of weakness there he said  though he might be careless and headstrong this man would ride straight and stand fire  i cant hint at an explanation of his sons disaster but i imagine that one might have been found if it had been diligently searched for  my opinion is that theres something hidden but whether it will ever come out is another matter  but your nephew hasnt forfeited my liking  if i can ever be of any service  thanks i know said challoner  it looks as if he meant to cut loose from all of us and while im sorry for this i cant say that hes wrong or that its not a proper feeling  and now i think well let the subject drop  he lighted a cigar before he resumed you look rather jaded and i understand that your responsibilities have been added to  what have you done about the african appointment you mentioned when last here  to be candid i never thought the man lately invalided home was in his right place  he was hardly decided enough greythorpe answered thoughtfully  so far we havent filled the post though two or three names have been suggested  we have a man out there now who has shown some enterprise and ability and are inclined to leave him informally in charge while we consider things  in view of our friendly relations with the french one would imagine that the appointment needs careful thought  its easy for undesirable disputes to crop up when you have turbulent native subjects to keep in hand along another powers frontier  thats true  our territory adjoins theirs for some distance but as it happens our respective fields of influence outside the recognized boundaries have not been very clearly defined  now theres reason to believe that part of the unclaimed neutral belt would be valuable to us and i neednt point out that the imperial expansionists have made their influence felt  its a pity the government seems able to resist it challoner drily remarked  greythorpe smiled for he and his host took different sides in party politics though they often agreed on points that concerned their countrys foreign policy  i think theyre wise in their moderation but ive had plain hints about the desirability of extending our influence in africa which is why we attach some importance to the appointment in question  its holder must be a man of tact able to keep on friendly terms with the french officials and yet bold enough to secure us any advantage that may offer in the unoccupied belt  in fact though the post is not highly paid he must have exceptional talent  men of that kind are hard to pick up  very true  none of the candidates quite satisfies us but when we have investigated their qualifications fully i may ask you what you think  it would be premature just now  always glad to be of service challoner replied  but the men youll have to choose among have grown up since my day  that is not important  its largely a question of personal character and youre a judge of that when it must be coupled with military skill  challoner smiled in a sombre manner  i used to think so but ive come to doubt it  i made a grave mistake about my nephew  however theres a matter you were speaking of this morning and a point has since occurred to me  greythorpe said he would be glad to hear it and they talked over the subject until they went to bed  the next afternoon was bright and mild and soon after mrs foster and her party arrived challoner offered to show them his winter shrubbery  i have lately planted a number of new specimens which you and margaret have not seen he said  your friends may be interested to learn what effects can be got by a judicious mingling of bushes remarkable for the beauty of their berries and branchcolouring among the stereotyped evergreens  they went out and mrs chudleigh thought the front of the old house with its mullioned windows heavy pillared coping and angular chimney stacks made a picturesque background for the smoothclipped yew hedges and broad sweep of lawn  behind it a wood of tall beeches raised their naked boughs in pale intricate tracery against the soft blue sky  the shrubs proved worth inspection for some were rich with berries of hues that varied from crimson to lilac and the massed twigs of others formed blotches of strong colouring  the grass was dry and lighted by gleams of sunshine the air only cold enough to make movement pleasant and mrs chudleigh felt content as she paced a sheltered walk with colonel challoner whom she unobtrusively studied  he looked rather stern and worn and his soft grey tweed showed the leanness of his figure but his expression and bearing indicated force of will  in his conversation with women he was marked by an air of oldfashioned gallantry and though his wit was now and then ironical his companion found him attractive  she had cleverly appropriated and separated him from the rest soon after they entered the garden but she was too clever to approach too soon the object she had in view  first of all she must ingratiate herself with him and she saw that he liked her society though she made one or two mistakes about the shrubs in which she professed a keen interest  im afraid you dont quite grasp my meaning he said with a smile its a difference between varieties not between species  they are not the same thing  i should have remembered mrs challoner transcribers note chudleigh replied  i must own that im not a botanist but one can appreciate the beauty of plants without knowing all about them perhaps the same applies to beauty in any form  no doubt  harmonies of outline and concords of colour make an unconscious appeal but in natures products knowledge adds to admiration  the deeper you probe the more you reveal until you come to mysteries beyond our solving  he added with some dryness its often otherwise with mans work knowledge means disillusion  you see how the trick is done  must it always be a trick  oh no not necessarily  there is a sincerity of effort that leads to lasting and beautiful work but perhaps its not common  im afraid youre a pessimist  i wouldnt like to think so but i have lived a long time and insisted on using my eyes even when clearsightedness may not have been a benefit  theres a penalty attached to the habit of close observation one sees things that hurt  he spoke with dry humour but his words had their effect on his companion who was by no means philosophical  when she studied human weaknesses it was with the object of turning them to her advantage but the shrewd upright soldier saw them as things to avoid or recognize with scorn  he however plucked a bunch of crimson berries which he gave her  this he said is in my opinion an exceptionally beautiful bush mrs keith sent it me from the tyrol some years ago  you are old friends then  our friendship is of forty years standing which i should imagine is a severe test but in many ways we are alike and margaret keith knows enough about me to make allowances  we are both wellseasoned and strongwilled and sometimes we differ but i must confess that whenever the point has been one of importance time has proved her right  mrs chudleigh looked up at him smiling  that is a handsome admission because i shouldnt imagine you easily changed your mind  no as one grows older ones ideas are apt to fall into a groove  it requires an effort to force them out of it  she said nothing for a few minutes though his confession had its significance since she must sooner or later persuade him to abandon one fixed idea  after all none of us find that easy she remarked  he glanced across the lawn where millicent was talking to greythorpe that girl has a very attractive face  i dont merely mean that its pretty  what do you call it then  he seemed to ponder  i think i could best say it looks untainted though that is rather vague  theres purity in it by which i dont mean the guilelessness of inexperience  that could hardly be considering who miss grahams father was and that she has earned her living for some years  there was a hint of surprise in the look challoner gave her and she saw that she had made a mistake  a few people have natures which cant be spoiled he said  to them knowledge brings pity or shrinking instead of temptation  i think miss graham is to be numbered among these and she is in good hands with my old friend  two or three minutes afterwards mrs keith resolutely crossed the lawn towards them but her determined expression softened as she approached challoner  do you know that i feel neglected she said  where are those american azaleas you promised to show me  challoner made her an apologetic bow  have i been remiss  i saw you with greythorpe and understood you found him interesting  ive nothing against the man and he never bores one but hes a friend of yesterday by comparison its only six years since i first met him  ah said challoner the old ties are strongest  mrs keith insisted on examining the azaleas though they were dry and leafless and mrs chudleigh seeing no further opportunity of a quiet talk with challoner left them  when she had gone mrs keith looked at her companion with a twinkle  well she said what do you think of mrs chudleigh  youll allow me to say that i find her charming  its a comprehensive word  and means anything or nothing  but i understand  youre often only conventional when you think yourself gallant  its possible but what would you have me say  shes attractive a pleasant talker and i think intelligent  highly intelligent mrs keith remarked pointedly do you think shes to be trusted  it doesnt enter into the question  i dont see that either of us is required to trust her  im inclined to think thats fortunate mrs keith rejoined  for the next half hour she kept challoner at her side and then left him with mrs foster  it was hard to resist margaret keith when she had made up her mind and challoner had no wish to do so  moreover he was glad to talk to mrs foster whom he liked but he had other guests to whom he owed some attention and he felt as if he were being gently but firmly kept away from them  mrs chudleigh and millicent however seemed to be content with greythorpes society and finding it difficult to leave mrs foster he acquiesced  presently she suggested that he should show her friends his pictures but he said that as it was near sunset and the gallery was badly lighted it would be better if she brought her party back in a day or two  having promised to do so she summoned the others and they were driven home     chapter xvii  the picture gallery  mrs foster brought her guests back to sandymere and when challoner had shown them the best bits of the old carved oak with which the house was decorated and some curious works of art he had picked up in india he took them to the picture gallery which ran round the big square hall  a lantern dome admitted a cold light but a few sunrays struck through a window looking to the southwest and fell in long bright bars on polished floor and sombre panelling  on entering the gallery challoner took out a case of miniatures and placing it on a small table brought a chair for mrs keith  you know the pictures but this collection generally interested you and i have added a few examples of a good french period since you were last here he said  mrs keith sat down  she was fond of miniatures and though she would have preferred to accompany her host she had kept him away from mrs chudleigh since their arrival and thought she must be content with that  she seldom overdid anything and had no wish to make her object too plain geoffrey challoner was by no means a fool  as she expected mrs chudleigh found an opportunity of joining him after a time and diverted his attention from mrs foster who left him to talk to his sister  mrs keith watched the manoeuvre which was cleverly carried out with ironical amusement though she was troubled by a faint uneasiness  she felt that her old friend was threatened but she could not see where the danger lay and sitting with the miniatures before her she tried to formulate her suspicions  in the first place she had unwisely given mrs chudleigh to understand that it was doubtful whether richard blake had merited his disgrace then the former had met lieutenant walters who had fought in the frontier action and had gained his confidence  it was possible that she had led him on to talk about the affair with injudicious freedom and now she had met greythorpe and seemed desirous of cultivating his acquaintance  all this had an ominous look because the woman was ambitious and scheming besides being in love with sedgwick who was something of an adventurer  she would no doubt seize upon any opportunity of securing his promotion  margarets keiths suspicions were justified for mrs chudleigh was then cleverly clearing the ground for future action  she had some knowledge of art and the row of family portraits hung between suits of armour and trophies of eastern weapons interested her while challoner was gratified by the way she listened as he spoke of them  one or two were by wellknown artists and the faces of the old challoners some of whom wore wigs and rich court dress and some obsolete uniforms fixed her attention  the resemblance between them all was recognizable and she thought the family strain must be unusually strong  they had obviously been stern masterful men practical rather than imaginative and not likely to be troubled by any emotional weaknesses  then she glanced at the picture of a young woman with a face of singularly delicate beauty  its expression was gentle and pensive  my wife she died in simla twenty years ago said challoner gravely and passing on stopped before a watercolour drawing of his son  it had been painted when bertram was young and he had his mothers dreamy look  mrs chudleigh missed the hardness of expression that marked the challoners  a sketch rather than a finished study but theres talent in it she remarked  the subjects temperament has been cleverly seized i have met captain challoner  my wifes work said the colonel  although i value it i have thought she was mistaken in this drawing  my son is a man of action and this is the face of a sentimentalist  ah said mrs chudleigh his mother should know him best  undoubtedly agreed challoner who looked disturbed at the suggestion  still perhaps in painting a portrait the artist may be misled into unduly emphasizing some single passing phase of the sitters character  a lads moods are variable his nature has not had time to harden into its mould  i imagine this is what has happened because if the likeness is faithful my son has changed since then  one does not change much in essentials mrs chudleigh answered thoughtfully  but what would you have different  it is a good and very likeable face  there is a hint of weakness something that suggests a too sensitive disposition  the colonel pointed to an officer in the old east india companys uniform whose expression was grim and arrogant  a crude piece of work but he has the challoner look  it may sound presumptuous but i think you are scarcely doing the family justice  one can see the salient characteristics of the male line in this example but theyre too strongly marked  good qualities such as resolution and courage may degenerate through being developed to exaggeration at the expense of others and after all captain challoner strikes me as a much finer type  im afraid you undervalue the gift of imagination  these others said challoner indicating the portraits generally had imagination enough to do their duty often in difficult situations  i dont know that one needs much more  a stern doctrine it seems to bar out a good deal of the beauty and joy of life  but i see some landscapes yonder  she led him up to several small impressionist sketches in watercolour of indian subjects and stopped in admiration  these are very good  i know the country and they make you realise what it is like  there is genius here  my son did them said challoner with dry amusement  i can see their cleverness but ill admit that i think them rather a waste of time  a shocking view  would you sooner have had him study his drill book or attend a kit inspection  on the whole i believe so  it would be more in line with his profession  mrs chudleigh gave him a direct reproachful glance  i know your son and that he is a good soldier but i feel you were wrong when you sent him into the army  with training he might have made a great artist  challoner regarded her with frank astonishment  but my dear lady would you prefer the latter a coverer of canvases a mere portrayer of action instead of a doer  is it better to paint human passions and emotions than to control and direct your own and those of others  painting is his work mrs chudleigh persisted  he has the temperament you can see it triumphing over circumstances  in spite of his duties the amusements he must be expected to take part in and no doubt the banter of the mess he finds time to make these sketches then they exhibit more than mere skill with the brush they show clear understanding and the power of feeling  the latter is a dangerous gift  a man of action is better without it  your son has it and it cannot be got rid of but in a sense youre right  sensibility must be a handicap to a soldier now and then making him realize dangers and cruelties he had better have been blind to  mrs chudleigh paused and added with a thoughtful air captain challoners courage and coolness are known but i think they must cost him more than is required of his comrades  i mean that his having something to overcome before he can practise them and yet always doing so shows a fine moral fibre  challoner looked grave  he had suspected what he thought were symptoms of weakness in his son though bertram had never given way to it  his companions talk disturbed him because it seemed to prove the correctness of his suppositions but he was shortly relieved of her  margaret keith who had watched closely decided that mrs chudleigh had been alone with her host long enough but for a time she could see no suitable means of separating them  by and by however millicent came towards her and she beckoned the girl  isnt arrowdale near your aunts place in the north she said theres a picture of the hills round it that i think you would like ask colonel challoner to show it you  millicent joined the others and when she spoke about the picture mrs chudleigh went away  she thought she had said enough for her object had been to plant a seed of doubt about his sons character in challoners mind  if he considered sensitiveness artistic talent and imagination failings in a challoner she had given him food for thought which was as far as she wished to go just then and on the whole she thought she had reason to be satisfied  when she had moved away challoner showed millicent a picture of grey hills and a sullen tarn half revealed between folds of rolling vapour and the girl was stirred to keen appreciation  its beautiful and full of life she said  one can see the mist drive by and the ripples break upon the stones  perhaps its because i know the tarn i like the picture so much but it makes one realize the rugged grandeur and melancholy charm of the place  i suppose that is genius who is the painter  my son said the colonel and added with a curious smile you are the second person who has lately tried to persuade me that he should have been an artist  millicent saw he was troubled though she could not imagine the reason  i hardly know captain challoner whom i only met once but it is obvious that he has talent  you would sooner have him a soldier  very much sooner  but he is one and i understand has distinguished himself  after all it is perhaps a mistake to think of genius as limited to one ability music or painting for example  real genius the power of understanding is more comprehensive the man who has it ought to be successful at whatever he undertakes  im dubious said challoner  it strikes me as a rather daring theory  it isnt mine millicent answered blushing  its a favourite theme of a philosopher im fond of and he insists upon it when he speaks about great men  perhaps im talking too freely but i feel that captain challoners being able to paint well shouldnt prevent his making a good officer  great men are scarce  im content that my son has so far done his duty quietly and well all i could wish for is that if any exceptional call should be made on him he should rise to the occasion  that is the supreme test and men one expects much from sometimes fail to meet it  millicent guessed that he was thinking of a man who had been dear to him and had apparently broken down beneath sudden stress  it must be hard to judge them unless one knows all the circumstances she remarked  not when a man has entered his countrys service  he must carry out his orders what he is sent to do must be done  no excuse can justify disobedience and failure  but we are getting too serious and i am boring you  there is another picture i think you would like to see  soon afterwards mrs foster said that she must go and when she and her friends had left challoner sat alone for a time while the pictures faded as dusk crept into the gallery  a man of practical abilities with a stern perception of his duty he was inclined to distrust all that made its strongest appeal to the senses  art and music he thought were vocations for women in his opinion it was hardly fitting that a man should exploit his emotions by expressing them for public exhibition  indeed he regarded sentimentality of any kind as a failing and it had been suggested that his son possessed the dangerous gift  one of his guests had gone further and hinted that bertram should never have been a soldier  challoner could not agree with this conclusion but he thought there was perhaps a grain of truth in it then he banished his disturbing thoughts and went out in search of greythorpe  during the next week mrs chudleigh met challoner twice and skilfully led the conversation to his son  then she heard from sedgwick who said that if he could obtain the vacant appointment it would give him an opportunity of making his mark  the time was ripe for a bold stroke which would lead to the acquisition of valuable territory but he could not carry out his plans unless he had full command  they were he felt bound to succeed but he frankly owned that he meant to force the hand of the colonial authorities and could not act while he held a subordinate position  accordingly he begged mrs chudleigh to exert all her influence to secure his promotion adding that his name had been mentioned in connexion with the post but that there were other candidates with stronger claims on those who had the power to make the appointment  mrs chudleigh had already been at work in different quarters but she thought colonel challoner the most likely man to help her though he might be difficult to persuade and she could not hurry him  she had moreover had several confidential talks with lieutenant walters and had extracted a good deal of information  this enabled her to form a plausible theory of what had happened during the night attack and she was inclined to think that even an experienced soldier could not find much fault with the conclusions she had arrived at but she did not wish to make use of it unless compelled  when it was getting dark one evening foster who was crossing a meadow with two young men carrying guns dropped behind to speak to a keeper as mrs chudleigh and millicent came forward to meet the party  soon afterwards he joined his wife who had waited for him and they walked to the house behind the others  how did you get on at the seymours this afternoon he asked  did ada air her views for the benefit of your friends  mrs foster laughed for ada seymour was a lady with strong opinions which she was fond of proclaiming  yes she said in fact she went farther than usual and rather forgot her manners  after a while mrs chudleigh took exception to something she said and miss graham was drawn into the argument somewhat to my surprise she supported ada and spoke really well but ada was getting angry and i was so busy trying to smooth things down that i hardly know what it was all about  the degeneracy of the age and the insidious influence of luxury no doubt  ada cant keep off these topics and she makes some surprising statements when she warms up but im not surprised that mrs chudleigh and miss graham took opposite sides  why  theyre very different types about as different as a moonlight night and a spring morning  mrs foster looked at him sharply and he chuckled  not often so poetical am i  but i prefer the bright morning moonlights a tricky elusive thing apt to dazzle and mislead one however does mrs chudleigh intend to remain long  she looks like a fixture  she doesnt inconvenience you  not at all  shes amusing and that and moderate good looks are all you expect from a woman so long as you dont mean to marry her  im interested in your friend very much so although i cant see her game  what do you mean by her game  if you dont know it isnt often youre so dull  shes up to something and meg keith sees it she keeps a close watch on the woman and when shes forced to take her eyes off her sets miss graham on guard  do you mean that miss graham informs her of what mrs chudleigh says or does  nothing farther from my thoughts  meg keith has lots of pluck but shed be shy of suggesting such a course to that girl  what she does is not to trust the woman alone when she can help it when you see mrs chudleigh youll generally find meg or her companion in the neighbourhood  the plots interesting and the colonels in it  ive an idea that megs somehow defending him  hes an old friend and shes as staunch as theyre made  if there is more in the situation than appears on the surface you had better leave it alone  you wont improve matters by interfering  seen that all along foster agreed  ill stick to my shooting but provided that i keep my hands off theres no harm in looking on  but you mark me therell be developments  he broke off with a chuckle and mrs foster walked on in thoughtful silence  her husband occasionally showed shrewd observation and she believed that he was right in the present instance  something was undoubtedly going on but she could not determine what it was  as she entered the hall she saw millicent talking to one of her sporting guests who had shown a preference for her society and mrs chudleigh watching  the latter liked admiration but her expression indicated critical scrutiny rather than jealousy  mrs foster imagined that she was trying to analyse the girls charm  then as she came forward with her husband the others joined them and shortly afterwards tea was brought in     chapter xviii  colonel challoner proves obdurate  a week after mrs fosters visit challoner drove over to hazlehurst in the afternoon and on reaching the lodge found her setting out with several of her guests to meet foster and his friends on their return from shooting  refusing to allow her to turn back with him he accompanied the party and some time later mrs keith who had remained at home went out on the terrace  following it to the end of the house near which the stables stood she saw a man leading in a horse which she thought she knew  isnt that bay colonel challoners she asked  yes maam said the groom  the gardener brought it up from the lodge  the colonel went on with mrs foster to the long wood  mrs keith turned away and sat down on a terrace seat feeling disturbed  mrs chudleigh was with the others and would no doubt detach challoner from them as she generally succeeded in doing when mrs keith was unable to prevent her  now there was nobody to come to his rescue he would be at the womans mercy and though she admitted that this was perhaps an exaggerated view to take mrs keith felt that he was threatened  it was however a long walk to the wood and she was old enough to shrink from it besides there was a possibility that she was after all suspecting mrs chudleigh without much cause but she made up her mind to follow  by walking fast she might overtake the party before much harm was done  entering the house she put on thick boots and then set out with all the speed she was capable of  in the meanwhile mrs fosters party had split up and mrs chudleigh and challoner were left together  the colonel did not regret this because he had found her an entertaining companion  though it was a winter day the weather was mild and the road almost dry and after a time they reached a birch wood which skirted its eastern side  the rays of the low sun struck in among the trees forcing up the silvery trunks and fragile twigs which looked like lacework against a background of blue shadow  thick hollies and rhododendrons planted near the wayside kept off the light wind and dead leaves and withered fern made patches of glowing colour  when they came to a gate leading to a drive through the wood mrs chudleigh stopped  the others have vanished i cant even hear them she said  i wonder which way they have gone  challoner listened but could only distinguish the murmur of the wind among the birches and the rustle of fallen leaves  the rest of the party were obviously some distance ahead  the roads the longer but as the fieldpaths often wet i cant tell which theyve taken he said  the fieldpath for me mrs chudleigh replied  im afraid im not very fond of walking  they entered the wood and presently reached a stile on the other side of which a boggy patch cut off the path from a strip of sticky ploughing  mrs chudleigh regarded it with disapproval  i dont know if mrs foster could jump over that but i cant she said  she sat down upon the stile and challoner leaned against the fence  therell be time to meet them coming back before they reach the spot where the path rejoins the road  after all i see no reason to complain of being left behind  mrs chudleigh smiled at him  thats very nice of you and while the sunshine lasts its pleasant here  i often think an english wood with the varied colours of the trunks and mosses showing is most beautiful on a bright winter day  besides i wanted to talk to you  theres a favour i must ask  you can consider it granted if its in my power  dont be rash she warned him  you may be surprised when you hear what it is but i want you to see the matter in its proper light and not to be actuated merely by a wish to please me  its a wish i should like to gratify challoner assured her  but please go on  mrs chudleigh hesitated  beneath his formal oldfashioned courtesy which she had found attractive she recognized a stern conscientiousness  he must if possible be convinced that the course she meant to urge was the best though she had the means of putting pressure on him if this proved needful  well she said there is a rather important post vacant in a west african colony and you have influence  mr greythorpe is an intimate friend of yours and may consult you about the matter  he will no doubt have a part in making the selection  i have heard about it challoner admitted guardedly  instead of answering mrs chudleigh started and clenched her hand for she was looking towards the road and could see a womans figure through an opening between the trees  she recognized the dress which was behind the current fashion and the newcomers carriage which somehow suggested determination further indicated mrs keith  mrs chudleigh was glad that challoner stood where he could not see the road but she watched in keen suspense when mrs keith reached the gate and stopped as if undecided which way to go  if she chose the fieldpath mrs chudleighs opportunity would be gone and it might be some time before she found another while her business brooked no delay  it was however fortunate that she and her companion could not be plainly seen from the road because there were some bushes in the way and a tall thicket close by formed a background against which their figures would not show  after a few moments mrs keith moved on and mrs chudleigh who was conscious of deep relief saw that challoner was waiting for her to speak  it is essential that the right man should be chosen she resumed our political and commercial interests demand this  there is a chance of acquiring a strip of territory which would open a way to the trade of the interior but it must be done with tact as well as boldness  we need a man with firmness and judgment who can secure us this opening without giving the french definite ground for offence and he must be experienced in west african affairs  the post could not be entrusted safely to a newcomer  ah said challoner as you seem so well informed i presume you have somebody to suggest  she could learn nothing from his manner which had changed and grown formal  i know a man who has all the necessary qualifications  he is resolute and enterprising a soldier who has distinguished himself in action and a clever administrator  what is more the direction of affairs has been largely left in his hands for some time  you mean captain sedgwick  challoners tone was discouragingly reserved  may i ask what leads you to plead his cause  first of all because i think he is the best man  a good reason said the colonel  still im inclined to think you have a better one  mrs chudleigh hesitated while the colour crept into her face then she said simply i love him  challoner bowed  i am honoured by your confidence but if he were chosen it would separate you  you could not stand the climate of western africa  i know she said eagerly  these appointments however are not for long and we are willing to defer our marriage if it will give him an opportunity of showing what he can do  there was silence for the next minute  challoner was somewhat touched by her frank appeal and though he saw that she was sufficiently ambitious to subordinate her affection to her desire for her lovers advancement it was an ambition he could sympathize with  the woman was willing to make a sacrifice  for all that he felt that he could not conscientiously help her  i wish you had asked for something else he said  im sorry this favour is not in my power  you can know nothing against captain sedgwick the answered sharply  certainly not the trouble is that personally i know nothing in his favour  but i have assured you that there is nobody so suitable  that is a different matter  your opinion is very natural and does you credit i will not suggest that your affection for him may lead you to rate captain sedgwicks qualifications too highly  no doubt he is an excellent officer but these appointments are not made on a ladys recommendation  are they not mrs chudleigh asked with a touch of irony  remember that i have lived at simla and know that influence often goes a long way i have seen it at work  challoner frowned  so have i but it is a thing i have always set my face against  the man for a post of this kind must be chosen on his merits  how are they to be ascertained unless you take the opinion of those who know him best  it is often difficult but the safest test is his work as it is known to his official superiors  unless he is judged by this there is a risk of partiality and unfairness  social influence is a dangerous thing and deplorable mistakes have been made when it has been allowed to have effect  then you will do nothing  her tone was harsh and challoner looked at her in surprise  it is possible that greythorpe may consult me though i do not know what weight my opinion would have with him  if the information he lays before me seems to indicate that captain sedgwick is the best man i should suggest his appointment  mrs chudleigh appeared to acquiesce and said nothing for some minutes she was sorry that challoner had not proved more amenable since his stubbornness forced her into a distasteful line of action but she could not spare him when her lovers future was at stake  after all she said a soldiers official record is sometimes as little to be trusted as you think his friends estimate of him ought to be  i have an instance in view two men i know took part in an action on the indian frontier and one gained a reputation for courage and the other obloquy  as it happened neither was deserved  on the indian frontier challoner glanced at her sharply  yes some time since  a night attack was made upon a hill which formed the key to the position of a small british force  an order to retreat was wrongly given  ah said challoner i have good reason to remember that affair  may i ask what you know about it  im convinced i know the truth which has been concealed  challoner started and his face grew eager  then your knowledge is of great importance and i must beg you to share it with me  it may clear a man i have a strong affection for  at the cost of involving another  i suppose that follows  then you do not believe it wiser to let a painful matter which is already almost forgotten rest  you would rake it up even if it brought trouble upon innocent people  justice must be done said challoner  i have always hated jobbery if a wrong has been committed it must be put right  you no doubt know that the order to retreat could only have been given by one of two officers  there were signs of tension in challoners face and mrs chudleigh pitied him but she was forced to be merciless  that seems to have been taken for granted  what then  it was a dark night and nobody saw who gave the order but blake was stationed with his electric apparatus in the ravine and the bugler some distance behind him  besides the latter was attached to captain challoners company  but blake did not fire the mine  challoners voice was strained  that is true  the conclusion was that he had deserted his post but i believe it must be wrong because he was seen busy with the wires  who saw him  one of his comrades after the attack began and it seems impossible that blake could have reached the bugler when the retreat was sounded there were one or two other points which might have been raised only that he made no defence  i will mention them  she had after a long and careful consideration arranged her evidence in a skilful manner  facts which had appeared of minor importance to the men who had noticed them had now as she handled them a telling effect and challoner grew troubled  if needful i believe i could prove all this though it would require strong pressure to make my informant speak she concluded  you must see what it implies  that my son is a coward and gave the shameful order  challoners eyes glittered though his face was colourless  its unthinkable  nevertheless its true  why did he without permission and abusing his authority over the guard spend two hours late at night with blake who was under arrest  what had they to say that took so long when there was a risk of captain challoners being discovered  why did blake make no defence unless it was because he knew that to clear himself would throw the blame upon his friend  you press me hard said challoner in a hoarse voice  but that my son should so have failed in his duty to his country and his cousin is impossible  yet you were willing to believe your nephew guilty  had you any cause to doubt his courage  no said challoner  i used to think he loved a risk  he felt beaten by her remorseless reasoning there was scarcely a point he could contest and his heart grew very heavy  a conviction that humbled him to the dust was being forced on him  there is only one conclusion mrs chudleigh resumed  the order to retreat was given by the weaker man bertram challoner  he turned to her with a gesture that begged her to desist  my dear lady this is very painful  i must try to think it out calmly and i am not able now  for a time there was strained silence and mrs chudleigh waited until he roused himself  i must know if what you have told me has any bearing on your request that i should recommend captain sedgwicks appointment  she paused before she answered for he was very stern and peremptory  not a direct one  i have kept the secret out of consideration for you and your son but since i have done so i ventured to believe you would not refuse me a favour that would only cost you a few words to your friend  im relieved to hear it challoner grimly replied  you wish to appeal to my gratitude and not my fears  has it struck you that if you are correct in your conclusions by keeping silent you were wronging an innocent man  think she said impressively  in a sense blake stands by himself a man of no importance your son is heir to a fine estate and is expected to carry on the traditions of the family  he has a young wife who adores him and many friends  is a career such as lies before him to be destroyed by one weak action which he has since well atoned for i believe your nephew saw that his cousins disgrace would be a disaster and felt that at any cost the situation must be saved  challoner regarded her with a stern smile  one would imagine that you are trying to heighten the value of your silence  you misjudge me but since you take this line i have some claim on your gratitude  can you deny it  i had better answer frankly  if my opinion is desired i will try to consider captain sedgwicks appointment on its merits  you must not count on more than this  mrs chudleigh rose and they turned back to the road in silence  it looked as if she had failed but she would not give up the game yet when challoner had time to think he would no doubt realize the necessity of safeguarding his sons good name and even his austere uprightness might fail to stand the strain  it was half an hour later when mrs keith who had walked as fast as she was able met foster and the others coming back  she stopped hot and breathless with keen disappointment for neither colonel challoner nor mrs chudleigh were among them  then rousing herself with an effort she asked where they were  i cant tell mrs foster replied  they dropped behind us and may have gone home  mrs chudleigh soon gets tired of walking  mrs keiths heart sank and foster noticed her expression  its a good way from hazlehurst but you look as if you had been hurrying he remarked  are you very much disappointed that you didnt meet us earlier  i am disappointed that i missed challoner mrs keith answered with a forced smile  foster who gave her a keen glance tactfully talked about his shooting as they went back together and on reaching the house they found that challoner had already driven home     chapter xix  challoners decision  the morning was mild and challoner paced slowly up and down his shrubbery  bright sunshine fell upon him the massed evergreens cut off the wind and in a sheltered border spearlike green points were pushing through the soil in promise of the spring  challoner knew them all the veined crocus blades the tightclosed heads of the hyacinths and the twin shoots of the daffodils but fond as he was of his garden he gave them scanty attention and by and by sat down in a sheltered nook lost in painful thought  he had a careworn look and had left the house in a restless mood with a wish to be alone in the open air  mrs chudleighs revelation had been a shock  with his sense of duty and family pride he had when the news of the frontier disaster first reached him found it almost impossible to believe that his nephew had been guilty of shameful cowardice and now it looked as if the disgrace might be brought still closer home  bertram would presently take his place and retiring from active service rule the estate in accordance with challoner traditions and perhaps exert some influence in politics he remembered that mrs chudleigh had laid some stress on this  she had however told him that bertram from whom so much was expected had shown himself a poltroon and what was even worse had allowed an innocent man to suffer for his baseness  challoner had spent the last few days pondering the evidence she had offered him and had seen one or two weak points in it  by making the most of these it might perhaps be rebutted but his honesty rendered such a course out of the question if she were right in her conclusions and he was forced to admit that this was possible  bertram had shown timidity in his younger dayschalloner remembered that they had had some trouble in teaching him to rideand there was no doubt that his was a highlystrung and nervous temperament  he had not the calm which marked the challoners in time of strain  then dick blake was recklessly generous and loved his cousin it would be consistent with his character if he were willing to suffer in bertrams stead  moreover there were reasons which might have had some effect in inducing bertram to consent because challoner knew the affection his son bore him and that he would shrink from involving him in his disgrace  what bertram would certainly not have done to secure his own escape he might have done for the sake of his father and the girl he was to marry  admitting all this challoner could not take his sons guilt for granted  there was room for doubt and soon after leaving mrs chudleigh he had cabled a friend in montreal asking him to spare no effort to trace blake  if the latter could be found he must be summoned home and forced to declare the truth  by and by challoner heard a footstep and looking up saw foster approaching  he stopped and regarded the colonel with surprise for it was seldom challoner was to be seen sitting moodily idle  im taking a short cut through your grounds to the fir spinney he said  as i was leaving home mrs chudleigh asked me to give you this note and when i looked in at the house miss challoner said she didnt know where you were and a telegram had just come in  thinking i might find you i brought it along  handing the other two envelopes he added sorry to see youre not looking as brisk as usual  theres not much the matter challoner replied forcing a smile still i do feel a trifle slack and ive had something to worry me  foster gave him a sympathetic nod  worrys bad make a rule to avoid it when i can  but will you walk as far as the wood  he went on when challoner said he would sooner remain and the latter eagerly opened the telegram  it was in answer to his cable and read   blake and two others left sweetwater settlement  destination supposed far north   this implied the impossibility of learning anything from his nephew for some time and challoner could not recall his son who was then in japan and must shortly rejoin his indian regiment  besides if bertram were blameless it would be a cruel blow for him to find that his father had suspected him of a shameful deed while if he were guilty something must be done  this would probably lead to a disastrous change in their relations and compel bertram to leave the army  though the suspense was hard to bear challoner as mrs chudleigh had foreseen was beginning to feel afraid to learn the truth and inclined to temporize  then he opened her note and read   as i hear you expect mr greythorpe shortly i venture to believe that now you have had time for reflection you will see that it would be better for everybody if you did as i suggested  this would be a great favour and you could count upon my gratitude and discretion   studying it carefully challoner saw a threat as well as a promise that she would keep his secret if he complied but he tore the note up and trod the fragments into the soil  so far as the african appointment was concerned he was not to be influenced  he would not offer a bribe for her silence nor would he derive a personal advantage from a piece of jobbery  on that point his mind was made up  a little later mrs keith opened a neighbouring gate and came towards him  the fine morning tempted me out and as lucy foster was passing with the car i thought id look your sister up she said  but im afraid youre in trouble  the last time we met you had a downcast air and you dont look much brighter today  its unpleasant to think im in the habit of showing my feelings so plainly he answered  you dont but your moody calm has its meaning  ive known you long enough to recognize it  you cant deny that something is disturbing you  no said challoner  im not clever enough to hide it from your keen eyes  theyre very friendly as you know  ill strain a friends privilege far enough to guess that your perplexities began the last time you and mrs chudleigh met  he wondered how much she knew and longed to confide in her  she was very staunch but his secret must be kept until he had learned the truth  im sorry margaret but i cant tell you what is troubling me  she made a sign of acquiescence  you would if it were possible and i wont press you but you know i can be trusted if you need me  i was afraid of that woman i felt she threatened you  their glances met and lingered and challoner felt that the reason for his grief was but thinly veiled from her  still for his sons sake he could not confirm her suspicions and he broke into a dry smile  i believe you tried to protect me and it certainly wasnt your fault that you failed  i appreciate it margaret but after all there may be less cause for anxiety than i imagine and well talk about something else  will you come up to the house  they walked slowly across the lawn and though his companion chatted about indifferent matters challoner knew he had her sympathy  when they reached the door she stopped  i neednt bring you in because i have something to ask hilda  no doubt its unnecessary but you wont mind my warning you not to be influenced by anything that woman said  i had already decided to disregard it  a look of gratified confidence came into her eyes  that is what i expected you are not easily swayed but i see signs of strain  there is some crisis you must face and i think it is connected with greythorpes visit  you have guessed correctly  when one is in difficulties the easiest way out is not always the best  but you know that  i have learned it  one has often to chose between the right and the most prudent thing  ah said mrs keith i believe they are generally the same in the end that is if one has the courage to choose the former  challoner bowed  you have never failed me margaret and you give me good counsel now  she went in and he turned away feeling encouraged but a reaction followed and he spent the rest of the day in troubled thought  a day or two later greythorpe arrived and in the early evening sat with his host in the library  though dusk was closing in a window near them stood open and a single shaded candle burned upon a neighbouring table presently greythorpe opened some papers  we have not settled the african appointment yet he said  the matter of course is not altogether in my hands but my recommendation will have weight and i should be glad of your opinion before making it  you will find the names and qualifications of the candidates here  challoner studied the papers and then gazed out of the window without speaking  it was not quite dark and he could see the great oaks in the park and the sombre masses of the woods rolling back up the valley  in the foreground a sheet of water shone with a pale gleam it was a rich and beautiful countryside and much of it belonged to him though his wife had brought him money sandymere had long been the property of the challoners and the old house had a picturesque stateliness while every field and farmstead had been well cared for  in process of time it would all be his sons and in that sense bertram had more than an individual importance  he was one of a line of men who had served their country well in court and field and any disgrace that fell upon him would taint a respected name and reflect upon his children for the family honour was indivisible a thing that stretched backwards to the past as well as forward  now however it was threatened by an unprincipled woman who claimed the power to drag it in the mire but challoner recognized that he could not allow this to influence him  his private affairs must not count where the interests of his country were concerned  well he said at length the matter seems difficult to decide  you have two men of excellent character whom i know something about and a third who has shown ability in a subordinate post  sedgwick  your manner leads me to believe that you dont quite class him with the others  there is a difference  the first two are honest and reliable but not brilliant men  sedgwick is obviously more capable than either but i suspect that selfinterest is his strongest motive  i knew a major in his regiment  he might use this appointment to force himself into prominence  its possible but that neednt prove a great drawback  is the cabinet ready to embark upon a bold course of colonial expansion  no said greythorpe with a smile not so far as im acquainted with their views but we would like the strip of unoccupied territory and sedgwick seems alive to its importance  hell probably get it for you if you give him a chance but i imagine he wont stop there  in fact he may take you much farther than you wish to go  suppose he brings off some sensational coup in which you would have to support him at the expense of france  there might be some risk of that but hes undoubtedly an able man  i think so challoner agreed  its his disinterestedness i suspect  then if the post were at your disposal you would not offer it to him  challoner was silent for a few moments  it looked as if greythorpe were disposed to favour sedgwicks claim and to concur might save a good deal of trouble  even then it did not follow that sedgwick would be chosen because there were higher authorities to be consulted challoner thought he would not be blamed if they refused the man the post because he did mrs chudleigh the justice to believe that she would not doubt his assurance that he had done his best and that she would afterwards put no further pressure on him  it was her lovers promotion she wished to secure  for all that easy as it would be to humour her he had been asked for his opinion by a man who trusted him and he must give it honestly  no he said with a resolute air i should prefer either of the others  on the whole i believe id select the first on your list  you seem to have thought it well over  thats true  its a rather grave matter challoner answered drily  well said greythorpe my idea is that sedgwick should be left in charge a month or two longer  then if we send out another man well try to find him something else  he changed the subject and challoner lighted a cigar and listened sitting back in the shadow where his companion could not see him  he felt weary because he had borne a heavy strain during the last few days and the course he had taken had cost him a good deal  now he knew that if sedgwick were not appointed mrs chudleigh would hold him responsible     chapter xx  mrs chudleigh makes a fresh attempt  next evening challoner and greythorpe dined at fosters with several other guests and the colonel was placed next to mrs chudleigh while mrs keith sat opposite  he found his position uncomfortable because when he looked up he saw that his old friend was watching him and though she chatted carelessly there was now and then a hint of tension in his companions manner  it was a relief when mrs foster rose but he afterwards felt that opposing influences were being brought to bear on him  when the party dispersed as was usual at hazlehurst some to play billiards and some to the drawingroom mrs keith engaged him in casual talk and stuck to him determinedly for a time  he had no doubt that her intentions were good since he noticed mrs chudleigh hovering in the background but he wished that she would leave him alone  by and by their hostess took mrs keith away but then millicent whom he suspected had been told to do so came up and spoke to him  it looked as if he were to be saved from his persecutor even against his will for he was anxious to meet her and get the unpleasant business over but he liked millicent and courtesy demanded that he should listen presently she rather hesitatingly mentioned his nephew  have you heard anything from mr blake since he left montreal  nothing said challoner with a trace of grimness  he does not correspond with me  then i suppose you dont know where he is  i took some trouble to find out but nothing came of it  i merely learned that he had left a small settlement on the western prairie and started for the north  he gave her a sharp glance  are you interested in my nephew  yes she said frankly  i dont know him very well but on two occasions he came to my assistance when i needed it  he was very tactful and considerate  then hes fortunate in gaining your good opinion  no doubt you know something about his history  i daresay my good opinion is not worth much but i feel that he deserves it in spite of what ive been told about him she answered with a blush  it is very sad that he should have to give up all he valued and i thought there was something gallant in his cheerfulness he was always ready with a jest  have you met his companion  i understand that he is not a man of my nephews stamp  millicent smiled  hardly so from your point of view  does that mean that yours is not the same as mine  i have had to earn my living which changes ones outlook perhaps id better not say enlarges it  however you shall judge  mr harding is a traveller for an american paint factory and had to begin work at an age when your nephew was at eton but i think him a very fine type hes serious courteous and sanguine and seems to have a strong confidence in his partner  ah said challoner that is not so strange  the blakes have a way of inspiring trust and liking  its a gift of theirs  your nephew undoubtedly has it  he uses it unconsciously but i think that those who trust him are not deceived  challoner regarded her with a curious expression  after all he said that may be true  then greythorpe came up in search of millicent and when she went away with him challoner saw mrs chudleigh approaching  obeying her sign he followed her to a seat in the recess in the hall  mr greythorpe came down yesterday she said  i suppose you have already had a talk with him  last night  as you anticipated he asked my opinion about the african matter  several names have been submitted trustworthy men  come to the point she told him sharply  what did you do about captain sedgwick  challoner gravely met her insistent gaze  i felt compelled to suggest that he was not the best man for the post  mrs chudleighs eyes sparkled and the blood swept into her face  her pose grew tense and she looked dangerous but with an obvious effort she controlled her anger  then if i were a revengeful person i would warn you that you must take the consequences  i suppose that follows but i would prefer to think you are fair enough to make allowances for a man who tried to do the right thing in a difficult situation  she was silent for a moment watching him with a curious halfashamed feeling  then she made an abrupt movement  its hard to do so  a word or two which you would not speak would have led to the appointment of the most talented man  im not a saint you mustnt expect a higher standard from me than im capable of  she dismissed him with an angry gesture and got up as mrs foster came in with greythorpe  when the latter left his hostess she beckoned him and led him to a seat near the hearth  how far does colonel challoners opinion go with you she asked boldly  that depends he answered smiling  on some matters it goes a long way  on the choosing of a west african officer for instance  ah said greythorpe now i begin to understand  if i am not indiscreet in mentioning it i thought my old friend was rather in disgrace with you  you are keen she told him  i must warn you that challoner is prejudiced  if that is so there is probably a reason for it  there is she said coolly  im afraid it is my fault  i made a mistake in trying to force the colonel to speak in favour of one of the candidates  it was unwise greythorpe agreed  our friend is by no means amenable to treatment of the kind  still you would not let a good officer suffer because of my tactlessness  certainly not the only thing that could count against any of the men we are considering is some shortcoming of their own  then i must try to remove a wrong impression and my task is difficult because you know challoner better than i do  we can however agree that he is honest  eminently conscientious greythorpe remarked  then you must allow for a reaction against the injudicious course i took  i urged him to speak for a friend of mine which was no doubt very wrong and it seems i went too far  can you not imagine his resenting it and being so determined not to be influenced that he became hypercritical  greythorpe thought this clever since it was the best means of lessening the value of challoners opinion that she could use  i gather that you put too severe a strain upon his friendship  im afraid theres a breach between us now but that is not the point  no said greythorpe  in a general way your reasoning is logical but i hardly think it applicable to challoner  he might resent your action but it would not make him unjust  i presume the man you favour is captain sedgwick  hes much the best of the three you have in view  then you know something about the matter  we thought it was secret  she laughed  secrets are not always well kept  i know the other men and though there is nothing that can be urged against their character they are plodders men of routine without much foresight or enterprise  allowing that you are right isnt there something to be said for the steady plodder  i daresay hes useful mrs chudleigh agreed with a touch of scorn but for the vacant post you want a bold determined man who can see ahead  to some extent i must agree  you believe captain sedgwick is such a man  he felt a certain tempered admiration for her  she made no secret of her aim though he supposed she must find it embarrassing to plead for her lover since he did not doubt that she loved sedgwick  she had courage and cleverness and he listened with close attention while she spoke about the mans exploits and abilities  then she looked up with an eagerness which somewhat moved him  have i convinced you she asked  greythorpe smiled  that sedgwick is a dashing and intrepid soldier yes  but there are other points to take into account and the matter does not entirely rest with me  still i think if he serves us well we may find some use for him  it was a guarded promise and by no means all that she desired but she knew she must be content with it  then i have accomplished something and will remember the consideration and patience you have shown she said and when some of the other guests came in moved away to join them  in the meanwhile millicent had been sitting alone for a few minutes at the opposite end of the hall  somebody was singing in the adjoining drawingroom the door of which stood open and she could see several people gathered about the piano though she was herself partly secluded by a screen  by and by lieutenant walters came in and as he made his way towards her after looking round she felt tempted to change her place but could not do so without making her retreat too marked  now and then he suffered from a relapse and she felt compassionate as she noticed the heaviness of his movements and his pinched expression still his eyes had been eager as he searched the room and this had caused her some alarm because he had lately shown a noticeable preference for her society  when he stopped he laid his hand as if for support on the back of a chair and glanced towards a window that opened into the conservatory  ive been hanging about since dinner trying to get hold of you but you were in too great demand he said  shall we slip out to the seat among the palms yonder for a quiet talk  the conservatory looked inviting with the coloured lamps hanging among the flowers and screens of trailing plants throwing their shadows across warm scented nooks  walters however had framed his question injudiciously because it implied a mutual desire to escape observation and confidential relations which did not exist  i think not said millicent  i may be wanted  mrs keiths talking to challoner and wont ask for you walters objected  be goodnatured its quiet yonder  that fellow in the drawingroom cant sing and the piano makes my head ache  it really oughtnt to  the girl whos accompanying him plays well but im afraid youre not feeling very fit tonight  im not i suppose its weak but when i seem to be going back instead of picking up i get depressed  thats partly why i came for you you know how to cheer one  i feel flattered millicent rejoined smiling  but you shouldnt be downcast  youre making excellent progress  oh well he said irritably dont let us talk about my ailments im tired of them  but this lights glaring  take pity on me and come in among the flowers where its quiet and dim  millicent was tempted to agree  she liked the man and felt sorry for him he was frank rather handsome and generally a pleasant companion but she thought their friendship was ripening too fast and was not prepared to see it change to something deeper  indeed since it was pleasant to be sought after she feared she had allowed herself to drift too far and now the time to pull up had come  no she said i must stay here  he looked at her rather hard for there was decision in her tone and he was not dull  she was very attractive he liked her thoughtful expression and her gentle firmness  halfconsciously he compared her with the highly polished clever woman who had at first fascinated him and his appreciation of the girl grew stronger  mrs chudleigh who did not improve upon close acquaintance had been inclined to leave him alone of late and though he could not resent this he had an unflattering suspicion that he had somehow been made use of and had served his turn  miss graham was different she was genuine which was the word that occurred to him and he was growing fond of her  as you wish of course he said  am i allowed to remain  she indicated a place on the corner seat and when he took it began to talk carefully avoiding any personal topic but after a time he interrupted her  i heard mrs keith say she was going to the vivians in durham later i suppose she will take you  millicent said she believed so and he continued its possible i may turn up there  he watched her closely but could see nothing that suggested satisfaction  do you know the people she inquired  i used to know herbert vivian though i havent seen him for some time  no doubt if he got a hint hed ask me down  its a high bleak place said millicent  we were nearly frozen on our last visit and im afraid you wouldnt find the cold good for you were you not recommended to stay in devonshire  walters gave her a halfindignant glance  when that brute of a hill man knocked me out id no suspicion how much his shot would cost me anyhow im not going to devonshire and i ventured to think you might have been glad to see me at the vivians  why should i wish you to do an unwise thing millicent asked  thats an evasion he answered bluntly  ill be candid  this place wont be the same after you have gone  millicent was silent a moment  she knew he wanted a tacit admission that their acquaintance need not end with her visit to hazlehurst but he would be right in attaching some significance to her action if she made it  the man who had only known her a few weeks could go no further yet and he was eminently likeable but she would not lead him on  that she said was very nice of you but you will soon get used to the change  you may he replied with rather bitter humour  after all said millicent one meets pleasant people here and there and though one regrets it has to part from them  looking at her fixedly he understood  her expression was quietly resolute and he recognized that their friendship must shortly come to an end  the girl knew her mind and had obviously made it up  well  he said in a resigned tone you wont be forgotten  i must get back to india as soon as i can  by and by he went away and mrs keith joined millicent  what have you been saying to walters she asked  i met him going out and he looked very crestfallen  he hinted that he might follow us to the vivians and i suggested that it was too cold a place for him millicent answered with a blush  i see remarked mrs keith who was sometimes blunt  well i daresay you were wise though im told hell be captain shortly and he has his good points jimmy is no catch  you certainly might do better  millicent turned her head halfindignant halfembarrassed and mrs keith laughed  my dear she resumed gently im glad you have some sense  its perhaps not impossible for the wife of a young indian officer to live upon her husbands pay but unless theyre exceptional people its apt to lead to disaster  it wasnt that millicent protested unwilling to be suspected of a mercenary mind and mrs keiths eyes twinkled  then what was it that influenced you  as the girl did not answer she turned away and left her to face the question  it proved troublesome for millicent was not daunted by poverty and could find no fault with walters indeed she was sensible of some esteem for him  then though she would not admit that this was her reason for checking his advances her thoughts centred on another man  he was in disgrace but she remembered how chivalrously and adroitly he had come to her rescue in london and had again been of assistance on the st lawrence steamer  he was prompt in action pitiful and humorous  she remembered his gay buoyancy she could imagine his facing his troubles with a laugh  it was characteristic of him that he had gone up into the wilds of the frozen north with an inexperienced companion on a rash search for fortune which she gathered would probably elude him  still she knew that he would struggle gallantly against the perils and hardships he might have to face  then she remembered that by sitting alone with an abstracted air she might excite curiosity and rousing herself went to look for her hostess     chapter xxi  a new persecutor  soon after greythorpes visit mrs chudleigh went away leaving challoner unpleasantly uncertain about the course she might take  he was still without news of blake he could not question his son whose integrity he tried hard to believe in and he spent a few anxious weeks  then one evening when he came home from a neighbours house he was told that a man who had called to see him some time earlier was in the library  challoner glanced at the card his servant gave him  clarke  i dont know anybody of that name he said and then started as he saw the word sweetwater in small type at the bottom of the card  taking off his coat he went up the staircase with some eagerness  the lamps had been lighted in the library and a good fire burned on the hearth near which his visitor was comfortably seated in a big leather chair  he rose as challoner entered and the latter was not favourably impressed by him  there was a hint of grossness about the fellow which repelled the colonel who was of an ascetic type besides he was badly and carelessly dressed and challoner was fastidious in such matters also the man had an irritating air of assurance  colonel challoner i presume he said  challoner bowed  you have brought me some news of my nephew richard blake  this disconcerted clarke who had not imagined that his object would be known and had counted upon challoners being surprised when he heard it and thrown off his guard  it however looked as if the colonel had been making inquiries about blake and clarke wished he could guess his reason because it might affect the situation  that is correct he said  i have a good deal to tell you and it may take some time  signing him to be seated challoner rang a bell and wine and cigars and hothouse fruit were brought in  these he offered his guest who helped himself freely and then said your nephew spent a week in the settlement where i live preparing for a journey to the north  though his object was secret i believe he went in search of something to make varnish of because he took a young american traveller for a colour factory with him besides another man  i know this challoner replied  i heard about his american companion who was the other  we will come to him presently  there is still something which i think you do not know  then i should be glad to be informed  but first of all could you find blake if it were necessary  im doubtful the thing would be difficult clarke answered in a significant tone  he hadnt returned when i left and the country he meant to cross is rugged and covered deep with snow all winter  food is hard to get and the temperature varies from forty to fifty degrees below  i suppose it could be traversed by a properly equipped expedition  though challoners face was calm clarke inferred some anxiety to find his nephew and answered cautiously it would be possible but whether a party sent up could strike the others trail is a different matter  very well said challoner well talk of it again  go on with what you wished to say  he was suspicious for his visitors looks were not in his favour and the man gave him a keen glance  it concerns your nephews earlier history  that is of most importance to himself and me  it cant interest you  it interests me very much clarke rejoined with an ironical smile i must ask you to let me tell you what i know  challoner who thought he had better learn it consented and clarke gave him what he admitted was a very accurate account of the action on the indian frontier  now he concluded the question who gave the order to retreat is of vital importance to you  in a sense it has been answered  i think incorrectly  then if you differ from the general opinion on the matter you can let me have your theory of what occurred  it took clarke some minutes to give it and challoners heart sank for the man carefully arranged his points and the damaging inference could hardly be shirked  on the whole his account agreed with mrs chudleighs although it was more cleverly worked out but there was nothing to be learned from challoners expression  he was now not dealing with a woman who had the excuse that she was acting in her lovers interest  your suggestions are plausible but you cant seriously expect me to attach much weight to them he remarked  besides you seem to have overlooked the important fact that at the regimental inquiry the verdict was that nobody in particular was to blame  oh no clarke rejoined with a harsh laugh  i merely question its validity  i imagine that reasons which would not be officially recognized led the court to take a lenient view but what of that blake had to leave the army a ruined man and ive good reason for knowing what an acquittal like his is worth  he paused a moment  i may as well tell you candidly because its probable that youll make inquiries about me  well id won some reputation as a medical specialist when i became involved in a sensational police caseyou may recollect it  challoner started  yes he said  so you are the man  i think nothing was actually proved against you  no said clarke drily there was only a fatal suspicion  as it happens i was innocent but i had to give up my profession and my life was spoiled  theres no reason why you should be interested in this and i mentioned it merely because a similar misfortune has befallen richard blake  the point of course is that it has done so undeservedly  i think you must see who the real culprit is  ill admit that you have told me a rather likely tale  as you dont speak of having been in india who gave you the information  blakes companion the man ive mentioned a former indian officer called benson  his full name please  clarke gave it him and challoner crossing the floor took a book from a shelf and turned it over by a lamp  yes hes here  what led him to talk of the thing to an outsider  drink said clarke  ill own to having taken advantage of the condition he was often in  challoner sitting down coolly lighted a cigar  his position seemed a weak one but he had no thought of surrender  well you have given me some interesting information but theres one thing you havent mentioned and that is your reason for doing so  cant you guess  i shouldnt have suspected you of being so diffident but i daresay you thought this was a chance of earning some money easily  yes said clarke  for five thousand pounds ill undertake that no word of what ive told you will ever pass my lips again  youre not flattering  do you suppose id pay five thousand pounds to see my nephew wronged  i believe you might do so to save your son  challoner who wished to lead the man on and learn something about his plans made a negative sign  out of the question  then ill make you an alternative offer and its worth considering take or get your friends to subscribe for ten thousand pounds worth of shares in a commercial syndicate im getting up and youll never regret it  if you wish ill make you a director so you can satisfy yourself that the money will be wisely spent  youll get it back several times over  challoner laughed  this is to salve my feelings to make the thing look like a business transaction  no said clarke leaning forward and speaking eagerly  its a genuine offer and ill ask your attention for a minute or two canadas an undeveloped country we have scarcely begun to tap its natural resources and theres wealth ready for exploitation all over it  we roughly know the extent of the farming land and the value of the timber but the minerals still to a large extent await discovery while perhaps the most readily and profitably handled product is oil now i know a belt of country where its oozing from the soil and with ten thousand pounds ill engage to bore wells that will give a remarkable yield  his manner was impressive and though challoner had no cause to trust him he thought the man sincere  one understands that in canada all natural commodities belong to the state and any person discovering them can work them on certain terms it seems to follow that if your knowledge of the locality is worth anything it must belong to you alone  how is it that nobody else suspects the belt contains oil  a shrewd objection but easily answered  the country in question is one of the most rugged tracts in canada difficult to get through in summer while the man who enters it in winter runs a serious risk  now ill allow that what you know about me is not likely to prejudice you in my favour but on your promise to keep it secret ill give you information that must convince you  why dont you make your offer to some company floater or stockjobber  clarke smiled in a pointed manner  because ive a damaging record and no friends to vouch for me  i came here because i felt i had some claim on you  you were mistaken said challoner drily  hear me out try to consider my proposition on its merits  for a number of years ive known the existence of the oil and have tried to prospect the country  it was difficult to transport enough food and tools meant a costly expedition and the attracting of undesirable attention  i went alone living with primitive russian settlers and afterwards with the indians  to gain a hold on them i studied the occult sciences and learned tricks that impose upon the credulous  to the white men im a crank to the indians something of a magician but my search for the oil has gone on and now while i already know where boring would be commercially profitable im on the brink of tapping a remarkable flow  what will you do if it comes up to your expectations challoner asked for he had grown interested  turn it over to a company strong enough to exact good terms from the american producers or failing that to work the wells  then id go back to london where with money and the standing it would buy me id take up my old profession  i believe ive kept abreast of medical progress and could still make my mark and reinstate myself  it has been my steadfast object ever since i became an outcast ive schemed and cheated to gain it besides risking my life often in desolate muskegs and the arctic frost  now i ask you to make it possible and you cannot refuse  challoner was silent for a minute or two while clarke smoked impassively  the former knew he had a determined man to deal with and believed moreover that he had spoken the truth  still the fellow although in some respects to be pitied was obviously a dangerous rascal embittered and robbed of all scruples by injustice  there was something malignant in his face that testified against him and worse than all he had come there resolved to extort money as the price of his connivance in a wrong  well clarke said breaking the pause  so far as i can judge your ultimate objects creditable but i cant say as much for the means you are ready to employ in raising the money if you go on with the scheme it must be without any help of mine  clarkes face grew hard and there was something forbidding in the way he knitted his brows  think  have you gauged the consequences of your refusal  its more to the purpose that ive tried to estimate the importance of your version of what happened during the night attack  it has one fatal weakness which you seem to have overlooked  ah said clarke with ironical calm  you will no doubt mention it  you suggest blakes innocence but you must be content with doing so you cannot prove it in the face of his denial  to challoners surprise clarke smiled  so you have seen that  the trouble is that your nephew may never have an opportunity of denying it  he left for the north very badly equipped and he has not come back yet  then he rose with an undisturbed air  well as it seems we cant come to terms i neednt waste my time and its a long walk to the station  i must try some other market and while i think you have made a grave mistake that is your affair  challoner let him go and afterwards sat down to think  there had been nothing forcible or obviously threatening in the mans last few remarks but their effect was somehow sinister  challoner wondered whether he had done well in suggesting that blakes denial would prove clarkes greatest difficulty  after all he had a strong affection for his nephew who might be in danger and knew that the wilds of northern canada might prove deadly to a weak party unprovided with proper sledges and stores  still something might perhaps be done and by and by he wrote a letter to a friend who had once made an adventurous journey across the frozen land     chapter xxii  clarke modifies his plans  a bitter wind swept the snowy prairie and the cold was arctic when clarke shivering in his furs came into sight of his homestead as he walked back from sweetwater  he had gone there for his mail which included an english newspaper and had taken supper at the hotel  it was now about two hours after dark but a full moon hung in the western sky and the cluster of wooden buildings formed a shadowy blur on the glittering plain  there was no fence not a tree to break the white expanse that ran back to the skyline and it struck clarke who had lately returned from england that the place looked very dreary  he walked on with the fine dry snow the wind whipped up glistening on his furs and on reaching the homestead went first to the stable  it was built of sod which was cheaper and warmer than sawn lumber and lighting a lantern he fed his teams  the heavy clydesdales and lighter driving horses were all valuable for clarke was a successful farmer and had found that the purchase of the best animals and implements led to economy though it was said he seldom paid the full market price for them  he had walked home because it was impossible to keep warm driving and felt tired and morose  the man had passed his prime and was beginning to find the labour he had never shirked more irksome than it had been while he dispensed with a hired hand in winter when there was less to be done  clarke neglected no opportunity of saving a dollar  when he had finished in the stable he crossed the snow to the house which was dark and silent  after the bustle and stir of london where he had spent some time it was depressing to come back to the empty dwelling and he was glad that he had saved himself the task of getting supper  shaking the snow from his furs he lighted the lamp and filled up the stove before he sat down wearily  the small room was not a cheerful place in which to spend the winter nights alone though he remembered that for a number of years he had not noticed this  walls and floor were uncovered and roughly boarded with heatcracked lumber the stove was rusty and gave out a smell of warm iron while a black distillate had dripped from its pipe  there were however several wellfilled bookcases and one or two comfortable chairs  clarke lighted his pipe and drawing his seat as near the stove as possible opened an english newspaper which contained some news that interested him  a short paragraph stated that captain bertram challoner then stationed at delhi had received an appointment which would shortly necessitate his return from india  this clarke imagined might be turned to good account but the matter demanded thought and for a time he sat motionless deeply pondering  his farming had prospered though the bare and laborious life had tried him hard and he had made some money by more questionable means lending to unfortunate neighbours at extortionate interest and foreclosing on their possessions  no defaulter got any mercy at his hands and shrewd sellers of seed and implements took precautions when they dealt with him  his money however would not last him long if he returned to england and attempted to regain a footing in his profession and he had daringly schemed to increase it  glancing across the room his eyes rested on a bookcase with a curious smile  it contained works on hypnotism telepathy and psychological speculations in general and he had studied some with ironical amusement and others with a quickening of his interest  amidst much that he thought of as sterile chaff he saw germs of truth and had once or twice been led to the brink of a startling discovery  there the elusive clue had failed him though he felt that strange secrets might be revealed some day  after all the books had served his purpose as well as kept him from brooding when he sat alone at nights while the icy wind howled round his dwelling  he passed for a sage and something of a prophet with the primitive dubokars his indian friends regarded him as a medicine man and both had unknowingly made his search for the petroleum easier then contrary to his expectations he had found speculators in london willing to venture a few hundred pounds on his scheme but the amount was insufficient and the terms were exacting  it would pay him better to get rid of his associates  he was growing old it would be too late to return to his former life unless he could do so soon but he must make a fair start with ample means  the man had no scruples and no illusions money well employed would buy him standing and friends people were charitable to a man who had something to offer them and the blot upon his name must be nearly forgotten  first of all however the richest spot of the oil field must be found and money enough raised to place him in a strong position when the venture was put on the market  he had failed to extort any from challoner but he might be more successful with his son  the man who was weak enough to allow his cousin to suffer for his fault would no doubt yield to judicious pressure  it was fortunate that bertram challoner was coming to england because he could be more easily reached  this led clarke to think of blake since he realized that challoner was right in pointing out that the man was his greatest difficulty  if blake maintained that the fault was his nothing could be done it was therefore desirable that he should be kept out of the way  there was another person to whom the same applied clarke had preyed on bensons weakness but if the fellow had overcome it and returned to farm industriously his exploitation would be no longer possible  on the other hand if he failed to pay off his debts clarke saw how he could with much advantage seize his possessions  thus both blake and benson were obstacles and now they had ventured into the icy north it would be better if they did not reappear  clarke refilled his pipe and his face wore a sinister look as he took down a rather sketchy map of the wilds beyond the prairie belt  after studying it for a time he sank into an attitude of concentrated thought  the stove crackled its pipe glowing red driving snow lashed the shiplap walls and the wind moaned drearily about the house  its occupant was however oblivious to his surroundings and sat very still in his chair with pouches under his fixed eyes and his lips set tight he looked malignant and dangerous and perhaps his mental attitude was not quite normal  close study and severe physical toil coupled with free indulgence had weakened him there were drugs he was addicted to which affected the brain and he had long been possessed by one fixed idea  by degrees it had become a mania and he would stick at nothing that might help him to carry his purpose out  when at length he got up with a shiver to throw wood into the stove as the room grew cold he thought he saw how his object could be secured  a month before clarke spent the evening thinking about them blake and his comrades camped at sunset in a belt of small spruces near the edge of the open waste that runs back to the polar sea  they were worn and hungry for the shortage of provisions had been a constant trouble and such supplies as they obtained from indians who had seldom much to spare soon ran out  once or twice they had feasted royally after shooting a big bull moose but the frozen meat they were able to carry did not last long and again they were threatened with starvation  it was a calm evening with a coppery sunset flaring across the snow but intensely cold and though they had wood enough and sat close beside a fire with their ragged blankets wrapped round them they could not keep warm  harding and benson were openly dejected but blake had somehow preserved his cheerful serenity  as usual after finishing their scanty supper they began to talk for during the day conversation was limited by the toil of the march  by and by harding took a few bits of resin out of a bag  no good he said  its common fir gum such as i could gather a carload of in the forests of michigan  guess theres something wrong with my theory about the effects of extreme cold  then he took a larger lump from a neat leather case  this is the genuine article and its certainly the product of a coniferous tree while the fellow i got it from said it was found in the coldest parts of north america seems to me we have tried all the varieties of the firs but were as far from finding what we want as when we started  hard luck benson remarked gloomily  harding broke off a fragment and lighted it  notice the smell  its characteristic  the fellow may have been right on one point said blake  when i was in india i once got some incense which was brought down in small quantities from the himalayas and i understood came from near the snowline  the smell was the same one doesnt forget a curious scent  thats so  talking about it reminds me that i was puzzled by a smell i thought i ought to know when i brought clarke out of the tepee  i remembered what it was not long since and the things significant  it was gasoline  they extract it from crude petroleum dont they  yes its called petrol on your side  clarkes out for coaloil and i guess hes struck it  then hes lucky but his good fortune doesnt concern us and we have other things to think about  what are you going to do now we dont seem able to find the gum  its a difficult question harding answered in a troubled voice id hate to go back with nothing accomplished and all my dollars spent and take to the road again  mariannas paying for this journey in many ways and i havent the grit to tell her were poorer than when i left  she wouldnt complain but when you have to live on a small commission thats hard to make its the woman who meets the bill  blake made a sign of sympathy  he had never shared hardings confidence in the success of his search and had joined in it from love of adventure and a warm liking for his comrade  well he said ive no means except a small allowance which is so tied up that its difficult to borrow anything upon it but its at your disposal as far as it goes  suppose we keep this prospecting up  if clarkes mortgage doesnt stop me i might raise a few dollars on my farm benson remarked  ill throw them in with pleasure because im pretty deep in your debt  thanks said harding  im sorry i cant agree but i wouldnt take your offer when you first made it and i cant do so now my plans a failure  anyway were doing some useless talking because i dont see how were to go on prospecting or get south again when we have only three or four days food in hand  he stated an unpleasant truth which the others had characteristically shirked for blake was often careless and benson had taken the risks of the journey with frank indifference though they had the excuse that after nearly starving once or twice they had succeeded in getting fresh supplies  now however their hearts sank as they thought of the expanse of frozen wilderness that lay between them and the settlements  well said blake theres a hudsons bay factory somewhere to the east of us  i cant tell how far off it is though it must be a long way but if we could reach it the agent might take us in  how are you going to find the place  i dont know but a hudsons bay post is generally fixed where there are furs to be got and there will no doubt be indians trapping in the neighbourhood  we must take our chances of hitting their tracks  but we cant make a long march without food benson objected  the trouble is that we cant stay here without it blake rejoined with a short laugh  this was undeniable and neither of his companions answered  they were unkempt worn out and ragged and had travelled a long way through fresh snow on short rations in the past week  ahead of them lay a vast and almost untrodden desolation behind them a rugged wilderness which there seemed no probability of their being able to cross  lured by the hope of finding what they sought they had pushed on from point to point and now it was too late to return  by and by blake got up  our best chance is to kill a caribou and this is the kind of country they generally haunt  since the sooner we look for one the better i may as well start at once  therell be a moon tonight  he threw off his blanket and picking up a marlin rifle which was their only weapon strode out of camp and as he was a good shot and tracker they let him go  it was getting dark when he left the shelter of the trees and the cold in the open struck through him like a knife  the moon had not risen yet and the waste stretched away before him its whiteness changed to a soft bluegrey  in the distance scattered bluffs rose in long dark smears but there was nothing to indicate which way he should turn and he had no reason to believe there was a caribou near the camp  as a matter of fact they had found the larger deer remarkably scarce  he was tired after breaking the trail since sunrise and the snow was loose beneath his big net shoes but he plodded towards the farthest bluff feeling that he was largely to blame for the partys difficulties  knowing something of the country he should have insisted on turning back when he found they could obtain no dogteams to transport their supplies  occasionally the hudsons bay agents and patrols of the northwest police made long journeys in arctic weather but they were provided with proper sledges and sufficient preserved food  indeed blake was astonished that he and his comrades had got so far  he had however given way to harding who hardly knew the risks he ran and now he supposed must take the consequences  this did not daunt him badly  after all life had not much to offer an outcast and though he had managed to extract some amusement from it he had nothing to look forward to  there was no prospect of his making moneyhis talents were not commercialand the hardships he could bear with now would press on him more heavily as he grew older  these considerations however were too philosophical for him to continue  he was essentially a man of action and feeling unpleasantly hungry and he quickened his pace knowing that the chance of his getting a shot at a caribou in the open was small  the moon had not risen when he reached the bluff but the snow reflected a faint light and he noticed a row of small depressions on its surface  kneeling down he examined them but there had been wind during the day and the marks were blurred  he felt for a match but his fingers were too numbed to open the watertight case and he proceeded to measure the distance between the footprints  this was an unreliable test because a big deers stride varies with its pace but he thought the tracks indicated a caribou  then he stopped without rising and looked about  close in front the trees rose in a shadowy wall against the clear blue sky there was no wind and it was oppressively still  he could see about a quarter of a mile across the open but the darkness of the wood was impenetrable and its silence daunting  the row of tracks was the only sign of life he had seen for days  while he listened a faint howl came out of the distance and was followed by another  after the deep silence the sound was startling and there was danger in it for blake recognized the cry of the timber wolves  the big grey brutes would make short work of a lonely man and his flesh crept as he wondered whether they were on his trail  on the whole it did not seem likely though they might get scent of him and rising to his feet he felt that the rifle magazine was full before he set off at his highest speed  the snow was loose however and his shoes packed and sank his breath got shorter and he began to feel distressed  there was no sound behind him but that somehow increased his uneasiness and now and then he anxiously turned his head  nothing moved on the sweep of bluegrey shadow and he pressed on knowing how poor his speed was compared with that the wolves were capable of making  at length it was with keen satisfaction he saw a flicker of light break out from the dark mass of a bluff ahead and a few minutes later he came breathing hard into camp  you havent stayed out long benson remarked  i suppose you saw nothing  i heard wolves blake answered drily  you had better gather wood enough to keep a big fire going because ive no doubt theyll pick up my trail  however its a promising sign  i guess we could do without it harding broke in  ive no use for wolves  they must live on something blake rejoined  since theyre here there are probably moose or caribou in the neighbourhood  ill have another try tomorrow  but the wolves  theyre not so bold in daylight  anyhow it seems to me we must take some risks  this was obvious and when they had heaped up a good supply of wood harding and blake went to sleep leaving benson to keep watch     chapter xxiii  the caribou  when blake was awakened by harding the cold was almost unendurable and it cost him a determined effort to rise from the hollow he had scraped out of the snow and lined with spruce twigs close beside the fire  he had not been warm there and it was significant that the snow was dry but sleep had brought him relief from discomfort and he had found getting up the greatest hardship of the trying journey  in answer to his drowsy questions harding said he had once or twice heard a wolf howl in the distance but that was all and then lay down leaving blake on guard  he sat with his back to a snowbank which afforded some shelter and imagined from his sensations that the temperature must be about fifty degrees below zero  the frost bit through him stiffening his muscles until he felt that if vigorous movement were demanded of him he would be incapable of it and dulling his brain  he could not reason clearly though he had things to consider and he looked about with heavy eyes trying to forget his physical discomfort while his mind wandered through a maze of confused thought  there was a halfmoon in the sky which was pitilessly clear for cloudiness might have made it warmer when the firelight sank he could see the slender spruce trunks cutting against the silvery radiance and the hard glitter of the snow  everything was tinted with blue and white and the deathly cold colouring depressed him  then he began to consider their position which was serious  they were worn out and halffed their furs were ragged and shortage of money and the difficulty of transport had forced them to cut down their camp equipment  indeed looking back on the long march he was surprised that they had escaped crippling frostbite although both benson and harding were somewhat lame from the strain which the use of snowshoes puts upon the muscles of the leg  there was moreover a risk of this becoming dangerous  he imagined that it must be two hundred miles to the hudsons bay post and recognized that the chances were against their reaching it but just then a howl rang harsh and ominous through the frosty air and with a nervous start he reached for his rifle  the wolves had scented them and turning his back to the light he spent some minutes gazing fixedly at the glistening white patches among the straggling trees but could make out none of the stealthy flitting shapes he had half expected to see  it was encouraging that the wolves had not overcome their timidity of the fire  keen hunger might have driven them to an attack and blake had no illusions about the result of that  however since the fierce brutes were not starving they must have found something to eat and what a wolf could eat would feed men who were by no means fastidious  seeing nothing that alarmed him blake resumed his musing  their search for the gum had proved useless and he pitied harding who had staked his future upon its success  the man had not complained much but blake knew what he must feel and thought with compassion of the lonely woman who had bravely sent his comrade out and was now waiting for him in the mean discomfort of a cheap tenement  it was not difficult to imagine her anxiety and suspense  next he began to ponder his own affairs which were not encouraging though he did not think he really regretted the selfsacrificing course he had taken  his father had died involved in debt and blake suspected that it had cost challoner something to redeem the share of his mothers property which brought him in a small income  that it had been carefully tied up was not he thought enough to guard it from the blake extravagance and ingenuity in raising money  afterwards the colonel had brought him up and sent him into the army doing so with a generous affection which was very different from cold charity and demanded some return  then bertram had never been jealous of the favour shown his cousin but had given him warm friendship and blake who was much the stronger had now and then stood between the lad and harm  he had done so again in bertrams greatest need and now he must not grumble at the consequences  of late they had seemed heavier than formerly for in tempting him clarke had made a telling suggestionsuppose he married  this appeared improbable for one thing no girl he was likely to be attracted by would look with favour on a man with his reputation but he had thought a good deal about millicent graham during the weary march  he imagined that she had inherited enough of her fathers reckless character to make her willing to take a risk  she would not have a man betray his friend for an advantage that he might gain she had a courage that would help her for loves sake to tread a difficult path  still there was no reason to believe that she had any love for him or indeed that she thought of him except as a stranger to whom she had perhaps some reason to be grateful  resolutely breaking off this train of thought he threw fresh wood upon the fire and sat shivering and making plans for the march to the factory until benson relieved him  when the grey dawn broke above the trees he got up stiff with cold and after eating his share of a very frugal breakfast carefully examined his rifle  though he kept it clean of superfluous grease there was some risk of the striker and magazineslide freezing and a missfire might prove disastrous  then he glanced up between the branches and noticed the low dingy sky while he thought it was not quite so cold  im going to look for a caribou he said  ill be back by dark  well have snow said harding  if theres much youll find it hard to get home  id find it harder to do without breakfast and supper which is what may happen very soon blake rejoined  one can eat the tripe de roche which grows upon the stones but i dont know where to look for it and a northwest police trooper who once tried it told me that it made him very ill  anyway you had better take one of us along  with the axe blake said laughing  its bad enough to reach a caribou with a rifle and bensons as poor a hand at stalking as i know while a days rest may save you from getting a snowshoe leg  as we havent a sledge it would be awkward to carry you to the factory  they let him go but when he reached the open his face hardened  the sky had a threatening look the snow was soft and there were wolves about but he was comparatively safe while daylight lasted and food must be found  during the morning he saw wolf tracks but no sign of a deer and at noon sat down for a few minutes in a sheltered hollow and managed to light the halffrozen pipe he kept in an inner pocket  he had brought nothing to eat since they had decided that it would be prudent to dispense with a midday meal and getting stiffly on his feet by and by he plodded from bluff to bluff throughout the afternoon for the most part they were thin and the trees very small while so far as he could make out the country between them was covered with slabs of rocks and stones  it was utterly empty with no sign of life in it but he continued his search until the light began to fail when he stopped to look about  no snow had fallen but the sky was very thick and a stinging wind had risen while he would have trouble in reaching camp if his trail got drifted up  he knew he should have turned back earlier but there was what seemed to be an extensive wood in front and he could not face the thought of returning emptyhanded to his scanty unearned supper  the grey trees were not far away he might reach them and make a mile or two on the back trail before dark though he was weary and hunger had given him a pain in his left side  quickening his pace he neared the bluff which looked very black and shadowy against the snow though the latter was fading to a curious lifeless grey  the trees were stunted and scattered which made it possible for him to get through though there were halfcovered fallen branches which entangled his big shoes  he could see no tracks of any animal and hardly expected to do so but in a savage mood he held on without much caution until he entered a belt of broken ground strewn with rocky hillocks  here he could not see where he was going and it was almost dark in the hollows but he had found that chance sometimes favours the hunter as much as careful stalking  stopping for breath a moment half way up a steep ascent he started for a shadowy object unexpectedly appeared upon the summit  it was barely distinguishable against the background of trees but he saw the broadtined horns in an opening and knew it for a caribou  there was no time to lose since the swift creature would take flight in an instant and almost as he caught sight of it the rifle went up to his shoulder  for a moment the foresight wavered across the indistinct form and then his numbed hands grew steady and trusting that nothing would check the frostclogged action he pressed the trigger  he felt the jar of the butt a little smoke blew in his eyes and he could make out nothing on the crest of the ridge  it however seemed impossible that he had missed and next moment he heard a heavy floundering in the snow among the rocks above  he went up the slope at a savage run and plunged down a precipitous hollow on the farther side of which a halfseen object was moving through the gloom of the trees  stopping a moment he threw up the rifle and after the thin red flash the deer staggered and collapsed  running on in desperate haste he fell upon it with his hunting knife and then stopped feeling strangely limp and breathless with the long blade dripping in his hand  now the caribou lay dead before him the strain of the last few minutes made itself felt  surprised when exhausted and weak from want of food by an opportunity he had not looked for he had forced upon himself sufficient steadiness to shoot it had cost him an effort the short fierce chase had tried him hard and now the reaction had set in  for all that he was conscious of a savage exultant excitement  here was food and food meant life  his first impulse was to light a fire and feast but as he grew calmer he began to think  he was a long way from camp and feared that if he rested he could not force himself to resume the march  besides there were the wolves to reckon with and he could not escape if they followed him in the dark  prudence suggested that he should cut off as much meat as possible and after placing it out of reach in a tree set off for camp at his best speed without taking any of the raw flesh to scent the air but this was more than he could bring himself to do his comrades were very hungry and some animal might climb to the frozen meat  it was unthinkable that he should run any risk of losing the precious food  he decided to take as much as he could carry and make a depot of the rest and set to work with the hunting knife in anxious haste  it was now quite dark he could not see what he was cutting and if he gashed his hand which was numbed and almost useless the wound would not heal  then the haft of the knife grew slippery and tough skin and bone turned the wandering blade  it was an unpleasant business but he was not fastidious and he tore the flesh off with his fingers knowing that he was in danger while he worked  there were wolves in the neighbourhood and their scent for blood was wonderfully keen it was a question whether they would reach the spot before he had left it and when he stopped to clean the knife in the snow he cast a swift glance about  he could see nothing farther off than a fallen trunk about a dozen yards away beyond that the trees had faded into a sombre mass  a biting wind wailed among them and he could hear the harsh rustle of the needles but except for this there was a daunting silence  he began to feel a horror of the lonely wood and a longing to escape into the open though he would be no safer there  but to give way to this weakness would be dangerous and pulling himself together he went to work more calmly  it was difficult to reach the branches of the spruce he chose and when he had placed the first load of meat in safety he was tempted to flight  indeed for some moments he stood irresolute struggling to hold his fears in subjection and then went back for another supply he climbed the tree three times before he was satisfied that he had stored enough and afterwards gathered up as much of the flesh as he could conveniently carry  it would soon freeze but not before it had left a scent that any wolf which might happen to be near could follow  he left the wood with a steady stride refraining from attempting a faster pace than he could keep up but when he had gone a mile he felt distressed  his load which included the rifle was heavy and he had been exerting himself since early morning  the wind was in his face lashing it until the cold became intolerable the dry snow was loose and he could not find his outward trail  still he was thankful that no more had fallen and thought he knew the quarter he must make for  now he was in the open he could see some distance for the snow threw up a dim light  it stretched away before him a sweep of glimmering grey and the squeaking crunch it made beneath his shoes emphasized the silence  skirting a bluff he did not remember he stopped in alarm until a taller clump of trees which he thought he knew caught his searching eyes  if he were right he must incline farther to the east to strike the shortest line to camp and he set off breathing heavily and longing to fling away his load  cold flakes stung his face and a creeping haze obscured his view in the direction where he expected to find the next wood  he was within a hundred yards of the nearest trees when he saw them and as he left the last it was snowing hard  his heart sank as he launched out into the open for he had now no guide and having neither axe nor blanket he could not make a fire and camp in a bluff even if he could find one  it looked as if he must perish should he fail to reach the camp  the thought of the wolves no longer troubled him but when he had gone a mile or two he imagined he heard a howl behind him and quickened his speed  after that he had only a hazy recollection of floundering on passing a bluff he could not locate and here there and a white rock while the snow fell thicker and its surface got worse  then when he felt he could go no farther a faint glow of light broke out and he turned towards it with a hoarse cry  an answer reached him the light grew brighter and he was in among the trees  benson met him and in another minute or two he flung himself down exhausted by the fire  ive brought you your supper boys he said  well have a feast tonight  they ate with keen appetite and afterwards went to sleep but when they reached the wood next morning nothing was left of the caribou except the meat in the tree and a few cleanpicked bones     chapter xxiv  the factory  light snow was driving across the waste before a savage wind when the party sat at breakfast one morning a fortnight after blake had shot the caribou  they had spent the first two days enjoying a badly needed rest but the rest of the time had been passed in forced marches which severely taxed their strength  part of their way however had lain across open country for they were near the northern edge of the timber belt and the straggling trees dwarfed and bent by the wind ran east and west in a deeply indented line  in some places they boldly stretched out towards the pole in long promontories in others they fell back in wide bays which blake steering by compass held straight across and afterwards again plunged into the scrub  three days were spent in struggling through the broadest tongue but as a rule a few hours arduous march brought them out into the open  even there the ground was very rough and broken and they were thankful for the numerous frozen creeks and lakes which provided an easier road  pushing on stubbornly camping where they could find shelter and wood since they could hardly have survived a night spent without a fire in the open they had made by calculation two hundred miles and blake believed they might by a determined effort reach the hudsons bay post about nightfall  this was necessary since their strength was nearly exhausted and provisions had run out but an indian trapper whom they had met two days before had given them directions and landmarks some of which they recognized  day had broken but there was little light and blake looking out from behind a slab of rock in the shelter of which a few junipers clung thought that three or four miles would be the longest distance that he could see  this was peculiarly unfortunate because he understood that their course led across a wide untimbered stretch on the opposite side of which one or two isolated bluffs would indicate the neighbourhood of the factory  disastrous consequences might follow the missing of these woods  a pannikin of weak tea made from leaves which had already been once or twice infused stood among the embers and by and by benson who was dividing the last of the meat held up a piece  i had thought of saving this but it hardly seems worth while he said  if we make the factory well get a good supper  you dont mention what will happen if we miss it harding remarked with grim humour  anyhow that piece of meat wont make much difference  what do you think blake  blake forced a cheerful laugh  put it all in were going to make the post as a matter of fact we have to  hows the leg this morning  i dont think its worse than it was last night harding answered if im careful how i go it ought to stand another journey  he made a grimace as he stretched out the limb which was very sore for during the last few days the strain the snowshoe threw on the muscles had nearly disabled him  now he knew it would be difficult to hold out for another journey but he had grown accustomed to pain and weariness and hunger  they were he imagined the lot of all who braved the rigours of winter in the northern wilds  well said benson theres no use in carrying anything thats not strictly needful and the empty grubbag may stay behind  then heres a pair of worn out moccasins i was keeping as a stand by  i should be able to get new ones at the factory  its still some distance off harding drily reminded him  if we dont make it the chances are that i wont need the things but what about your collection of gum  nothing had been said on this point for some time but hardings face wore a curious look as he took up a bag which weighed three or four pounds  some of the stuff might be used for lowgrade varnish but thats not what im out for  ive been trying to believe that a few of the specimens might prove better on analysis but i guess its a delusion  with a quick resolute movement he threw the bag into the fire and when the resin flared up with a thick brown smoke the others regarded him with silent sympathy  this was the end of the project he had expected so much from but it was obvious that he could meet failure with fortitude  nothing that would serve any purpose could be said and they quietly strapped on their blankets  there was not much snow when they set off and fortunately the wind blew behind them but the white haze narrowed in the prospect and blake who broke the trail kept his eyes upon the compass  he was not quite sure of the right line but he had the satisfaction of knowing that he was at least going straight  after a few minutes harding glanced behind their camping place had vanished they were out in an open waste and he knew that he had started on the last march he was capable of making where it would lead him he could not tell though the answer to the question was of vital importance  for a time he thought of his wife and wondered with keen anxiety what would become of her if his strength gave way before they reached the post but he drove these cares out of his mind  it was dangerous to harbour them and served no purpose his part was to struggle on swinging the net shoes while he grappled with the pain each step caused him  he shrank from contemplating the distance yet to be covered it seemed vast to him in his weakness and he felt himself a feeble crippled thing  soft snow and arctic cold opposed his advance with malignant force but his wornout body still obeyed the spur of his will and he roused himself to fight for the life that had some value to another  he must march dividing up the distance into short stages that had less effect upon the imagination limping forward from the iceglazed rock abreast of him to the white hillock which loomed up dimly where the snow blurred the horizon  then he would again look ahead from some patch of scrub to the most prominent elevation that he could see  the marks he chose and passed seemed innumerable but the wilderness still ran on pitilessly empty in front of him  his leg was horribly painful he knew he must break down soon and they had seen nothing of a stony rise they were looking for  to find it would simplify matters because the indian had made them understand that the bluffs about the post lay nearly east of it  noon passed and they still pressed forward without a halt for there was little more than three hours daylight left and it was unthinkable that they should spend the night without food or shelter  the horizon steadily narrowed as the snow thickened there was a risk of their passing the guidingmarks or even the factory  it was nearly three oclock when harding stumbled and falling into the snow found himself unable to get up until benson helped him  in his attempt to rise he further strained his weakened leg and for a moment or two he leaned on his companion his face contorted with pain  the fall seems to have hurt you benson said sympathetically  ill have to go on harding gasped and setting his teeth strode forward made a few paces with horrible pain and then sank down on his knees  the others stopped in consternation and blake said if ive kept the right line we cant be far from the factory  im played out said harding  youll have to leave me here  if you make the post you can come back with a sledge  no blake answered shortly  how are we to find you with our trail drifting up  besides youd be frozen in a few hours  if you cant walk youll have to be carried  get hold of him benson  benson lifted him to his feet blake seized his arm and both supporting him they resumed the march  leaning on them heavily harding was dragged along and they silenced the feeble protests he made now and then  stop talking that rot  we see this out together blake told him roughly  none of them had much doubt as to what the end would be but they stubbornly held on  nothing further was said blake and bensons pinched faces were set and stern and hardings drawn up in a ghastly fashion by suffering  still their overtaxed muscles somehow obeyed the relentless call on them  at length when the light had almost gone benson stepped into a slight depression that slanted across their path  hold on he cried hoarsely  look at this  blake stooped while harding swaying awkwardly with bent leg held on to him  the hollow was small a smooth groove of slightly lower level than the rest of the snow  a sledge trail he said in an exultant voice  drifted up a bit but theyve been hauling lumber over it and that means a good deal to us he indicated a shallow furrow a foot or two outside the groove thats been made by the butt of a trailing log  the indian said there were bluffs near the post and they wouldnt haul their cordwood farther than necessary  then they were silent for a few moments overcome by relief  they had now a guide to shelter and safety but when they had gathered breath blake steadied harding who found standing difficult with his arm  we must make a move and hustle all we can he said  it will be dark in half an hour and the snow wont take long in filling up the trail  the risk of missing the factory which might be close at hand was not to be faced and they pulled themselves together for a last effort blake and benson breathing hard as they dragged harding along  the light was rapidly going now they had changed their course the snow lashed their faces making it difficult to see and they plodded forward with lowered heads and eyes fixed on the guidingline  it grew faint in places and vanished altogether after a while  then they stopped in dismay and blake went down upon his knees scraping with ragged mittens in the snow  i cant see which way it runs but it certainly doesnt end here he said  go ahead and look for it benson but dont get out of call  benson moved forward and when he faded into the cloud of driving flakes those he left behind were conscious of a keen uneasiness  they could only see a few yards it was blowing fresh and the wind might carry their voices away while if this happened the chances were against their comrades being able to rejoin them  by and by blake shouted and the answer was reassuring  they waited for a time and then when they cried out a hail came back very faintly nothing yet  keep closer blake shouted but it seemed that benson did not hear him for there was no reply  hadnt you better go after him harding suggested  no said blake shortly  it would make things worse to scatter  he raised his voice  come back before your tracks fill up  the silence that followed filled them with alarm but while they listened in strained suspense a minute or two later a faint call came out of the snow  the words were indistinguishable but the voice had an exultant note in it and blake said with deep relief he has found the trail  it was difficult to see the print of bensons shoes and harding could not move a step alone but they called out at intervals as blake slowly helped him along and at length a shadowy object loomed in front of them  as they came up benson pointed to a slight depression  we can follow it if it gets no fainter but theres no time to lose he said  it might be safer if i went first and kept my eye on the trail  he shuffled forward with lowered head while blake came behind helping harding as best he could and all three long remembered the next half hour  once or twice they lost the trail and were seized with despair but searching anxiously they found it again  at length a pale elusive light appeared amidst the snow ahead and they saw it grow clearer with keen satisfaction  when it had changed to a strong yellow glow they passed a broken white barrier which blake supposed was a ruined stockade and the hazy mass of a building showed against the snow then there was a loud barking of dogs and while they sought for the door a stream of light suddenly shone out with a mans dark figure in the midst of it  next minute they entered the house and harding lurching forward across the floor of a large room clutched at a table and then fell with a crash into a chair  after the extreme cold outside the air was suffocatingly hot and overcome by the change and pain he leaned back with flushed face and half closed eyes  his companions stood still with the snow thick upon their ragged furs and the other man shut the door before he turned to them  a rough night he said calmly  ye might as weel sit down  where do ye hail from  blake laughed as he found a seat  he imagined that their appearance must have been somewhat startling but he knew it takes a good deal to disturb the equanimity of a hudsons bay scot  from sweetwater but we have been up in the timber belt since winter set in  now we have run out of provisions and my partners lamed by snowshoe trouble  ay said the other i suspected something o the kind  but maybe yell be wanting supper  i believe if we were put to it we could eat half a caribou benson told him with a grin  its no to be had the scot answered in a matteroffact tone  i can give ye a good thick bannock and some whitefish  our stores are no so plentiful the now  they took off their furs and glanced about the place while their host was busy at the stove  the room was large its walls of narrow logs chinked with clay and moss  guns and steel traps hung upon them the floor was made of uneven boards which had obviously been split in the nearest bluff and the furniture was of the simplest and rudest description  it had however an air of supreme comfort to the famishing newcomers and after the first few minutes they found it delightfully warm  they ate the food given them ravenously and afterwards the agent brought harding some warm water and examined his leg  yell no walk far for a while im thinking he remarked  rest it on the chair here and sit ye still  harding was glad to comply and lighting their pipes they began to talk their host who told them his name was robertson was a rather hardfeatured man of middle age  im all my lone my clerks away with the breeds at the swan lake he said  where are ye making for  for the south said blake  we came here for shelter badly tired and want to hire a dog team and a halfbreed guide if possible as soon as my partners fit to travel  then we want provisions  im afraid i cannot supply ye  our stores are lowwe got few fish and caribou the year and we have not a team to spare  well said benson i dont suppose youll turn us out and wed be glad to pay for our accommodation  we have no wish to take the trail again without food or transport  robertson looked thoughtful  ye might wait a week or two and then well maybe see better what can be done  he asked them a few questions about their journey and by and by harding took the piece of gum from its case  i guess you have seen nothing like this round here  no said robertson who examined it carefully  i have made it my business to study the natural products o the district and its my opinion yell find no gum of this kind in the northern timber belt  i expect youre right  leaving furs out if the countrys rich in anything its probably minerals  theres copper and some silver but ive seen no ore that would pay for working when ye consider the transport  i dont suppose youre anxious to encourage prospecting benson suggested  robertson smiled  if there was a rich strike we would no object were here to trade and supplying miners is no quite so chancy as dealing in furs but to have a crowd from the settlements disturbing our preserves and going away after finding nothing of value would not suit us  still im thinking its no likely the distance and the winter will keep them out  did you ever see signs of oil  no here theres petroleum three hundred miles south but no enough in my opinion to pay for driving wells  onyway the two prospecting parties that once came up didna come back again  he left them presently and when they heard him moving about an adjoining room harding said well stay here for a time and then look for that petroleum on our way to the settlements  blake who agreed thought this determination was characteristic of his comrade  hardings project had failed but instead of being crushed by disappointment he was already considering another  while they talked about it robertson returned and shortly afterwards they went to sleep     chaffer xxv  the back trail  blake and his friends spent three weeks at the hudsons bay post and throughout the first fortnight an icy wind hurled the snow against the quivering building  it was dangerous to venture as far as a neighbouring bluff where fuel had been cut and one evening benson and the agent who were hauling cordwood home narrowly escaped from death in the suddenly freshening storm  none of the halfbreeds could reach the factory and robertson confessed to some anxiety about them there was little that could be done and they spent the dreary days lounging about the redhot stove and listening to the roar of the gale  in the long evenings robertson told them grim stories of the north  then there came a week of still clear weather with intense frost and when several of the trappers arrived robertson suggested that his guests had better accompany a man who was going some distance south with a dog team  he could however only spare them a scanty supply of food and they knew that a long forced march lay before them when they had left their guide  day was breaking when the dogs were harnessed to the sledge and harding and his companions shivering in their furs felt a strong reluctance to leave the factory  it was a rude place and very lonely but they had enjoyed warmth and food there and their physical nature shrank from the toil and bitter cold  none of them wished to linger in the north and harding least of all but it was daunting to contemplate the distance that lay between them and the settlements  strong effort and stern endurance would be required of them before they rested beside a hearth again  there was no wind the smoke went straight up and then spreading out hung above the roof in a motionless cloud the snow had a strange ghostly glimmer in the creeping light and the cold bit to the bone it was with a pang they bade their host farewell and followed the halfbreed who ran down the slope from the door after his team robertson was going back to sit warm and wellfed by his stove but they could not tell what hardships awaited them  their depression however vanished after a time  the snow was good for travelling the dogs trotted fast and the halfbreed grunted approval of their speed as he pointed to landmarks that proved it when they stopped at noon  after that they held on until dark and made camp among a few junipers in the shelter of a rock  all had gone well the first day hardings leg no longer troubled him and there was comfort in travelling light with their packs upon the sledge  the journey began to look less formidable and gathering close round the fire they ate their supper cheerfully while the dogs fought over the scraps of frozen fish  harding however had some misgivings about their ability to keep the pace up he thought that in a day or two it would tell on the white men  nothing disturbed their sleep which was sound for the cold has less effect on the man who is fresh and properly fed  breakfast was quickly dispatched and after a short struggle with the dogs they set out again  it was another good day and they travelled fast over a rolling tableland on which the snow smoothed out the inequalities among the rocks  bright sunshine streamed down on them the sledge ran easily up the slopes and down the hollows and looking back when they nooned harding noticed the straightness of their course  picked out in delicate shades of blue against the unbroken white surface surrounding it the sledge trail ran back with scarcely a waver to the crest of a rise two miles away  this was not how they had journeyed north with the icy wind in their faces laboriously struggling round broken ridges and through tangled woods  harding was a sanguine man but experience warned him to prepare for much less favourable conditions  it was not often the wilderness showed a smiling face  still the fine weather held and they were deep in the timber when they parted from their guide on a frozen stream which he must follow while they pushed south across a rugged country  he was not a companionable person and spoke only a few words of barbarous french but they were sorry to see the last of him when he left them with a friendly farewell  he had brought them speedily a long distance on their way but they must now trust to the compass and their own resources while the loads they strapped on were unpleasantly heavy  before this task was finished dogs and driver had vanished up the white riband of the stream and they felt lonely as they stood in the bottom of the gorge with steep rocks and dark pines hemming them in  blake glanced at the high bank with a rueful smile  there are advantages in having a good guide and we hadnt to face a climb like that all the way he said  anyhow we had better get up  it cost them some labour and after reaching the summit they stopped to look for the easiest road  ahead as far as they could see small ragged pines grew among the rocks and breaks in the uneven surface hinted at troublesome ravines  it looks rough said benson  theres rather a high ridge yonder it might save trouble to work round its end  what do you think  when im not sure said harding i mean to go straight south  benson gave him a sympathetic nod  one can understand that you have better reasons for getting back than the rest of us though ive no particular wish to loiter up here  break the trail blake due south by compass  they plunged deeper into the broken belt clambering down ravines crossing frozen lakes and snowy creeks  indeed they were thankful when a strip of level surface indicated water for the toil of getting through the timber was heavy  after two days of travel there was a yellow sunset and the snow gleamed in the lurid light with an ominous brilliance while as they made their fire a moaning wind got up  these things presaged a change in the weather and they were rather silent over the evening meal  they missed the halfbreed and the snarling dogs while it looked as if the good fortune that had so far attended them was coming to an end  next morning there was a low brooding sky and at noon snow began to fall but they kept on until evening over very rough ground and then held a council round the fire  the situation requires some thought blake remarked  first of all our provisions wont carry us through the timber belt  now the shortest course to the prairie where the going will be easier is due south but after we get there well have a long march to the settlements  id partly counted on our killing a caribou or perhaps a moose but so far weve seen no tracks  there must be some smaller beasts that the indians eat benson suggested  none of us knows where to look for them and we havent much time to spare for hunting  thats so harding agreed  whats your plan  im in favour of heading southwest  it may mean an extra hundred miles or more but it would bring us nearer the stony village and afterwards the logging camp on the edge of the timber where we might get supplies  its understood that the indians are often half starved in winter benson observed  for all that they might have had good luck and anyhow we couldnt cross the prairie with an empty grubsack  my votes for striking off to the west  harding concurred though as his leg had threatened further trouble during the last day or two he would have preferred the shorter route then blake asked him what about the petroleum  we cant stop to look for it unless we can lay in a good stock of food and i dont suppose we could do much prospecting with the snow upon the ground  he paused a moment with a thoughtful air  when we reach the settlement i must go home but if the dollars can be raised ill be back as soon as the thaw comes to try for the oil  clarkes an unusually smart man and theres no doubt hes on the trail  well raise enough money somehow benson told him and blake signified his agreement with a nod  then they dropped into casual talk which lasted until they went to sleep  when dawn came it was snowing hard and for a week they made poor progress with a bitter gale driving the flakes in their faces while rations were cut down as the distance covered daily steadily lessened hardings leg was getting sore but he did not mean to speak of this unless it was necessary  they were however approaching the neighbourhood of the indian village and blake began to speculate upon the probability of their finding its inhabitants at home  he understood that the stonies wandered about and realized with uneasiness that it would be singularly unfortunate if they were away on a hunting trip  at length after laboriously climbing the rough but gently rising slope of a long divide all one blustering day they camped on a high tableland and lay awake too cold to sleep beside a sulky greenwood fire  in the morning it was difficult to get upon their feet but as the light grew clearer the prospect they looked down upon seized their attention  the hill summits were wrapped in leaden cloud but a valley opened up below  it was wider and deeper than any they had met with since leaving the factory the bottom looked unusually level and it ran roughly south  they gazed at it in silence for a time and then harding said ive a notion that this is the valley where blake fell sick and its going to straighten out things for us if im right  thats so benson agreed  we would be sure of striking the stony village and we could afterwards follow the low ground right down to the river  with the muskegs frozen solid it ought to make an easy road  blake was conscious of keen satisfaction but there was still a doubt  well know more about it after another march he said  no snow fell that morning and as their packs were ominously light they made good speed across the hill benches and down a ravine where they scrambled among the boulders of a frozen creek  it was a grey day without the rise in temperature that often accompanies cloudiness and the light was strangely dim  rocks and pines melted into one another at a short distance and leaden haze obscured the lower valley  blake was however becoming sure it was the one they had travelled up and dispensing with the usual noon halt they pushed on as fast as possible  all were anxious to set their doubts at rest for there was now a prospect of obtaining food and shelter in a few days but they recognized no landmarks and with the approach of evening the frost grew very keen  the haze drew in closer the scattered pines they passed wailed drearily in a rising wind and the men were tired but they could see no suitable camping place and held on looking for thicker timber  it was getting dark when a belt of trees stretched across the valley and they were thinking of stopping when benson who led the way cried out  what is it harding asked  benson hesitated  well he said the thing doesnt seem probable but i believe i saw a light  anyway its gone  they stopped gazing eagerly into the gloom  a light meant that there were men not far off and after the grim desolation they had travelled through all were conscious of a longing for human society  besides the strangers would no doubt have something to eat and might be cooking a plentiful supper  there was however nothing to be seen until blake moved a few yards to one side  then he turned to benson with a cheerful laugh  you were right i can see a glimmer about a mile ahead  i wonder who the fellows are though thats not important  they set off as fast as they could go though travelling among the fallen branches and slanting trees was difficult in the dark  now and then they lost their beacon but the brightening glow shone out again and when it was visible blake watched it with surprise  it was low and he thought hardly large enough for a fire besides which it had a curious irregular flicker  drawing nearer they dipped into a hollow where they could only distinguish a faint brightness beyond the rising ground ahead which they eagerly ascended  reaching the summit they saw the light plainly but it was very small and there were no figures outlined against it  benson shouted and all three felt a shock of disappointment when he got no answer  he ran as fast as his snowshoes would let him smashing through brush floundering over snowy stones with blake and harding stumbling short of breath behind and then stopped with a hoarse cry close to the light  there was nobody about and the blaze sprang up mysteriously from the frozen ground  a blower of natural gas said harding in an excited tone  in a sense weve had our run for nothing but this may be worth a good deal more than your supper  if i had the option id trade all the natural gas in canada for a thick red moose steak and a warm place to sleep in benson savagely rejoined  anyhow it will help us to light our fire and we have a bit of whitefish and a few hard bannocks left  blake shared his comrades disappointment  he was tired and hungry and felt irritated by hardings satisfaction  for all that he chopped wood and made camp and their frugal supper was half eaten before he turned to the american  now he said you may as well tell us what you think about this gas  first of all harding answered goodhumouredly it indicates that theres oil somewhere about the two generally go together  anyhow if there were only gas it would be worth exploiting so long as we found enough of it but judging by the pressure theres not much here  what would you do with gas in this wilderness  in due time i or somebody else would build a town  fuels power and if you could get it cheap i expect youd find minerals that would pay for working  men with money in montreal and new york are looking for openings like this and no place is too remote to build a railroad to if you can ensure freight  youre the most sanguine man i ever met blake said grinning  take care your optimism doesnt ruin you  i wonder harding continued whether clarke knows about this gas and on the whole i think it probable  we cant be very far from the stony camp and theres reason to believe hes been prospecting this district  its oil hes out for  how did the thing get lighted benson asked in an indifferent tone  harding smiled as he gave him a sharp glance  he had failed in his search for the gum and did not expect his companions to share his enthusiasm over a new plan  they had however promised to support him and that was enough for he believed he might yet show them the way to prosperity  well he said i guess i cant blame you for not feeling very keen but thats not the point  i cant answer what you ask and i believe our forest wardens are now and then puzzled about how bush fires get started  we have crossed big belts of burnt trees in a country where we saw no signs of indians  if this blower has been burning long the stonies must have known of it blake remarked  isnt it curious that no news of it has reached the settlements  im not sure harding rejoined  they may venerate the thing and anyway theyre smart in some respects  they know that where the white men come their people are rounded up on reserves and i guess theyd sooner have the whole country to themselves for trapping and fishing then clarke may have persuaded them to say nothing  its possible blake said thoughtfully  well push on for their camp first thing tomorrow     chapter xxvi  the rescue  starting at daybreak they reached a hillside overlooking the stony village on the third afternoon  surrounded by willows and ragged spruces the conical tepees rose in the plain beneath but blake who was leading stopped abruptly as he caught sight of them  they were white to the apex where the escaping heat of the fire within generally melted the snow and no curl of smoke floated across the clearing  the village was ominously silent and had a deserted look  im very much afraid clarkes friends are not at home he said with forced calm  well know more about it in half an hour that is if you think it worth while to go down  the others were silent a moment struggling with their disappointment they had made a toilsome journey to reach the village their food was nearly exhausted and it would cost them two days to return to the valley which was their best road to the south  then harding said now were here we may as well spend another hour over the job  its possible they havent packed all their stores along  his companions suspected that they were wasting time but they followed him down hill until benson who was a short distance to one side of them called out  when they joined him he indicated a row of footsteps leading up the slope  that fellow hasnt been gone very long there was snow yesterday he said  by the line he took he must have passed near us  i wonder why he stayed on after the others  blake examined the footsteps carefully and compared them with the impress of his own snowshoes  its obvious that they cant be older than yesterday afternoon he said  from their depth and sharpness i should judge that the fellow was carrying a good load which probably means that he meant to be some time gone  the stride suggests a white man  clarke said harding  he seems to be up here pretty often though i cant see how hed do much prospecting in the winter  its possible blake rejoined  anyhow the point doesnt seem to matter and im anxious to find out whether theres anything to eat in the tepees  they hurried on and discovered only a few skins in the first tent then separating they eagerly searched the rest without result and when they met again were forced to the conclusion that there was no food in the place  it was about three oclock and a threatening afternoon  the light was dim and a savage wind blew the snow about they stood with gloomy faces in the shelter of the largest tepee feeling that luck was hard against them  these northern indians have often to put up with short commons while the snow lies benson remarked  no doubt they set off for some place where games more plentiful when they found their grub running out and as theyve all gone the chances are that they wont come back soon  weve had our trouble for nothing but we may as well camp here with a big fire going one could make this tepee warm  the others felt strongly tempted to agree  the cold had been extreme the last few nights and weary and scantily fed as they were they craved for shelter  still they had misgivings and blake said we have wasted too much time already and theres only a few days rations in the bag  we have got to get back to the valley and ought to make another three hours march before we stop  yes harding regretfully assented i guess that would be wiser  setting off at once they wearily struggled up the hill and it had been dark some time when they made camp in a hollow at the foot of a great rock  it kept off the wind and the spruces which grew close about it further sheltered them but blake told his companions to throw up a snow bank while he cut wood  im afraid were going to have an unusually bad night and we may as well take precautions he said  his forecast proved correct for soon after they had finished supper a cloud of snow swept past the hollow and the spruces roared among the rocks above  then there was a crash and the top of a shattered tree plunged down between the men and fell on the edge of the fire scattering a shower of sparks  another foot would have made a difference to two of us said harding coolly  however its fallen where it was wanted help me heave the thing on  it crackled fiercely as the flame licked about it and sitting between the snowbank and the fire the men kept fairly warm but a white haze drove past their shelter and eddying in now and then covered them with snow  in an hour the drifts were level with the top of the bank but this was a protection and they were thankful they had found such a camping place since death would have been the consequence of being caught in the open  the blizzard gathered strength but though they heard the crash of broken trees through the roar of the wind no more logs fell and by and by they went to sleep secure in the shelter of the rock  when day broke it was long past the usual hour and the cloud of driving flakes obscured even the spruces a few yards away  the hollow at the foot of the crag was shadowy and the snow had piled up several feet above the bank and lapped over at one end  still with wood enough they could keep warm and had their supplies been larger they would have been content to rest  as things were however they were confronted with perhaps the gravest peril that threatens the traveller in the norththey might be detained by bad weather until their food ran out  none of them spoke of this but by tacit agreement they made a very sparing breakfast and ate nothing at noon  when night came and the storm still raged their hearts were very heavy  it lasted three days and on the fourth morning it seemed scarcely possible to face the somewhat lighter wind and break a trail through the fresh snow  they however dare risk no further delay and strapping on their packs struggled up the range  at nightfall they were high among the rocks and it was piercingly cold but they got a few hours sleep in a clump of junipers and struck the valley late next day  finding shelter they made camp and after dividing a small bannock between them sat talking gloomily  their fire had been lighted to lee of a cluster of willows and burned sulkily because the wood was green  pungent smoke curled about them and they shivered in the draughts  how far do you make it to the logging camp benson asked  im taking it for granted that the lumber gangs still there  a hundred and sixty miles said blake  and we have food enough for two days say forty miles  about that it depends upon the snow  benson made no answer and harding was silent a while sitting very still with knitted brows  then he said i cant see any way out  can you  well said blake quietly well go on as long as we are able though i havent had a rosy time ive faith in my luck  conversation languished after this but they had a small cake of tobacco left and sat smoking and hiding their fears while the wind moaned among the willows and thin snow blew past  the camp was exposed and hungry and dejected as they were they felt the stinging cold after an hour of moody silence harding suddenly leaned forward with a lifted hand  whats that he said sharply  didnt you hear it  for a few moments the others only heard the rustle of the willows and the swishing sound of driven snow then a faint patter caught their ears and a crack followed like the snapping of a whip  a dog team cried benson and springing to his feet set up a loud shout  it was answered in english and while they stood shaken by excitement and intense relief several low shadowy shapes emerged from the gloom then a tall figure appeared and after it two more  somebody shouted harsh orders in uncouth french the dogs sped towards the fire and stopped  then their driver hurrying after them began to loose the traces while another man walked up to blake  we saw your fire and thought wed make for it he said  i see your cooking outfits still lying round  its at your service blake told him  im sorry we cant offer you much supper though theres a bit of a bannock and some flour  well soon fix that said the other  guess youre up against it but our grubs holding out  he turned to the driver  come and tend to the cooking when youre through emile  though the order was given goodhumouredly there was a hint of authority in his voice and the man he spoke to quickened his movements  then another came up and while the dogs snapped at each other and rolled in the snow the halfbreed driver unloaded a heavy provision bag and filled hardings frying pan  dont spare it said the first comer  i guess these folks are hungry fix up your best menoo  sitting down by the fire shapeless in his whitened coat with his bronzed face half hidden by his big fur cap he had nevertheless a soldierly look  youll be wondering who we are he said  no blake answered smiling  i can make a guess theres a stamp on you i recognize  youre from regina  youve hit it first time  im sergeant lane rnwmp  thishe indicated his companionis private walthew  weve been up on a special patrol to copper lake and left two of the boys there to make some inquiries about the indians  now were on the back trail  he looked as if he expected the others to return his confidence and blake had no hesitation about doing so  he knew the high reputation of the royal northwest mounted police which is a force of wellmounted and carefully chosen frontier cavalry  its business is to keep order on a vast stretch of plain to watch over adventurous settlers who push out ahead of the advancing farming community and to keep a keen eye on the reserve indians  men from widely different walks of life serve in its ranks and the private history of each squadron is rich in romance but one and all are called upon to scour the windy plains in the saddle in the fierce summer heat and make adventurous sledge journeys across the winter snow  their patrols search the lonely north from hudsons bay to the mackenzie living in the open in arctic weather and the peaceful progress of western canada is largely due to their unrelaxing vigilance  blake accordingly gave a short account of his journey and explained his present straits  well said the sergeant i figure we have stores enough to see us down to the settlements all right and well be glad of your company the stronger the party the smoother the trail and after what youve told me i guess you can march  where did you find the breed benson asked  your chiefs at regina dont allow you hired packers  they surely dont  hes a hudsons bay man working his passage going back to his friends somewhere about lake winnipeg and allowed hed come south with us and take the cars to selkirk  i was glad to get him im not smart at driving dogs  we found it hard to understand the few indians we met said harding the farther north you go the worse it must be  how will the fellows you left up yonder get on  the sergeant laughed  when we want a thing done we can find a man in the force fit for the job  one of the boys i took up can talk to them in cree or assiniboine and it wouldnt beat us if they spoke hebrew or greek  theres a trooper in my detachment who knows both  benson who did not doubt this turned to private walthew whose face upon which the firelight fell suggested intelligence and refinement  what do you specialize in  farriery answered the young man who might have added that extravagance had cut short his career as veterinary surgeon in the old country  knows a horse all over outside and in sergeant lane interposed  i allow thats why they sent him when i asked for a good dog driver though in a general way our bosses arent given to joking  walthew will tell you theres a difference between physicking a horse and harnessing a sledge team  its marked walthew agreed with a chuckle  when i first tried to put the traces on i thought theyd eat me  even now i have some trouble and ill venture to remind my superior that hed be short of some of his fingers if they didnt serve us out good thick mittens  thats right said lane goodhumouredly  im sure no good at dogs if youre going to drive them you want to speak karalit or french plain english cussins no blame use  by and by emile said that supper was ready and the police watched their new acquaintances devour it with sympathetic understanding for they had more than once covered long distances on very short commons in the arctic frost  afterwards they lighted their pipes and emile being tactfully encouraged told them in broken english stories of the barrens  these were so strange and gruesome that it was only because they had learned something of the wilds that harding and his friends believed him  had  they been less experienced they would have denied that flesh and blood could bear the things the halfbreed calmly talked about  while he spoke there broke out behind the camp a sudden radiance which leaped from the horizon far up the sky  it had in it the scintillation of the diamond for the flickering brilliance changed to evanescent blue and rose from pure white light  spreading in a vast irregular arc it hung like a curtain wavering to and fro and casting off luminous spears that stabbed the dark  for a time it blazed in transcendental splendour then faded and receded dying out with unearthly glimmering far back in the lonely north  now said lane with mild approval i allow thats pretty fine  blake smiled but made no answer  he and his comrades were getting drowsy and although a stinging wind swept the camp and the green wood burned badly they were filled with a serene content  the keen bodily craving was satisfied they had eaten and could sleep while it looked as if their troubles were over  the dogs were obviously fit for travel because they were still engaged in a vigorous quarrel over some caribou bones the toil of the journey would be lightened by carrying their loads on the sledge and the party was strong enough to assist any member of it whose strength might give way  there was no reason to apprehend any difficulty in reaching the settlements and in their relief at the unexpected rescue their thoughts went no further  after the hunger and nervous strain they had borne they were blissfully satisfied with their present ease  there would be time enough by and by to consider the future  at length sergeant lane got up and shook the snow from his blanket  ive seen a better fire boys but ive camped with none at all on as cold a night he said  so far as i can figure we have grub enough but now there are three more of us we dont want to lose time  youll be ready to pull out by seven in the morning  they lay down in the most comfortable places they could find though the choice was limited and spent the night in comfort though harding was once awakened by a dog that crept up to him for warmth     chapter xxvii  a startling discovery  it was getting light next morning when the reinforced party entered a belt of thicker timber where they first clearly realized the fury of the storm  the trees were small and sprang from a frozen muskeg so that they could not be uprooted but the gale had snapped the trunks and laid them low in swaths  even in the spots where some had withstood its force the ground was strewn with split and broken branches to lee of which the snow had gathered in billowy drifts  the scene of ruin impressed the men who were forced to make long rounds in search of a passage for the sledge  about as fierce a blizzard as i remember sergeant lane remarked we were held up three days and thought ourselves lucky in making a ravine with a steep bank but the wind couldnt have been quite so strong back north a piece  thered have been two names less on the roster if wed been caught down here  harding thought this was probable  he had had a protecting rock at his back but there was no shelter in the valley from the storm that had levelled the stoutest trees  even the fourfooted inhabitants of the wilds could hardly have escaped and as he stumbled among the wreckage he thought about the man whose footsteps they had seen near the indian village  unless he had found some secure retreat he must have had to face the fury of the gale and harding felt convinced that the man was clarke  it was curious that he should have been living alone among the empty tepees but harding imagined that he was in some way accountable for the indians departure and wondered where he was going when he crossed the range  there was a mystery about the matter and if an explanation could be arrived at it would be of interest to him and his friends  even before clarke had sent them into the muskeg when he knew it was practically impassable harding had entertained a deep distrust of him  he was however called upon to help in dragging the sledge over an obstacle and the difficulties of the way afterwards occupied his attention  by and by they found clearer ground and made good progress until late in the afternoon when seeing a rocky spur running out from the hillside they headed for it to look for a sheltered camping place there was still some daylight but a cold wind had sprung up blowing the loose snow into their faces and when as they neared the spur the dogs swerved as if attracted by something the halfbreed struck the nearest beast and drove them on  that was curious said private walthew  it was old chasseur who led them off and hes not given to playing tricks  a dead mink or beaver in the snow the sergeant suggested  i didnt notice anything but theyve a keen scent  anyhow lets get into camp  they found a nook among the rocks and emile loosed the dogs and threw them some frozen fish while the rest made supper  it was a heavy lowering evening and the bitter air was filled with the murmur of the spruces as the wind passed over them  though the light was fading they kept their sharpness of outline rising black and ragged from a sweep of chill lifeless grey  when the meal was nearly finished lane looked round the camp  where are the dogs he asked  theyre very quiet  i leaf zem la bas said emile waving his hand towards a neighbouring hollow  then moving a few paces forward he exclaimed ah les coquins  looks as if theyd bolted walthew remarked  i think i know where to find them  he left the camp with emile and presently the others heard the halfbreed threatening the dogs then walthews voice reached them and there was a hoarse and urgent tone in it  springing up they ran back along the trail and found emile keeping off the dogs while walthew bent over a dark object that lay half revealed in the clawed up snow  at first harding saw only a patch or two of ragged fur that looked as if it belonged to an animal then with a shock he caught the outline of a mans shoulder and arm  the rest of the party gathered round breathless after their haste and when lane spoke there was grave authority in his voice  give me a hand boys  we have to get him out  they did so with mingled compassion and reluctance though harding was sensible of a curious strained expectation and soon the body lay clear of the snow  the dim light fell on the frozen face and blake started  its clarke he cried  sure said harding gravely  im not surprised  then you knew him lanes tone was sharp  yes benson interposed i knew him pretty well  he lived at sweetwater where were going  i can give you any particulars you want  ill ask you later  the sergeant knelt down and carefully studied the dead mans pose before he added looks as if hed been caught in the blizzard and died of exposure but thats a thing ive got to ascertain  ill want somebodys help in getting him out of this big coat  none of them volunteered but when lane gave walthew a sharp order blake and harding joined them and the latter afterwards held the fur coat  blake noticed that he folded and arranged it on his arm with what seemed needless care though he first turned his back upon the others  lane was now engaged in examining the body and the others stood watching him impressed by the scene  all round the narrow opening the spruces rose darkly against the threatening sky and in its midst the sergeant bent over the still form  it made a dark blot on the pale glimmer of the snow and the white patch of the face was faintly distinguishable in the fading light  the spruce tops stirred shaking down loose snow which fell with a soft patter and the wind blew trails of it about  i can find nothing wrong lane said at last  considering that you came across the man lying frozen after one of the worst storms you remember what did you expect to find harding asked  well said the sergeant drily its my duty to make investigations though i didnt think it likely there might have been a knife cut or a bullet hole  now one of you had better bring up the sledge  we cant break this ground without dynamite but there are some loose rocks along the foot of the spur  the sledge was brought and clarke gently placed on it wrapped in his fur coat after which they took the traces and started for the ridge where they built up a few stones above the hollow in which they laid him  it was quite dark when they had finished and lane made a gesture of relief  well he said thats done and hell lie safely there  rough on him but its a hard country and many a good man has left his bones in it  i guess well get back to camp  they crossed the snow in silence trailing the empty sledge and for a time after they reached camp nobody spoke  lane sat near the fire where the light fell upon the book in which he wrote with a pencil held awkwardly in his mittened hand while blake watched him and mused  he had no cause to regret clarkes death but he felt some pity for the man  gifted with high ability he had through no fault of his own been driven out of a profession he was keenly interested in and made an outcast  his subsequent life had been a hard and evil one but it had ended in a tragic manner and what made this more impressive blake and his companions had narrowly escaped his fate  in spite of the cheerful fire the camp had a lonely air and blake shivered as he glanced at the gleaming snow and dusky trees that shut it in  there was something in the desolate north that daunted him  hardings reflections also centred on the dead man and he had food for thought  there was a mystery to be explained and he imagined that he had a clue to it in his pocket though he could not follow it up for the present  he waited with some anxiety until lane closed his book  now said the sergeant there are one or two points i want explained and as you know the man its possible you can help me  how did he come to be here with only about three days rations  i can answer that said harding  he was in the habit of staying at the indian village we told you of  we saw tracks coming from it when we were there the day before the blizzard began  a white mans tracks  why did you go to the village  i believe they were blake replied  we went to look for provisions and didnt get them because the place was empty  then how do you account for the fellows being there alone  i cant account for it blake said quietly  lane turned to harding who had a theory but was not prepared to communicate it to the police  its certainly curious he remarked  well start for the village tomorrow  as the indians are away there wont be much to be learned benson suggested  they may have come back  anyway its my business to find out all i can  soon afterwards they went to sleep and rising an hour or two before daylight broke camp and turned back across the hills  the march was rough and toilsome and when they camped at night fatigue and drowsiness checked conversation but blakes party were sensible of a difference in lanes manner  it had become reserved and he had a thoughtful look  reaching the village one evening they were surprised to find that some of the indians had returned and after supper lane summoned them into the tepee he occupied  emile interpreted but he had some difficulty in making himself understood for which harding was inclined to be thankful  the sergeant began by explaining the authority and business of the northwest police of whom it appeared one or two of the indians had heard after which he made emile ask them if they knew clarke  one of them said they did and added that he stayed with them now and then lane next asked why they took him in and the indian hesitated  he was a big medicine man and cured us when we were ill he replied  do you know these white men lane asked indicating blakes party  an indian declared that they had never seen them though he added that it was known they were in the neighbourhood  being questioned about this he explained that about the time of clarkes arrival one of the tribe had come in from the north where he had met a halfbreed who told him that he had travelled some distance with three white men who were going to the settlements  knowing the country they had calculated that the white men could not be very far off  as he heard this harding felt anxious  he saw where lanes questions led and that the sergeant meant to sift the matter thoroughly  there was not much cause to fear that he and his friends would be held responsible for clarkes death but he suspected things he did not wish the police to guess and the indians might mention having seen a white mans footprints on the occasion when he had forcibly taken clarke away owing perhaps to their difficulty in making themselves understood nothing was however said of this and by and by lane asked  how was it you left the white man in your village by himself  the indians began to talk to one another and it was with some trouble emile at length elicited an answer  it is a thing that puzzles us said one  the white man came alone and told us he had seen tracks of caribou three days journey back  as we had no meat and our fish was nearly done six of us went to look for the deer  six of you said lane  where are the rest  these tepees would hold a good many people  they are hunting farther north answered the man  when we got to the place the white man told us of we could see no caribou tracks  as he was a good hunter we thought this strange but we went on because there was another muskeg like the one he spoke of and we might not have understood him  then the snow came and we camped until it was over and afterwards came back finding no deer  when we reached the tepees he had gone and we do not know what has become of him  we could not follow because the snow had covered his trail  he is dead lane told them  i found him frozen some days ago  their surprise was obviously genuine and lane was quick to notice signs of regret  he imagined that clarke had been a person of some importance among them  tell them i dont want them any more he said to emile and when the indians went out turned to benson  you had better give me all the information you are able about the man  benson told him as much as he thought judicious after which lane sat silent for a time  then he said there is no reason to doubt that he came to his death by misadventure  i dont quite understand what led him to visit these fellows but after all that doesnt count  it isnt very plain benson agreed  is there anything else you wish to know  no said lane looking at him steadily  you can take it that this inquiry is closed well pull out first thing tomorrow  he beckoned walthew  now were here we may as well find out what we can about these fellows and how they live  it will fill up our report and they like that kind of information at regina  when the police had left the tepee harding turned to his companions with a smile  sergeant lane is a painstaking officer but his shrewdness has its limits and there are points he seems to have missed  it would have been wiser not to have let clarkes coat out of his hands until he had searched it  ah said blake sharply  you emptied the pockets  i did i allow my action was hardly justifiable but i thought it better that the police shouldnt get on the track of matters that havent much bearing on clarkes death  i found two things and theyre both of interest to us  well take this one first  he drew out a metal flask and when he unstoppered it a pungent smell pervaded the tepee  crude petroleum he explained  i should imagine the flashpoint is low  i cant say how clarke got the stuff when the grounds hard frozen but here it is  isnt a low flashpoint a disadvantage benson asked  it must make the oil explosive  it does but all petroleums refined and the byproducts they take off which include gasoline fetch a remarkably good price  shake a few drops on the end of a hot log and well see how it lights  a fire burned in a ring of stones in the middle of the tepee and benson carefully did as he was told  hardly had the oil fallen on the wood than it burst into flame  as i thought said harding  i suspect the presence of one or two distillates that should be worth as much as the kerosene  well get the stuff analysed later but you had better stopper the flask because we dont want the smell to rouse lanes curiosity  the important point is that as ive reasons for believing the oil is fresh from the ground clarke must have found it shortly before the blizzard overtook him that fixes the locality and we shouldnt have much trouble in striking the spot when we come back again  his eyes sparkled as he concluded its going to be well worth while this is a big thing  blake did not feel much elation  his was not a mercenary nature and he had all along thought his comrade too sanguine though he meant to back him  in a way it was very hard luck for clarke he said  if youre right in your conclusions hes been searching for the oil for several years and now he was cut off just when it looks as if hed found it  you dont owe him much pity  what would have happened if we hadnt met the police  its unpleasant to think of  no doubt wed have starved to death  a sure thing said harding  it hasnt struck you that this was what he meant us to do  blake started  are you making a bold guess or have you any ground for what youre saying  i see youll have to be convinced  very well in the first place the man would have stuck at nothing and ive already tried to show you that hed something to gain by bensons death  he turned to the latter  i suspected when we took you away from him that you were running a risk  i was running a bigger one before that if you can call a thing a risk when the results inevitable benson rejoined  the pace i was going would have killed me in another year or two and even now im half afraid  he paused for a few moments with sombre face and knitted brows and then resumed thoughtfully i believe youre right harding but you havent told us how he proposed to get rid of me  im coming to that  there was however another member of this party who was in his way and he made his plans to remove you both  you mean me blake broke in  its possible but i dont altogether see how hed profit  first lets look at what he did  as soon as he reached the village he heard that we had started from the hudsons bay post  it wouldnt be difficult to calculate how long the stores we could carry would last and hed see that the chances were in favour of our calling at the village for provisions  presuming on that he sent his friends away to look for caribou which they couldnt find  recollect that they owned to being puzzled because he was a good hunter  then he cleared out by himself but i believe that if there was any food left in the place he carefully hid it  the others felt that their comrade was taking something for granted but they believed his suspicions were correct  they however made no comment and harding went on looking at blake  now ill show you how he would have profited  i found this in his pocket  he took out a letter which he gave to blake and the latter started as he recognized the writing  it was from colonel challoner to clarke  you had better read the thing its justifiable benson remarked  blake read it aloud holding the paper near the fire with the light upon his face which looked very grim  in reply to your letter i have nothing new to say and believe i have already made my intentions plain  it would be useless for you to trouble me with any further proposals  then blake folded the letter and put it into his pocket  now he said i think i see  the man had been trying to bleed the colonel and got his answer  is that all harding asked  well said blake i believe it proves your conclusions right  i wont go into particulars but where my uncle and cousin are threatened im so to speak the leading witness for the defence and it wouldnt have suited clarke to let me speak  no doubt thats why he took rather drastic measures to put me out of the way  then you never mean to question the story of the indian affair  what do you know about it blake asked curtly  harding laughed  i believe i know the true one  havent i marched and starved and shared my plans with you  if there had been any meanness in you wouldnt i have found it out  whats more benson knows what really happened and so does colonel challoner  how else could clarke have put the screw on him  he doesnt seem to have made much impression you have heard the colonels answer  blake frowned  well drop this subject  if challoner attached any importance to what you think clarke told him his first step would have been to send for me  i expect youll find a letter waiting for you at sweetwater harding rejoined  blake did not answer and soon afterwards sergeant lane came in with walthew     chapter xxviii  a matter of duty  sergeant lane sat by the camp fire in a straggling bluff a notebook in his hand while emile repacked a quantity of provisions the weight of which they had been carefully estimating  the scattered trees were small and let the cold wind in for the party had now reached the edge of the plain where the poplars began to grow  the sergeants brows were knitted for the calculations he had made were not reassuring  the time we lost turning back to the stony village has made a big hole in our grub he said  guess well have to cut the menoo down and do a few more miles a day  our partys used to that blake answered with a smile  i suggest another plan  you have brought us a long way and sweetwaters a bit off your line  suppose you give us food enough to last us on half rations and let us push on  no sir said lane decidedly we see this trip through together for another thing the dogs are playing out and after the way theyve served us i want to save them  with your help at the traces we make better time  blake could not deny this  the snow had been in bad condition for the last week and the men had relieved each other in hauling the sledge the police camp equipment was heavy but it could not be thrown away because they preferred some degree of hunger to lying awake at nights half frozen  moreover neither blake nor his comrades desired to leave their new friends and once more face the rigours of the wilds alone  then well have to make the best speed we can he said  they talked about the journey still before them for another hour  it was a clear night and very cold but with a crescent moon in the sky and no wind stirring  the fragile twigs of the birches which shot up among the poplars were still and deep silence brooded over the wide stretch of snow  by and by emile looked up with his face towards the south  ah he said you hear someting  they did not though they listened hard but the halfbreed had been born in the wilderness and they could not think him mistaken  for a minute or two his pose suggested strained attention and then he smiled  white man come from the sout  mais oui  he come sure ting  lane nodded  i guess hes right but i cant figure on the kind of outfit  then blake heard a sound which puzzled him  it was not the quick patter of a dogteam or the sliding fall of netted shoes  the noise was dull and heavy and as he knew the snow would deaden it whoever was coming could not be far away  bobsled emile exclaimed with scorn  vla la belle chose  arrive the great horse of the plough  the fellows sure a farmer since hes coming up with a clydesdale team lane said laughing  one wouldnt have much trouble in following his trail  a few minutes later three men appeared carefully leading two big horses through the trees  saw your fire a piece back said one when they had hauled up a clumsy sled  then he caught sight of blake  im mighty glad to find you we were wondering how far we might have to go  then you came up after me tom said blake who knew the man  you wouldnt have got much further with that team but who sent you  i dont quite know  it seems gardner got orders from somebody that you were to be found and he hired me and the boys  wed trouble in getting here but we allowed we could bring up more grub and blankets on the sled and wed send jake back with the team when we struck the thick bush  then we were going to make a depot and pack along the stuff we didnt cache  but ive a letter which may tell you something  blake opened it and harding noticed that his face grew intent but he put the letter into his pocket and turned to the man  its from a friend in england he said  you were lucky in finding me and well go back together in the morning  after attending to their horses the new arrivals joined the others at the fire and explained that at the hotelkeepers suggestion they had meant to head for the indian village and make inquiries on their way up at the logging camp  though blake talked to them he had a preoccupied look and harding knew he was thinking of the letter  he had however no opportunity of questioning him and waited until next day when emile whom they were helping chose a shorter way across a ravine than that taken by the police and the men with the bobsled  when they reached the bottom of the hollow blake told the halfbreed to stop and took his comrades aside  theres something i must tell you he said  it was colonel challoner who sent the boys up from the settlement with food for us and he begs me to come home at once  thats a point on which id like your opinion but you shall hear what he has to say  then sitting down upon a log he began to read from his letter  a man called clarke whom you have evidently met lately called on me and suggested an explanation of the indian affair  as the price of his keeping silence on the subject he demanded that i should take a number of shares in a syndicate he is forming for the exploitation of some petroleum wells  i think it was a good offer harding interposed  clarke must have had reason for believing he was about to make a big strike hed have kept quiet until he was sure of the thing  the fellows story was plausible blake continued reading  it seems possible that you have been badly wronged and i have been troubled  he omitted the next few lines and went on  as it happens another account of the frontier action had been given me some time earlier by a lady who has been in india  it differed from clarkes in one or two details but agreed in exonerating you and she also asked a price which i declined to pay  after giving the matter careful thought i feel that these people may have hit upon the truth it would of course afford me the keenest satisfaction to see you cleared but the thing must be thoroughly sifted because  blake stopped and added quietly he insists upon my going home  his difficulty is obvious benson remarked  if you are blameless his son must be guilty  i arrived at the former conclusion some time ago  blake who did not answer sat musing with a disturbed expression there was now no sign of the others who had left the ravine and no sound reached the men from the plain above  emile stood patiently waiting some distance off and though they were sheltered from the wind it was bitterly cold  in some ways it might be better if i went home at once he said at last  i could come back and join you as soon as i saw how things were going  the colonel would be safe from any further persecution if i were with him but all the same im inclined to stay away  why harding asked  for one thing if i were there he might insist on taking some quite unnecessary course that would only cause trouble  now said harding curtly im going to give you my opinion  i take it that your uncle is a man who tries to do the square thing  blakes face relaxed and his eyes twinkled  hes what you call white and as obstinate as theyre made  convince him that a things right and hell see it done no matter how many people it makes uncomfortable  thats why i dont see my way to encourage him  heres a man whos up against a point of honour he has i understand a long clean record and now hes prepared to take a course that may cost him dear  are you going to play a lowdown game on him to twist the truth sos to give him a chance of deceiving himself  arent you and benson taking what you mean by the truth too much for granted  harding gave him a searching look  i havent heard you deny it squarely youre a poor liar  its your clear duty to go back to england right away and see your uncle through with the thing he means to do  after all ill go to england blake answered with significant reserve  however we had better get on or we wont catch the others until theyve finished dinner  emile started the dogs and when they had toiled up the ascent they saw the rest of the party far ahead on the great white plain  we maynt have another chance of a private talk until we reach the settlement said blake  what are you going to do about the petroleum  ill come back and prospect the muskeg as soon as the frost goes  it will cost a good deal to do that thoroughly  we must hire transport for a full supply of all the tools and stores we are likely to need one experience of the kind weve had this trip is enough  how are you going to get the money  im not going to the city men for it until our positions secure  the thing must be kept quiet until were ready to put it on the market  you were doubtful about taking me for a partner once benson interposed  i dont know that i could blame you but now i mean to do all i can to make the scheme successful and i dont think youll have as much reason for being afraid that i might fail you  call it a deal said harding  youre the man we want  well said blake i ought to be out again before you start and if i can raise any money in england ill send it over  youre satisfied that this is a project i can recommend to my friends  i believe its such a chance as few people ever get harding answered in a tone of firm conviction  then well see what can be done  it wont be your fault if the venture fails  harding smiled  theres hard work and perhaps some trouble ahead but you wont regret you faced it  youll be a rich man in another year or two  then emile urged the dogs and they set off after the others as fast as they could go  sweetwater was safely reached but on the morning after his arrival there blake pushed on south for the railroad with the police and a week later caught a steamer in montreal  on landing he took the first train to shropshire but before going on to sandymere called at hazlehurst where he had learned that mrs keith was staying  as it happened mrs keith was out with mrs foster and millicent was the first to welcome him  she started when he was shown into the hall and dropping the book she was reading rose with a tingle of heightened colour while he felt his heart beat fast  it was a clear winter afternoon and the sunshine that entered a window fell upon the girl  blake thought she looked very beautiful and thrown off her guard as she had been he caught the gladness in her eyes before she could hide it  i expect you are surprised at my turning up he remarked  yes she said with a shyness she could not overcome  indeed i was startled when you came in but of course its pleasant to see you safely back  i knew colonel challoner had given orders for you to be traced if possible and that you had been found but that was all mrs keith told me  i suppose she didnt knowdidnt think i meanthat i was interested  id like to believe that was foolish of her blake answered with a twinkle  millicent laughed though she felt that his rejoinder did not adequately express his feelings his humorous manner set her at ease  it really was foolish she said smiling  but you must have some tea and wait until she comes  i dont think she will be long  the tea was brought and she studied him unobtrusively as he sat opposite her at the small table  he had grown thin his bronzed face was worn and he looked graver than he had done  though she could not imagine his ever becoming very solemn it was obvious that something had happened in canada which had had its effect on him  looking up suddenly from his plate he surprised her attentive glance  you have changed she said  thats not astonishing blake replied  we didnt get much to eat in the wilds and i was thinking how pleasant it is to be back again  he examined his prettily decorated cup  its remarkable how many things one can do without  in the bush we drank our tea when we had any out of a blackened can and the rest of our table equipment was to match  but well take it that the change in me is an improvement  it was an excuse for looking at her as if demanding a reply but she answered readily in a sense it is  then i feel encouraged to continue starving myself  theres a limit extremes are to be avoided millicent rejoined but did you starve yourselves in canada  i must confess that the thing wasnt altogether voluntary  im afraid we were rather gluttonous when we got the chance  did you find what you were looking for  no said blake who saw that she was interested  i think it was a serious disappointment for harding and i was very sorry for him at first  so am i said millicent  it must have been very hard after leaving his wife alone and badly provided for and risking everything on his success  but why did you say you were sorry for him  arent you sorry now  though we didnt find what we were looking for we found something else which harding seems firmly convinced is quite as valuable  of course hes a bit of an optimist but it looks as if he were right this time  anyway im plunging on his scheme  you mean you will stake all you have on it  thats it blake agreed with a humorous twinkle  its true that what i have doesnt amount to much but im throwing in what i would like to get and thats a great deal  there was something of a hint in his manner and she noticed his expression suddenly grow serious  it seemed advisable to choose another topic and she said you must have had adventures  tell me about them  oh he protested theyre really not interesting  let me judge  is it nothing to have gone where other men seldom venture  he began rather awkwardly but she prompted him with tactful questions and he saw that she wished to hear his story  by degrees he lost himself in his subject and being gifted with keen imagination she followed his journey into the wilds  it was not his wish to represent himself as a hero and now and then he spoke with deprecatory humour but he betrayed something of his character in doing justice to his theme  millicents eyes sparkled as she listened for she found the story moving he was the man she had thought him capable of grim endurance determined action and steadfast loyalty  so you carried your crippled comrade when you were exhausted and starving she said when he came to their search for the factory  one likes to hear of such things as that  but what would you have done if you hadnt found the post  i cant answer he said soberly  we durst not think of it a starving mans will gets weak  then his expression grew whimsical besides if one must be accurate we dragged him  still said millicent softly i cant think you would have left him  he looked at her with some embarrassment and then smiled  im flattered miss graham but you really havent very strong grounds for your confidence in me  supposing he was thinking of his disgrace she made a gesture of half scornful impatience  well she said please go on with the tale  the rest of it had its interest though he made no reference to clarkes treachery and millicent listened with close attention  it was growing dark but they had forgotten to ring for lights neither of them heard the door open when he was near the conclusion and mrs keith entering quietly with mrs foster stopped a moment in surprise the room was shadowy but she could see the man leaning forward with an arm upon the table and the girls intent face  there was something that pleased her in the scene  then as she moved forward millicent looked up quickly and blake rose  so you have come back said mrs keith giving him her hand  how was it you didnt go straight to sandymere where your uncle is eagerly waiting you  i sent him a telegram as soon as the steamer was boarded but on landing found there was an earlier train  as he wont expect me for another two hours i thought id like to pay my respects to you  it sounds plausible mrs keith rejoined with rather dry amusement well im flattered and as it happens ive something to say to you  then mrs foster joined them and it was some time later when mrs keith took blake into the empty drawingroom  im glad you have come home she said  i think you are needed  that said blake is how it seemed to me  his quietness was reassuring  mrs keith knew he was to be trusted but she felt some misgivings about supporting him in a line of action that would cost him much  still she could not be deterred by compassionate scruples when there was an opportunity of saving her old friend from suffering  troubled by a certain sense of guilt but determined she tried to test his feelings  you didnt find waiting for us tedious she remarked  i suppose you were telling millicent about your adventures when we came in playing othello and she seemed to be listening as desdemona did  i expect she was exercising a good deal of patience blake rejoined with a laugh  anyway since you compare me to the moor you must own that ive never pretended to be less black that im painted  ah said mrs keith with marked gentleness you neednt pretend to me  i have my own opinion about you and if it doesnt agree with other peoples so much the worse for theirs  i knew you would come home as soon as you could be found  then you must know what has been going on in my absence  i have a strong suspicion  your uncle has been hard pressed by unscrupulous people with an end to gain  how much impression they have made on him i cannot tell but hes fond of you dick and in trouble its a cruel position for an honourable man with traditions like those of the challoners behind him  thats true i hate to think of it  you know what i owe to him and bertram  hes old continued mrs keith  it would be a great thing if he could be allowed to spend his last years in quietness but i fear thats impossible although perhaps to some extent it lies in your hands  then she looked steadily at blake  now you have come back what do you mean to do  whatever is needful im for the defence  the colonels position cant be stormed while im on guard and this time therell be no retreat  dont add that dick it hurts me  im not so hard as i sometimes pretend  i never doubted your staunchness but i wonder whether you quite realize what the defence may cost you  have you thought about your future  you ought to know that the blakes never think of the future  were a happygolucky irresponsible lot  but suppose you wished to marry  he smiled at her  its a difficulty that has already been pointed out  if i ever marry the girl i choose will believe in me in spite of appearances  in fact shell have to ive no medals and decorations to bring her  you have much thats worth more mrs keith exclaimed moved by his steadfastness  still its a severe test for any girl  then she laid her hand gently on his arm  in the end you wont regret the course you mean to take  i have lived a long while and have lost many pleasant illusions but i believe that loyalty like yours has its reward  i loved you for your mothers sake when you were a boy afterwards when things looked blackest i kept my faith in you and now im proud i did so  blake looked confused  confidence like yours is an embarrassing gift it makes one feel one must live up to it and that isnt easy  mrs keith regarded him affectionately  its yours dick given without reserve  but i think theres nothing more to be said and no doubt youre anxious to get away  besides the colonel will be expecting you  he used to be seriously annoyed if he had to wait for dinner and ive been here some time blake answered laughing and went out to take leave of mrs foster     chapter xxix  blake holds his ground  dinner was finished at sandymere miss challoner had gone out and in accordance with ancient custom the cloth had been removed from the great mahogany table  its glistening surface was only broken by a decanter two choice wineglasses and a tall silver candlestick there were lamps in other parts of the room but challoner liked candles  lighting a cigar blake looked about while he braced himself for the ordeal that must be faced  he knew the big room well but its air of solemnity with which the heavy georgian furniture was in keeping impressed him  the ceiling had been decorated by a french artist of the eighteenth century and the faded delicacy of the design bearing as it did the stamp of its period helped to give the place a look of age  challoner could trace his descent much further than his house and furniture suggested but the family had first come to the front in the east india companys wars and while maintaining its position afterwards had escaped the modernizing influence of the countrys awakening in the early victorian days  it seemed to blake fresh from the new and democratic west that his uncle shrewd and wellinformed man as he was was very much of the type of wellingtons officers  for all that he pitied him  challoner looked old and worn and there were wrinkles that hinted at anxious thought round his eyes  his life was lonely and his unmarried sister who spent much of her time in visits was the only relative who shared his home  now that age was limiting his activities and interests he had one great source of gratification the career of the soldier son who was worthily following in his steps  his nephew determined that this should be saved for him as he remembered the benefits he had received at his hands  by and by challoner filled the glasses  dick he said im very glad to see you home  i should like to think you have come to stay  thank you sir  ill stay as long as you need me  i feel i need you altogether  its now doubtful whether bertram will leave india after all  his regiment has been ordered into the hills where theres serious trouble brewing and he has asked permission to remain  even if he comes home he will have many duties and i have nobody left  blake did not answer immediately and his uncle studied him  dick had grown thin but he looked very hard and the evening dress set off his fine muscular figure  his face was still somewhat pinched but its deep bronze and the steadiness of his eyes and firmness of his lips gave him a very soldierly look and a certain air of distinction  there was no doubt that he was true to the challoner type  then blake said slowly i must go back sooner or later sir there is an engagement i am bound to keep  besides your pressing me to stay raises a question  the last time we met you acquiesced in my decision that i had better keep out of the country and i see no reason for changing it  the question must certainly be raised that is why i sent for you you can understand my anxiety to learn what truth there is in the stories i have heard  it might be better if you told me all about it  very well the task is painful but it cant be shirked  well take the womans tale first  challoner carefully outlined mrs chudleighs theory of what had happened during the night attack and blake listened quietly  now he said you might give me clarkes account  challoner did so and concluded both these people have an obvious end to serve and i daresay theyre capable of misrepresenting things to suit it  ill confess i found the thought comforting but i want the truth dick  i must do whats right  in the first place clarke who once approached me about the matter will never trouble either of us again  i helped to bury him up in the wilds  dead exclaimed challoner  frozen  in fact it was not his fault we escaped his fate  he set a trap for us intending that we should starve  but why  his motive was obvious blake rejoined  there was a man with us whose farm and stock would in the event of his death fall into clarkes hands and its clear that i was a serious obstacle in his way  cant you see that he couldnt use his absurd story to bleed you unless i supported it  challoner felt the force of this  he was a shrewd man but just then he was too disturbed to reason closely and failed to perceive that his nephews refusal to confirm the story did not necessarily disprove it that clarke had thought it worth while to attempt his life bulked most largely in his uncles eye  he urged me to take some shares in a petroleum syndicate he remarked  then i believe you missed a good thing sir  blake seized upon the change of topic  the shares would probably have paid you well  i thought he proposed it to make the thing look better in fact to give me something to salve my conscience with  anyway he found the oil and put us on the track of it though i dont suppose he had any wish to do the latter  we expect to make a good deal out of the discovery  it looks like justice said challoner  but we are getting away from the point  id better tell you that after my talk with the man i felt he might be dangerous and that i must send for you  why didnt you send for bertram  challoner hesitated  when i cabled out instructions to find you there was no word of his leaving india then you must see how hard it would have been to hint at my suspicions  this would have opened a breach between us that could never be closed  yes said blake leaning forward on the table and speaking earnestly your reluctance was very natural  im afraid of presuming too far but i cant understand how you could believe this thing of your only son  it lies between my son and my nephew dick  there was emotion in the colonels voice  i had a great liking for your father and i brought you up  then i took a keen pride in you there were respects in which i found you truer to our type than bertram  you heaped favours on me blake replied  that i bitterly disappointed you has been my deepest shame in fact its the one thing that counts  for the rest i cant regret the friends who turned their backs on me and poverty never troubled the blakes  but the taintthe stain upon your name  i have the advantage of bearing it alone and to tell the truth it doesnt bother me much  that a man should go straight in the present is all they ask in canada and homeless adventurers with no possessions which is the kind of comrades ive generally met are charitable  as a rule it wouldnt become them to be fastidious anyhow sir you must see the absurdity of believing that bertram could have failed in his duty in the way these tales suggest  i once felt that strongly the trouble is that the objection applies with equal force to you  your mother had a resolute character your father was a daring man  blake coloured as he answered im glad you mentioned this my parents cant be held responsible for my faults  you must know that rather surprising variations are apt to appear in a family strain  its possible im what gardeners call a sport a throwback to some inferior type  there may have been a weakling even among the challoners  i have dreaded that there was one in the present generation the colonel answered with stern gravity  but we get no farther  do you deny the stories these people have told me  blake felt that his task was hard  he had to convict himself and must do so logically since challoner was by no means a fool  as he nerved himself to the effort he was conscious of a rather grim amusement  i think it would be better if i tried to show you how the attack was made  is the old set of indian chessmen still in the drawer  i believe so  it must be twenty years since they were taken out its strange you should remember them  a stirring of halfpainful emotions troubled blake  he loved the old house and all that it contained and had a deepseated pride in the challoner traditions  now he must show that he was a degenerate scion of the honoured stock and could have no part in them  i have forgotten nothing at sandymere but we must stick to the subject  crossing the floor he came back with the chessmen which he carefully arranged setting up the white pawns in two separate ranks to represent bodies of infantry with the knights and bishops for officers  the coloured pieces he placed in an irregular mass  now he continued this represents the disposition of our force pretty well and ive good reason for remembering it  i was here at the top of the ravinehe laid a cigar on the table to indicate the spotbertram on the ridge yonder  this bunch of red pawns stands for the ghazee rush  it agrees with what ive heard said challoner surveying the roughly marked scene of battle with critical eyes  you were weak in numbers but your position was strong  it could have been held  well take mrs chudleighs suggestion first  blake began to move the pieces  the ghazees rolled straight over our first line my mine which might have checked them wouldnt go off a broken circuit in the firing wires i suppose  we were hustled out of the trenches it was too dark for effective rifle fire  the trench the second detachment held should have been difficult to rush  oh well said blake you must remember that the beggars were ghazees theyre hard to stop  then our men were worn out and had been sniped every night for the last week or two  however the buglers the key to my explanation ill put this dab of cigar ash here to represent him  this bishops bertram and you can judge by the distance whether the fellow could have heard the order to blow cease fire through the row that was going on  he resumed his quick moving of the chessmen accompanying it by a running commentary  heres another weak point in the womans tale which must be obvious to any one who has handled troops these fellows couldnt have gained a footing in this hollow because it was raked by our fire  there was no cover and the range was short  then you see the folly of believing that the section with which the bugler was could have moved along the ridge they couldnt have crossed between the ghazees and the trench  theyd have been exposed to our own fire in the rear  he added more to much the same effect and concluded i think that disposes of mrs chudleighs theory  challoner made a sign of agreement without speaking and blake lighting a fresh cigar leaned back in his chair  he believed he had succeeded so far but he was feeling the strain  now ill deal with clarkes suggestion its certainly ingenious he said presently and began to rearrange the chessmen  proceeding much as he had already done he followed the movements of the pieces with short explanations and when he finally swept them up into a heap looked hard at his companion  i think you ought to be convinced he said  it all turns upon the buglers movements challoner remarked  and he was killed  mrs chudleighs account presupposes that he was in one place clarkes in another while ive tried to show you that he couldnt have been in either  challoner was silent for a time and blake watched him anxiously until he looked up  i think you have succeeded dick though i feel that with a trifling alteration here and there you could have cleared yourself  now well let the painful matter drop for good unless indeed some fresh light is ever thrown on it  that cant happen blake replied and added with a gleam of humour as a matter of fact id sooner remain in friendly obscurity  challoner rose and laid a hand on his arm  if you were once at fault you have since shown yourself a man of honour  though the thing hurt me at the time im glad you are my nephew  had there been any baseness in you some suspicion must always have rested on your cousin well we are neither of us sentimentalists but i must say that you have amply made amends  he turned away and blake went out into the open air to walk up and down  the face of the old house rose above him dark against the clear night sky in front the great oaks in the park rolled back in shadowy masses  blake who loved sandymere had thought of it often in his wanderings and now he was glad that through his action his cousin would enjoy it without reproach  after all it was some return to make for the favours he had received  for himself there remained the charm of the lonely trail and the wide wilderness unless indeed harding succeeded better than blake really expected with his petroleum exploitation scheme  for all that he had been badly tempted  poverty and disgrace were serious obstacles to marriage and had he been free to do so he would eagerly have sought the hand of millicent graham  he knew now that he loved her and it was hard to hold his longing for her in check but while this must be done for the present he did not altogether despair he was hopeful and believed that if she loved him she would not shrink from his painful story while it was possible that another of his disadvantages might be removed  harding was confident that they were going to be rich  thinking about the girl tenderly he walked up and down the terrace until he grew calm and then went in to talk to miss challoner  the next fortnight passed uneventfully and then one afternoon he met millicent in a fieldpath and turned back with her to hazlehurst  it was a raw day and the wind had brought a fine colour into her face while she wore a little fur cap and furtrimmed jacket which he thought became her very well  you have not been over often foster was remarking about it she said to him  thats true said blake who had kept away for fear of his resolution melting if he saw much of her  still my uncle seems to think he has a prior claim and i maynt be able to stay with him long  then you are going back to canada  the quick way the girl looked up and something in her tone suggested unpleasant surprise for she had been taken off her guard  i shall have to go when harding needs me  i havent heard from him since i arrived but ill get my summons sooner or later  i thought you had come home for good  there was rueful humour but no bitterness in blakes smile  oh no though im very fond of it sandymere is not my home  it will be bertrams by and by and he is married  im the poor relation and no great credit to the family  millicents colour deepened but she looked at him steadily  i think that is wrong  since you have been so frank i may perhaps say that i know there has been a serious mistake somewhere  im flattered blake rejoined and something in his voice was out of keeping with his half whimsical bow  its nice to know your friends think well of you but you mustnt let your goodnature get the better of your judgment  perhaps i shouldnt have ventured so far  there was a hint of impatience in millicents gesture  but are you content with your life in the northwest  it has its charm  there are very few restrictions one feels free the fences havent reached us yet you can ride as far as you can see over miles of grass and through the clumps of bush  theres something attractive in the wide horizon the riband of trail that seems to run forward for ever draws you on  but the arctic frost and snow  after all theyre bracing  our board shacks with the big stoves in them are fairly warm and no one can tell what developments may suddenly come about in such a country  a railroad may be run through wheatland opened up minerals found and wooden cities spring up from the empty plain  lifes rapid and strenuous one is swept along with the stream  but you were in the wilds  blake laughed  we were but not far behind us the tide of population pours across the plain and if we had stayed a year or two in the timber it would have caught us up  that flood wont stop until it reaches the polar sea  but can people live in a rugged land covered with snow that only melts for a month or two  it depends upon what they find there  so long as the country has natural resources the climate doesnt count  one hears of precious metals and some are being mined  he paused and added in a tone of humorous confidence my partner believes in oil  they were now close to hazlehurst and millicent could ask no more questions because as they reached the highroad mrs keith joined them  you might go in and write the letter i told you about she said to millicent and then turned to blake  as i want a quiet walk dick i daresay you will keep me company  blake said he would be delighted and when millicent had left them remarked i didnt know you were given to this form of exercise  i may as well tell you that i came out because i couldnt take part in the meaningless chatter that was going on  as a matter of fact i was too disturbed to stay in  may one ask what disturbed you  mrs fosters announcement that mrs chudleigh is coming down again she only heard this morning  you think this means a fresh attack upon my persecuted relative  judge for yourself  mrs chudleigh had no pressing invitation to come back and has not been away long after all she and lucy foster are not great friends  now she has only a flimsy excuse for the visitive seen her letter  why should the woman force herself into hazlehurst unless its to be within striking distance of your uncle  i dont know  i suppose she couldnt have come down independently and called on him because it would have excited remark but thats not the question  the colonel mustnt see her  how would you prevent his doing so if she goes to the house  i think said blake the matter could be most effectively dealt with by letting her see me  an excellent plan but if your uncles to be kept in ignorance it will need some arranging  undoubtedly said blake thats your business  i suppose i must undertake it  the probability is that mrs chudleigh doesnt know you are at home and she must if possible be kept from learning it until she sees you  as shes only down for a few days i expect shell make her first move tomorrow  is your uncle going to the croxleigh meet  he is so am i  is there any risk of mrs chudleighs turning up at the cover  i dont think so  foster has only one spare horse and as he promised it to millicent ill see she goes  im more afraid that mrs chudleigh will make lucy foster take her across to sandymere in the afternoon and if im able to prevent that shell go alone  she has cultivated an acquaintance with your aunt  well said blake its a long way to croxleigh and the colonel wont ride hard  hell probably be satisfied with seeing the hounds throw off and then go quietly home  as it happens there isnt a direct road  where does all this lead  i should imagine it will be four oclock when he gets back while by leaving the hunt and heading straight across country i ought to beat him by some time  in fact i might get rid of the lady before he arrives  after she has seen me she maynt wish to stay  very well said mrs keith  if lucy goes to sandymere ill go with them and hurry them off as soon as i can  then ill try to make an opportunity for you  after a few more words she dismissed him and turned back to hazlehurst she thought the plan would work     chapter xxx  mrs chudleighs defeat  challoner kept one or two good horses though he no longer used them much and he and his nephew were well mounted when they rode to croxleigh gorse  as the place was difficult of access the meet had been arranged late and it was after midday when they drew near a broad stretch of furze on the crest of a grassy hill  mounted men and a few women were climbing the slope the scarlet coats shining in a gleam of light carriages and motors were drawn up in the shelter of a beech wood and from the summit there fell a faint blast of a horn  it was a raw day with a nipping wind and blinks of sunshine that swept across grass and ploughland and faded again  there were glistening pools in the narrow road and drops of moisture hung on the briars and withered fern along the hedgerows  both challoner and blake were dressed in sober tweed for the colonel said he only wore the pink when he felt fit to follow the hounds and now he must be content to see them find  glancing at his watch he pulled up his horse to a walk  we are in good time and its generally a lengthy matter getting a fox out of the gorse he said  though we havent hurried its rather a long way and i feel i have done enough  dont trouble about me when the hounds get off  i expect to pick up some elderly crony and if the fox does not run straight may be able to see something of the hunt after an easy ride then ill jog quietly home  ill stay with you if youd prefer it sir blake declared though this was far from his wish but challoner shook his head  get a good run if you can my boy  old folks mustnt be selfish and i know what young blood is  he turned and regarded blake affectionately  you have been a good nephew dick and since you came home i have felt that i ought to make some provision for you  that of course was my intention when you were young but when the break occurred you cut yourself adrift and refused assistance  blake coloured for there were he thought adequate reasons why he should take no further favours from his uncle  if the truth about the frontier affair ever came out it would look as if he had valued his honour less than the money he could extort and the colonel would bear the stigma of having bought his silence  im grateful sir but i must still refuse he said  but why  the property would stand the cost of the arrangement i thought of making and bertram wouldnt feel that i had been unfair to him besides his wife has means  bertrams as generous as you are he pressed me to take some help from him in montreal but i could not consent  i think you were wrong and see i have made a mistake  i should have stuck to my first intention of saying nothing about it and putting you into my will but it struck me that you would like to know how you stood in case you thought of marrying or going in for farming on a remunerative scale in canada  thank you but if my future is to be provided for im the person who ought to look after it  theres no reason why it should become a charge on you  i think there is challoner rejoined  in fact i feel somewhat hurt that you dont see it  blake was touched but his determination held  im glad you made me the offer sir because it shows i havent forfeited your regard  you must however let me have my way particularly as i see a chance of making money  then you have some plan  my partner has blake answered smiling  i leave that kind of thing to him  i told you about the oil  you did and clarke had something to say upon the subject  he however gave me to understand that capital was needed  that is so blake replied unguardedly for he did not see where his uncles remark led  boring plant is expensive and transport costs something  then you have to spend a good deal beforehand if you wish to float a company  but you believe this venture will pay you  harding is convinced of it and hes shrewd  personally i dont know enough about the business to judge but if i had any money to risk id take his word for it  well said challoner urging his horse to a trot perhaps we had better get on  they joined the company gathered round the edge of the gorse and when challoner greeted an acquaintance blake found what he thought was a good place for getting a start from  he could hear the cries of the huntsman and an occasional blast of his horn among the furze once or twice a ranging dog broke cover and disappeared again  outside redcoated men and some in grey jammed their hats tight and tried to keep their fidgeting horses quiet  close by a young girl finely habited with a glowing face gracefully controlled her plunging mount and a few older women seemed to have some trouble in holding their thoroughbreds  everybody wore a strained eager look but blake was disappointed for although he looked round for millicent and foster he did not see them  by and by a deep baying broke out and swelled into a burst of thrilling sound the horn called sharply somebody shouted and there was a rush of wellmounted riders towards a corner of the gorse  then the hounds streamed out speeding across the grassy slope with a small redbrown object travelling very fast some distance in front  blake who let his chestnut go swept down the hill at a furious gallop and felt the horse rise and heard a thud of hoofs on sloppy ground as a fence was cleared  then he toiled across a strip of ploughing with firm grip on the bridle for exhilarating as the chase was he could not enjoy it long  in his younger days he had hunted the country he was now riding over he had been a crack polo player and had covered wide stretches of the canadian prairie in the saddle  he could feel the power of the good horse he bestrode the speed fired his blood and for the first few minutes he had been in danger of forgetting that the keen pleasure he was conscious of could not be enjoyed long  there was a crash as they broke through the top of a bending hedge he heard a rail break beneath the hoofs and they were flying across a wide pasture the chestnut pulling hard  it needed some strength of will to hold him but blake did so keeping his place behind the foremost while the rest of the hunt tailed out  after another awkward jump or two most of the rearguard were out of sight scattering no doubt in search of gates and blake was not pleased to find himself level with two wellmounted redcoated men  there was a brook with a fringe of willows along its side not far ahead and a short distance to the right a deep treeshrouded hollow  this was where he must break off but sitting a good horse in the company of hardriding men it was not pleasant to look as if he shirked the leap  ware rotten bank cried one glancing round at him  head for the pollard stump  give me a lead blake shouted  you know the country  with a strong effort he held the chestnut back and saw the first redcoated figure rise above the willows and alight with the mire flying among the rushes across the stream  then he swung to the right where he remembered there was a broad shallow place and drove the chestnut at its widest part  they came down with a great splash and the horse floundered badly for the bottom was soft but blake had done what he meant to do and as the second horseman leaped across a narrower spot he caught a sympathetic hard luck  then he turned the chestnut and scrambling out upon the bank he had left trotted to the hollow where he was lost among the trees before the tail of the hunt came up  he thought he had withdrawn himself neatly and must now get home as soon as possible because if his uncle saw no opportunity of picking up the hounds again after an easy ride he might return before mrs chudleigh could be dealt with  crossing a sunk lane by and by blake who glanced at his watch held straight across the fields and was glad to find that the huntclub subsidies had had some effect in determining the nature of the fences the most part could be jumped without much trouble but the chestnut was foulcoated and flecked with spume when at length he turned into a road  there he pulled up to a steady trot and got home rather wet and splashed with mire early in the afternoon and after a bath and change felt himself ready for the encounter  he had not much diplomacy but thought he could make up for that by stubbornly sticking to his point  as he sat in the library with the door left open he heard mrs foster and her friends arrive and recognized the voices  mrs keith had come and millicent besides another lady whom he surmised was mrs chudleigh  he hardly thought his aunt whom he had not taken into his confidence would mention him and it might be better if he waited until tea was served after which the party would probably separate and saunter about the hall and picture gallery  it was important that he should have a few words with mrs chudleigh alone  fortune favoured him for when he entered the gallery she stood before a picture and the nearest of her companions was some yards further on  she started when he came up and joined her  you remember me though i imagine my appearance is a surprise to you he said with a bow  yes she answered calmly though she had received something of a shock  nobody told me you had returned from canada  there was no obvious reason for thinking you would be interested  but will you sit down  my uncle has some rather good miniatures which might please you  theyre in yonder drawer  she looked at him sharply  you may bring them  i suppose you have something to say  blake placed the case of miniatures on a table and she took up one or two  they are worth seeing and in good french style beauties of marie antoinettes court perhaps though this one in the highwaisted dress may have been attached to josephines  then she put them down with a smile  now they have served their purpose  what have you to say  you must excuse the bluntness which i feel is needful  you came over to see my uncle and im afraid you were disappointed in finding me instead  suppose i admit it  that wouldnt prevent my seeing colonel challoner another time  certainly not provided that you still wished to do so but im inclined to think you wont consider it necessary when you know what my attitude is  you must realize that a good deal depends on this  yes she said frankly in a sense youre important  i see you understand the situation  you believe you have the power to force my uncle into furthering a plan of yours  you found him obstinate at your first attempt but you think his resolution may since have given way  yes she said if i insist he cannot refuse me  that is where we differ  im in your way and youll excuse my saying that youll find me rather troublesome to remove  then a secret loses its value when people find it out and its perhaps news to you that a man from canada called upon my uncle not long since with a story very like yours  he found the colonel no more amenable than you did  mrs chudleigh looked surprised but that was all  it may save us both trouble if you tell me candidly what you mean to do  blake glanced down the gallery  mrs keith was sitting at a table with some old prints spread out before her but as the light was fading he hardly supposed that she could see him well though he imagined that she was watching  in the background mrs foster was talking to miss challoner with millicent standing in the shadow  the challoner portraits were growing indistinct though their heavy gold frames glimmered faintly and he could no longer distinguish the carving on the ends of the dark oak beams  though he thought he was safe from interruption by any of the others blake realized that he had no time to lose because challoner must arrive soon  yes he said i think it would be better  well i mean to relieve my uncle from any further attacks of the kind you have made on him and to defend my cousins honour  you must see that you are powerless to injure it unless i confirm your tale  mrs chudleigh clenched her hand and her eyes flashed  you are willing to bear undeserved disgrace to wander about canada an outcast from all society you could take pleasure in  its incomprehensible unless you have something to gain  blake regarded her with a tolerant smile  my dear lady its obvious that i should not gain anything by supporting your ingenious theory of what happened on the frontier because if you were right your only power over the colonel would lie in his supposed desire to keep it quiet which would of course prevent my clearing my character  if however you wish to believe that i have been bought over by him or bertram you must do so  ill own that it seems the best explanation but i should then have a strong reason for opposing you  but you are opposing me  yes said blake  my object in doing so hasnt much bearing on the matter so far as you are concerned but it will simplify things if you will realize that i mean to stand between my relatives and harm  im not a clever player of this kind of game but you must see i hold the ace of trumps among my cards  now you know im ready to play it dont you think it would be wiser to leave the colonel alone  for a few moments she looked at him in silence and though she burned with anger and disappointment she kept her head  she was beaten no art that she could practise and no argument would prevail against the mans resolution  the only thing left was to retire with as much dignity as possible from the fight  well she answered getting up i suppose there is no more to be said and after all you might have shown me less consideration  i must do you the justice to admit that i believe you are acting out of loyalty to your friends  thank you blake said with a bow  now i notice mrs foster coming towards us and imagine that she doesnt mean to stay much longer  mrs chudleigh left him and in another few minutes mrs foster declared that she must go while as they walked towards the staircase mrs keith came up to blake  well she asked in an anxious tone  blake smiled at her  i think we neednt fear any further trouble  admiration shone in margaret keiths eyes  its a great relief though i knew the worst danger was over when you came home  none of the challoners ever did so fine a thing dick  she went by before he could answer and he turned back into the gallery while the others descended to the hall  standing near a window he saw fosters car speed down the drive then the hoot of the horn reached him from the corner by the lodge and there was silence again  it was broken a few minutes later by a beat of hoofs and blake looking out saw challoner dismount  where did you get to dick the colonel asked when his nephew went down to meet him  i saw you close behind the hounds for a time but you disappeared and nobody seemed to know what had become of you  i had a good run blake said smiling  then i dropped out and rode home across country  i remembered that there was something i had to do  it must have been something important to take you off the field when the hounds were running as they were then  i thought the matter needed attention blake rejoined lighting a cigar     chapter xxxi  a difficult question  on the evening after mrs chudleighs visit challoner sent for blake who had just returned from an afternoons shooting with foster  the colonel was sitting in a big leather chair near a good fire but he had a heavy rug wrapped about him  had you good sport he asked  you must have found it very cold standing about the covers  we made a fair bag  the air was raw but nothing unusual  i cant keep warm ive been shivering all day  it looks as if id got a chill waiting outside croxleigh gorse but that is not what i want to talk about  his tone grew sharper  its curious that i wasnt told mrs chudleigh came here yesterday had you anything to do with keeping the information from me  im afraid i must own up sir  i thought it might disturb you if you knew  your intentions were no doubt good but please remember in future that i cant permit things that concern me to be taken out of my hands i believe im still capable of managing my affairs  it struck blake that his uncle looked ill which might account for his asperity and he made an apologetic answer  you may as well tell me what she said challoner resumed  as a matter of fact she didnt say very much blake answered with a twinkle  i did most of the talking but you must guess her object she seems a persistent lady  then what did you say  i tried to show her that she was helpless to make any trouble so long as i stuck to my guns and i think she recognized it  anyhow foster mentioned that she told his wife this morning she was afraid she couldnt stay as long as she had expected  i suppose this means shes ready to leave the field as soon as she can do so without exciting curiosity  challoner looked much relieved but when blake left him he grew thoughtful  his nephews demonstration with the chessmen had lifted a weight off his mind but he was troubled by a doubt about the absolute correctness of his explanation  moreover when he dwelt upon it the doubt gathered strength but there was nothing that he could do dick obviously meant to stick to his story and bertram could not be questioned  another matter troubled him dick whom he had meant to provide for would not allow it and though challoner admired his independence he thought dick was carrying it too far  in the meanwhile blake sought miss challoner and said i dont think my uncles looking fit  mightnt it be better to send for dr onslow  he wouldnt be pleased miss challoner answered dubiously  still he sometimes enjoys a talk with onslow whos a tactful man  if he looked in as it were casually  yes said blake well give him a hint  ill send the groom with a note at once  the doctor came and left without expressing any clear opinion but when he returned next day he ordered challoner to bed and told blake he feared a sharp attack of pneumonia  his fears were justified for it was some weeks before challoner was able to leave his room  during his illness he insisted on his nephews company whenever the nurses would allow it and when he began to recover again begged him to remain at sandymere  he had come to lean upon the younger man and entrusted him with all the business of the estate which he was no longer able to attend to  dick he said one day when blake thought he was too ill to perceive that he was casting a reflection on his son i wish my personal means were larger so i could give bertram enough and leave sandymere to you then id know the place would be in good hands  on the surface youre a happygolucky fellow but thats deceptive  in reality you have a surprising grip of thingshowever you know my opinion of you  but you wont go away dick  the nurse interrupted them and blake was glad he had written to harding stating his inability to rejoin him  a week or two later he received a cable message no hurry  when spring came he was still at sandymere for challoner who got better very slowly would not let him go and saw millicent frequently at first he felt that this was a weakness since he had nothing to offer her except a tainted name but his love was getting beyond control and his resistance feebler  after all he thought the story of the indian disaster must be almost forgotten and harding had a good chance of finding the oil  if the latter had not already started for the north he would do so soon but blake had had no news from him since his cabled message  then after a quiet month things began to happen for one afternoon when challoner had driven over to hazlehurst with his nephew foster came in from the station bringing a newspaper  the party was sitting in the conservatory mrs keith talking to challoner millicent and blake standing close by but there were no other guests and mrs chudleigh had left some weeks earlier  foster sat down near the colonel  heres a paragraph that may be of interest it wasnt in the morning papers  he remarked  i believe ive heard miss graham and mrs chudleigh mention a captain sedgwick  yes said millicent we both knew him but what has he been doing  he seems to have got into trouble but ill read you the account  the interest he had roused was obvious  challoner leaned forward with an intent face blake dropped the match with which he was lighting a cigarette while mrs keith fixed her eyes eagerly on foster millicent was the least concerned and she wondered at the others air of tension while foster unfolded his paper  telegraphic news has been received of a disaster to a small british force in western africa he read  captain sedgwick left his headquarters at ambolana with a detachment of native troops to demand guarantees of good behaviour from the headman of a fortified village near the french frontier  the expedition was ambushed in thick jungle but escaping after heavy loss made a stand against large numbers at a place which appears to lie outside the british boundary  here sedgwick again suffered some loss before a body of french black troops appeared upon the field  further details are anxiously waited since the affair which is complicated by a doubt about the headmans suzerainty may lead to strong representations from france  it looks as if your friend will get a wigging foster remarked to millicent as he laid down the paper  as i understand it the government doesnt thank too zealous officers who make trouble with our neighbours unless theres some substantial gain  there cant be any in this case because the french had to rescue the fellow  then im sorry for captain sedgwick millicent replied  i met him in quebec but only saw him for a few weeks  she turned to blake the news seems to have made some impression on you  it has in a way blake admitted with embarrassment because he did not wish his interest to be noticed  as it happens ive heard a good deal about the man  then mrs keith beckoned the girl  i think i left my outdoor spectacles in my room would you mind getting them  millicent went away and mrs keith led foster to talk about something else because she saw that his wifes curiosity was aroused  it was undesirable that any one should guess that the news had its importance to challoner  prudence prevented her saying anything to her old friend alone before he left but she gave him a look which was expressive of relief and satisfaction  as they drove home challoner turned to blake  ill know more about the matter in a day or two he said greythorpes coming down  in my opinion sedgwick has ruined himself blake replied  no influence could get him the appointment now  this view was taken by greythorpe when he sat talking with challoner a few evenings afterwards  you were right about captain sedgwick he remarked  the man came near getting us into serious difficulties  i suppose you have read the newspaper account  yes  you have more complete information  greythorpe nodded  the other was accurate so far as it went  the fellow played a bold stroke making the usual excuse the necessity for putting an end to the depredations and barbarities of a native headman  to do him justice i daresay the excuse was good  its possible but sedgwicks motive was not humanitarian  he knew that if he could seize the headmans stronghold and effectively occupy the surrounding country we should stay there and after a protest or two the french would have to acquiesce  as it happened he bungled the business and worst of all had to be extricated by the people he meant to outwit  they led him politely but very firmly across the frontier and now its our part to express our regret and promise to avoid any fresh aggression  what will you do with sedgwick  hell have to be reprimanded and after this we cant trust him with independent authority  hes too venturesome though ill admit that it would have been different if he had succeeded  still he has his talents and i daresay well find him useful in a subordinate post im inclined to sympathize with your friend mrs chudleigh  challoner made no answer to this and they talked about matters until blake came in when greythorpe left them alone together  he agrees with you about the african affair said the colonel sedgwick is so to speak done for and will be kept in the background after this  its more important that mrs chudleigh is disposed of blake replied  as she cant help the man shell no longer have any motive for troubling us and i dont think she would do so out of malice that sets me free and as youre getting strong again i ought to go back to canada as soon as i can  if you feel you must go ill have to consent  ive a duty to my partner  its probable that he has already set off but i know where to find him and therell be plenty to do  for one thing as transport is expensive well have to relay our supplies over very rough country and that means making the same stage several times while i dont suppose harding will have been able to buy very efficient boring plant  he may have done better than you imagined challoner remarked  a man as capable as he seems to be would somehow get hold of what was needful  blake was surprised at this because his uncle understood their financial difficulties but he said theres a fast boat next saturday  i think ill go by her  wait another week to please me challoner urged him  you have had a dull time since ive been ill and now id like you to get about  i shall miss you badly dick  blake agreed  he felt that he ought to have sailed earlier but the temptation to remain was strong  he now met millicent every day and it might be a very long time before he returned to england  he feared that he was laying up trouble for himself but he recklessly determined to make the most of the present and in spite of his misgivings the next eight or nine days brought him many delightful hours  now she knew he was going millicent abandoned the reserve she had sometimes shown  she was sympathetic interested in his plans and he thought wonderfully charming  they were rapidly drawn closer together and the more he learned of her character the stronger his admiration grew  at times he imagined he noticed a tender shyness in her manner and though it delighted him he afterwards took himself to task  he was not acting honourably he had no right to win this girls love as he was trying to do but there was the excuse that she knew his history and it had not made her cold to him  in the meanwhile mrs keith who had grown very fond of her companion and entirely approved of her looked on with observant eyes and made opportunities for throwing the two together  one afternoon a day or two before blakes departure she called millicent into her room and asked her abruptly have you ever thought about your future  not often since i have been with you millicent answered  before that it used to trouble me  then im afraid youre imprudent  you have no relations you could look to for help and while my health is pretty good i cant of course live for ever  i might leave you something but it would not be much because my property is earmarked for a particular purpose  millicent wondered where this led but mrs keith went on as you have found out im a frank old woman and not afraid to say what i think well considering how attractive you are theres a way out of the difficulty and i believe its the best one  you ought to marry its your true vocation  im not sure said millicent blushing  besides it mightnt be possible  i owe everything to your generosity but you have brought me into a station where i must stand comparison with girls who have more advantages  you mean they have more money  well its not to be despised but ive met men who didnt attach too much importance to it  they had the sense to see there were other things of greater value and while i dont often flatter people youre not poor in this respect  but if you liked a man who was far from rich would you marry him  it would depend millicent replied while her colour deepened  why do you ask  i cant give you a general answer  then give me a particular one i want to know  the girl was embarrassed but she had learned that her employer was not to be put off easily  i suppose his being poor wouldnt daunt me if i loved him enough  then well suppose something else  if he had done something to be ashamed of  millicent looked up with a flash in her eyes  people are so ready to believe the worst  he did nothing that he need blush forthats impossible  then she saw the trap into which her generous indignation had led her but instead of looking down in confusion she boldly faced mrs keith  yes she added if he loved me i would marry him in spite of what people are foolish enough to think  and you would not regret it  mrs keith laid her hand on the girls arm with a caressing touch  my dear if you value your happiness you will tell him so  remember that he is going away in a day or two  how can i tell him millicent cried with burning face  i onlyi mean you tricked me into telling you  it shouldnt be difficult to give him a tactful hint and that wouldnt be a remarkably unusual course mrs keith rejoined with amusement  the idea that a proposal comes quite spontaneously is to some extent a convention nowadays  i dont suppose you need reminding that we dine at sandymere tomorrow  millicent made no reply and as she seemed rather overwhelmed by her employers frankness the latter took pity on her  you might ask foster for the review he promised me but you can send it up instead of coming back she said and added as millicent turned away think over what i told you  the recommendation was superfluous because millicent thought of nothing else  she knew blake was her lover and believed she understood why he had not declared himself  now he might go away without speaking if she let him  mrs keiths blunt candour left her no excuse for shirking the truth she loved the man but it was hateful to feel that she must make the first advances and reveal her tenderness for him she said she could not do so and yet vacillated for the alternative was worse     chapter xxxii  harding strikes oil  next evening millicent accompanied mrs keith to sandymere in a troubled mood  dinner was a trying function because she sat next to foster who talked in a humorous strain and expected her to appreciate his jokes  she found it hard to smile at the right moment and noticed that blake was unusually quiet  it was his last evening in england  when they went into the drawingroom challoner engaged her in conversation for a time and she was afterwards asked to sing  an hour passed before blake had an opportunity of exchanging a word with her and then miss challoner was sitting close by  theyll make you sing again if you stop here he said softly  she understood that he wanted her to himself and thrilled at something in his voice but instead of complying she asked dont you wish me to  yes of course he answered lamely and was silent for a few moments then he resumed youre interested in eastern brasswork i think  i hardly know said millicent  i havent seen much of it  she was vexed with herself for her prudish weakness  an opportunity that might never be repeated was offered her and she could not muster the courage to seize it  blake however did not seem daunted  you said you were delighted with the things my uncle showed you when you were last here and a friend has just sent him a fresh lot from benares  he gave her an appealing look  it struck me you might like to see them  yes said millicent with forced calm i really think i would  will you give me the key of the indian collection blake asked challoner  here it is said the colonel who turned to mrs keith  that reminds me you havent seen my new treasures yet  dryhurst has lately sent me some rather good things among others theres a small buddha exquisitely carved  shall we go and look at them  mrs keith felt angry with him for a marplot but she said wouldnt it be better to wait until im here in the daylight  if i try to examine anything closely with these spectacles they strain my eyes  ive had a new lamp placed in front of the case challoner persisted and mrs keith found it hard to forgive him for his obtuseness  very well she said in a resigned tone and when millicent and blake had gone out walked slowly to the door with challoner  they were half way up the staircase which led rather sharply from the hall when she stopped and turned to her companion  its obvious that you have recovered she said  i certainly feel much better but what prompted your remark  these stairs  you dont seem to feel them but if you expect me to run up and down youll have to make them shallower and less steep ive been up twice since i came hilda insisted on my seeing the new decorations in the west wing and i must confess to a weakness in my knee  challoner gave her a sharp glance and then said im sorry  mrs foster mentioned something about your not walking much i should have remembered  its the weather i find the damp troublesome  if you dont mind i think well go down  challoner gave her his arm and millicent standing in the picture gallery noticed their return  she suspected that this was the result of some manoeuvre of mrs keiths intended for her advantage and tried to summon her resolution  the man she loved would sail next day believing that his poverty and the stain he had not earned must stand between them unless she could force herself to give him a hint to the contrary  this was the only sensible course but she timidly shrank from it  blake unlocked a glass case and taking out two shelves laid them on a table  there they are he said with a rather nervous smile  ive no doubt the things are interesting and if our friends come up they can look at them  but it wasnt benares brassware that brought me here  was it not millicent asked with a fluttering heart  certainly not  one couldnt talk with foster enlarging upon the only rational way of rearing pheasants and you know im going away first thing tomorrow  yes i know said millicent and then looked up at him with sudden courage  im sorry  truly sorry you mean that  he gave her a very keen glance while he knitted his brows  yes she said recklessly i mean it  you ought to know i do  he laid his hand on her shoulder holding her a little away from him i came up here in a state of horrible indecision torn different ways by a sense of the duty i owed you and my selfish longing  even if nothing had been said to make it harder for me i cant tell how the struggle would have ended  why should there be a struggle she asked him  his grasp tightened and his eyes were steadily fixed upon her face youre very young and beautiful and though i love you im a broken man  then its through no fault of yours  the consequences are the same and apart from this i have nothing to offer  can you wonder my dear that i was afraid  i come to you a beggar with everything to gain  ah she said all i have to give is yours i think it was yours before you asked for it  then you are not afraid  she looked at him with a happy smile  what should i fear  arent you able to take care of me  it must be for my sake that you are so timid and i love you for it but i think this must be the first time you ever hesitated long  where has your usual recklessness gone  its coming back  he passed his arm about her waist drawing her strongly to him  well laugh at coldblooded prudence and take our chances  its a wide world and well find a nook somewhere if we go out and look for it  all my care will be to smooth the trail for your dear pretty feet  they spent a time in happy talk and blake murmured when millicent protested that they must go back while she feared that her lovers exultant air would betray them as they entered the drawingroom  wheres the key challoner asked  im afraid i forgot it sir blake confessed  very sorry but im not even sure i put the things away  challoner rang a bell and gave an order to a servant  then he asked millicent did you see the buddha  no she said  i dont think so  or the brass plate with the fantastic serpent pattern round the rim  im afraid i didnt millicent owned with a trace of confusion  challoner looked hard at blake and then his eyes twinkled  well he said pointedly perhaps it wasnt to be expected  there was a moments silence  millicent looked down with the colour in her face blake stood very straight smiling at the others  then he said we are all friends here and im proud to announce that millicent has promised to marry me as soon as i return from canada he bowed to mrs keith and the colonel  as you have taken her guardians place madam and you sir are the head of the house i should like to think we have your approval  how formal dick said mrs keith with a laugh  i imagine my consent is very much a matter of form but i give it with the greatest satisfaction  challoner got up and took millicents hand  my dear i am very glad and i think dick has shown great wisdom  i wish you both all happiness  mrs foster and her husband offered their congratulations and for the next hour they discussed blakes future plans after which they were interrupted by the entrance of a servant with a small silver tray  telegram sir for mr blake he said  hopkins was at the post office and they gave it him  blake took the envelope and looked at miss challoner for permission to open it  when he had done so he started and gave the form to millicent  oh dick she cried with sparkling eyes  isnt this very good  i believe so  blake turned to the others  after the good feeling you have shown towards us i daresay youll be interested to hear my partners latest news  he read out come  struck it  tell challoner  he turned to mrs keith  this should set me firmly on my feet and may make me rich  then he addressed challoner  but i dont understand the last of it  why does he wish you to know  the colonel chuckled  i sent mr harding five hundred pounds to buy anything he needed for his prospecting and told him to give me an option on a good block of shares in the new syndicate at par  youre very independent dick but i cant see why you should object to your relatives putting money into what looks like a promising thing  ive no doubt it was mainly through your help harding found the oil blake said gratefully  soon after this the fosters rose to go but they waited sympathetically in the hall while millicent lingered with blake in the drawingroom  dick she said blushing you made a rash statement i didnt quite promise to marry you as soon as you came back  then it was understood blake answered firmly  i cant let you off  well she said if it will bring you home any quicker dear  but how long must you stay  i cant tell there may be much to do and if harding needs me i must see it out but i wont delay a minute more thans needful  you know we may have to live in canada  yes she said shyly i wont object  where you are will be home  then foster opened the door  the cars waiting and its coming on to rain  millicent went out with him and blake who sailed next day found on reaching the timber belt that as he had predicted there was much to be done  after some months hard work harding who was confident that the oil would pay handsomely left him in charge while he set off for the cities to arrange about pipes and plant and the raising of capital it was early winter when he returned satisfied with what he had accomplished and blake saw that he would be able to visit england in a few weeks  he was sitting in their office shack one bitter day when a sledge arrived with supplies and the teamster brought him a telegram  his face grew grave as he opened it and read   bertram killed in actionchalloner   this sets you free doesnt it harding remarked after expressing his sympathy  i cant tell blake answered  i havent thought of it in such a light  i was very fond of my cousin  but the action must have been in india harding resumed after a while  didnt you tell me captain challoner was coming home  he gave up a good appointment when he found his regiment was to be sent to a station where there was a likelihood of some fighting  i think i can guess the reason  shortly before blake left the camp he received further news by mail and some english newspapers  bertram had been shot when leading an attack upon a fort among the frontier hills and the accounts agreed that he had shown exceptional gallantry  on reaching england blake found millicent at the station  mrs keith she told him had given up her london house and taken one near sandymere  then she looked thoughtful when he asked about his uncle  im afraid you will see a marked change in him she said  he has not been well since you left and the news of bertrams death was a shock  she was with him when he met challoner who looked very frail and forlorn  its a comfort to see you back dick you are all i have now he said and went on with a break in his voice after all it was a good end my boy madea very daring thing  the place was supposed to be unassailable by such a force as he had but he stormed it  in spite of his fondness for painting he was true to strain  some time later blake said to millicent you heard what he told me dear  the secret must still be kept i cant speak  no said millicent not while your uncle lives  its hard when i want everybody to know what you are  he kissed her  i daresay its natural that you should be prejudiced in my favour but i like it  oh she answered smiling ive no doubt you have some faults but youre very staunch  you must do what you think right dick and ill try to be content  one reason for my loving you is that you are brave enough to take this generous part     the end
