78861024	night watches  by ww jacobs    his other self  theyre as like as two peas him and is brother said the night watchman gazing blandly at the indignant face of the lighterman on the barge below and the ony way i know this one is sam is because bill dont use bad langwidge  twins they are but the likeness is only outside bills art is as white as snow  he cut off a plug of tobacco and placing it in his cheek waited expectantly  white as snow he repeated  thats me said the lighterman as he pushed his unwieldy craft from the jetty  ill tell sam your opinion of im  so long  the watchman went a shade redder than usual  thats twins all over he said sourly always deceiving people  its bill arter all and instead of hurting is feelings ive just been flattering of im up  it aint the fust time ive ad trouble over a likeness  ive been a twin myself in a manner o speaking  it didnt last long but it lasted long enough for me to always be sorry for twins and to make a lot of allowance for them  it must be very ard to have another man going about with your face on is shoulders and getting it into trouble  it was a year or two ago now  i was sitting one evening at the gate smoking a pipe and looking at a newspaper i ad found in the office when i see a gentleman coming along from the swingbridge  well dressed cleanshaved chap e was smoking a cigarette  he was walking slow and looking about im casuallike until his eyes fell on me when he gave a perfect jump of surprise and arter looking at me very ard walked on a little way and then turned back  he did it twice and i was just going to say something to im something that i ad been getting ready for im when he spoke to me  good evening he ses  good evening i ses folding the paper over and looking at im rather severe  i hope youll excuse me staring he ses very perlite but ive never seen such a face and figger as yours in all my lifenever  ah you ought to ha seen me a few years ago i ses  im like everybody elseim getting on  rubbish  he ses  you couldnt be better if you tried  its marvellous  wonderful  its the very thing ive been looking for why if youd been made to order you couldnt ha been better  i thought at fust he was by way of trying to get a drink out o meive been played that game aforebut instead o that he asked me whether id do im the pleasure of aving one with im  we went over to the albion and i believe i could have ad it in a pail if id ony liked to say the word  and all the time i was drinking he was looking me up and down till i didnt know where to look as the saying is  i came down ere to look for somebody like you he ses but i never dreamt i should have such luck as this  im an actor and ive got to play the part of a sailor and ive been worried some time ow to make up for the part  dye understand  no i ses looking at im  i want to look the real thing he ses speaking low so the landlord shouldnt hear  i want to make myself the living image of you  if that dont fetch em ill give up the stage and grow cabbages  make yourself like me  i ses  why youre no more like me than im like a seasick monkey  not so much he ses  thats where the art comes in  he stood me another drink and then taking my arm in a cuddling sort o way and calling me dear boy e led me back to the wharf and explained  he said e would come round next evening with wot e called his makeup box and paint is face and make imself up till people wouldnt know one from the other  and wot about your figger  i ses looking at im  a cushion he ses winking or maybe a couple  and what about clothes  youll ave to sell me those youve got on  hat and all  and boots  i put a price on em that i thought would ave finished im then and there but it didnt  and at last arter paying me so many more compliments that they began to get into my ead he fixed up a meeting for the next night and went off  and mind he ses coming back not a word to a living soul  he went off agin and arter going to the bulls head and aving a pint to clear my ead i went and sat down in the office and thought it over it seemed all right to me as far as i could see but praps the pint didnt clear my ead enoughpraps i ought to ave ad two pints  i lay awake best part of next day thinking it over and when i got up i ad made up my mind  i put my clothes in a sack and then i put on some others as much like em as possible ony praps a bit older in case the missis should get asking questions and then i sat wondering ow to get out with the sack without er noticing it  shes got a very inquiring mind and i wasnt going to tell her any lies about it besides which i couldnt think of one  i got out at last by playing a game on her  i pertended to drop arf a dollar in the washus and while she was busy on er hands and knees i went off as comfortable as you please  i got into the office with it all right and just as it was getting dark a cab drove up to the wharf and the actorchap jumped out with a big leather bag  i took im into the private office and e was so ready with is money for the clothes that i offered to throw the sack in  he changed into my clothes fust of all and then asking me to sit down in front of im he took a lookingglass and a box out of is bag and began to alter is face  wot with sticks of coloured paint and false eyebrows and a beard stuck on with gum and trimmed with a pair o scissors it was more like a conjuring trick than anything else  then e took a wig out of is bag and pressed it on his ead put on the cap put some black stuff on is teeth and there he was  we both looked into the glass together while e gave the finishing touches and then he clapped me on the back and said i was the handsomest sailorman in england  i shall have to make up a bit eavier when im behind the floats he ses but this is enough for ere  wot do you think of the imitation of your voice  i think ive got it exact  if you ask me i ses it sounds like a pollparrot with a cold in the ead  and now for your walk he ses looking as pleased as if id said something else  come to the door and see me go up the wharf  i didnt like to hurt is feelings but i thought i should ha bust  he walked up that wharf like a dancingbear in a pair of trousers too tight for it but e was so pleased with imself that i didnt like to tell im so  he went up and down two or three times and i never saw anything so ridikerlous in my life  thats all very well for us he ses but wot about other people thats wot i want to know  ill go and ave a drink and see whether anybody spots me  afore i could stop im he started off to the bulls head and went in while i stood outside and watched im  arf a pint o four ale he ses smacking down a penny  i see the landlord draw the beer and give it to im but e didnt seem to take no notice of im  then just to open is eyes a bit i walked in and put down a penny and asked for a arfpint  the landlord was just wiping down the counter at the time and when i gave my order he looked up and stood staring at me with the wet cloth eld up in the air  he didnt say a wordnot a single word  he stood there for a moment smiling at us foolishlike and then e let go o the beerinjin wot e was olding in is left hand and sat down heavy on the bar floor  we both put our eads over the counter to see wot had appened to im and e started making the most orrible noise i ave ever heard in my life  i wonder it didnt bring the fireinjins  the actorchap bolted out as if hed been shot and i was just thinking of follering im when the landlords wife and is two daughters came rushing out and asking me wot i ad done to him  theretherewas two of im   ses the landlord trembling and holding on to is wifes arm as they helped im up and got im in the chair two of im  two of wot  ses his wife  twotwo watchmen ses the landlord both exacly alike and both asking for arf a pint o four ale  yes yes ses is wife  you come and lay down pa ses the gals  i tell you there was ses the landlord getting is colour back with temper  yes yes i know all about it ses is wife  you come inside for a bit and gertie you bring your father in a sodaa large soda  they got im in arter a lot o trouble but three times e came back as far as the door olding on to them and taking a little peep at me the last time he shook his ead at me and said if i did it agin i could go and get my arfpints somewhere else  i finished the beer wot the actor ad left and arter telling the landlord i oped his eyesight ud be better in the morning i went outside and arter a careful look round walked back to the wharf  i pushed the wicket open a little way and peeped in  the actor was standing just by the fust crane talking to two of the hands off of the saltram  hed got is back to the light but ow it was they didnt twig his voice i cant think  they was so busy talking that i crept along by the side of the wall and got to the office without their seeing me  i went into the private office and turned out the gas there and sat down to wait for im  then i eard a noise outside that took me to the door agin and kept me there olding on to the doorpost and gasping for my breath  the cook of the saltram was sitting on a paraffincask playing the mouthorgin and the actor with is arms folded across his stummick was dancing a hornpipe as if hed gorn mad  i never saw anything so ridikerlous in my life and when i recollected that they thought it was me i thought i should ha dropped  a nightwatchman cant be too careful and i knew that it ud be all over wapping next morning that i ad been dancing to a tuppennyhapenny mouthorgin played by a ships cook  a man that does is dooty always has a lot of people ready to believe the worst of im  i went back into the dark office and waited and by and by i eard them coming along to the gate and patting im on the back and saying he ought to be in a pantermime instead o wasting is time nightwatching  he left em at the gate and then e came into the office smiling as if hed done something clever  wot dye think of me for a understudy  he ses laughing  they all thought it was you  there wasnt one of em ad the slightest suspicion not one  and wot about my character  i ses folding my arms acrost my chest and looking at him  character he ses staring  why theres no arm in dancing its a innercent enjoyment  it aint one o my innercent enjoyments i ses and i dont want to get the credit of it  if they hadnt been sitting in a pub all the evening theyd ave spotted you at once  oh he ses very huffy  how  your voice i ses  you try and mimic a pollparrot and think its like me  and for another thing you walk about as though youre stuffed with sawdust  i beg your pardon he ses the voice and the walk are exact  exact  wot i ses looking im up and down  you stand there and ave the impudence to tell me that my voice is like that  i do he ses  then im sorry for you i ses  i thought youd got more sense  he stood looking at me and gnawing is finger and by and by he ses are you married  he ses  i am i ses very short  where do you live he ses  i told im  very good he ses praps ill be able to convince you arter all by the way wot do you call your wife  missis  yes i ses staring at him  but wots it got to do with you  nothing he ses  nothing  only im going to try the pollparrot voice and the sawdust walk on her thats all  if i can deceive er thatll settle it  deceive her  i ses  do you think im going to let you go round to my ouse and get me into trouble with the missis like that  why you must be crazy that dancing must ave got into your ead  wheres the arm  he ses very sulky  arm  i ses  i wont ave it thats all and if you knew my missis youd know without any telling  ill bet you a pound to a sixpence she wouldnt know me he ses very earnest  she wont ave the chance i ses so thats all about it  he stood there argufying for about ten minutes but i was as firm as a rock  i wouldnt move an inch and at last arter we was both on the point of losing our tempers he picked up his bag and said as ow he must be getting off ome  but aint you going to take those things off fust  i ses  no he ses smiling  ill wait till i get ome  tata  he put is bag on is shoulder and walked to the gate with me follering of im  i expect i shall see a cab soon he ses  goodbye  wot are you laughing at  i ses  ony thoughts he ses  ave you got far to go i ses  no just about the same distance as you ave he ses and he went off spluttering like a sodawater bottle  i took the broom and ad a good sweepup arter he ad gorn and i was just in the middle of it when the cook and the other two chaps from the saltram came back with three other sailormen and a brewers drayman they ad brought to see me dance  same as you did a little while ago bill ses the cook taking out is beastly mouthorgin and wiping it on is sleeve  wot toon would you like  i couldnt get away from em and when i told them i ad never danced in my life the cook asked me where i expected to go to  he told the drayman that id been dancing like a fairy in seaboots and they all got in front of me and wouldnt let me pass  i lost my temper at last and arter they ad taken the broom away from me and the drayman and one o the sailormen ad said wot theyd do to me if i was ony fifty years younger they sheered off  i locked the gate arter em and went back to the office and i adnt been there above arf an hour when somebody started ringing the gate bell as if they was mad  i thought it was the cooks lot come back at fust so i opened the wicket just a trifle and peeped out  there was a ansomcab standing outside and i ad hardly got my nose to the crack when the actorchap still in my clothes pushed the door open and nipped in  youve lost he ses pushing the door to and smiling all over wheres your sixpence  lost  i ses hardly able to speak  dye

dye think ive got  wot dye mean by it  arter i left you he ses giving me a little poke in the ribs i picked up a cab and fust leaving my bag at aldgate i drove on to your ouse and knocked at the door  i knocked twice and then an angry looking woman opened it and asked me wot i wanted  its all right missis i ses  ive got arf an hour off and ive come to take you out for a walk  wot she ses drawing back with a start  just a little turn round to see the shops i ses and if theres anything particler youd like and it dont cost too much you shall ave it  i thought at fust from the way she took it she

know me my pretty  dont you know your pet sailorboy  she gave a screech like a steaminjin and then she went next door and began knocking away like mad  then i see that i ad gorn to number twelve instead of number fourteen  your wife your real wife came out of number fourteenand she was worse than the other  but they both thought it was youtheres no doubt of that  they chased me all the way up the road and if it adnt ha been for this cab that was just passing i dont know wot would ave appened to me  he shook his ead and smiled agin and arter opening the wicket a trifle and telling the cabman he shouldnt be long he turned to me and asked me for the sixpence to wear on his watchchain  sixpence i ses  sixpence  wot do you think is going to appen to me when i go ome  oh i adnt thought o that he ses  yes o course  wot about my wifes jealousy  i ses  wot about the other and her usband a cooper as big as a ouse  well well he ses one cant think of everything  itll be all the same a hundred years hence  look ere i ses taking is shoulder in a grip of iron  you come back with me now in that cab and explain  dye see  thats wot youve got to do  all right he ses certainly  isis the husband badtempered  youll see i ses but thats your business  come along  with pleasure he ses elping me in  arf a mo while i tell the cabby where to drive to  he went to the back o the cab and afore i knew wot had appened the orse had got a flick over the head with the whip and was going along at a gallop  i kept putting the little flap up and telling the cabby to stop but he didnt take the slightest notice  arter id done it three times he kept it down so as i couldnt open it  there was a crowd round my door when the cab drove up and in the middle of it was my missis the woman next door and er husband wot ad just come ome  arf a dozen of em helped me out and afore i could say a word the cabman drove off and left me there  i dream of it now sometimes standing there explaining and explaining until just as i feel i cant bear it any longer two policemen come up and elp me indoors  if they had elped my missis outside it would be a easier dream to have
