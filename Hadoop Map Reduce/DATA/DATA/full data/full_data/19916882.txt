19916882	our mr wrenn  the romantic adventures of a gentle man  by  sinclair lewis  new york and london  mcmxiv       to grace livingstone hegger       chapter i  mr wrenn is lonely      the tickettaker of the nickelorion movingpicture show is a public personage who stands out on fourteenth street new york wearing a gorgeous lightblue coat of numerous brass buttons he nods to all the patrons and his nod is the most cordial in town  mr wrenn used to trot down to fourteenth street passing ever so many other shows just to get that cordial nod because he had a lonely furnished room for evenings and for daytime a tedious job that always made his head stuffy  he stands out in the correspondence of the souvenir and art novelty company as our mr wrenn who would be writing you directly and explaining everything most satisfactorily at thirtyfour mr wrenn was the salesentry clerk of the souvenir company  he was always bending over bills and columns of figures at a desk behind the stockroom  he was a meek little bachlora person of inconspicuous blue readymade suits and a small unsuccessful mustache  todayhistorians have established the date as april 9 1910there had been some confusing mixed orders from the wisconsin retailers and mr wrenn had been called down by the office manager mr mortimer r guilfogle  he needed the friendly nod of the nickelorion tickettaker  he found fourteenth street after office hours swept by a dusty wind that whisked the skirts of countless plump jewish girls whose vnecked blouses showed soft throats of a warm brown under the elevated station he secretly made believe that he was in paris for here beautiful italian boys swayed with trays of violets a tramp displayed crimson mechanical rabbits which squeaked on silvery leadingstrings and a newsstand was heaped with the orange and green and gold of magazine covers  gee inarticulated mr wrenn  lots of colors  hope i see foreign stuff like that in the moving pictures  he came primly up to the nickelorion feeling in his vest pockets for a nickel and peering around the booth at the friendly tickettaker  but the latter was thinking about buying johnnys pants  should he get them at the fourteenth street store or siegelcoopers or over at aronsons near home so ruminating he twiddled his wheel mechanically and mr wrenns pasteboard slip was indifferently received in the plateglass gullet of the grinder without the takers even seeing the clerks bow and smile  mr wrenn trembled into the door of the nickelorion  he wanted to turn back and rebuke this fellow but was restrained by shyness  he had liked the mans fine evenin sir rain or shinebut he wouldnt stand for being cut  wasnt he making nineteen dollars a week as against the tickettakers ten or twelve  he shook his head with the defiance of a cornered mouse fussed with his mustache and regarded the moving pictures gloomily  they helped him  after a selig domestic drama came a stirring vitagraph western scene the goat of the rancho which depicted with much humor and tumult the revolt of a ranch cook a chinaman  mr wrenn was really seeing not cowpunchers and sagebrush but himself defying the office managers surliness and revolting against the ticketmans rudeness  now he was ready for the nearly overpowering delight of travelpictures he bounced slightly as a gaumont film presented java  he was a connoisseur of travelpictures for all his life he had been planning a great journey  though he had done staten island and patronized an excursion to bound brook neither of these was his grand tour  it was yet to be taken  in mr wrenn apparently fastened to new york like a domesticminded barnacle lay the possibilities of heroic roaming  he knew it  he too like the man who had taken the gaumont pictures would saunter among dusky javan natives in markets with tiles on the roofs and temples andanduh wellplaces  the scent of oriental spices was in his broadened nostrils as he scampered out of the nickelorion without a look at the tickettaker and headed for homefor his thirdfloorfront on west sixteenth street he wanted to prowl through his collection of steamship brochures for a description of java  but of course when ones landlady has both the sciatica and a case of patient suffering one stops in the basement diningroom to inquire how she is  mrs zapp was a fat landlady  when she sat down there was a straight line from her chin to her knees  she was usually sitting down  when she moved she groaned and her apparel creaked she groaned and creaked from bed to breakfast and ate five griddlecakes two helpins of scrapple an egg some rump steak and three cups of coffee slowly and resentfully  she creaked and groaned from breakfast to her rockingchair and sat about wondering why providence had inflicted upon her a weak digestion mr wrenn also wondered why sympathetically but mrs zapp was too conscientiously dolorous to be much cheered by the sympathy of a niggerlovin yankee who couldnt appreciate the subtle sorrows of a zapp of zapps bog allied to all the first families of virginia  mr wrenn did nothing more presumptuous than sit still in the stuffy furniturecrowded basement room which smelled of dead food and deader pride in a race that had never existed  he sat still because the chair was broken  it had been broken now for four years  for the hundred and twentyninth time in those years mrs zapp said in her rich corruption of southern negro dialect which can only be indicated here ah been meaning to get that chair mended mist wrenn  he looked gratified and gazed upon the crayon enlargements of lee theresa the older zapp daughter who was forewoman in a factory and of godiva  godiva zapp was usually called goaty and many times a day was she called by mrs zapp  a tamed child drudge was goaty with adenoids which mrs zapp had been meanin to have removed and which she would continue to have benevolent meanins about till it should be too late and she should discover that providence never would let goaty go to school  yes mist wrenn ah told goaty she was to see the man about getting that chair fixed but she nev does nothing ah tell her  in the kitchen was the noise of goaty ungovernable goaty aged eight still snivelingly washing though not cleaning the incredible pile of dinner dishes  with a trail of hesitating remarks on the sadness of sciatica and windy evenings mr wrenn sneaked forth from the august presence of mrs zapp and mounted to paradisehis thirdfloorfront  it was an abjectly respectable roomthe bedspread patched no two pieces of furniture from the same family halftones from the magazines pinned on the wall  but on the old marble mantelpiece lived his friends books from wanderland other friends the room had rarely known  it was hard enough for mr wrenn to get acquainted with people anyway and mrs zapp did not expect her gennulman lodgers to entertain  so mr wrenn had given up asking even charley carpenter the assistant bookkeeper at the souvenir company to call  that left him the books which he now caressed with small eager fingertips he picked out a p  o circular and hastily left for fairyland   the april skies glowed with benevolence this saturday morning the metropolitan tower was singing bright ivory tipped with gold uplifted and intensely glad of the morning  the buildings walling in madison square were jubilant the honest redbrick fronts radiant the new marble witty  the sparrows in the middle of fifth avenue were all talking at once scandalously but cleverly  the polished brass of limousines threw off teethy smiles at least so mr wrenn fancied as he whisked up fifth avenue the skirts of his small blue doublebreasted coat wagging he was going blocks out of his way to the office ready to defy time and eternity yes and even the office manager he had awakened with defiance as his bedfellow and throughout breakfast at the hustler dairy lunch sunshine had flickered over the dirty tessellated floor  he pranced up to the souvenir companys brick building on twentyeighth street near sixth avenue  in the office he chuckled at his inkwell and the untorn blotters on his orderly desk  though he sat under the weary unnatural brilliance of a mercuryvapor light he dashed into his work and was too keen about this business of living merrily to be much flustered by the bustle of the lady buyers superior good morning even up to tenthirty he was still slamming down papers on his desk  just let any one try to stop his course his readiness for snapping fingers at the job just let them try it that was all he wanted  then he was shot out of his chair and four feet along the corridor in reflex response to the surly burrrrr of the buzzer  mr mortimer r guilfogle the manager desired to see him  he scampered along the corridor and slid decorously through the managers doorway into the long sunbright room ornate with rugs and souvenirs  seven novelties glittered on the desk alone including a large rococo shakespearestyle glass inkwell containing cloves and a small iron pittsburgstyle one containing ink  mr wrenn blinked like a noonroused owlet in the brilliance  the manager dropped his fist on the desk glared smoothed his flowered prairie of waistcoat and growled his red jowls quivering  look here wrenn whats the matter with you  the bronx emporium order for may day novelties was filled twice they write me  they ordered twice sir  by phone smiled mr wrenn in an agony of politeness  they ordered hell sir  twicethe same order  yes sir their buyer was prob  they say theyve looked it up  anyway they wont pay twice i know em  well have to crawl down graceful and all because youi want to know why you aint more careful  the announcement that mr wrenn twice wriggled his head and once tossed it would not half denote his wrath  at last it was herethe time for revolt when he was going to be defiant he had been careful old goglefogle was only barking but why should he be barked at  with his voice palpitating and his heart thudding so that he felt sick he declared  im sure sir about that order  i looked it up  their buyer was drunk  it was done  and now would he be discharged  the manager was speaking  probably  you looked it up eh  um  send me in the two orderrecords  well  but anyway i want you to be more careful after this wrenn  youre pretty sloppy  now get out expect me to make firms pay twice for the same order cause of your carelessness  mr wrenn found himself outside in the dark corridor the manager hadnt seemed much impressed by his revolt  the manager wasnt  he called a stenographer and dictated  bronx emporium  gentlemenour mr wrenn has again underline that again miss blaustein again looked up your order for may day novelties as we wrote before order certainly was duplicated by phone our mr wrenn is thoroughly reliable and we have his records of these two orders  we shall therefore have to push collection on both  after all mr wrenn was thinking the crafty manager might be merely concealing his hand  perhaps he had understood the defiance that gladdened him till after lunch  but at three when his head was again foggy with work and he had forgotten whether there was still april anywhere he began to dread what the manager might do to him  suppose he lost his job the job  he worked unnecessarily late hoping that the manager would learn of it as he wavered home drunk with weariness his fear of losing the job was almost equal to his desire to resign from the job   he had worked so late that when he awoke on sunday morning he was still in a whirl of figures  as he went out to his breakfast of coffee and whisked wheat at the hustler lunch the lines between the blocks of the cement walk radiant in a white flare of sunshine irritatingly recalled the crosslines of orderlists with the narrow cement blocks at the curb standing for unfilled columnheadings  even the ridges of the hustler lunchs imitation steel ceiling running in parallel lines jeered down at him that he was a prosaic man whose path was a ruler  he went clear up to the branch postoffice after breakfast to get the sunday mail but the mail was a disappointment he was awaiting a wonderful fully illustrated guide to the land of the midnight sun a suggestion of possible and coyly improbable trips whereas he got only a letter from his oldest acquaintancecousin john of parthenon new york the boywhocomestoplay of mr wrenns backyard days in parthenon without opening the letter mr wrenn tucked it into his inside coat pocket threw away his toothpick and turned to sunday wayfaring  he jogged down twentythird street to the north river ferries afoot trolleys took money and of course one saves up for future great traveling  over him the april clouds were fetterless vagabonds whose gaiety made him shrug with excitement and take a curb with a frisk as gambolsome as a central park lamb  there was no hint of saleslists in the clouds at least  and with them mr wrenns soul swept along while his halfsoled cumfeebest 380 shoes were ambling past warehouses  only once did he condescend to being really on twentythird street  at the ninth avenue corner under the grimy elevated he sighted two blocks down to the general theological seminarys brick gothic and found in a pointed doorway suggestions of alien beauty  but his real object was to loll on a west and south railroad in luxury and go sailing out into the foam and perilous seas of north river  he passed through the smokingcabin  he didnt smokethe habit used up travelmoney  once seated on the upper deck he knew that at last he was outwardbound on a liner true there was no great motion but mr wrenn was inclined to let realism off easily in this feature of his voyage  at least there were undoubted lifepreservers in the white racks overhead and everywhere the world to his certain witnessing was turned to crusading to setting forth in great ships as if it were again in the brisk morning of history when the joy of adventure possessed the argonauts  he wasnt excited over the liners they passed  he was so experienced in all of travel save the traveling as to have gained a calm interested knowledge  he knew the campagnia three docks away and explained to a harlem grocer her fine points speaking earnestly of stacks and sticks tonnage and knots  not excited butwhere couldnt he go if he were pulling out for arcady on the campagnia gee  what were even the buildingblock towers of the metropolitan and singer buildings and the timess creamstick compared with some old shrine in a cathedral close that was misted with centuries  all this he felt and hummed to himself though not in words he had never heard of arcady though for many years he had been a citizen of that demesne  sure he declared to himself he was on the liner now he was sliding up the muddy mersey see the w s travel notes for the source of his visions he was off to st georges square for an organrecital see the english baedeker then an express for london andgee  the ferryboat was entering her slip  mr wrenn trotted toward the bow to thrill over the bump of the boats snub nose against the lofty swaying piles and the swash of the brown waves heaped before her as she sidled into place  he was carried by the herd on into the station  he did not notice the individual people in his exultation as he heard the great chords of the stations paean  the vast roof roared as the iron coursers stamped titanic hoofs of scorn at the little stayathome  that is a washedout hint of how the poets might describe mr wrenns passion  what he said was gee  he strolled by the lists of destinations hung on the track gates chicago the plains the rockies sunset over miningcamps washington and the magic southlandthither the iron horses would be galloping their swarthy smoke manes whipped back by the whirlwind pounding out with clamorous strong hoofs their sixty miles an hour  very well  in time he also would mount upon the iron coursers and charge upon chicago and the southland just as soon as he got ready  then he headed for cortlandt street for long island city finally the navy yard  along his way were the docks of the tramp steamers where he might ship as steward in the allpromising sometime  he had never done anything so reckless as actually to ask a skipper for the chance to go asailing but he had once gone into a mission societys free shippingoffice on west street where a disapproving elder had grumped at him are you a sailor  no  cant do anything for you my friend are you saved  he wasnt going to risk another horror like that yet when the golden morning of sometime dawned he certainly was going to go cruising off to palmbordered lagoons  as he walked through long island city he contrived conversations with the sailors he passed  it would have surprised a norwegian bosuns mate to learn that he was really a gunrunner and that as a matter of fact he was now telling yarns of the spanish main to the man who slid deprecatingly by him  mr wrenn envied the jackies on the trainingship and carelessly went to sea as the presidents guest in the admirals barge and was frightened by the stare of a sauntering shopgirl and arrived home before dusk to mrs zapps straitened approval  dusk made incantations in his thirdfloorfront  pleasantly fagged in those slight neat legs after his walk mr wrenn sat in the wicker rocker by the window patting his scrubby tan mustache and reviewing the days wandering  when the gas was lighted he yearned over pictures in a geographical magazine for a happy hour then yawned to himself wellll willum guess its time to crawl into the downy  he undressed and smoothed his readymade suit on the rockingchair back  sitting on the edge of his bed quaint in his cotton nightgown like a rare little bird of dull plumage he rubbed his head sleepily  ummmmm  how tired he was he went to open the window  then his tamed heart leaped into a waltz and he forgot thirdfloorfronts and sleepiness  through the window came the chorus of foghorns on north river boommm that must be a giant liner battling up through the fog  it was a ferry  a liner  shed be roaring just like that if she were off the banks  if he were only off the banks  toot toot that was a tug  whawnnn  another liner  the tumultuous chorus repeated to him all the adventures of the day  he dropped upon the bed again and stared absently at his clothes  out of the inside coat pocket stuck the unopened letter from cousin john  he read a paragraph of it  he sprang from the bed and danced a tarantella pranced in his cottony nightgown like a drunken yaqui  the letter announced that the flinty farm at parthenon left to mr wrenn by his father had been sold  its location on a river bluff had made it valuable to the parthenon chautauqua association  there was now to his credit in the parthenon national bank nine hundred and forty dollars  he was wealthy then  he had enough to stalk up and down the earth for many venturesome but economical months till he should learn the trade of wandering and its mysterious trick of living without a job or a salary  he crushed his pillow with burrowing head and sobbed excitedly with a terrible stomachsinking and a chill shaking  then he laughed and wanted tobut didntrush into the adjacent hall room and tell the total stranger there of this worldchanging news he listened in the hall to learn whether the zapps were up but heard nothing returned and cantered up and down gloating on a map of the world  gee  its happened  i could travel all the time  i guess i wont bevery muchafraid of wrecks and stuff     things like that     gee  if i dont get to bed ill be late at the office in the morning  mr wrenn lay awake till three oclock  monday morning he felt rather ashamed of having done so eccentric a thing  but he got to the office on time  he was worried with the cares of wealth with having to decide when to leave for his worldwanderings but he was also very much aware that office managers are disagreeable if one isnt on time  all morning he did nothing more reckless than balance his new fortune plus his savings against steamship fares on a waste halfsheet of paper  the noonhour was not the jobs but his for exploration of the parlous lands of romance that lie hard by twentyeighth street and sixth avenue  but he had to go out to lunch with charley carpenter the assistant bookkeeper that he might tell the news as for charley he needed frequently to have a confidant who knew personally the tyrannous ways of the office manager mr guilfogle  mr wrenn and charley chose that is to say charley chose a table at drubels eating house  mr wrenn timidly hinted ive got some big news to tell you  but charley interrupted say did you hear old goglefogle light into me this morning  i wont stand for it  say did you hear himthe old  what was the trouble charley  trouble  nothing was the trouble  except with old goglefogle i made one little break in my accounts  why if old gogie had to keep track of seventyleven accounts and watch every single last movement of a fool girl that cant even run the addingmachine why hed get green around the gills  hed never do anything but make mistakes  well i guess the old codger must have had a bum breakfast this morning  wanted some exercise to digest it me i was the exercisei was the goat  he calls me in and he calls me down and mewell just lemme tell you wrenn i calls his bluff  charley carpenter stopped his rapid tirade delivered with quick headshakes like those of palsy to raise his smelly cigarette to his mouth  midway in this slow gesture the memory of his wrongs again overpowered him  he flung his right hand back on the table scattering cigarette ashes jerked back his head with the irritated patience of a nervous martyr then waved both hands about spasmodically while he snarled with his cheaply handsome smooth face more flushed than usual  sure  you can just bet your bottom dollar i let him see from the way i looked at him that i wasnt going to stand for no more monkey business  you bet i did  ill fix him i will you just watch me  hey drubel got any lemon merang  bring me a hunk will yuh  why wrenn that crosseyed doublejointed fat old slob ill slam him in the slats so hard some dayi will you just watch my smoke  if it wasnt for that messy wife of minei ought to desert her and i will some day and  yuh  mr wrenn was curt for a second  i know how it is charley but youll get over it honest you will  say ive got some news some land that my dad left me has sold for nearly a thousand plunks by the way this lunch is on me  let me pay for it charley  charley promised to let him pay quite readily  and expanding said  great wrenn  great  lemme congratulate you  dont know anybody id ratherve had this happen to  youre a meek little baalamb but youve got lots of stuff in you old wrennski oh say by the way could you let me have fifty cents till saturday  thanks   ill pay it back sure  by golly youre the only man around the office that preciates what a double ducklined old fiend old goglefogle is the old  aw

dont need to be scared about the job youll realize it and youll want to soak him sames i do  say  the impulse of a great idea made him gleefully shake his fist sidewise  say why dont you soak him  they bank on you at the souvenir company  darn sight more than you realize lemme tell you why you do about half the stockkeepers work sides your own tell you what you do  you go to old goglefogle and tell him you want a raise to twentyfive and want it right now  yes by golly thirty youre worth that or pretty darn near it but course old goglefoglell never give it to you  hell threaten to fire you

right in the bus  but cant you see you poor nut you wont be leaving emtheyll either pay you what they ought to or lose you  oh i dont know about that charley  charley was making up for some uncertainty as to his own logic by beaming persuasiveness and mr wrenn was afraid of being hypnotized  no no he throbbed rising  well all right snarled charley if you like to be gogies goat  oh youre all right wrennski  i suppose you had ought to stay if you feel you got to  well so long ive got to beat it over and buy a pair of socks before i go back  mr wrenn crept out of drubels behind him very melancholy even charley admitted that he had ought to stay then and what chance was there of persuading the dread mr mortimer r guilfogle that he wished to be looked upon as one resigning where then any chance of globetrotting perhaps for months he would remain in slavery and he had hoped just that morning one dreadful quarterhour with mr guilfogle and he might be free he grinned to himself as he admitted that this was like seeing europe after merely swimming the midwinter atlantic  well he had nine minutes more by his twodollar watch nine minutes of vagabondage  he gazed across at a greek restaurant with signs in real greek letters like ruins atwell at aythens a chinese chopsuey den with a redandyellow carved dragon and at an upper window a squat chinaman who might easily be carrying a kris or whatever them chink knives are as he observed for the hundredth time he had taken this journey a rotisserie before whose upright fender of scarlet coals whole ducks were happily roasting to a shiny brown in a furriers window were siberian foxes skins siberia huts of awful brave convicks the steely northern sea guards in blouses just as hed seen them at an academy of music play and a polar bear meaning to him the northern lights the long hike and the igloo at night  and the florists  there were orchids that though he only half knew it and that all inarticulately whispered to him of jungles where in the hot hush he saw the slumbering python andwhat was it in that poem that mandalay thing was it about jungles  anyway   them garlicky smells and the sunshine and the palms and the bells   he had to hurry back to the office  he stopped only to pat the head of a florists delivery horse that looked wistfully at him from the curb  poor old fella  what you thinking about want to be a circus horse and wander  les beat it together you cant eh  poor old fella  at threethirty the time when it seems to office persons that the days work never will end even by a miracle mr wrenn was shaky about his duty to the firm  he was more so after an electrical interview with the manager who spent a few minutes which he happened to have free in roaring i want to know why at mr wrenn  there was no particular why that he wanted to know he was merely getting scientific efficiency out of employees a phrase which mr guilfogle had taken from a business magazine that dilutes efficiency theories for inefficient employers  at fivetwenty the manager summoned him complimented him on nothing in particular and suggested that he stay late with charley carpenter and the stockkeeper to inventory a line of deskclocks which they were closing out  as mr wrenn returned to his desk he stopped at a window on the corridor and coveted the bright late afternoon  the cornices of lofty buildings glistened the sunset shone fierily through the glassinclosed layerlike upper floors  he wanted to be out there in the streets with the shopping crowds  old goglefogle didnt consider him why should he consider the firm       chapter ii  he walks with miss theresa      as he left the souvenir company building after working late at taking inventory and roamed down toward fourteenth street mr wrenn felt forlornly aimless  the worst of it all was that he could not go to the nickelorion for moving pictures not after having been cut by the tickettaker  then there before him was the glaring sign of the nickelorion tempting him a bill with great train robbery film tonight made his heart thump like stairclimbingand he dashed at the ticketbooth with a nickel doughtily extended  he felt queer about the scalp as the cashier girl slid out a coupon  why did she seem to be watching him so closely  as he dropped the ticket in the chopper he tried to glance away from the brassbutton man  for one nineteenth of a second he kept his head turned  it turned back of itself he stared full at the man half bowedand received a hearty absentminded nod and a fine evenin he sang to himself a monotonous song of great joy  when he stumbled over the feet of a large german in getting to a seat he apologized as though he were accustomed to laugh easily with many friends  the trainrobbery film waswell he kept repeating gee to himself pantingly  how the masked men did sneak simply sneak and sneak behind the bushes  mr wrenn shrank as one of them leered out of the picture at him  how gallantly the train dashed toward the robbers to the spiritstirring roll of the snaredrum  the rush from the bushes followed the battle with detectives concealed in the expresscar  mr wrenn was standing sturdily and shooting coolly with the slender hawkfaced pinkerton man in puttees with him he leaped to horse and followed the robbers through the forest  he stayed through the whole program twice to see the train robbery again  as he started to go out he found the tickettaker changing his long lightblue robe of state for a highly commonplace sackcoat without brass buttons  in his astonishment at seeing how a highness could be transformed into an everyday man mr wrenn stopped and having stopped spoke  uhthat was quite aquite a picturethat train robbery wasnt it  yuh i guessnow wheres the devil and his wife flew away to with my hat  them guys is always swiping it  picture mister  why i didnt see it no more nsay you pink eye say you crabfooted usher did you swipe my hat  aint he the cutup mister aint both them ushers the jingling sheepsheads though  being cute and hiding my hat in the boxoffice picture  i dont get no chance to see any of em  funny aint itme barking for em like i was the grandmother of the guy that invented em and not knowing whether the train robberynow who stole my goinghome shoes why i dont know whether the train did any robbing or not  he slapped mr wrenn on the back and the sales clerks heart bounded in comradeship  he was surprised into declaring  sayuhi bowed to you the other night and youwell honestly you acted like you never saw me  well well now and thats what happens to me for being the dad of five kids and a shegirl and a tomcat  sure i couldnt ve seen you  me i was probably that busy with fambly caresi was probably thinking who was it et the lemon pie on mewas it pete or johnny or shall i lick em both together or just bite me wife  mr wrenn knew that the tickettaker had never never really considered biting his wife  he knew  his nod and grin and thats the idea were urbanely sophisticated  he urged  oh yes im sure you didnt intend to hand me the icy mitt say  im thirsty  come on over to mojes and ill buy you a drink  he was aghast at this abyss of moneyspending into which he had leaped and the brassbutton man was suspiciously wondering what this person wanted of him but they crossed to the adjacent saloon a new york corner saloon which of course glittered with a large mirror heaped glasses and a long shining footrail on which in bravado mr wrenn placed his cumfeebest shoe  uh said the bartender  rye jimmy said the brassbutton man  uhhhhh said mr wrenn in a frightened diminuendo now thatwealthy citizen though he had becomehe was in danger of exposure as a mollycoddle who couldnt choose his drink properly stummick been hurting me  guess id better just take a lemonade  youre the brotherinlaw to a wise one commented the brassbutton man  me i aint never got the sense to do the traffic cop on the booze  the old woman she says to me mory she says if you was in heaven and there was a pail of beer on one side and a gold harp on the other she says and you was to have your pick which would you take and what d yuh think i answers her  the beer said the bartender  she had your number all right  not on your tintype declared the tickettaker  me i says to her  me  id pinch the harp and pawn it for ten growlers of dutch beer and some mansized rum  hee hee hee grinned mr wrenn  ha ha ha grumbled the bartender  wellll yawned the tickettaker the old womanll be chasing me best pants around the flat if she dont have me to chase pretty soon  guess id better beat it  much obliged for the drink mr uh  so long jimmy  mr wrenn set off for home in a high state of exhilaration which he noticed exactly resembled driving an aeroplane and went briskly up the steps of the zapps genteel but unexciting residence  he was much nearer to heaven than west sixteenth street appears to be to the outsider  for he was an explorer of the arctic a trusted man on the job an associate of witty bohemians  he was an army lieutenant who had with his friend the hawkfaced pinkerton man stood off bandits in an attack on a train  he opened and closed the door gaily  he was an apologetic little mr wrenn  his landlady stood on the bottom step of the hall stairs in a bunchy mother hubbard groaning  mist wrenn if you got to come in so late ah wish you wouldnt just make all the noise you can  ah dont see why ah should have to be kept awake all night  ah suppose its the will of the lord that whenever ah go out to see mrs muzzy and just drink a drop of coffee ah must get insomina but ah dont see why anybody that tries to be a gennulman should have to go and bang the door and just rack mah nerves  he slunk upstairs behind mrs zapps lumbering gloom   theres something i wanted to tell you mrs zappsomething thats happened to me  thats why i was out celebrating last evening and got in so late  mr wrenn was diffidently sitting in the basement  yes dryly ah noticed you was out late mist wrenn  you see mrs zapp iuhmy father left me some land and its been sold for about one thousand plunks   ahm awful glad mist wrenn she said funereally  maybe youd like to take that hall room beside yours now  the two roomsd make a nice apartment  she really said nahs pahtmun you understand  why i hadnt thought much about that yet he felt guilty and was profusely cordial to lee theresa zapp the factory forewoman who had just thumped downstairs  miss theresa was a large young lady with a bust much black hair and a handsome disdainful discontented face  she waited till he had finished greeting her then sniffed and at her mother she snarled  ma they went and kept us late again tonight  im getting just about tired of having a bunch of jews and yankees think im a nigger  uff  i hate them  tresa mist wrenns just inherited two thousand dollars and hes going to take that upper hall room  mrs zapp beamed with maternal fondness at the timid lodger  but the gallant friend of pinkertons faced herfor the first time  waste his travelmoney he was inwardly exclaiming as he said  but i thought you had some one in that room  i heard som  that fellow  oh he aint going to be permnent  and he promised meso you can have  im awful sorry mrs zapp but im afraid i cant take it fact is i may go traveling for a while  cose youll keep your room if you do mist wrenn  why im afraid ill have to give it up butoh i may not be going for a long long while yet and of course ill be glad to comeill want to come back here when i get back to new york i wont be gone for more than oh probably not more than a year anyway and  and ah thought you said you was going to be permnent mrs zapp began quietly prefatory to working herself up into hysterics  and here ahve gone and had your room fixed up just for you and new paper put in and youve always been talking such a lot about how you wanted your furniture arranged and ahve gone and made all mah plans  mr wrenn had been a shyly paying guest of the zapps for four years  that famous new paper had been put up two years before so he spluttered  oh im awfully sorry  i wishuhi dont  ahd thank you mist wrenn if you could conveniently let me know before you go running off and leaving me with empty rooms with the landlord after the rent and me turning away people that d pay more for the room because ah wanted to keep it for you  and people always coming to see you and making me answer the door and  even the roominghouse worm was making small wormlike sounds that presaged turning  lee theresa snapped just in time oh cut it out ma will you  she had been staring at the worm for he had suddenly become interesting and adorable and incidentally an heir  i dont see why mr wrenn aint giving us all the notice we can expect  he said he mightnt be going for a long time  oh grunted mrs zapp  so mah own flesh and blood is going to turn against me  she rose  her appearance of majesty was somewhat lessened by the creak of stays but her instinct for unpleasantness was always good  she said nothing as she left them and she plodded upstairs with a train of sighs  mr wrenn looked as though sudden illness had overpowered him but theresa laughed and remarked  you dont want to let ma get on her high horse mr wrenn  shes a bluff  with much billowing of the lower less stiff part of her garments she sailed to the cloudy mirror over the magazinefilled bookcase and inspected her cap of false curls with many prods of her large firm hands which flashed with brazilian diamonds  though he had heard the word puffs he did not know that half her hair was false  he stared at it  though in disgrace he felt the honor of knowing so ample and rustling a woman as miss lee theresa  but say i wish i could ve let her know i was going earlier miss zapp  i didnt know it myself but it does seem like a mean trick  i spose i ought to pay her something extra  why child you wont do anything of the sort  ma hasnt got a bit of kick coming  youve always been awful nice far as i can see  she smiled lavishly  i went for a walk tonight i wish all those men wouldnt stare at a girl so  im sure i dont see why they should stare at me  mr wrenn nodded but that didnt seem to be the right comment so he shook his head then looked frightfully embarrassed  i went by that armenian restaurant you were telling me about mr wrenn  some time i believe ill go dine there  again she paused  he said only yes it is a nice place  remarking to herself that there was no question about it after all he was a little fool theresa continued the siege do you dine there often  oh yes  it is a nice place  could a lady go there  why yes i  yes  i should think so he finished  oh  i do get so awfully tired of the greasy stuff ma and goaty dish up  they think a big stew that tastes like dishwater is a dinner and if they do have anything i like they keep on having the same thing every day till i throw it in the sink  i wish i could go to a restaurant once in a while for a change but of coursei dunnos it would be proper for a lady to go alone even there  what do you think  oh dear she sat brooding sadly  he had an inspiration  perhaps miss theresa could be persuaded to go out to dinner with him some time  he begged  gee i wish youd let me take you up there some evening miss zapp  now didnt i tell you to call me miss theresa  well i suppose you just dont want to be friends with me  nobody does  she brooded again  oh i didnt mean to hurt your feelings  honest i didnt ive always thought youd think i was fresh if i called you miss theresa and so i  why i guess i could go up to the armenian with you perhaps when would you like to go  you know ive always got lots of dates but iumlets see i think i could go tomorrow evening  lets do it  shall i call for you missuhtheresa  yes you may if youll be a good boy  good night she departed with an air of intimacy  mr wrenn scuttled to the nickelorion and admitted to the brassbutton man that he was feeling pretty good s evening  he had never supposed that a handsome creature like miss theresa could ever endure such a slow fellow as himself  for about one minute he considered with a chill the question of whether she was agreeable because of his new wealth but reproved the fiend who was making the suggestion for had he not heard her mention with great scorn a second cousin who had married an old yankee for his money  that just settled that he assured himself and scowled at a passing messengerboy for having thus hinted but hastily grimaced as the youngster showed signs of loud displeasure   the armenian restaurant is peculiar for it has foreign food at low prices and is below thirtieth street yet it has not become bohemian  consequently it has no bad music and no crowd of persons from missouri whose women risk salvation for an evening by smoking cigarettes  here prosperous oriental merchants of mild natures and bandit faces drink semiliquid turkish coffee and discuss rugs and revolutions  in fact the place seemed so unartificial that theresa facing mr wrenn was bored  and the menu was foreign without being society viands  it suggested rats tails and birds nests she was quite sure  she would gladly have experimented with pate de foie gras or alligatorpears but what social prestige was there to be gained at the factory by remarking that she always did like pahklava  mr wrenn did not see that she was glancing about discontentedly for he was delightedly listening to a lanky young man at the next table who was remarking to his visavis a pale slithey lady in black with the lines of a torpedoboat  try some of the stuffed vineleaves child of the angels and some wheat pilaf and some bourma  your wheat pilaf is a comfortable food and cheering to the stomach of man simply wonderful  as for the bourma he is a merry beast a brown rose of pastry with honey cunningly secreted between his petals andhere  waiter stuffed vineleaves wheat plaf bourmtwice on the order and hustle it  when you get through listening to that manhe talks like a bar of soaptell me what there is on this bill of fare thats safe to eat snorted theresa  i thought he was real funny insisted mr wrenn  im sure youll like shish kebab and s  shish kibub  who ever heard of such a thing  havent they anyoh i thought theyd have stuff they call turkish delight and things like that  turkish delights is cigarettes i think  well i know it isnt because i read about it in a story in a magazine  and they were eating it  on the terrace  what is that shish kibub  kebab  its lamb roasted on skewers  i know youll like it  well im not going to trust any heathens to cook my meat ill take some eggs and some of thatwhat was it the idiot was talking aboutberma  bourma  thats awful nice  with honey  and do try some of the stuffed peppers and rice  all right said theresa gloomily  somehow mr wrenn wasnt vastly transformed even by the possession of the two thousand dollars her mother had reported he was still funny and sort of scary not like the overpowering southern gentlemen she supposed she remembered also she was hungry  she listened with stolid glumness to mr wrenns observation that that was an awful big hat the lady with the funny guy had on  he was chilled into quietness till papa gouroff the owner of the restaurant arrived from abovestairs  papa gouroff was a russian jew who had been a police spy in poland and a hotel proprietor in mogador where he called himself turkish and married a renegade armenian  he had a nose like a sickle and a neck like a bluegum nigger  he hoped that the place would degenerate into a bohemian restaurant where liberal clergymen would think they were slumming and barbers would think they were entering society so he always wore a fez and talked bad arabic  he was local color atmosphere bohemian flavor  mr wrenn murmured to theresa  say do you see that man  hes signor gouroff the owner ive talked to him a lot of times  aint he great  golly look at that beak of his  dont he make you think of kiosks and hyrems and stuff  gee  what does he make you think  hes got on a dirty collar  that waiters awful slow would you please be so kind and pour me another glass of water  but when she reached the honied bourma she grew tolerant toward mr wrenn  she had two cups of cocoa and felt fat about the eyes and affectionate  she had mentioned that there were good shows in town  now she resumed  have you been to the gold brick yet  no iuhi dont go to the theater much  gwendolyn muzzy was telling me that this was the funniest show shed ever seen  tells how two confidence men fooled one of those terrible little jay towns  shows all the funny people you know like they have in jay towns  i wish i could go to it but of course i have to help out the folks at home so well  oh dear  say id like to take you if i could  lets gothis evening  he quivered with the adventure of it  why i dont know i didnt tell ma i was going to be out butoh i guess it would be all right if i was with you  lets go right up and get some tickets  all right  her assent was too eager but she immediately corrected that error by yawning i dont suppose id ought to go but if you want to  they were a very lively couple as they walked up  he trickled sympathy when she told of the selfishness of the factory girls under her and the meanness of the superintendent over her and he laughed several times as she remarked that the superintendent ought to be boiled alivethats what all lobsters ought to be so she repeated the epigram with such increased jollity that they swung up to the theater in a gale and once facing the ennuied ticketseller he demanded dollar seats just as though he had not been doing sums all the way up to prove that seventyfivecent seats were the best he could afford  the play was a glorification of yankee smartness  mr wrenn was disturbed by the fact that the swindler heroes robbed quite all the others but he was stirred by the brisk romance of moneymaking  the swindlers were supermenblonde beasts with card indices and options instead of clubs  not that mr wrenn made any observations regarding supermen  but when by way of commercial genius the swindler robbed a young night clerk mr wrenn whispered to theresa gee he certainly does know how to jolly them heh  shhhhhh said theresa  every one made millions victims and all in the last act as a proof of the social value of being a live american business man as they oozed along with the departing audience mr wrenn gurgled  that makes me feel just like id been making a million dollars  masterfully he proposed say lets go some place and have something to eat  all right  letsi almost feel as if i could afford rectors after that play but anyway lets go to allaires  though he was ashamed of himself for it afterward he was almost haughty toward his waiter and ordered welsh rabbits and beer quite as though he usually breakfasted on them  he may even have strutted a little as he hailed a car with an imaginary walkingstick  his parting with miss theresa was intimate he shook her hand warmly  as he undressed he hoped that he had not been too abrupt with the waiter poor cuss  but he lay awake to think of theresas hair and handclasp of polished desks and florid gentlemen who curtly summoned bankpresidents and who hadhe tossed the bedclothes about in his struggle to get the wordwho had a punch  he would do that great traveling of his in the land of big business  the five thousand princes of new york to protect themselves against the four million ungrateful slaves had devised the sacred symbols of dresscoats large houses and automobiles as the outward and visible signs of the virtue of making money to lure rebels into respectability and teach them the social value of getting a dollar away from that inhuman socially injurious fiend some one else  that our mr wrenn should dream for dreamings sake was catastrophic he might do things because he wanted to not because they were fashionable whereupon police forces and the clergy would disband wall street and fifth avenue would go thundering down  hence for him were provided those y m c a night bookkeeping classes administered by solemn earnest men of thirty for solemn credulous youths of twentynine those sermons on content articles on building up the rundown store by live advertising kiplingesque stories about playing the game and correspondenceschool advertisements that shrieked mount the ladder to thorough knowledgethe path to power and to the fuller payenvelope  to all these mr wrenn had been indifferent for they showed no imagination  but when he saw big business glorified by a humorous melodrama then the job appeared to him as picaresque adventure and he was in peril of his imagination   the eightoclock sun which usually found a wildly shaving mr wrenn discovered him dreaming that he was the manager of the souvenir company  but that was a complete misunderstanding of the case  the manager of the souvenir company was mr mortimer r guilfogle and he called mr wrenn in to acquaint him with that fact when the new magnate started his career in big business by arriving at the office one hour late  what made it worse considered mr guilfogle was that this wrenn had a higher average of punctuality than any one else in the office which proved that he knew better  worst of all the guilfogle family eggs had not been scrambled right at breakfast they had been anemic  mr guilfogle punched the buzzer and set his face toward the door with a scowl prepared  mr wrenn seemed weary and not so intimidated as usual  look here wrenn you were just about two hours late this morning  what do you think this office is  a club or a readingroom for hoboes  ever occur to you wed like to have you favor us with a call now and then sos we can learn how youre getting along at golf or whatever youre doing these days  there was a sample babyshoe office pincushion on the managers desk  mr wrenn eyed this and said nothing  the manager  hear what i said  dyuh think im talking to give my throat exercise  mr wrenn was stubborn  i couldnt help it  couldnt help  and you call that an explanation  i know just exactly what youre thinking wrenn youre thinking that because ive let you have a lot of chances to really work into the business lately youre necessary to us and not simply an expense  oh no mr guilfogle honest i didnt think  well hang it man you want to think  what do you suppose we pay you a salary for  and just let me tell you wrenn right here and now that if you cant condescend to spare us some of your valuable time now and then we can good and plenty get along without you  an old tale oft told and never believed but it interested mr wrenn just now  im real glad you can get along without me  ive just inherited a big wad of money  i think ill resign  right now  whether he or mr mortimer r guilfogle was the more aghast at hearing him bawl this no one knows  the manager was so worried at the thought of breaking in a new man that his eyeglasses slipped off his poor perspiring nose  he begged in sudden tones of old friendship  why you cant be thinking of leaving us  why we expect to make a big man of you wrenn  i was joking about firing you you ought to know that after the talk we had at mouquins the other night  you cant be thinking of leaving us  theres no end of possibilities here  sorry said the dogged soldier of dreams  why wailed that hurt and astonished victim of ingratitude mr guilfogle  ill leave the middle of june  thats plenty of notice chirruped mr wrenn  at five that evening mr wrenn dashed up to the brassbutton man at his station before the nickelorion crying  say  you come from ireland dont you  now what would you think  meoh no im a chinaman from oshkosh  no honest straight tell me  ive got a chance to travel what dyuh think of that  aint it great  and im going right away  what i wanted to ask you was whats the best place in ireland to see  donegal o course  i was born there  hauling from his pocket a pencil and a worn envelope mr wrenn joyously added the new point of interest to a list ranging from delagoa bay to denver  he skipped uptown looking at the stars  he shouted as he saw the stacks of a big cunarder bulking up at the end of fourteenth street  he stopped to chuckle over a lithograph of the parthenon at the window of a greek bootblacks stand starssteamertemples all these were his  he owned them now he was free  lee theresa sat waiting for him in the basement livingroom till tenthirty while he was flirting with trainboards at the grand central  then she went to bed and though he knew it not that prince of wealthy suitors mr wrenn had entirely lost the heart and hand of miss zapp of the f f v   he stood before the managers godlike desk on june 14 1910  sadly  goodby mr guilfogle  leaving today  i wishgee i wish i could tell you you knowabout how much i appreciate  the manager moved a wire basket of carbon copies of letters from the left side of his desk to the right staring at them thoughtfully rearranged his pencils in a pile before his inkwell glanced at the point of an indelible pencil with a manner of startled examination tapped his deskblotter with his knuckles then raised his eyes  he studied mr wrenn smiled put on the look he used when inviting him out for a drink  mr guilfogle was essentially an honest fellow harshened by the job a wellsatisfied victim with the imagination clean gone out of him so that he took followup letters and the celerity of officeboys as the only serious things in the world  he was strong alive not at all a bad chap merely efficient  well wrenn i suppose theres no use of rubbing it in  course you know what i think about the whole thing  it strikes me youre a fool to leave a good job  but after all thats your business not ours  we like you and when you get tired of being just a bum why come back well always try to have a job open for you  meanwhile i hope youll have a mighty good time old man  where you going  when dyuh start out  why first im going to just kind of wander round generally lots of things id like to do  i think ill get away real soon now  thank you awfully mr guilfogle for keeping a place open for me  course i probly wont need it but gee  i sure do appreciate it  say i dont believe youre so plumb crazy about leaving us after all now that the cards are all dole out  straight now are you  yes sir it does make me feel a little bluebeen here so long  but itll be awful good to get out at sea  yuh i know wrenn  id like to go traveling myselfi suppose you fellows think i wouldnt care to go bumming around like you do and never have to worry about how the firms going to break even  butwell goodby old man and dont forget us  drop me a line now and then and let me know how youre getting along  oh say if you happen to see any novelties that look good let us hear about them  but drop me a line anyway well always be glad to hear from you  well goodby and good luck sure and drop me a line  in the corner which had been his home for eight years mr wrenn could not devise any new and yet more improved arrangement of the wire baskets and clips and desk reminders so he cleaned a pen blew some gray eraserdust from under his iron inkwell standard and decided that his desk was in order reflecting  hed been there a long time  now he could never come back to it no matter how much he wanted to  how good the manager had been to him  gee he hadnt appreciated how considerut guilfogle was  he started down the corridor on a round of farewells to the boys too bad he hadnt never got better acquainted with them but it was too late now  anyway they were such fine jolly sports theyd never miss a stupid guy like him  just then he met them in the corridor all of them except guilfogle headed by rabin the traveling salesman and charley carpenter who was bearing a box of handkerchiefs with a large greenandcrimsonpaper label  govnor wrenn orated charley upon this suspicious occasion we have the pleasure of showing by this small token of our esteem our preciation of your untiring efforts in the investigation of mortimer r gugglegiggle of the graft trust and  say old man joking aside were mighty sorry youre going anduhwell wed like to give you something to show wereuhmighty sorry youre going  we thought of a box of cigars but you dont smoke much anyway these hankchiefsll help to showthree cheers for wrenn fellows  afterward by his desk alone holding the box of handkerchiefs with the resplendent redandgreen label mr wrenn began to cry   he was lying abed at eightthirty on a morning of late june two weeks after leaving the souvenir company deliberately hunting over his pillow for cool spots very hot and restless in the legs and enormously depressed in the soul  he would have got up had there been anything to get up for  there was nothing yet he felt uneasily guilty  for two weeks he had been afraid of losing by neglect the job he had already voluntarily given up so there are men whom the fear of death has driven to suicide  nearly every morning he had driven himself from bed and had finished shaving before he was quite satisfied that he didnt have to get to the office on time  as he wandered about during the day he remarked with frequency im scared as teachers pet playing hookey for the first time like what we used to do in parthenon all proper persons were at work of a weekday afternoon  what then was he doing walking along the street when all morality demanded his sitting at a desk at the souvenir company being a little more careful to win the divine favor of mortimer r guilfogle  he was sure that if he were already out on the great traveling he would be able to push the buzzer on himself and get up his nerve but he did not know where to go  he had planned so many trips these years that now he couldnt keep any one of them finally decided on for more than an hour  it rather stretched his short arms to embrace at once a gay old dream of seeing venice and the stern civic duty of hunting abominably dangerous beasts in the guatemala bush  the expense bothered him too  he had through many years so persistently saved money for the great traveling that he begrudged money for that traveling itself  indeed he planned to spend not more than 300 of the 123580 he had now accumulated on his first venture during which he hoped to learn the trade of wandering  he was always influenced by a sentence he had read somewhere about one of those globetrotters you meet carrying a monkeywrench in calcutta then in raiment and a monocle at the athenaeum  he would learn some kiplingy trade that would teach him the use of astonishingly technical tools also daring and the location of smugglers haunts copra islands and whalingstations with curious names  he pictured himself shipping as third engineer at the manihiki islands or engaged for taking moving pictures of an aeroplane flight in algiers  he had to get away from zappism  he had to be out on the iron seas where the battleships and liners went by like a marching military band  but he couldnt get started  once beyond sandy hook he would immediately know all about engines and fighting  it would help he was certain to be shanghaied  but no matter how wistfully no matter how late at night he timorously forced himself to loiter among unwashed english stokers on west street he couldnt get himself molested except by glib persons wishing ten cents for a place to sleep  when he had dallied through breakfast that particular morning he sat about  once he had pictured sitting about reading travelbooks as a perfect occupation  but it concealed no exciting little surprises when he could be a sunday loafer on any plain monday  furthermore goaty never made his bed till noon and the grayandbrownpatched coverlet seemed to trail all about the disordered room  midway in a paragraph he rose threw one hundred ways to see california on the tumbled bed and ran away from our mr wrenn but our mr wrenn pursued him along the wharves where the sun glared on oily water  he had seen the wharves twelve times that fortnight  in fact he even cried viciously that he had seen too blame much of the blame wharves  early in the afternoon he went to a movingpicture show but the first sight of the white giant figures bulking against the gray background was wearily unreal and when the inevitable largeeyed blackbraided indian maiden met the canonical cowpuncher he threshed about in his seat was irritated by the nervous click of the machine and the hot stuffiness of the room and ran away just at the exciting moment when the indian chief dashed into camp and summoned his braves to the warpath  perhaps he could hide from thought at home  as he came into his room he stood at gaze like a kitten of good family beholding a mangy mongrel asleep in its pink basket for on his bed was mrs zapp her rotund curves stretching behind her large flat feet whose soles were toward him  she was noisily somnolent her stays creaked regularly as she breathed except when she moved slightly and groaned  guiltily he tiptoed downstairs and went snuffling along the dusty unvaried brick side streets wondering where in all new york he could go  he read minutely a placard advertising an excursion to the catskills to start that evening  for an exhilarated moment he resolved to go but oh there was a lot of them rich society folks up there  he bought a morning american and sitting in union square gravely studied the humorous drawings  he casually noticed the help wanted advertisements  they suggested an uninteresting idea that somehow he might find it economical to go venturing as a waiter or farmhand  and so he came to the gate of paradise   men wanted  free passage on cattleboats to liverpool feeding cattle  low fee  easy work  fast boats  apply international and atlantic employment bureaugreenwich street   gee he cried i guess providence has picked out my first hike for me       chapter iii  he starts for the land of elsewhere      the international and atlantic employment bureau is a long dirty room with the plaster cracked like the outlines on a map hung with steamship posters and the laws of new york regarding employment offices which are regarded as humorous by the proprietor m baraieff a short slender ejaculatory person with a nervous black beard lively blandness and a knowledge of all the incorrect usages of nine languages  mr wrenn edged into this junkheap of nationalities with interested wonder m baraieff rubbed his smooth wicked hands together and bowed a number of times  confidentially leaning across the counter mr wrenn murmured say i read your ad about wanting cattlemen  i want to make a trip to europe  how  yes yes yes yes mistaire  i feex you up right away ten dollars pleassss  well what does that entitle me to  i tole you i feex you up  ha  ha  i know it you are a gentleman you want a nice leetle trip on europe  sure  i feex you right up  i send you off on a nice easy cattleboat where you wont have to work much hardly any  right away it goes  ten dollars pleassss  but when does the boat start  where does it start from  mr wrenn was a bit confused  he had never met a man who grimaced so politely and so rapidly  next tuesday i send you right off  mr wrenn regretfully exchanged ten dollars for a card informing trubiggs atlantic avenue boston that mr ren was to be ship 1st poss catel boat right away and charge my acct fee paid baraieff brightly declaring i geef you a fine ship m baraieff added on the margin of the card in copperplate script best ship easy work  he caroled come early next tuesday morning and bowed out mr wrenn like a parisian shopkeeper  the row of waiting servantgirls curtsied as though they were a hedge swayed by the wind while mr wrenn selfconsciously hurried to get past them  he was too excited to worry over the patient and quiet suffering with which mrs zapp heard the announcement that he was going that theresa laughed at him for a cattleman while goaty in the kitchen audibly observed that nobody but a yankee would travel in a pigpen merely increased his joy in moving his belongings to a storage warehouse  tuesday morning clad in a sweaterjacket tennisshoes an old felt hat a khaki shirt and corduroys carrying a suitcase packed to bursting with clothes and baedekers with one hundred and fifty dollars in expresscompany drafts craftily concealed he dashed down to baraieffs hole  though it was only eightthirty he was afraid he was going to be late  till 2 pm  he sat waiting then was sent to the joy steamship line wharf with a ticket to boston and a letter to trubiggss shippingoffice  give bearer ren as per inclosed receet one trip england catel boat charge my acct  sylvestre baraieff n y   standing on the hurricanedeck of the joy line boat with his suitcase guardedly beside him he crooned to himself tuneless chants with the refrain free free out to sea  free free thats me he had persuaded himself that there was practically no danger of the boats sinking or catching fire  anyway he just wasnt going to be scared  as the steamer trudged up east river he watched the late afternoon sun brighten the manhattan factories and make soft the stretches of westchester fields of course he thrilled  he had no stateroom but was entitled to a place in a twelveberth room in the hold  here large farmers without their shoes were grumpily talking all at once so he returned to the deck and the rest of the night while the other passengers snored he sat modestly on a canvas stool unblinkingly gloating over a seafabric of frosty blue that was shot through with golden threads when they passed lighthouses or ships  at dawn he was weary pepperyeyed but he viewed the flooding light with approval  at last boston  the front part of the shippingoffice on atlantic avenue was a glassinclosed room littered with chairs piles of circulars old pictures of cunarders older calendars and directories to be ranked as antiques  in the midst of these remains a redheaded yankee of forty smoking a pittsburg stogie sat tilted back in a kitchen chair reading the boston american mr wrenn delivered m baraieffs letter and stood waiting holding his suitcase ready to skip out and go aboard a cattleboat immediately  the shippingagent glanced through the letter then snapped  bryffs crazy  always sends em too early  wrenn you ought to come to me first  what jyuh go to that jew first for  here he goes and sends you a day lateor couple days too early  f youd got here last night i could ve sent you off this morning on a dominion line boat  all i got now is a leyland boat that starts from portland saturday  les see this is wednesday thursday fridayyoull have to wait three days  now you

you can see for yourself boats aint leaving every minute just to please bryff  and its the busy season  bunches of rahrah boys wanting to cross and canadians wanting to get back to england and jews beating it to polandto sling bombs at the czar i guess  and lemme tell you them jews is all right  theyre willing to pay for a mans time and trouble in getting em fixed up and so  with dignity mr william wrenn stated  of course ill be glad touhmake it worth your while  i thought you was a gentleman  hey al al  an underfed boy with few teeth dusty and grown out of his trousers appeared clear off a chair for the gentleman  stick that valise on top my desk  sit down mr wrenn  you see its like this  ill tell you in confidence you understand  this letter from bryff aint worth the paper its written on  he aint got any right to be sending out men for cattleboats  me im running that i deal direct with all the boston and portland lines  if you dont believe it just go out in the back room and ask any of the cattlemen out there  yes i see mr wrenn observed as though he were ill and toed an old almanac about the floor  uhmrtrubiggs is it  yump  yump my boy  trubiggs  tru by name and true by nature  heh  this last was said quite without conviction  it was evidently a joke which had come down from earlier years  mr wrenn ignored it and declared as stoutly as he could  you see mr trubiggs id be willing to pay you  ill tell you just how it is mr wrenn  i aint one of these sheeny employment bureaus im an american i like to look out for americans  even if you didnt come to me first ill watch out for your interests sames if they was mine  now do you want to get fixed up with a nice fast boat that leaves portland next saturday just a couple of days wait  oh yes i do mr trubiggs  well my list is really fullmen waiting toobut if it d be worth five dollars to you to  heres the five dollars  the shippingagent was disgusted  he had estimated from mr wrenns cheap sweaterjacket and tennisshoes that he would be able to squeeze out only three or four dollars and here he might have made ten  more in sorrow than in anger  of course you understand i may have a lot of trouble working you in on the next boat you coming as late as this  course five dollars is less n what i usually get he contemptuously tossed the bill on his desk  if you want me to slip a little something extra to the agents  mr wrenn was too headachy to be customarily timid  lets see that  did i give you only five dollars  receiving the bill he folded it with much primness tucked it into the pocket of his shirt and remarked  now you said youd fix me up for five dollars  besides that letter from baraieff is a form with your name printed on it so i know you do business with him right along  if five dollars aint enough why then you can just go to hell mr trubiggs yes sir thats what you can do  im just getting tired of monkeying around  if five is enough ill give this back to you friday when you send me off to portland if you give me a receipt  there  he almost snarled so weary and discouraged was he  now trubiggs was a warmhearted rogue and he liked the society of what he called white people  he laughed poked a pittsburg stogie at mr wrenn and consented  all right  ill fix you up  have a smoke  pay me the five friday or pay it to my foreman when he puts you on the cattleboat  i dont care a rap which  youre all right cant bluff you eh  and further bluffing mr wrenn he suggested to him a lodginghouse for his two nights in boston  tell the clerk that redheaded trubiggs sent you and hell give you the best in the house  tell him youre a friend of mine  when mr wrenn had gone mr trubiggs remarked to some one by telephone nother sucker coming blaugeld  now dont try to do me out of my bit or ill cap for some other joint understand  huh  yuh stick him for a thirtyfivecent bed s long  the caravan of trubiggss cattlemen who left for portland by night steamer friday was headed by a bulkyshouldered boss who wore no coat and whose corduroy vest swung cheerfully open  a motley troupe were the cattlemenjews with small trunks large imitationleather valises and assorted bundles a stolid prophetbearded procession of weary men in tattered derbies and sweatshop clothes  there were englishmen with ropebound pine chests  a lewdmouthed american named tim who said he was a hatter out of work and a loudtalking tough called pete mingled with a straggle of hoboes  the boss counted the group and selected his confidants for the trip to portlandmr wrenn and a youth named morton  morton was a square heavyfleshed young man with stubby hands who up to his eyes was stolid and solid as a granite monument but merry of eye and hinting friendliness in his tousled softbrown hair  he was always wielding a pipe and artfully blowing smoke through his nostrils  mr wrenn and he smiled at each other searchingly as the portland boat pulled out and a wind swept straight from the land of elsewhere  after dinner morton smoking a pipe shaped somewhat like a golfstick head and somewhat like a toad at the rail of the steamer turned to mr wrenn with  classy bunch of cattlemen weve got to go with  not  my names morton  im awful glad to meet you mr morton  my names wrenn  glad to be off at last aint you  golly i should say i am  som i  been waiting for this for years  im a clerk for the p r r in n york  i come from new york too  so  lived there long  uhhuh i began mr wrenn  well i been working for the penn for seven years now  now ive got a vacation of three months  on me

was twelve  well how about you  traveling or going somewhere  just traveling  im glad were going together mr morton i dont think most of these cattlemen are very nice  except for the old jews  they seem to be fine old coots  they make you think ofohyou knowprophets and stuff  watch em over there making tea  i suppose the steamer grub aint kosher i seen one on the joy line saying his prayersi suppose he wasin a kind of shawl  well well you dont say so  distinctly mr wrenn felt that he was one of the gentlemen who in kipling stand at steamer rails exchanging observations on strange lands  he uttered cosmopolitanly  gee look at that sunset  aint that grand  holy smoke it sure is  i dont see how anybody could believe in religion after looking at that  shocked and confused at such a theory yet excited at finding that morton apparently had thoughts mr wrenn piped honestly i dont see that at all  i dont see how anybody could disbelieve anything after a sunset like that  makes me believe all sorts of thinggets me goingi imagine im all sorts of placeson the nile and so on  sure thats just it  everythings so peaceful and natural just is  gives the imagination enough to do even by itself without having to have religion  well reflected mr wrenn i dont hardly ever go to church i dont believe much in all them highbrow sermons that dont come down to brass tacksaint got nothing to do with real folks  but just the same i love to go up to st patricks cathedral  why i get real thrilledi hope you wont think im trying to get highbrowed mr morton  why no  cernly not  i understand  gwan  it gets me going when i look down the aisle at the altar and see the arches and so on  and the priests in their robesthey look soso way upoh i dunno just how to say itso kind of uplifted  sure i know  just the esthetic end of the game  esthetic you knowthe beauty part of it  yuh sure thats the word  sthetic thats what it is yes sthetic  but just the same it makes me feels though i believed in all sorts of things  tell you what i believe may happen though exulted morton this socialism and maybe even these here international workers of the world may pan out as a new kind of religion  i dont know much about it i got to admit  but looks as though it might be that way  its dead certain the old political parties are just gangsdont stand for anything except the name  but this comrade businessgood stunt  brotherhood of manreal brotherhood  my idea of religion  one that is because its got to be not just because it always has been  yessir me for a religion of guys working together to make things easier for each other  you bet commented mr wrenn and they smote each other upon the shoulder and laughed together in a fine flame of shared hope  i wish i knew something about this socialism stuff mused mr wrenn with tilted head examining the burntumber edges of the sunset  great stuff  not working for some lazy cuss thats inherited the right to boss you  and international brotherhood not just neighborhoods  new thing  gee i surely would like that awfully sighed mr wrenn  he saw the processional of world brotherhood tramp steadily through the paling sunset saffronvestured mandarin marching by flaxfaced norseman and languid south sea islanderthe diverse peoples toward whom he had always yearned  but i dont care so much for some of these ranting streetcorner socialists though mused morton  the kind that holler come get saved our way or go to hell  keep off scab guides to prosperity  yuh sure  ha ha ha  huh huh  morton soon had another thought  still same time us guys that do the work have got to work out something for ourselves we cant bank on the rahrah boys that wear eyeglasses and condescend to like us cause they think we aint entirely too dirty for em to associate with and all these writer guys and so on  thats where you got to hand it to the streetcorner shouters  yes thats so  y right there i guess all right  they looked at each other and laughed again initiated friends tasting each others souls  they shared sandwiches and confessions  when the other passengers had gone to bed and the sailors on watch seemed lonely the two men were still declaring shyly but delightedly that things is curious  in the damp discomfort of early morning the cattlemen shuffled from the steamer at portland and were herded to a lunchroom by the boss who cheerfully smoked his corncob and ejaculated to mr wrenn and morton such interesting facts as  trubiggs is a lobster  you dont want to let the bosses bluff you aboard the merian  theyll try to chase you in where the steersll gore you  the grubll be  what grub do you get  scouse and bread  and water  whats scouse  beef stew without the beef  oh the grubll be rotten trubiggs is a lobster  he wouldnt be nowhere if t want for me  mr wrenn appreciated englands need of roast beef but he timidly desired not to be gored by steers which seemed imminent before breakfast coffee  the streets were coldly empty and he was sleepy and morton was silent  at the restaurant sitting on a high stool before a pine counter he choked over an egg sandwich made with thick crumby slices of a bread that had no personality to it  he roved forlornly about portland beside the gloomy pipevaliant morton fighting two fears the company might not need all of them this trip and he might have to wait secondly if he incredibly did get shipped and started for england the steers might prove dreadfully dangerous  after intense thinking he ejaculated gee its be bored or get gored which was much too good not to tell morton so they laughed very much and at ten oclock were signed on for the trip and led whooping to the deck of the ss merian  cattle were still struggling down the chutes from the dock  the dirty decks were confusingly littered with cordage and the cattlemens luggage  the jewish elders stared sepulchrally at the wilderness of open hatches and rude passageways as though they were prophesying death  but mr wrenn standing sturdily beside his suitcase to guard it fawned with romantic love upon the rusty iron sides of their pilgrims caravel and as the merian left the wharf with no more handkerchiefwaving or tears than attends a ferrys leaving he mumbled  free free out to sea  free free thats me  then gee  gee whittakers       chapter iv  he becomes the great little bill wrenn      when the merian was three days out from portland the frightened cattleman stiff known as wrennie wanted to die for he was now sure that the smell of the focsle in which he was lying on a thin mattress of straw covered with damp gunnysacking both could and would become daily a thicker smell a stronger smell a smell increasingly diverse and deadly  though it was so late as eight bells of the evening pete the tough factory hand and tim the downandout hatter were still playing sevenup at the dirty focsle table while mcgarver underboss of the morris cattle gang lay in his berth heavily studying the game and blowing sulphurous fumes of lunch pail plug cut tobacco up toward wrennie  pete the tough was very evil  he sneered  he stole  he bullied  he was a drunkard and a person without cleanliness of speech  tim the hatter was a loudtalking weakling under petes domination  tim wore a dirty rubber collar without a tie and his soul was like his neckware  mcgarver the underboss was a good shepherd among the men though he had recently lost the head foremanship by a spree complicated with language and violence  he looked like one of the merian bulls with broad short neck and short curly hair above a thickskinned deeply wrinkled low forehead  he never undressed but was always seen as now in heavy shoes and bluegray woolen socks tucked over the bottoms of his overalls he was gruff and kind and tyrannical and honest  wrennie shook and drew his breath sharply as the foghorn yawped out its whawnnnn again reminding him that they were still in the bank fog that at any moment they were likely to be stunned by a heartstopping crash as some liners bow burst through the focsles walls in a collision  bowplates buckling in and shredding the inthrust of an enormous black bow water flooding in cries andhowever the horn did at least show that they were awake up there on the bridge to steer him through the fog and werent they experienced seamen  hadnt they made this trip ever so many times and never got killed wouldnt they take all sorts of pains on their own account as well as on his  butjust the same would he really ever get to england alive and if he did would he have to go on holding his breath in terror for nine more days  would the focsle always keep heaving upupup like this then downdowndown as though it were going to sink  how do yuh like de foghorn wrennie  pete the tough spit the question up at him from a corner of his mouth  hope we dont run into no ships  he winked at tim the weakling hatter who took the cue and mourned  im kinda afraid were going to aint you pete  the mate was telling me he was scared we would  sures ting you know  hey wrennie wait till youse have to beat it downstairs and tie up a bull in a storm  hully gee yousell last quick on de game birdie  oh shut up snapped wrennies friend morton  but morton was seasick and pete not heeding him outlined other dangers which he was happily sure were threatening them wrennie shivered to hear that the grub d git worse  he writhed under petes loud questions about his loss in some cattlepen of the grayandscarlet sweaterjacket which he had proudly and gaily purchased in new york for his work on the ship  and the cardplayers assured him that his suitcase which he had intrusted to the croac ships carpenter would probably be stolen by satan  satan  wrennie shuddered still more  for satan the gauntjawed hooknosed railfaced head foreman diabolically smiling when angry sardonically sneering when calm was a lean human whiplash  pete sniggered  he dilated upon satans wrath at wrennie for not coming across with ten dollars for a bribe as he pete had done  he lied of course  and his words have not been given literally  they were not beautiful words  mcgarver the strawboss would always lie awake to enjoy a good brisk indecent story but he liked wrennies admiration of him so lunging with his bulllike head out of his berth he snorted  hey you pete its time to pound your ear  cut it out  wrennie called down sternly i aint no theological student pete and i dont mind profanity but i wish you wouldnt talk like a garbagescow  hey poicy did yuh bring your dictionary  pete bellowed to tim two feet distant from him  to wrennie say gladys aint you afraid one of them long woids like teological will turn around and bite you right on the wrist  dry up irritatedly snapped a canadian  aw cut it out you groaned another  shut up added mcgarver the strawboss  both of you raging  gwan to bed pete or ill beat your block clean off i mean it see  hear me  yes pete heard him  doubtless the first officer on the bridge heard too and perhaps the inhabitants of newfoundland  but pete took his time in scratching the back of his neck and stretching before he crawled into his berth  for half an hour he talked softly to tim for wrennies benefit stating his belief that satan the head boss had once thrown overboard a jew much like wrennie and was likely thus to serve wrennie too tim pictured the result when after the capsizing of the steamer which would undoubtedly occur if this long sickening motion kept up wrennie had to take to a boat with satan  the fingers of wrennie curled into shape for strangling some one  when pete was asleep he worried off into thin slumber  then there was satan the head boss jerking him out of his berth stirring his cramped joints to another dawn of drudgerytwo hours of work and two of waiting before the daily eightoclock insult called breakfast  he tugged on his shoes marveling at mr wrenns really being there at his sitting in cramped stoop on the side of a berth in a dark filthy place that went up and down like a freight elevator subject to the orders of persons whom he did not in the least like  through the damp gray seaair he staggered hungrily along the gangway to the hatch amidships and trembled down the iron ladder to mcgarvers crew tweendecks  first watering the steers  sickened by walking backward with pails of water he carried till he could see and think of nothing in the world save the waterbutt the puddle in front of it and the cattlemen mercilessly dipping out pails there through centuries that would never end  how those steers did drink  mcgarvers favorite bull which he called the grenadier took ten pails and still persisted in leering with dripping gray mouth beyond the headboard trying to reach more  as wrennie was carrying a pail to the heifers beyond the grenadiers horn caught and tore his overalls  the boat lurched  the pail whirled out of his hand  he grasped an iron stanchion and kicked the grenadier in the jaw till the steer backed off a reformed character  mcgarver cheered for such kicks were a rule of the game  good work ironically remarked tim the weakling hatter  you go to hell snapped wrennie and tim looked much more respectful  but wrennie lost this credit before they had finished feeding out the hay for he grew too dizzy to resent tims remarks  straining to pitch forkfuls into the pens while the boat rolled slopping along the wet gangway down by the bunkers of coal where the heat seemed a closewound choking shroud and the darkness was made only a little pale by light coming through dustcaked portholes he sneezed and coughed and grunted till he was exhausted  the floating bits of haydust were a thousand impish hands with poisoned nails scratching at the roof of his mouth  his skin prickled all over  he constantly discovered new and aching muscles  but he wabbled on until he finished the work fifteen minutes after tim had given out  he crawled up to the main deck and huddled in the shelter of a pile of haybales where pete was declaring to tim and the rest that satan couldnt never get nothing on him  morton broke into petes publicity with the question say is it straight what they say pete that youre the guy that owns the leyland line and thats why you know so much more than the rest of us poor lollops  watson the needle quick  applause and laughter  wrennie felt personally grateful to morton for this but he went up to the aft top deck where he could lie alone on a pile of tarpaulins  he made himself observe the sea which as kipling and jack london had specifically promised him in their stories surrounded him everywhere shining free but he glanced at it only once  to the north was a liner bound for home  home  gee  that was rubbing it in  while at work whether he was sick or not he could forgetthings  but the liner fleeting on with bright ease made the cattleboat seem about as romantic as mrs zapps kitchen sink  why he wonderedwhy had he been a chump  him a wanderer no he was a hired man on a seagoing dairyfarm  well hed get onto this confounded job before he was through with it but thengee back to gods country   while the merian eleven days out pleasantly rocked through the irish sea with the moon revealing the coast of anglesey one bill wrenn lay on the afterdeck condescending to the heavens  it was so warm that they did not need to sleep below and half a dozen of the cattlemen had brought their mattresses up on deck  beside bill wrenn lay the man who had given him that nametim the hatter who had become weakly alarmed and admiring as wrennie learned to rise feeling like a boy in early vacationtime and to find shouting exhilaration in sending a forkful of hay fifteen good feet  morton who lay near by had also adopted the name bill wrenn  most of the trip morton had discussed pete and tim instead of the fact that things is curious  mr wrenn had been jealous at first but when he learned from morton the theory that even a pete was a victim of vironment he went out for knowing him quite systematically  to mcgarver he had been bill wrenn since the fifth day when he had kept a haybale from slipping back into the hold on the bosss head  satan and pete still called him wrennie but he was not thinking about them just now with tim listening admiringly to his observations on socialism  tim fell asleep  bill wrenn lay quiet and let memory color the sky above him  he recalled the gardens of water which had flowered in foam for him strange ships and nomadic gulls and the schools of sleekly black porpoises that for him had whisked through violet waves  most of all he brought back the yesterdays long excitement and delight of seeing the irish coast hillshis first foreign landwhose faint sky fresco had seemed magical with the elfin lore of ireland a country that had ever been to him the haunt not of potatoes and politicians but of fays  he had wanted fays  they were not common on the asphalt of west sixteenth street  but now he had seen them beckoning in wanderland  he was falling asleep under the dancing dome of the sky a happy mr wrenn when he was aroused as a furious bill the cattleman pete was clogging near by singing hoarsely dey was a skoit and er name was goity  you shut up commanded bill wrenn  say be careful the awakened tim implored of him pete snorted  who says to shut up hey  who was it satan  from the capstan where he was still smoking the head foreman muttered  whats the odds  the little man wont say it again  pete stood by bill wrenns mattress  who said shut up sounded ominously  bill popped out of bed with what he regarded as a vicious fightingcrouch  for he was too sleepy to be afraid  i did what you going to do about it  more mildly as a fear of his own courage began to form i want to sleep  oh  you want to sleep  little mollycoddle wants to sleep does he  come here  the tough grabbed at bills shirtcollar across the mattress bill ducked stuck out his arm wildly and struck pete half by accident  roaring pete bunted him and he went down with pete kneeling on his stomach and pounding him  morton and honest mcgarver the strawboss sprang to drag off pete while satan the panther with the first interest they had ever seen in his eyes snarled let em fight fair  rounds youre a right bill  right commended morton  armored with satans praise firm but fearful in his rubber sneakers surprised and shocked to find himself here doing this bill wrenn squared at the rowdy  the moon touched sadly the lightly sketched anglesey coast and the rippling wake but bill wrenn oblivious of dream moon and headland faced his fellowbruiser  they circled  pete stuck out his foot gently  morton sprang in bawling furiously none o them roughandtumble tricks  righto added mcgarver  pete scowled  he was left powerless  he puffed and grew dizzy as bill wrenn danced delicately about him for he could do nothing without backstreet tactics  he did bloody the nose of bill and pummel his ribs but many cigarettes and much whisky told and he was ready to laugh foolishly and make peace when at the end of the sixth round he felt bills neat little fist in a straightand entirely accidentalrip to the point of his jaw  pete sent his opponent spinning with a backhander which awoke all the cruelty of the terrible bill  silently bill wrenn plunged in with a smash smash smash like a murderous savage using every grain of his strength  let us turn from the lamentable luck of pete  he had now got the idea that his supposed victim could really fight  dismayed shocked disgusted he stumbled and sought to flee and was sent flat  this time it was the great little bill who had to be dragged off  mcgarver held him kicking and yammering his mild mustache bristling like a battling cats till the next round when pete was knocked out by a clumsy whirlwind of fists  he lay on the deck with bill standing over him and demanding whats my name heh  i tink its bill now all right wrennie old hossbill old hoss groaned pete  he was permitted to sneak off into oblivion  bill wrenn went below  in the dark passage by the fidley he fell to tremorous weeping  but the brackish hydrant water that stopped his nosebleed saved him from hysterics  he climbed to the top deck and now he could again see his brother pilgrim the moon  the stiffs and bosses were talking excitedly of the fight tim rushed up to gurgle  great bill old man  you done just what id a done if hed cussed me  i told you pete was a bluffer  git out said satan  tim fled  morton came up looked at bill wrenn pounded him on the shoulder and went off to his mattress  the other stiffs slouched away but mcgarver and satan were still discussing the fight  snuggling on the hard black pile of tarpaulins bill talked to them warmed to them and became mr wrenn  he announced his determination to wander adown every shining road of europe  nice work  sure  youll make a snappy little ole globetrotter  sure ought to be able to get the slickest kind of grub for four bits a day  nice work satan interjected from time to time with smooth irony  sure go ahead  like to hear your plans  mcgarver broke in  cut that out marvin  youre a satan all right  quit your kidding the little man  hes all right  and he done fine on the job last threefour days  lying on his mattress bill stared at the network of the ratlines against the brilliant sky  the crisscross lines made him think of the ruled orderblanks of the souvenir company  gee he mused id like to know if jake is handling my work the way wetheylike it  id like to see the old office again and charley carpenter just for a couple of minutes  gee i wish they could have seen me put it all over pete tonight thats what im going to do to the blooming englishmen if they dont like me   the ss merian panted softly beside the landingstage at birkenhead liverpools jersey city resting in the sunshine after her voyage while the cattle were unloaded  they had encountered fogbanks at the mouth of the mersey river  mr wrenn had ecstatically watched the shores of englandenglandride at him through the fog and had panted over the lines of english villas among the dunes  it was like a dream yet the shore had such amazingly safe solid colors real red and green and yellow when contrasted with the fogwet deck unearthily glancing with mistlights  now he was seeing his first foreign city and to morton stolidly curious beside him he could say nothing save gee with churchtower and swarthy dome behind dome liverpool lay across the mersey  up through the liverpool streets that ran down to the river as though through peepholes slashed straight back into the middle ages his vision plunged and it wandered unchecked through each street while he hummed  free free in europee thats me  the cattlemen were called to help unload the remaining hay they made a game of it  even satan smiled even the jewish elders were lightly affable as they made pretendedly fierce gestures at the squat patient haybales  tim the hatter danced a limber foolish jig upon the deck and mcgarver bellowed the bonnee bonnee banks of loch loooomond  the crowd bawled  come on bill wrenn your turn  hustle up with that bale pete or well sic bill on you  bill wrenn standing very dignified piped  im colonel armour  i own all these cattle cept the morris uns see gotta do what i say savvy  tim walk on your ear  the hatter laid his head on the deck and waved his anemic legs in accordance with directions from colonel armour late wrenn  the hay was off  the merian tooted and headed across the mersey to the huskinson dock in liverpool while the cattlemen played tag about the deck  whooping and laughing they made last splashy toilets at the waterbutts dragged out their luggage and descended to the dockhouse  as the cattlemen passed bill wrenn and morton shouting affectionate goodbys in english or courteous yiddish bill commented profanely to morton on the fact that the solid stone floor of the great shed seemed to have enough seamotion to make a guy sick it was nearly his last utterance as bill wrenn he became mr wrenn absolute mr wrenn on the street as he saw a real english bobby a real english carter and the sign cocoa house  tea id  england  now for some real grub cried morton  no more scouse and willowleaf tea  stretching out their legs under a table glorified with toasted sally lunns and melton mowbrays served by a waitress who said thank you with a rising inflection they gazed at the line of mirrors running britishly all around the room over the long lounge seat and smiled with the triumphant content which comes to him whose hunger for dreams and hunger for meatpies are satisfied together       chapter v  he finds much quaint english flavor      big wharves all right  england sure is queen of the sea heh busy town liverpool  but say there is a quaint english flavor to these shops  look at that  red lion inn overhead trams they call the elevated  real flavor all right  english as can be  i sure like to wander around these little shops  street crowd  thats where you get the real quaint flavor  thus morton to the glowing mr wrenn as they turned into st georges square noting the liptons tea establishment  sir thomas liptonwasnt he a friend of the king  anyway he was some kind of a lord and he owned big society racingyachts  in the grandiose square mr wrenn prayerfully remarked gee  greek temple  fine agreed morton  thats st georges hall where they have big organ concerts explained mr wrenn  and theres the artgallery across the square and heres the lime street station  he had studied his baedeker as club women study the cyclopedia  lets go over and look at the trains  funny little boxes aint they wrenn them cars  quaint things  what is it they call emcarriages  first second third class  just like in books  bookingoffice  thats tickets  funny eh  mr wrenn insisted on paying for both their high teas at the cheap restaurant timidly but earnestly  morton was troubled as they sat on a park bench smoking those most anglican cigarettes dainty bits mr wrenn begged  whats the matter old man  oh nothing  just thinking morton smiled artificially he added presently  well old bill got to make the break cant go on living on you this way  aw thunder  you aint living on me  besides i want you to honest i do  we can have a whole lot better time together morty  yes butnope i cant do it  nice of you  cant do it though  got to go on my own like the fellow says  aw come on  look here its my money aint it  i got a right to spend it

learning something on this trip  ive always wanted to just do one thingsee foreign places  well i want to do that just as much as ever but theres something thats a whole lot more important somehow i aint ever had many friends  some ways youre about the best friend ive ever hadyou aint neither too highbrow or too lowbrow  and this friendship businessit means such an awful lot  its like what i was reading aboutsomething by elbert hubbard orthunder i cant remember his name but anyway its one of those poet guys that writes for the back page of the journalsomething about a joyous adventure thats what being friends is  course you understand i wouldnt want to say this to most people but youll understand how i mean itsthis friendship business is just like those old crusaders you knowtheyd start out on a fine morningyou know armor shining all that stuff  it wouldnt make any dif what they met as long as they was fighting together  rainy nights with folks sneaking through the rain to get at em and all sorts of things ready for anything long as they just stuck together  thats the way this friendship business is i blieve  just like it said in the journal  yump sure is  gee itschance to tell folks what you think and really get some fun out of seeing places together  and i aint ever done it much  course i dont mean to say ive been living off on any blooming desert island all my life but just the same ive always been kind of alonenot knowing many folks  you know how it is in a new york roominghouse  so nowaw dont slip up on me morty honestly i dont care what kind of work we do as long as we can stick together i dont care a hang if we dont get anything better to do than scrub floors  morton patted his arm and did not answer for a while  then  yuh i know how you mean  and its good of you to like beating it around with me  but you sure got the exaggerated idee of me and youd get sick of the holes im likely to land in  there was a certain pride which seemed dreadfully to shut mr wrenn out as morton added  why man im going to do all of europe  from the turkish jails tooh st petersburg  you made good on the merian all right  but you do like things shipshape  oh id  we might stay friends if we busted up now and met in new york again  but not if you get into all sorts of bum places w  why look here morty  with me  however ill think it over  lets not talk about it till tomorrow  oh please do think it over morty old man wont you  and tonight youll let me take you to a musichall wont you  uhyes morton hesitated  a musichallnot mere vaudeville  mr wrenn could hardly keep his feet on the pavement as they scampered to it and got ninepenny seats  he would have thought it absurd to pay eighteen cents for a ticket but pencethey were out at ninethirty  happily tired mr wrenn suggested that they go to a temperance hotel at his expense for he had read in baedeker that temperance hotels were respectablealso cheap  no no frowned morton  tell you what you do bill  you go to a hotel and ill beat it down to a lodginghouse on duke street  juke street  remember how i ran onto pete on the street  he told me you could get a cot down there for fourpence  aw come on to a hotel  please do  it d just hurt me to think of you sleeping in one of them holes  i wouldnt sleep a bit if  say for the love of mike wrenn get wise  get wise son im not going to sponge on you and thats all there is to it  bill wrenn strode into their company for a minute and quoth the terrible bill  well you dont need to get so sore about it  i dont go around asking folks can i give em a meal ticket all the time let me tell you and when i dooh rats  say i didnt mean to get huffy morty  but doggone you old man you cant shake me this easy  i sye old top im peeved yessir  well go dutch to a lodginghouse or even walk the streets  all right sir all right  ill take you up on that  well sleep in an areaway some place  they walked to the outskirts of liverpool questing the desirable dark alley  awed by the solid quietude and semigrandeur of the large private estates through narrow streets where dim trees leaned over high walls whose long silent stretches were broken only by mysterious little doors they tramped bashfully inspecting but always rejecting nooks by lodge gates  they came to a stone church with a porch easily reached from the street a large and airy stone porch just suited morton declared to a couple of hoboes like us  if a bobby butts in why well just slide under them seats  then the bobby can go soak his head  mr wrenn had never so far defied society as to steal a place for sleeping  he felt very uneasy like a man left naked on the street by robbers as he rolled up his coat for a pillow and removed his shoes in a place that was perfectly open to the street  the paved floor was cold to his bare feet and as he tried to go to sleep it kept getting colder and colder to his back  reaching out his hand he fretfully rubbed the cracks between stones  he scowled up at the ceiling of the porch he couldnt bear to look out through the door for it framed the vicars house with lamplight bodying forth latticed windows suggesting soft beds and laughter and comfortable books  all the while his chilled back was aching in new places  he sprang up put on his shoes and paced the churchyard  it seemed a great waste of educational advantages not to study the tower of this foreign church but he thought much more about his aching shoulderblades  morton came from the porch stiff but grinning  didnt like it much eh bill  afraid you wouldnt  must say i didnt either though  well come on  lets beat it around and see if we cant find a better place  in a vacant lot they discovered a pile of hay  mr wrenn hardly winced at the hearty slap morton gave his back and he pronounced some waldorfastoria that stack as they sneaked into the lot  they had laid loving hands upon the hay remarking well i guess when they heard from a low stable at the very back of the lot  i say you chaps what are you doing there  a reflective carter who had been twisting two straws ambled out of the shadow of the stable and prepared to do battle  say old man cant we sleep in your hay just tonight argued morton  were americans  came over on a cattleboat  we aint got only enough money to last us for food while mr wrenn begged aw please let us  oh  youre americans are you  you seem decent enough  ive got a brother in the states  he used to own this stable with me  in st cloud minnesota he is you know  minnesotas some kind of a shire  either of you chaps been in minnesota  sure lied morton ive hunted bear there  oh i say bear now  my brothers never written m  oh that was way up in the northern part in the big woods ive had some narrow escapes  then morton who had never been west of pittsburg sang somewhat in this wise the epic of the hunting he had never done  alone  among the pines  dead o winter  only one shell in his rifle  cold of winter  snowdeep snow  snowshoes  hiking alongreglar mushingpacking grub to the lumbercamp  way up near the canadian border  cold terrible cold  stars looked like little bits of steel  mr wrenn thought he remembered the story  he had read it in a magazine  morton was continuing  snow stretched out among the pines  he was wearing a mackinaw and shoepacks  saw a bear loping along  he hadmorton hada 4440 marlin but only one shell  thrust the muzzle of his rifle right into the bears mouth  scared for a minute  almost fell off his snowshoes  hardest thing he ever did to pull that trigger  fired  bear sort of jumped at him then rolled over clawing great place those minnesota big  whats a shoepack  the englishman stolidly interjected  kind of a moccasin  great place those woods  hope your brother gets the chance to get up there  i say i wonder did you ever meet him  scrabble is his name jock scrabble  jock scrabbleno but say  by golly there was a fellow up in the big woods that came from st clst cloud  yes that was it  he was telling us about the town  i remember he said your brother had great chances there  the englishman meditatively accepted a bad cigar from mr wrenn suddenly  you chaps can sleep in the stableloft if youd like  but you must blooming well stop smoking  so in the dark odorous haymow mr wrenn stretched out his legs with an affectionate good night to morton  he slept nine hours  when he awoke at the sound of a chain clanking in the stable below morton was gone  this note was pinned to his sleeve   dear old mani still feel sure that you will not enjoy the hiking  bumming is not much fun for most people i dont think even if they say it is  i do not want to live on you  i always did hate to graft on people  so i am going to beat it off alone  but i hope i will see you in n y  we will enjoy many a good laugh together over our trip  if you will phone the p r r you can find out when i get back  so on  as i do not know what your address will be  please look me up  i hope you will have a good trip                                    yours truly                                         harry p morton   mr wrenn lay listening to the unfriendly rattling of the chain harness below for a long time  when he crawled languidly down from the hayloft he glowered in a manner which was decidedly surly even for bill wrenn at a middleaged english stranger who was stooping over a cows hoof in a stall facing the ladder  wot you doing here asked the englishman raising his head and regarding mr wrenn as a housewife does a cockroach in the saladbowl  mr wrenn was bored  this seemed a very poor sort of man a bloated cockney with a dirty neckcloth vile cuffs of grayish black and a waistcoat cut foolishly high  the owner said i could sleep here he snapped  ow  e did did e  e aynt been giving you any of the perishin osses too as e  it was sturdy old bill wrenn who snarled oh shut up bill didnt feel like standing much just then  hed punch this fellow as hed punched pete as soon as notor even sooner  ow  its shut up is it  ive arf a mind to set the tecs on you but im lyte  ill just it you on the bloody nowse  bill wrenn stepped off the ladder and squared at him  he was sorry that the cockney was smaller than pete  the cockney came over feinted in an absentminded manner made swift and confusing circles with his left hand and hit bill wrenn on the aforesaid bloody nose which immediately became a bleeding nose  bill wrenn felt dizzy and sitting on a grainsack listened amazedly to the cockneys apologetic  im sorry i aynt got time to ave the law on you but i could spare time to it you again  bill shook the blood from his nose and staggered at the cockney who seized his collar set him down outside the stable with a jarring bump and walked away whistling                  come oh come to our sundayschool                evvvvvvry sunday morning   gee mourned mr william wrenn and i thought i was getting this hobo business down pat  gee  i wonder if pete was so hard to lick       chapter vi  he is an orphan      sadly clinging to the plan of the walkingtrip he was to have made with morton mr wrenn crossed by ferry to birkenhead quite unhappily for he wanted to be discussing with morton the quaintness of the uniformed functionaries  he looked for the merian half the way over  as he walked through birkenhead bound for chester he pricked himself on to note redbrick houserows almost shocking in their lack of high front stoops along the country road he reflected  wouldnt morty enjoy this  farmyard all paved  haystack with a little roof on it kitchen stove stuck in a kind of fireplace  foreign as the deuce  but morton was off some place in a darkness where there werent things to enjoy  mr wrenn had lost him forever  once he heard himself wishing that even tim the hatter or good old mcgarver were along  a scene so british that it seemed proper to enjoy it alone he did find in a real gardenparty with what appeared to be a real curate out of a story in the strand passing teacups but he passed out of that hot glow into a cold plodding that led him to chester and a dull hotel which might as well have been in bridgeport or hoboken  he somewhat timidly enjoyed chester the early part of the next day docilely following a guide about the walls gaping at the mill on the dee and asking the guide two intelligent questions about roman remains  he snooped through the galleried streets peering up dark stairways set in heavy masonry that spoke of historic sieges and imagined that he was historically besieging for a time mr wrenns fancies contented him  he smiled as he addressed glossy red and green postcards to lee theresa and goaty cousin john and mr guilfogle writing on each a variation of having a splendid trip  this is a very interesting old town  wish you were here pantingly he found a panorama showing the hotel where he was stayingor at least two of its chimneysand marking it with a heavy cross and the announcement this is my hotel where i am staying he sent it to charley carpenter  he was at his nearest to greatness at chester cathedral he chuckled aloud as he passed the remains of a refectory of monastic days in the close where knights had tied their romantically pawing chargers just like hed read about in a story about the olden times  he was really there  he glanced about and assured himself of it  he wasnt in the office  he was in an english cathedral close  but shortly thereafter he was in an english temperance hotel sitting still almost weeping with the longing to see morton he walked abroad feeling like an intruder on the lively night crowd in a taproom he drank a glass of english porter and tried to make himself believe that he was acquainted with the others in the room to which theory they gave but little support  all this while his loneliness shadowed him  of that loneliness one could make many books how it sat down with him how he crouched in his chair bespelled by it till he violently rose and fled with loneliness for companion in his flight  he was lonely  he sighed that he was lonely as fits lonelythe word obsessed him  doubtless he was a bit mad as are all the isolated men who sit in distant lands longing for the voices of friendship  next morning he hastened to take the train for oxford to get away from his loneliness which lolled evilly beside him in the compartment  he tried to convey to a stodgy north countryman his interest in the way the seats faced each other the man said oh aye insultingly and returned to his manchester newspaper  feeling that he was so offensive that it was a matter of honor for him to keep his eyes away mr wrenn dutifully stared out of the door till they reached oxford  there is a calm beauty to new college gardens  there is mr wrenn observed something simply slick about all these old quatrangleses crossed by summering students in short flappy gowns  but he always returned to his exiles room where he now began to hear the new voice of shapeless nameless fearfear of all this alien world that didnt care whether he loved it or not  he sat thinking of the cattleboat as a home which he had loved but which he would never see again  he had to use force on himself to keep from hurrying back to liverpool while there still was time to return on the same boat  no  he was going to stick it out somehow and get onto the hang of all this highbrow business  then he said  oh darn it all  i feel rotten  i wish i was dead   those sir are the windows of the apartment once occupied by walter pater said the cultured american after whom he was trailing  mr wrenn viewed them attentively and with shame remembered that he didnt know who walter pater was  butoh yes now he remembered walter was the guy that d murdered his whole family  so aloud well i guess oxfords sorry walt ever come here all right  my dear sir mr pater was the most immaculate genius of the nineteenth century lectured dr mittyford the cultured american severely  mr wrenn had met mittyford phd near the barges had upon polite request still more politely lent him a match and seized the chance to confide in somebody  mittyford had a bald head neat eyeglasses a fair family income a chatty goodfellowship at the faculty club and a chilly contemptuousness in his rhetoric classroom at leland stanford jr university  he wrote poetry which he filed away under the letter p in his letterfile  dr mittyford grudgingly took mr wrenn about to teach him what not to enjoy  he pointed at shelleys rooms as at a certificated angels feather but mr wrenn writhingly admitted that he had never heard of shelley whose name he confused with max orells which dr mittyford deemed an error  then paters window  the doctor shrugged  oh well what could you expect of the proletariat  swinging his stick aloofly he stalked to the bodleian and vouchsafed that sir is the aeschylus shelley had in his pocket when he was drowned  though he heard with sincere regret the news that his new idol was drowned mr wrenn found that aeschylus left him cold  it seemed to be printed in a foreign language  but perhaps it was merely a very old book  standing before a case in which was an exquisite book in a queer wrigglesome language bearing the legend that from this volume fitzgerald had translated the rubaiyat dr mittyford waved his hand and looked for thanks  pretty book said mr wrenn  and did you note who used it  uhyes  he hastily glanced at the placard  mr fitzgerald say i think i read some of that rubaiyat  it was something about a persian kitteni dont remember exactly  dr mittyford walked bitterly to the other end of the room   about eight in the evening mr wrenns landlady knocked with theres a gentleman below to see you sir  me blurted mr wrenn  he galloped downstairs panting to himself that morton had at last found him  he peered out and was overwhelmed by a motorcar with dr mittyford waiting in awesome fur coat goggles and gauntlets centered in the carlamplight that loomed in the shivery evening fog  gee just like a hero in a novel reflected mr wrenn  get on your things said the pedagogue  im going to give you the time of your life  mr wrenn obediently went up and put on his cap  he was excited yet frightened and resentful at being dragged into all this highbrow business which he had resolutely been putting away the past two hours  as he stole into the car dr mittyford seemed comparatively human remarking  i feel bored this evening  i thought i would give you a nuit blanche  how would you like to go to the red unicorn at bremptonone of the few untouched old inns  that would be nice said mr wrenn unenthusiastically  his chilliness impressed dr mittyford who promptly told one of the best of his wellknown whimsical yet scholarly stories  ha ha remarked mr wrenn  he had been saying to himself  by golly  i aint going to even try to be a society guy with him no more  im just going to be me and if he dont like it he can go to the dickens  so he was gentle and sympathetic and talked west sixteenth street slang to the rhetoricians lofty amusement  the taproom of the red unicorn was lighted by candles and a fireplace  that is a simple thing to say but it was not a simple thing for mr wrenn to see  as he observed the trembling shadows on the sanded floor he wriggled and excitedly murmured gee  gee whittakers  the shadows slipped in arabesques over the dustgray floor and scampered as bravely among the rafters as though they were in such a tale as men told in believing days  rustics in smocks drank ale from tankards and in a corner was snoring an earringed peddler with his beetleblack head propped on an oilcloth pack  stamping in chilly from the ride mr wrenn laughed aloud with a comfortable feeling on the side toward the fire he stuck his slight legs straight out before the oldtime settle looked devilmaycare made delightful ridges on the sanded floor with his toe and clapped a pewter pot on his knee with a small emphatic wop  after about two and a quarter tankards he broke out  say that peddler guy there dont he look like he was a gipsyyou knowsneaking through the hedges around the mannerhouse to steal the earls daughter huh  yes  youre a romanticist then i take it  yes i guess i am  kind of  like to read romances and stuff he stared at mittyford beseechingly  but saysay i wonder whysomehow i havent enjoyed oxford and the rest of the places like i ought to  see id always thought id be simply nutty about the quatrangles and stuff but im afraid theyre too highbrow for me  i hate to own up but sometimes i wonder if i can get away with this traveling stunt  mittyford the magnificent had mixed ale and whisky punch he was mellowly instructive  do you know ive been wondering just what you would get out of all this  you really have a very fine imagination of a sort you know but of course youre lacking in certain factual bases as i see it your metier would be to travel with a pleasant wife the two of you hand in hand so to speak looking at the more obvious public buildings and plesauncesavenues and plesuances  there must be a certain portion of the tripper class which really has the ability for to admire and for to see  dr mittyford finished his second toddy and with a wave of his hand presented to mr wrenn the world and all the plesaunces thereof for to see though not of course to admire mittyfordianly  butwhat are you to do now about oxford  well im afraid youre taken into captivity a bit late to be trained for that sort of thing  do about oxford  why go back master the world you understand  by the way have you seen my book on saxon derivatives  not that im prejudiced in its favor but it might give you a glimmering of what this difficile thing culture really is  the rustics were droning a church anthem  the glow of the ale was in mr wrenn  he leaned back entirely happy and it seemed confusedly to him that what little he had heard of his learned and affectionate friends advice gratefully confirmed his own theory that what one wanted was friendsa nice wifefolks yes sir by golly  it was awfully nice of the doc  he pictured a tender girl in golden brown back in the new york he so much desired to see who would await him evenings with a smile that was kept for him  homeythat was what he was going to be he happily and thoughtfully ran his finger about the rim of his glass ten times  time to go i m afraid dr mittyford was saying  through the exquisite haze that now filled the room mr wrenn saw him dimly as a triangle of shirtfront and two gleaming ellipses for eyes  his dear friend the doc  as he walked through the room chairs got humorously in his way but he goodnaturedly picked a path among them and fell asleep in the motorcar  all the ride back he made soft mouselike sounds of snoring  when he awoke in the morning with a headache and surveyed his unchangeably dingy room he realized slowly after smothering his head in the pillow to shut off the light from his scorching eyeballs that dr mittyford had called him a fool for trying to wander  he protested but not for long for he hated to venture out there among the dreadfully learned colleges and try to understand stuff written in letters that look like crowtracks  he packed his suitcase slowly feeling that he was very wicked in leaving oxfords opportunities   mr wrenn rode down on a tottenham court road bus viewing the quaintness of london  life was a rosy ringing valiant pursuit for he was about to ship on a mediterranean steamer laden chiefly with adventurous friends  the bus passed a victoria containing a man with a real monocle  a newsboy smiled up at him the strand roared with lively traffic  but the gray stonework and curtained windows of the anglosouthern steamship companys office did not invite any mr wrenns to come in and ship nor did the hall porter a beefy person with a huge collar and sparse painfully sleek hair whose eyes were like cold boiled mackerel as mr wrenn yearned  pleaseuhplease will you be so kind and tell me where i can ship as a steward for the med  none needed  or spain  i just want to get any kind of a job at first peeling potatoes orit dont make any difference  none needed i said my man the porter examined the hall clock extensively  bill wrenn suddenly popped into being and demanded  look here you i want to see somebody in authority  i want to know what i can ship as  the porter turned round and started  all his faith in mankind was destroyed by the shock of finding the fellow still there nothing i told you  no one needed  look here can i see somebody in authority or not  the porter was privately esteemed a wit at his motherinlaws waddling away he answered  or not  mr wrenn drooped out of the corridor  he had planned to see the tate gallery but now he hadnt the courage to face the difficulties of enjoying pictures  he zigzagged home mourning whats the use  and ill be hung if ill try any other offices either  the icy mitt thats what they hand you here some day ill go down to the docks and try to ship there probly  gee  i feel rotten   out of all this fog of unfriendliness appeared the waitress at the st brasten cocoa house first as a human being to whom he could talk second as a woman  she was ignorant and vulgar she misused english cruelly she wore greasy cotton garments planted her large feet on the floor with firm clumsiness and always laughed at the wrong cue in his diffident jests  but she did laugh she did listen while he stammered his ideas of meatpies and st pauls and aeroplanes and shelley and fog and tan shoes  in fact she supposed him to be a gentleman and scholar not an american  he went to the cocoahouse daily  she let him know that he was a man and she a woman young and kindly clearskinned and joyouseyed  she touched him with warm elbow and plump hip leaning against his chair as he gave his order  to that he looked forward from meal to meal though he never ceased harrowing over what he considered a shameful intrigue  that opinion of his actions did not keep him from tingling one lunchtime when he suddenly understood that she was expecting to be tempted  he tempted her without the slightest delay muttering  lets take a walk this evening  she accepted  he was shivery and short of breath while he was trying to smile at her during the rest of the meal and so he remained all afternoon at the tower of london though he very well knew that all this historykings and gwillotines and stuffdemanded real wrenn thrills  they were to meet on a streetcorner at eight  at seventhirty he was waiting for her  at eightthirty he indignantly walked away but he hastily returned and stood there another halfhour  she did not come  when he finally fled home he was glad to have escaped the great mystery of life then distressingly angry at the waitress and desolate in the desert stillness of his room   he sat in his cold hygienic uncomfortable room on tavistock place trying to keep his attention on the tick tick tick tick of his twodollar watch but really cowering before the vast shadowy presences that slunk in from the hostile city  he didnt in the least know what he was afraid of  the actual englishman whom he passed on the streets did not seem to threaten his life yet his friendly watch and familiar suitcase seemed the only things he could trust in all the menacing world as he sat there so vividly conscious of his fear and loneliness that he dared not move his cramped legs  the tension could not last for a time he was able to laugh at himself and he made pleasant picturescharley carpenter telling him a story at drubels morton companionably smoking on the top deck lee theresa flattering him during an evening walk most of all he pictured the browneyed sweetheart he was going to meet somewhere sometime  he thought with sophomoric shame of his futile affair with the waitress then forgot her as he seemed almost to touch the comforting hand of the browneyed girl  friends thats what i want  you bet  that was the work he was going to domake acquaintances  a girl who would understand him with whom he could trot about seeing departmentstore windows and movingpicture shows  it was then probably hunched up in the dowdy chair of faded upholstery that he created the two phrases which became his formula for happiness  he desired somebody to go home to evenings still more some one to work with and work for  it seemed to him that he had mapped out his whole life  he sat back satisfied and caught the sound of emptiness in his room emphasized by the stilly tick of his watch  ohmorton he cried  he leaped up and raised the window  it was raining but through the slow splash came the night rattle of hostile london  staring down he studied the desolate circle of light a streetlamp cast on the wet pavement  a cat gray as dishwater its fur worn off in spots lean and horrible sneaked through the circle of light like the spirit of unhappiness like londons sneer at solitary americans in russell square rooms  mr wrenn gulped  through the light skipped a man and a girl so little aware of him that they stopped laughingly wrestling for an umbrella then disappeared and the street was like a forgotten tomb  a hansom swung by the hoofbeats sharp and cheerless  the rain dripped  nothing else  mr wrenn slammed down the window  he smoothed the sides of his suitcase and reckoned the number of miles it had traveled with him  he spun his watch about on the table and listened to its rapid mocking speech friends friends friends friends  sobbing he began to undress laying down each garment as though he were going to the scaffold  when the room was dark the great shadowy forms of fear thronged unchecked about his narrow dingy bed  once during the night he woke  some sound was threatening him it was london coming to get him and torture him  the light in his room was dusty mottled gray lifeless  he saw his door half ajar and for some moments lay motionless watching stark and bodiless heads thrust themselves through the opening and withdraw with sinister alertness till he sprang up and opened the door wide  but he did not even stop to glance down the hall for the crowd of phantoms that had gathered there  some hidden manful scorn of weakness made him sneer aloud  dont be a baby even if you are lonely  his voice was deeper than usual and he went to bed to sleep throwing himself down with a coarse wholesome scorn of his nervousness  he awoke after dawn and for a moment curled in happy wriggles of satisfaction over a good sleep  then he remembered that he was in the cold and friendless prison of england and lay there panting with desire to get away to get back to america where he would be safe  he wanted to leap out of bed dash for the liverpool train and take passage for america on the first boat  but perhaps the officials in charge of the emigrants and the steerage and of course a fellow would go steerage to save money would want to know his religion and the color of his hairas bad as trying to ship  they might hold him up for a couple of days  there were quarantines and customs and things of which he had heard perhaps for two or even three days more he would have to stay in this nauseating prisonland  this was the morning of august 3 1910 two weeks after his arrival in london and twentytwo days after victoriously reaching england the land of romance       chapter vii  he meets a temperament      mr wrenn was sulkily breakfasting at mrs cattermoles tea house which mrs cattermole kept in a genteel fashion in a basement three doors from his roominghouse on tavistock place after his night of fear and tragic portents he resented the general floweredpapernapkin aspect of mrs cattermoles establishment  hungh he grunted as he jabbed at the fringed doily under the silly pinkandwhite teacup on the greenandwhite lacquered tray brought him by a fat waitress in a frilly apron which must have been made for a christmas pantomime fairy who was not fat  hurump he snorted at the pictures of lambs and radishes and cathedrals and little duckies on mrs cattermoles pinkandwhite wall  he wished it were possiblewhich of course it was notto go back to the st brasten cocoa house where he could talk to the honest flatfooted galumping waitress and cross his feet under his chair  for here he was daintily yes daintily studied by the tearoom habituestwo bouncing and talkative daughters of an american tourist a slender palehaired english girl student of assyriology with large topbarred eyeglasses over her protesting eyes and a sprinkling of people living along tavistock place who looked as though they wanted to know if your opinions on the national gallery and abstinence were sound  his disapproval of the lambiness of mrs cattermoles was turned to a feeling of comradeship with the other patrons as he turned with the rest to stare hostilely at a girl just entering  the talk in the room halted startled  mr wrenn gasped  with his head solemnly revolving his eyes followed the young woman about his table to a table opposite a freak  gee what red hair was his private comment  a slender girl of twentyeight or twentynine clad in a onepiece gown of sagegreen its lines unbroken by either belt or collarbrooch fitting her as though it had been pasted on and showing the long beautiful sweep of her fragile thighs and longcurving breast  her collar of the material of the dress was so high that it touched her delicate jaw and it was set off only by a fine silver chain with a la valliere of silver and carved burmese jade  her red hair red as a poinsettia parted and drawn severely back made a sweep about the fair deadwhite skin of her bored sensitive face  bored bluegray eyes with pathetic crescents of faintly violethued wrinkles beneath them and a scarce noticeable web of tinier wrinkles at the side thin long cheeks a delicate nose and a straight strong mouth of thin but startlingly red lips  such was the new patron of mrs cattermole  she stared about the tearoom like an officer inspecting raw recruits sniffed at the stare of the thin girl student ordered breakfast in a low voice then languidly considered her toast and marmalade  once she glanced about the room  her heavy brows were drawn close for a second making a deepcleft wrinkle of ennui over her nose and two little indentations like the impressions of a box corner in her forehead over her brows  mr wrenns gaze ran down the line of her bosom again and he wondered at her hands which touched the heavy breadandbutter knife as though it were a finepoint pen  long hands colored like ivory the joint wrinkles etched into her skin orange cigarette stains on the second finger the nails  he stared at them  to himself he commented  gee i never did see such freak fingernails in my life  instead of such smoothly rounded nails as theresa zapp displayed the new young lady had nails narrow and sharppointed the ends like little triangles of stiff white writingpaper  as she breakfasted she scanned mr wrenn for a second  he was too obviously caught staring to be able to drop his eyes  she studied him all out with almost as much interest as a policeman gives to a passing trolleycar yawned delicately and forgot him  though you should penetrate greenland or talk anarchism to the daughter of a millionaire grocer never shall you feel a more devouring chill than enveloped mr wrenn as the new young lady glanced away from him paid her check rose slithily from her table and departed  she rounded his table not stalking out of its way as theresa would have done but bending from the hips thus was it revealed to mr wrenn that  he was almost too horrified to put it into words  he had noticed that there was something kind of funny in regard to her waist he had had an impression of remarkably smooth waist curves and an unjagged sweep of back  now he saw thatit was unheard of not at all like lee theresa zapp or ladies in the subway  forthe freak girl wasnt wearing corsets  when she had passed him he again studied her back swiftly and covertly  no sir  no question about it  it couldnt be denied by any one now that the girl was a freak for charitable though our mr wrenn was he had to admit that there was no sign of the midback ridge and little rounded knobbinesses of corseted respectability  and he had a closer view of the texture of her sagegreen crash gown  golly he said to himself of all the doggone cloth for a dress  reglar gunnysacking  shes skinny too  brightred hair  she sure is the prize freak  kind of goodlooking butget a brick  he hated to rule so cleverseeming a woman quite out of court but he remembered her scissors glance at him and his soft little heart became very hard  how brittle are our steel resolves  when mr wrenn walked out of mrs cattermoles excellent establishment and heavily inspected the quiet bloomsbury street with a catsmeatman stolidly clopping along the pavement as loneliness rushed on him and he wondered what in the world he could do he mused  gee i bet that redheaded lady would be interestin to know  a day of furtive darts out from his room to do london which glumly declined to be done  he went back to the zoological gardens and made friends with a tiger which though it presumably came from an english colony was the friendliest thing he had seen for a week  it did yawn but it let him talk to it for a long while  he stood before the bars peering in and whenever no one else was about he murmured  poor fella they wont let you go heh  you got a worse boss n goglefogle heh  poor old fella  he didnt at all mind the disorder and rancid smell of the cage he had no fear of the tigers sleek murderous power  but he was somewhat afraid of the sound of his own tremorous voice  he had spoken aloud so little lately  a man came an englishman in a high offensively wellfitting waistcoat and stood before the cage  mr wrenn slunk away robbed of his new friend the tiger the forlornest person in all london kicking at pebbles in the path  as halfdusk made the quiet street even more detached he sat on the steps of his roominghouse on tavistock place keeping himself from the one definite thing he wanted to dothe thing he keenly imagined a happy mr wrenn doingdashing over to the euston station to find out how soon and where he could get a train for liverpool and a boat for america  a girl was approaching the house  he viewed her carelessly then intently  it was the freak lady of mrs cattermoles tea housethe corsetless young woman of the tightfitting crash gown and flamecolored hair  she was coming up the steps of his house  he made room for her with feverish courtesy  she lived in the same househe instantly without a bit of encouragement from the uninterested way in which she snipped the door to made up a whole novel about her  gee  she was a french countess who lived in a reglar chateau and she was staying in bloomsbury incognito seeing the sights  she was a noble  she was  above him a window opened  he glanced up  the countess incog was leaning out scanning the street uncaringly  whyher windows were next to his he was living next room to an unusual personas unusual as dr mittyford  he hurried upstairs with a fervid but vague plan to meet her maybe she really was a french countess or somepun  all evening sitting by the window he was comforted as he heard her move about her room  he had a friend  he had started that great work of making friendswell not started but started startingthen he got confused but the idea was a flame to warm the fogchilled spaces of the london street  at his cattermole breakfast he waited long  she did not come another daybut why paint another day that was but a smear of flat dull slate  yet another breakfast and the lady of mystery came  before he knew he was doing it he had bowed to her a slight uneasy bend of his neck  she peered at him unseeing and sat down with her back to him  he got much good healthy human vindictive satisfaction in evicting her violently from the french chateau he had given her and remembering that of course she was just a fool freak englishwomanprobly a bloomin stoodent he scorned and so settled her  also he told her by telepathy that her new gown was freakier than evera palegreen thing with large white buttons  as he was coming in that evening he passed her in the hall  she was clad in what he called a bathrobe and what she called an arabian burnoose of black embroidered with dullgold crescents and stars showing a v of exquisite flesh at her throat  a shred of tenuous lace straggled loose at the opening of the burnoose  her radiant hair tangled over her forehead shone with a thousand various gleams from the gaslight over her head as she moved back against the wall and stood waiting for him to pass  she smiled very doubtfully distantlythe smile he felt of a great lady from mayfair  he bobbed his head lowered his eyes abashedly and noticed that along the shelf of her forearm held against her waist she bore many silver toilet articles and such a huge heavy fringed turkish bathtowel as he had never seen before  he lay awake to picture her brilliant throat and shining hair he rebuked himself for the lack of dignity in thinking of that freak when she wouldnt even return a fellows bow  but her shimmering hair was the star of his dreams  napping in his room in the afternoon mr wrenn heard slight active sounds from her next room  he hurried down to the stoop  she stood behind him on the doorstep glaring up and down the street as bored and as ready to spring as the zoo tiger  mr wrenn heard himself saying to the girl  please miss do you mind telling meim an american im a stranger in londoni want to go to a good play or something and what would iwhat would be good  i dont know reahlly she said with much hauteur everythings rather rotten this season i fancy  her voice ran fluting up and down the scale  her as were very broad  ohohyyou are english then  yes  whyuh  yes  oh i just had a fool idea maybe you

tell me the rest of your story about me  she was sitting on the rail above him now  as he spoke she cupped her chin with the palm of her delicate hand and observed him curiously  oh nothing much more  you were a countess  please  not just were  please sir maynt i be a countess now  oh yes of course you are he cried delight submerging timidity  and your father was sick with somepun mysterious and

you know  he didnt think you could do anything yourself about him being mysteriously sick so one night you  oh was it dark  very very dark  and silent  and my footsteps rang on the hollow flagstones  and i swiped the gold and went forth into the night  yes yes  thats it  but why did i swipe it  im just coming to that he said sternly  oh please sir im awful sorry i interrupted  it was like this  you wanted to come over here and study medicine sos you could cure your father  but please sir said the girl with immense gravity maynt i let him die and not find out whats ailing him so i can marry

moon                dont you wish you   could know all about art and economics as we do  thats what they say  umph  then she wriggled her fingers in the air like white butterflies shrugged her shoulders elaborately rose from the rail and sat down beside him on the steps quite matteroffactly  he gould feel his templepulses beat with excitement  she turned her pale sensitive vivid face slowly toward him  when did you see meto make up the story  breakfasts  at mrs cattermoles  oh yes  how is it you arent out sightseeing  or is it blessedly possible that you arent a trippera tourist  why i dunno  he hunted uneasily for the right answer not exactly  i tried a stuntcoming over on a cattleboat  thats good  much better  she sat silent while with enormous and selfbetraying pains to avoid detection he studied her firm thin brilliantly red lips at last he tried  please tell me something about london  some of you english oh i dunno  i cant get acquainted easily  my dear child im not english  im quite as american as yourself  i was born in california  i never saw england till two years ago on my way to paris  im an art student  thats why my accent is so perishin englishi cant afford to be just ordinary british y know  her laugh had an october tang of bitterness in it  well illsay what do you know about that he said weakly  tell me about yourselfsince apparently were now acquainted  unless you want to go to that musichall  oh no no no gee i was just crazy to have somebody to talk tosomebody nicei was just about nutty i was so lonely all in a burst  he finished hesitatingly i guess the english are kinda hard to get acquainted with  lonely eh she mused abrupt and bluffly kind as a man for all her modulating womans voice  you dont know any of the people here in the house  nom  say i guess we got rooms next to each other  how romantic she mocked  wrenns my name william wrenn  i work fori used to work for the souvenir and art novelty company  in new york  oh  i see  novelties  nice little ashtrays with love from the erie station  and woggly pincushions  yes  and fat pugdogs with black eyes  oh nooo please not black  pale sympathetic blue eyesnice honest blue eyes  nope  black  awful black  say gee i aint talking too nutty am i  nutty  you mean idiotically  the slangs changed sinceoh yes of course youve succeeded in talking quite nice and idiotic  oh say gee i didnt mean towhen you been so nice and all to me  dont apologize istra nash demanded savagely  havent they taught you that  yesm he mumbled apologetically  she sat silent again apparently not at all satisfied with the architecture of the opposite side of tavistock place diffidently he edged into speech  honest i did think you was english  you came from california oh say i wonder if youve ever heard of dr mittyford  hes some kind of schoolteacher  i think he teaches in leland stamford college  leland stanford  you know him  she dropped into interested familiarity  i met him at oxford  really  my brother was at stanford  i think ive heard him speak ofoh yes  he said that mittyford was a cultural climber if you know what i mean ratheroh how shall i express itoh shall we put it finicky about things people have just told him to be finicky about  yes glowed mr wrenn  to the luxury of feeling that he knew the unusual miss istra nash he sacrificed dr mittyford scholarship and eyeglasses and shelley and all without mercy  yes he was awfully funny  gee i didnt care much for him  of course you know hes a great man however  istra was as bland as though she had meant that all along which left mr wrenn nowhere at all when it came to deciding what she meant  without warning she rose from the steps flung at him g night and was off down the street  sitting alone all excited happiness mr wrenn muttered  aint she a wonder  gee shes strikinglookin  gee whittakers  some hours later he said aloud tossing about in bed  i wonder if i was too fresh  i hope i wasnt  i ought to be careful  he was so worried about it that he got up and smoked a cigarette remembered that he was breaking still another rule by smoking too much then got angry and snapped defiantly at his suitcase  well what do i care if i am smoking too much and ill be as fresh as i want to he threw a newspaper at the censorious suitcase and much relieved went to bed to dream that he was a rabbit making enormously amusing jests at which he laughed rollickingly in halfdream till he realized that he was being awakened by the sound of long sobs from the room of istra nash   afternoon mr wrenn in his room  miss nash was back from tea but there was not a sound to be heard from her room though he listened with mouth open bent forward in his chair his hands clutching the wooden seat his fingertips rubbing nervously back and forth over the rough undersurface of the wood he wanted to help herthe wonderful lady who had been sobbing in the night  he had a plan in which he really believed to say to her please let me help you princess jus like i was a knight  at last he heard her moving about  he rushed downstairs and waited on the stoop  when she came out she glanced down and smiled contentedly he was flutteringly sure that she expected to see him there but all his plan of proffering assistance vanished as he saw her impatient eyes and her splendors of dressanother tightfitting gown of smoky gray with faint silvery lights gliding along the fabric  she sat on the rail above him immediately unhesitatingly and answered his evenin cheerfully  he wanted so much to sit beside her to be friends with her but he felt it took courage to sit beside her  she was likely to stare haughtily at him  however he did go up to the rail and sit shyly kicking his feet beside her and she did not stare haughtily  instead she moved over an inch or two glanced at him almost as though they were sharing a secret and said quietly  i thought quite a bit about you last evening  i believe you really have an imagination even though you are a salesmani mean so many dont you know how it is  oh yes  you see mr wrenn didnt know he was commonplace  after i left here last night i went over to olympia johns and she dragged me off to a play  i thought of you at it because there was an imaginative butler in it  you dont mind my comparing you to a butler do you  he was really quite the nicest person in the play y know  most of it was gorgeously rotten  it used to be a french farce but they sent it to sundayschool and gave it a nice fresh frock  it seemed that a gentlemantabby had been trying to make a match between his nephew and his ward  the ward arted  personally i think it was by tonsorial art  but anyway the uncle knew that nothing brings people together so well as hating the same person  you know like hating the cousin when youre a kiddy hating the cousin that always keeps her nails clean  yes  thats so  so he turned nasty and of course the nephew and ward clinched till death did them partwhich im very sorry to have to tell you death wasnt decent enough to do on the stage  if the play could only have ended with everybodys funeral i should have called it a real happy ending  mr wrenn laughed gratefully though uncertainly  he knew that she had made jokes for him but he didnt exactly know what they were  the imaginative butler he was rather good  but the restugh  that must have been a funny play he said politely  she looked at him sidewise and confided  will you do me a favor  oh yes i  ever been married  he was frightfully startled  his  no sounded as though he couldnt quite remember  she seemed much amused  you wouldnt have believed that this superior quizzical woman who tapped her fingers carelessly on her slim exquisite knee had ever sobbed in the night  oh that wasnt a personal question she said  i just wanted to know what youre like  dont you ever collect people  i dochloroform em quite cruelly and pin their poor little corpses out on nice clean corks  you live alone in new york do you  yyes  who do you play withknow  notnot much of anybody  except maybe charley carpenter hes assistant bookkeeper for the souvenir company  he had wanted to and immediately decided not to invent grandes mondes whereof he was an intimate  what dooh you knowpeople in new york who dont go to parties or read muchwhat do they do for amusement  im so interested in types  well said he  that was all he could say till he had digested a pair of thoughts  just what did she mean by types  had it something to do with printing stories  and what could he say about the people anyway  he observed  oh i dont knowjust talk aboutoh cards and jobs and folks and things andoh you know go to moving pictures and vaudeville and go to coney island andoh sleep  but you  well i read a good deal  quite a little  shakespeare and geography and a lot of stuff  i like reading  and how do you place nietzsche she gravely desired to know    nietzsche  you knowthe german humorist  oh yesuhlet me see now hesuh  why you remember dont you  haeckel and he wrote the great musical comedy of the century  and matisse did the musicmatisse and rodin  i havent been to it he said vaguely  i dont know much german  course i know a few words like spricken sie dutch and bitty sir that rabin at the souvenir companyhes a german jew i guesslearnt me  but say isnt kipling great  gee when i read kim i can imagine im hiking along one of those roads in india just like i was thereyou know all those magicians and so on  readins wonderful aint it  um  yes  i bet you read an awful lot  very little  ohdannunzio and some turgenev and a little tourgenieff  that last was a joke you know  oh yes disconcertedly  what sorts of plays do you go to mr wrenn  moving pictures mostly he said easily then bitterly wished he hadnt confessed so lowlife a habit  welltell me my dearoh i didnt mean that artists use it a good deal it just means old chap  you dont mind my asking such beastly personal questions do you  im interested in people  and now i must go up and write a letter  i was going over to olympiasshes one of the interesting people i spoke ofbut you see you have been much more amusing  good night youre lonely in london arent you  well have to go sightseeing some day  yes i am lonely he exploded  then meekly  oh thank you i shd be awful pleased to  have you seen the tower miss nash  no  never  have you  no  you see i thought it d be kind of a gloomy thing to see all alone  is that why you havent never been there too  my dear man i see i shall have to educate you  shall i  ive been taken in hand by so many peopleit would be a pleasure to pass on the implied slur  shall i  please do  one simply doesnt go and see the tower because thats what trippers do  dont you understand my dear  pardon the my dear again  the tower is the sort of thing school superintendents see and then go back and lecture on in school assemblyroom and the g a r hall  ill take you to the tate gallery then very abruptly g night and she was gone  he stared after her smooth back thinking  gee i wonder if she got sore at something i said  i dont think i was fresh this time  but she beat it so quick  them lips of hersi never knew there was such red lips  and an artistpaints pictures  read a lotnitchygerman musical comedy  wonder if thats that merry widow thing  that gray dress of hers makes me think of fog  curous  in her room istra nash inspected her nose in a mirror powdered and sat down to write on thick creamy paper   skilly dear im in a fierce bloomsbury boardinghousebores except for a phenomenonlittle man of 35 or 40 with embryonic imagination  a virgin soul  ill try to keep from planting radical thoughts in the virgin soul but im tempted  oh skilly dear im lonely as the devil  would it be too bromid to say i wish you were here  i put out my hand in the darkness  yours wasnt there  my dear my dear how desolateoh you understand it only too well with your supercilious grin  your superior eyeglasses  your beatific oxonian ignorance of poor eager america  i suppose i am just a barbarous californian kiddy  its just as pere dureon said at the atelier  you haf a onderstanding of the igher immorality but i ope you can cookpaint you cannot  he wins  i cant sell a single thing to the art editors here or get one single order  one horrid eyeglassed earnest youth who sees people at a magazine he vouchsafed that they didnt use any outsiders  outsiders  and his hair was nearly as red as my wretched mop  so i came home  howled  burned milan tapers before your picture  i did  though you dont deserve it  oh damn it am i getting sentimental  youll read this at petit monsard over your drip  grin at your poor unnietzschean barbarian                                                        i n      chapter viii  he tiffins      mr wrenn chewing and chewing and chewing the cud of thought in his room next evening after an hour had proved two things thus  a the only thing he wanted to do was to go back to america at once because england was a country where every onenative or americanwas so unfriendly and so vastly wise that he could never understand them  b the one thing in the world that he wanted to do was to be right here for the most miraculous event of which he had ever heard was meeting miss nash  first one then the other these thoughts swashed back and forth like the swinging tides  he got away from them only long enough to rejoice that somehowhe didnt know howhe was going to be her most intimate friend because they were both americans in a strange land and because they both could makebelieve  then he was proving that istra would and would not be the perfect comrade among women when some one knocked at his door  electrified his cramped body shot up from its crouch and he darted to the door  istra nash stood there tapping her foot on the sill with apologetic haste in her manner  abruptly she said  so sorry to bother you  i just wondered if you could let me have a match  im all out  oh yes  heres a whole box  please take em  i got plenty more which was absolutely untrue  thank you  s good o you she said hurriedly  g night  she turned away but he followed her into the hall bashfully urging  have you been to another show  gee i hope you draw a better one next time n the one about the guy with the nephew  thank you  she glanced back in the half dark hall from her doorsome fifteen feet from his  he was scratching at the wallpaper with a diffident finger hopeful for a talk  wont you come in she said hesitatingly  oh thank you but i guess i hadnt better  suddenly she flashed out the humanest of smiles her bluegray eyes crinkling with cheery friendship  come in come in child as he hesitatingly entered she warbled  neednt both be so lonely all the time after all need we  even if you dont like poor istra  you dontdo you  seemingly she didnt expect an answer to her question for she was busy lighting a russian cigarette  it was the first time in his life that he had seen a woman smoke  with embarrassed politeness he glanced away from her as she threw back her head and inhaled deeply  he blushingly scrutinized the room  in the farther corner two trunks stood open  one had the tray removed and out of the lower part hung a confusion of lacey things from which he turned away uncomfortable eyes  he recognized the blackandgold burnoose which was tumbled on the bed with a nightgown of lace insertions and soft wrinkles in the lawn a green book with a paper label bearing the title three plays for puritans a red slipper and an open box of chocolates  on the plain kitchenware table was spread a cloth of reseda green like a dull old leaf in color  on it lay a goldmounted fountainpen huge and stubpointed a medley of papers and torn envelopes a bottle of creme yvette and a silverframed portrait of a lean smiling man with a single eyeglass  mr wrenn did not really see all these details but he had an impression of luxury and high artistic success  he considered the yvette flask the largest bottle of perfume hed ever seen and remarked that there was some guys picture on the table he had but a moment to reconnoiter for she was astonishingly saying  so you were lonely when i knocked  why how  oh i could see it  we all get lonely dont we  i do of course  just now im getting sorer and sorer on interesting people  i think ill go back to paris  there even the interesting people arewhy theyre interesting  savvyyou see i am an americansavvy  whyuhuhuhi ddont exactly get what you mean  how do you mean about interesting people  my dear child of course you dont get me  she went to the mirror and patted her hair then curled on the bed with an offhand  wont you sit down and smoked elaborately blowing the blue tendrils toward the ceiling as she continued  of course you dont get it  youre a nice sensible clerk whove had enough real work to do to keep you from being afraid that other people will think youre commonplace  you dont have to coddle yourself into working enough to earn a living by talking about temperament  why these interesting peopleyou find em in  london and new york and san francisco just the same  theyre convinced theyre the wisest people on earth  theres a few artists and a bum novelist or two always and some social workers  the particular bunch that it amuses me to hate just nowand that i apparently cant do withoutthey gather around olympia johns who makes a kind of salon out of her rooms on great james street off theobalds road  they might just as well be in new york but theyre even stodgier  they dont get sick of the game of being on intellectual heights as soon as newyorkers do  ill have to take you there  its a cheery sensation you know to find a man who has some imagination but who has been unspoiled by interesting people and take him to hear them wamble  they sit around and growl and rush the growleri hope you know growlerrushingand rejoice that theyre free spirits being free of course theyre not allowed to go and play with nice people for when a person is free you know he is never free to be anything but free  that may seem confusing but they understand it at olympias  of course theres different sorts of intellectuals and each cult despises all the others  mostly each cult consists of one person but sometimes theres twoa talker and an audienceor even three  for instance you may be a militant and a vegetarian but if some one is a militant and has a good figure why thenoof  thats what i mean by interesting people i loathe them  so of course being one of them i go from one bunch to another and upon my honor every single time i think that the new bunch is interesting  then she smoked in gloomy silence while mr wrenn remarked after some mental labor i guess theyre like cattlementhe cattleier they are the more romantic they look and then when you get to know them the chief trouble with them is that theyre cattlemen  yes thats it  theyrewhy theyreoh poor dear there there there  it shant have so much intellekchool discussion shall it  i think youre a very nice person and ill tell you what well do  well have a small fire shall we  in the fireplace  yes  she pulled the oldfashioned bellcord and the oldfashioned north country landlady cametall thin parchmentfaced mustylooking as though she had been dressed up in victorian garments in 1880 and left to stand in an unaired parlor ever since she glowered silent disapproval at the presence of mr wrenn in istras room but sent a slavey to make the firesaxpence uxtry mr wrenn felt guilty till the coming of the slavey a perfect christmasstorybook slavey a small and merry lump of soot who sang out chilly tnight aynt it and made a fire that was soon singing  chilly tnight like the slavey  istra sat on the floor before the fire turkwise her quick delicate fingers drumming excitedly on her knees  come sit by me  you with your sense of the romantic ought to appreciate sitting by the fire  you know its always done  he slumped down by her clasping his knees and trying to appear the dignified american business man in his countryhouse  she smiled at him intimately and quizzed  tell me about the last time you sat with a girl by the fire tell poor istra the dark secret  was she the perfect among pink faces  iveneversatbeforeanyfireplacewith anyone  except when i was about nineone halloweenat a party in parthenonlittle town up york state  really  poor kiddy  she reached out her hand and took his  he was terrifically conscious of the warm smoothness of her fingers playing a soft tattoo on the back of his hand while she said  but you have been in love  drefful in love  i never have  dear child youve missed so much of the tea and cakes of life havent you  and you have an interest in life  do you know when i think of the jaded interesting people ive metwhy do i leave you to be spoiled by some shopgirl in a flowered hat shed drag you to movingpicture shows  oh  you didnt tell me that you went to moving pictures did you  no he lied fervently then feeling guilty i used to but no more  it shall go to the nice moving pictures if it wants to  it shall take me too  well forget there are any syndicalists or brokencolorists for a while wont we  well let the robins cover us with leaves  you mean like the babes in the woods  but say im afraid you aint just a babe in the woods  youre the first person with brains i ever met cept maybe dr mittyford and the doc never would play games i dont believe  the very first one really  thank you  her warm pressure on his hand tightened  his heart was making the maddest gladdest leaps and timidly with a feeling of historic daring he ventured to explore with his thumbtip the fine lines of the side of her hand  it actually was he sitting here with a princess and he actually did feel the softness of her hand he pantingly assured himself  suddenly she gave his hand a parting pressure and sprang up  come  well have tiffin and then ill send you away and tomorrow well go see the tate gallery  while istra was sending the slavey for cakes and a pint of light wine mr wrenn sat in a chairjust sat in it he wanted to show that he could be dignified and not take advantage of miss nashs kindness by slouchin round  having read much kipling he had an idea that tiffin was some kind of lunch in the afternoon but of course if miss nash used the word for evening supper then he had been wrong  istra whisked the writingtable with the resedagreen cover over before the fire chucked its papers on the bed and placed a bunch of roses on one end moving the small blue vase two inches to the right then two inches forward  the wine she poured into a decanter  wine was distinctly a problem to him  he was excited over his sudden rise into a society where one took wine as a matter of course  mrs zapp wouldnt take it as a matter of course  he rejoiced that he wasnt narrowminded like mrs zapp  he worked so hard at not being narrowminded like mrs zapp that he started when he was called out of his daydream by a mocking voice  but you might look at the cakes  just once anyway  they are very nice cakes  uh  yes i know the wine is wine  beastly of it  say miss nash i did get you this time  oh dont tell me that my presiding goddessship is over already  uhsure  now im going to be a cruel boss  deelighted  are you going to be a caveman  im sorry  i dont quite get you on that  thats too bad isnt it  i think id rather like to meet a caveman  oh say i know about that cavemanjack londons guys  im afraid i aint one  stillon the cattleboatsay i wish you could of seen it when the gang were tying up the bulls before starting  dark close place tweendecks with the steers bellowin and all parked tight together and the stiffs gettin seasickso seasick we just kind of staggered around and wed get hold of a head rope and yank and then let go and the bosses d yell  pull or ill brain you  and then the focslemen packed in like herrings  she was leaning over the table making a labyrinth with the currants from a cake and listening intently  he stopped politely feeling that he was talking too much  but  go on please do she commanded and he told simply seeing it more and more of satan and the grenadier of the fairies who had beckoned to him from the irish coast hills and the comradeship of morton  she interrupted only once murmuring  my dear its a good thing youre articulate anyway which didnt seem to have any bearing on haybales  she sent him away with a light  its been a good party hasnt it caveman  if you are a caveman  call for me tomorrow at three  well go to the tate gallery  she touched his hand in the fleetingest of grasps  yes  good night miss nash he quavered   a morning of planning his conduct so that in accompanying istra nash to the tate gallery he might be the faithful shadow and beautiful transcript of mittyford phd  as a result when he stood before the large canvases of mr watts at the tate he was so heavy and correctly appreciative so ready not to enjoy the stories in the pictures of millais that istra suddenly demanded  oh my dear child i have taken a great deal on my hands youve got to learn to play  you dont know how to play  come i shall teach you  i dont know why i should either  butcome  she explained as they left the gallery  first the art of riding on the buses  oh it is an art you know  you must appreciate the flowergirls and the grrrand young bobbies you must learn to watch for the blossoms on the restaurant terraces and roll on the grass in the parks  youre much too respectable to roll on the grass arent you  ill try ever so hard to teach you not to be  and well go to tea  how many kinds of tea are there  oh ceylon and english breakfast andohchinese  b  and golf tees he added excitedly as they took a seat in front atop the bus  puns are a beginning at least she reflected  but how many kinds of tea are there istra  oh say i hadnt ought to  course call me istra or anything else  only you mustnt call my bluff  what do i know about tea  all of us who play are bluffers more or less and we are ever so polite in pretending not to know the others are bluffing  theres lots of kinds of tea  in the new york chinatown i saw oncedo you know chinatown  being a newyorker i dont suppose you do  oh yes  and italiantown  i used to wander round there  well down at the seven flowery kingdoms chop suey and american cooking theres tea at five dollars a cup that they advertise is grown on cloudcovered mountaintops  i suppose when the tops arent cloudcovered they only charge three dollars a cup but seriouslike theres really only two kinds of teasthose you go to to meet the man you love and ought to hate and those you give to spite the women you hate but ought tohate  isnt that lovely and complicated  thats playing  with words  my aged parent calls it talking too much and not saying anything note that lastnot saying anything  its one of the rules in playing that mustnt be broken  he understood that better than most of the things she said why he exclaimed its kind of talking sideways  why yes  of course  talking sideways  dont you see now  gallant gentleman as he was he let her think she had invented the phrase  she said many other things things implying such vast learning that he made gigantic resolves to read like thunder  her great lesson was the art of taking tea  he found surprisedly that they werent really going to endanger their clothes by rolling on park grass  instead she led him to a tearoom behind a candyshop on tottenham court road a low room with white wicker chairs colored tiles set in the wall and green sedjiware jugs with irregular bunches of white roses a waitress with wildrose cheeks and a busy step brought orange pekoe and lemon for her ceylon and russian caravan tea and a jug of clotted cream for him with a pile of cinnamon buns  but said istra  isnt this like alice in wonderland but you must learn the buttering of english muffins most of all if you get to be very good at it the flunkies will let you take tea at the carleton  they are such hypercritical flunkies and the one that brings the gold buttermeasuring rod to test your skill why he always wears kneebreeches of silver gray so you can see billy how careful you have to be  and eat them without buttering your nose  for if you butter your nose theyll think youre a greek professor  and you wouldnt like that would you honey  he learned how to pat the butter into the comfortable brown insides of the muffins that looked so cold and floury without  but istra seemed to have lost interest and he didnt in the least follow her when she observed  doubtless it was the best butter  but where where dear dormouse are the hatter and hare  especially the sweet bunny rabbit that wriggled his ears and loved gralice the princesse d outremer                  where where are the hatter and hare                and where is the best butter gone   presently  come on  lets beat it down to soho for dinner orno  now you shall lead me  show me where youd go for dinner  and you shall take me to a musichall and make me enjoy it  now you teach me to play  gee im afraid i dont know a single thing to teach you  yes butsee here  we are two lonely western barbarians in a strange land  well play together for a little while  were not used to each others sort of play but that will break up the monotony of life all the more  i dont know how long well play orshall we  oh yes  now show me how you play  i dont believe i ever did much really  well you shall take me to your kind of a restaurant  i dont believe youd care much for penny meatpies  little meatpies  umhuh  little crispy ones  with flaky covers  umhuh  why course i would  and hapny tea  lead me to it o brave knight  and to a vaudeville  he found that this devoted attendant of theaters had never seen the beautiful italians who pounce upon protesting zylophones with small clubs or the sidesplitting jugglers assistant who breaks up piles and piles of plates  and as to the top hat that turns into an accordion and produces much melody she was ecstatic  at aftertheater supper he talked of theresa and south beach of charley carpenter and mortonmortonmorton  they sat at midnight on the steps of the house in tavistock place  i do know you now she mused  its curious how any two babes in a strangeenough woods get acquainted  you are a lonely child arent you  her voice was mothersoft  we will play just a little  i wish i had some games to teach  but you know so much  and im a perfect beauty too arent i she said gravely  yes you are stoutly  you would be loyal  and i need some ones admiration mostly paris and london hold their sides laughing at poor istra  he caught her hand  oh dont they must preciate you id like to kill anybody that didnt  thanks she gave his hand a return pressure and hastily withdrew her own  youll be good to some sweet pink face and ill go on being discontented  oh isn t life the fiercest proposition  we seem different you and i but maybe its mostly surfacedown deep were alike in being desperately unhappy because we never know what were unhappy about  well  he wanted to put his head down on her knees and rest there  but he sat still and presently their cold hands snuggled together  after a silence in which they were talking of themselves he burst out  but i dont see how paris could help preciating you  ill bet youre one of the best artists they ever saw the way you made up a picture in your mind about that juggler  nope  sorry  cant paint at all  ah stuff with a rudeness quite masterful  ill bet your pictures are corkers  um  please would you let me see some of them some time  i suppose it would bother  come upstairs  i feel inspired  you are about to hear some great though nasty criticisms on the works of the unfortunate miss nash  she led the way laughing to herself over something  she gave him no time to blush and hesitate over the impropriety of entering a ladys room at midnight but stalked ahead with a brief  come in  she opened a large portfolio covered with greenveined black paper and yanked out a dozen unframed pastels and washdrawings which she scornfully tossed on the bed saying as she pointed to a mass of marseilles roofs  do you see this sketch  the only good thing about it is the thing that last art editor that redheaded youth probably didnt like  dont you hate red hair  you see these ridiculous glaring purple shadows under the clocher  she stared down at the picture interestedly forgetting him pinching her chin thoughtfully while she murmured  theyre rather nice  rather good  rather good  then quickly twisting her shoulders about she poured out  but look at this  consider this arch  its miserably out of drawing  and see how ive faked this figure  it isnt a real person at all  dont you notice how ive juggled with this stairway  why my dear man every bit of the drawing in this thing would disgrace a seventhgrade drawingclass in dos puentes  and regard the bunch of lombardies in this other picture  they look like umbrellas upside down in a silly washbasin  uff  its terrible  affreux  dont act as though you liked them  you really neednt you know  cant you see now that theyre hideously out of drawing  mr wrenns fancy was walking down a green lane of old france toward a white cottage with orangetrees gleaming against its walls  in her pictures he had found the land of all his forsaken dreams  iii was all he could say but admiration pulsed in it  thank you  yes we will play  good night  tomorrow       chapter ix  he encounters the intellectuals      he wanted to find a cable office stalk in and nonchalantly send to his bank for more money  he could see himself doing it maybe the cable clerk would think he was a rich american  what did he care if he spent all he had  a guy he admonished himself just had to have coin when he was goin with a girl like miss istra  at least seven times he darted up from the doorstep where he was on watch for her and briskly trotted as far as the corner  each time his courage melted and he slumped back to the doorstep  sending for moneygee he groaned that was pretty dangerous  besides he didnt wish to go away  istra might come down and play with him  for three hours he writhed on that doorstep till he came to hate it it was as much a prison as his room at the zapps had been  he hated the areaway grill and a big brown spot on the pavement and as a truckdriver hates a motorman so did he hate a pudgy woman across the street who peeped out from a secondstory window and watched him with cynical interest he finally could endure no longer the worlds criticism as expressed by the woman opposite  he started as though he were going to go right now to some place he had been intending to go to all the time and stalked away ignoring the woman  he caught a bus then another then walked a while  now that he was moving he was agonizedly considering his problem  what was istra to him really  what could he be to her  he was just a clerk  she could never love him  and of course he explained to himself you hadnt oughta love a person without you expected to marry them you oughtnt never even touch her hand yet he did want to touch hers  he suddenly threw his chin back high and firm in defiance  he didnt care if he was wicked he declared he wanted to shout to istra across all the city  let us be great lovers let us be mad  let us stride over the hilltops  though that was not at all the way he phrased it  then he bumped into a knot of people standing on the walk and came down from the hilltops in one swoop  a crowd was collecting before rothsey hall which bore the sign   glorygloryglory   special salvation army jubilee meeting   experiences of adjutant crabbenthwaite in africa   he gaped at the sign  a salvationist in the crowd trim and well set up his redribboned salvation army cap at a jaunty angle said  wont you come in brother  mr wrenn meekly followed into the hall  bill wrenn was nowhere in sight  now it chanced that adjutant crabbenthwaite told much of houssas and the ngombi of saraweks and weeklong treks but mr wrenns imagination was not for a second drawn to africa nor did he even glance at the sunbonneted salvationist women packed in the hall  he was going over and over the adjutants denunciations of the englishmen and englishwomen who flirt on the mailboats  suppose it had been himself and his madness over istraat the moment he quite called it madnessthat the adjutant had denounced  a salvationist near by was staring at him most accusingly  he walked away from the jubilee reflectively  he ate his dinner with a grave courtesy toward the food and the waiter  he was positively courtly to his fork  for he was just reformed  he was going to steer clear of mad artist womenof all but nice good girls whom you could marry  he remembered the adjutants thundered words  flirting you call itflirting  look into your hearts  god himself hath looked into them and found flirtation the gateway to hell  and i tell you that these army officers and the bedizened women with their wine and cigarettes with their devils callingcards and their jewels with their helllighted talk of the sacrilegious follies of socialism and art and horseracing o my brothers it was all but a cloak for looking upon one another to lust after one another  rotten is this empire and shall fall when our soldiers seek flirtation instead of kneeling in prayer like the iron men of cromwell  istra  cardplaying  talk of socialism and art  mr wrenn felt very guilty  istra  smoking and drinking wine  but his moral reflections brought the picture of istra the more clearly before himthe persuasive warmth of her perfect fingers the curve of her backwardbent throat as she talked in her melodious voice of all the beautiful things made by the wise hands of great men  he dashed out of the restaurant  no matter what happened good or bad he had to see her  while he was climbing to the upper deck of a bus he was trying to invent an excuse for seeing her  of course one couldnt go and call on ladies in their rooms without havin some special excuse they would think that was awful fresh  he left the bus midway at the sign of a periodical shop and purchased a blackwoods and a nineteenth century  morton had told him these were the chief english highbrow magazines  he carried them to his room rubbed his thumb in the lampblack on the gasfixture and smeared the magazine covers then cut the leaves and ruffled the margins to make the magazines look dogeared with much reading not because he wanted to appear to have read them but because he felt that istra would not permit him to buy things just for her  all this business with details so calmed him that he wondered if he really cared to see her at all  besides it was so lateafter halfpast eight  rats  hang it all  i wish i was dead  i dont know what i do want to do he groaned and cast himself upon his bed  he was sure of nothing but the fact that he was unhappy  he considered suicide in a dignified manner but not for long enough to get much frightened about it  he did not know that he was the toy of forces which working on him through the strangeness of passionate womanhood could have made him a great cad or a petty hero as easily as they did make him confusedly sorry for himself  that he wasnt very much of a cad or anything of a hero is a detail an accident resulting from his thirtyfive or thirtysix years of stodgy environment cad or hero filling scandal columns or histories he would have been the same william wrenn  he was thinking of istra as he lay on his bed  in a few minutes he dashed to his bureau and brushed his thinning hair so nervously that he had to try three times for a straight parting while brushing his eyebrows and mustache he solemnly contemplated himself in the mirror  i look like a damn rabbit he scorned and marched halfway to istras room  he went back to change his tie to a navyblue bow which made him appear younger  he was feeling rather resentful at everything including istra as he finally knocked and heard her  yes  come in  there was in her room a wonderful being lolling in a wingchair one leg over the chairarm a young young man with broken brown teeth always seen in his perpetual grin but a godlike grecian nose a high forehead and bristly yellow hair  the being wore large round tortoiseshell spectacles a soft shirt with a goldplated collarpin and delicately gray garments  istra was curled on the bed in a leafgreen silk kimono with a great goldmounted medallion pinned at her breast  mr wrenn tried not to be shocked at the kimono  she had been frowning as he came in and fingering a long thin green book of verses but she glowed at mr wrenn as though he were her most familiar friend murmuring mouse dear im so glad you could come in  mr wrenn stood there awkwardly  he hadnt expected to find another visitor  he seemed to have heard her call him mouse yes but what did mouse mean  it wasnt his name at all  this was all very confusing  but how awful glad she was to see him  mouse dear this is one of our best little indecent poets mr carson haggerty  from americacaliforniatoo  mr hagty mr wrenn  pleased meet you said both men in the same tone of annoyance  mr wrenn implored  iuhi thought you might like to look at these magazines  just dropped in to give them to you  he was ready to go  thank youso good of you  please sit down  carson and i were only fightinghes going pretty soon  we knew each other at art school in berkeley  now he knows all the toffs in london  mr wrenn said the best little poet i hope youll back up my contention  izzy says th  carson i have told you just about enough times that i do not intend to stand for izzy any more  i should think that even you would be able to outgrow the standard of wit that obtains in firstyear art class at berkeley  mr haggerty showed quite all of his ragged teeth in a noisy joyous grin and went on unperturbed  miss nash says that the best european thought personally gathered in the best salons shows that the rodin vogue is getting the pickleeye from all the real yearners  what is your opinion  mr wrenn turned to istra for protection  she promptly announced  mr wrenn absolutely agrees with me  by the way hes doing a big book on the recrudescence of kipling after his slump and  oh come off now  kipling  blatant imperialist antistirner cried carson haggerty kicking out each word with the assistance of his swinging left foot  much relieved that the stormcenter had passed over him mr wrenn sat on the front edge of a caneseated chair with the magazines between his hands and his hands pressed between his forwardcocked knees  always in the hundreds of times he went over the scene in that room afterward he remembered how cool and smooth the magazine covers felt to the palms of his flattened hands  for he associated the papery surfaces with the apprehension he then had that istra might give him up to the jagtoothed grin of carson haggerty who would laugh him out of the room and out of istras world  he hated the poetic youth and would gladly have broken all of carsons teeth short off  yet the dread of having to try the feat himself made him admire the manner in which carson tossed about long creepysounding words like a bushape playing with scarlet spiders  he talked insultingly of yeats and the commutation of sexenergy and isadora duncan and the poetry of carson haggerty  istra yawned openly on the bed kicking a pillow but she was surprised into energetic discussion now and then till haggerty intentionally called her izzy again when she sat up and remarked to mr wrenn  oh dont go yet  you can tell me about the article when carson goes  dear carson said he was only going to stay till ten  mr wrenn hadnt had any intention of going so he merely smiled and bobbed his head to the room in general and stammered yyes while he tried to remember what he had told her about some article  article  perhaps it was a souvenir company novelty article  great idea  perhaps she wanted to design a motto for them  he decidedly hoped that he could fix it up for herhed sure do his best  hed be glad to write over to mr guilfogle about it  anyway she seemed willing to have him stick here  yet when dear carson had jauntily departed leaving the room still loud with the smack of his grin istra seemed to have forgotten that mr wrenn was alive  she was scowling at a book on the bed as though it had said things to her  so he sat quiet and crushed the magazine covers more closely till the silence choked him and he dared mr carson is an awful welleducated man  hes a bounder she snapped  she softened her voice as she continued  he was in the art school in california when i was there and he presumes on that  it was good of you to stay and help me get rid of him  im gettingim sorry im so dull tonight  i suppose ill get sent off to bed right now if i cant be more entertaining  it was sweet of you to come in mouse  you dont mind my calling you mouse do you  i wont if you do mind  he awkwardly walked over and laid the magazines on the bed why its all right  what was it about some noveltysome article  if theres anything i could doanything  article  why yes  that you wanted to see me about  oh  oh that was just to get rid of carson  his insufferable familiarity  the penalty for my having been a naive kiddy hungry for friendship once  and now good n oh mouse he says my eyeseven with this green kimono on come here dear  tell me what color my eyes are  she moved with a quick swing to the side of her bed  thrusting out her two arms she laid ivory hands clutchingly on his shoulder  he stood quaking forgetting every one of the wrennish rules by which he had edged a shy polite way through life  he fearfully reached out his hands toward her shoulders in turn but his arms were shorter than hers and his hands rested on the sensitive warmth of her upper arms  he peered at those dear grayblue eyes of hers but he could not calm himself enough to tell whether they were chinablue or basaltblack  tell me she demanded arent they green  yes he quavered  youre sweet she said  leaning out from the side of her bed she kissed him  she sprang up and hastened to the window laughing nervously and deploring  i shouldnt have done that  i shouldnt  forgive me  plaintively like a child  istra was so bad so bad  now you must go  as she turned back to him her eyes had the peace of an old friends  because he had wished to be kind to people because he had been pitiful toward goaty zapp mr wrenn was able to understand that she was trying to be a kindly big sister to him and he said good night istra and smiled in a lively way and walked out he got out the smile by wrenching his nerves for which he paid in agony as he knelt by his bed acknowledging that istra would never love him and that therefore he was not to love would be a fool to love never would love herand seeing again her white arms softly shadowed by her green kimono sleeves  no sight of istra no scent of her hair no sound of her alwayschanging voice for two days  twice seeing a sliver of light under her door as he came up the darkened stairs he knocked but there was no answer and he marched into his room with the dignity of fury  numbers of times he quite gave her up decided he wanted never to see her again  but after one of the savagest of these renunciations while he was stamping defiantly down tottenham court road he saw in a window a walkingstick that he was sure she would like his carrying  and it cost only twoandsix hastily before he changed his mind he rushed in and slammed down his money  it was a very beautiful stick indeed and of a modesty to commend itself to istra just a plain straight stick with a cap of metal curiously like silver  he was conscious that the whole world was leering at him demanding whatre you carrying a cane for but hethe misunderstoodwas willing to wait for the reward of this martyrdom in istras approval  the third night as he stood at the window watching two children playing in the dusk there was a knock  it was istra  she stood at his door smart and inconspicuous in a black suit with a small toque that hid the flare of her red hair  come she said abruptly  i want you to take me to olympiasolympia johns flat  ive been reading all the balzac there is  i want to talk  can you come  oh of course  hurry then  he seized his small foolishly round hat and he tucked his new walkingstick under his arm without displaying it too proudly waiting for her comment  she led the way downstairs and across the quiet streets and squares of bloomsbury to great james street  she did not even see the stick  she said scarce a word beyond  im sick of olympias bunchi never want to dine in soho with an inhibition and a varietistic sex instinct againjamais de la vie  but one has to play with somebody  then he was so cheered that he tapped the pavements boldly with his stick and delicately touched her arm as they crossed the street  for she added  well just run in and see them for a little while and then you can take me out and buy me a rhine wine and seltzer  poor mouse it shall have its play  olympia johns residence consisted of four small rooms  when istra opened the door after tapping the livingroom was occupied by seven people all interrupting one another and drinking fourpenny ale seven people and a fog of cigarette smoke and a tangle of papers and books and hats  a swamp of unwashed dishes appeared on a large table in the room just beyond divided off from the livingroom by a burlap curtain to which were pinned suffrage buttons and medallions  this last he remembered afterward thinking over the room for the medals glittering points of light relieved his eyes from the intolerable glances of the people as he was hastily introduced to them  he was afraid that he would be dragged into a discussion and sat looking away from them to the medals and to the walls on which were posters showing mighty fists with hammers and flaming torches or hoglike men lolling on the chests of workmen which they seemed to enjoy more than the workmen  by and by he ventured to scan the group  carson haggerty the american poet was there  but the center of them all was olympia johns herselfspinster thirtyfour as small and active and excitedly energetic as an ant trying to get around a match  she had much of the ants brownness and slimness too  her pale hair was always falling from under her fillet of worn black velvet with the dingy under side of the velvet showing curled up at the edges  a lock would tangle in front of her eyes and she would impatiently shove it back with a jab of her thin rough hands never stopping in her machinegun volley of words  yes yes yes yes she would pour out  dont you see we must do something  i tell you the conditions are intolerable simply intolerable  we must do something  the conditions were it seemed intolerable in the several branches of education of female infants water rates in bloomsbury the cutlery industry and balladsinging  and mostly she was right  only her rightness was so demanding so restless that it left mr wrenn gasping  olympia depended on carson haggerty for most of the yes thats sos though he seemed to be trying to steal glances at another woman a young woman a lazy smiling pretty girl of twenty who istra told mr wrenn studied greek archaeology at the museum no one knew why she studied it  she seemed peacefully ignorant of everything but her kissable lips and she adorably poked at things with lazy graceful fingers and talked the little language to carson haggerty at which olympia shrugged her shoulders and turned to the others  there were a mr and mrs stettiniusshe a poet he a bleached man with goatish whiskers and a sanctimonious white neckcloth who was puritanically ethically gloomily religiously atheistic  items in the room were a young man who taught in mr jeneys select school and an established church mission worker from whitechapel who loved to be shocked  it was mr wrenn who was really shocked however not by the noise and odor not by the smoking of the women not by the demand that we tear down the state no not by these was our mr wrenn of the souvenir company shocked but by his own fascinated interest in the frank talk of sex  he had always had a quite undefined supposition that it was wicked to talk of sex unless one made a joke of it  then came the superradicals to confuse the radicals who confused mr wrenn  for always there is a greater rebellion and though you sell your prayerbook to buy bakunine and esteem yourself revolutionary to a point of madness you shall find one who calls you reactionary  the scorners came in togethermoe tchatzsky the syndicalist and direct actionist and jane schott the writer of impressionistic proseand they sat silently sneering on a couch  istra rose nodded at mr wrenn and departed despite olympias hospitable shrieks after them of  oh stay  its only a little after ten  do stay and have something to eat  istra shut the door resolutely  the hall was dark  it was gratefully quiet  she snatched up mr wrenns hand and held it to her breast  oh mouse dear im so bored  i want some real things  they talk and talk in there and every night they settle all the fate of all the nations always the same way  i dont suppose theres ever been a bunch that knew more things incorrectly you hated them didnt you  why i dont think you ought to talk about them so severe he implored as they started downstairs  i dont mean theyre like you  they dont savvy like you do  i mean it  but i was awful intrested in what that miss johns said about kids in school getting crushed into a mold  gee thats so aint it never thought of it before  and that mrs stettinius talked about yeats so beautiful  oh my dear you make my task so much harder  i want you to be different  cant you see your cattleboat experience is realer than any of the things those halfbaked thinkers have done  i know  im halfbaked myself  oh ive never done nothing  but youre ready to  oh i dont know  i wanti wish jock setonthe filibuster i met in san franciscoi wish he were here  mouse maybe i can make a filibuster of you  ive got to create something  oh those people  if you just knew them  that fool mary stettinius is mad about that tchatzsky person and her husband invites him to teas  stettinius is mad about olympia wholl probably take carson out and marry him and hell keep on hanging about the greek girl  ungh  i dont knowi dont know  but as he didnt know what he didnt know she merely patted his arm and said soothingly  i wont criticize your first specimens of radicals any more  they are trying to do something anyway then she added in an irrelevant tone  youre exactly as tall as i am  mouse dear you ought to be taller  they were entering the drab stretch of tavistock place after a silence as drab when she exclaimed  mouse i am so sick of everything  i want to get out away anywhere and do something anything just sos its different  even the country  id likewhy couldnt we  lets go out on a picnic tomorrow istra  a picnic picnic  with pickles and a pillow cushion and several kinds of cake  im afraid the bois boulogne has spoiled me for that  let me think  she drooped down on the steps of their house  her head back her supple strong throat arched with the passion of hating boredom she devoured the starlight dim over the stale old roofs across the way  stars she said  out on the moors they would come down by you  what is your adventureyour formula for it  lets see you take common roadside things seriously youd be dear and excited over a red lion inn  are there more than one red li  my dear mouse england is a menagerie of red lions and white lions and fuzzy green unicorns  why not why not why not lets walk to aengusmere  its a fool colony of artists and so on up in suffolk but they have got some beautiful cottages and theyre more celt than dublin  start right now take a train to chelmsford say and tramp all night  take a couple of days or so to get there  think of it  tramping through dawn past english fields  think of it yankee  and not caring what anybody in the world thinks  gipsies  shall we  whhhhy  he was sure she was mad  tramping all night he couldnt let her do this  she sprang up  she stared down at him in revulsion her hands clenched  her voice was hostile as she demanded  what  dont you want to  with me  he was up beside her angry dignified a man  look here  you know i want to  youre the elegantesti mean youreoh you ought to know  cant you see how i feel about you  why id rather do this than anything i ever heard of in my life  i just dont want to do anything that would get people to talking about you  who would know  besides my dear man i dont regard it as exactly wicked to walk decently along a country road  oh it isnt that  oh please istra dont look at me like thatlike you hated me  she calmed at once drummed on his arm sat down on the railing and drew him to a seat beside her  of course mouse  its silly to be angry  yes i do believe you want to take care of me  but dont worry  come  shall we go  but wouldnt you rather wait till tomorrow  no  the whole things so mad that if i wait till then ill never want to do it  and youve got to come so that ill have some one to quarrel with  i hate the smugness of london especially the smugness of the antismug antibourgeois radicals so that i have the finest mad mood  come  well go  even this logical exposition had not convinced him but he did not gainsay as they entered the hall and istra rang for the landlady  his knees grew sick and old and quavery as he heard the landladys voice loud belowstairs  now wot do they want its eleven oclock  arent they ever done aringing and aringing  the landlady the tired thin parchmentfaced north countrywoman whose god was respectability of lodgings listened in a frightened way to istras blandly superior statement  mr wrenn and i have been invited to join an excursion out of town that leaves tonight  well pay our rent and leave our things here  going off together  my good woman we are going to aengusmere  heres two pound dont allow any one in my room  and i may send for my things from out of town  be ready to pack them in my trunks and send them to me  do you understand  yes miss but  my good woman do you realize that your buts are insulting  oh i didnt go to be insulting  then thats all  hurry now mouse  on the stairs ascending she whispered with the excitement not of a tired woman but of a tennisanddancingmad girl  were off  just take a toothbrush  put on an outing suitany old thingand an old cap  she darted into her room  now mr wrenn had for any old thing as well as for afternoon and evening dress only the sturdy undistinguished clothes he was wearing so he put on a cap and hoped she wouldnt notice she didnt  she came knocking in fifteen minutes trim in a khaki suit with low thick boots and a jolly tousled blue tamoshanter  come on  theres a train for chelmsford in half an hour my timetable confided to me  i feel like singing       chapter x  he goes agipsying      they rode out of london in a thirdclass compartment opposite a curate and two stodgy people who were just people and defied you istra cheerfully explained to mr wrenn to make anything of them but just people  wouldnt they stare if they knew what idiocy were up to she suggested  mr wrenn bobbed his head in entire agreement  he was trying without any slightest success to make himself believe that mr william wrenn our mr wrenn late of the souvenir company was starting out for a country tramp at midnight with an artist girl  the night foreman of the station a person of bedizenment and pride stared at them as they alighted at chelmsford and glanced around like strangers  mr wrenn stared back defiantly and marched with istra from the station through the sleeping town past its ragged edges into the country  they tramped on a bit wearily  mr wrenn was beginning to wonder if theyd better go back to chelmsford  mist was dripping and blind and silent about them weaving its heavy gray with the night  suddenly istra caught his arm at the gate to a farmyard and cried  look  gee  gee were in england  were abroad  yesabroad  a paved courtyard with farm outbuildings thatched and ancient was lit faintly by a lantern hung from a post that was thumbed to a soft smoothness by centuries  that couldnt be america he exulted  gee  im just gettin it  im so darn glad we came  heres real england no tourists  its what ive always wanteda country thats old and different  thatched houses  and pretty soon itll be dawn summer dawn with you with istra  gee  its the darndest adventure  yes  come on  lets walk fast or well get sleepy and then your romantic heroine will be a grouchy interesting people  listen  theres a sleepy dog barking a million miles away  i feel like telling you about myself  you dont know me  or do you  i dunno just how you mean  oh it shall have its romance  but some time ill tell youperhaps i willhow im not really a clever person at all but just a savage from outer darkness who pretends to understand london and paris and munich and gets frightfully scared of them  wait  listen  hear the mist drip from that tree  are you nice and drowned  uhkind of  but i been worrying about you being soaked  let me see  why your sleeve is wet clear through  this khaki of mine keeps out the water better  but i dont mind getting wet  all i mind is being bored  id like to run up this hill without a thing onjust feeling the good healthy real mist on my skin  but im afraid it isnt done  mile after mile  mostly she talked of the boulevards and pere dureon of debussy and artichokes in little laughing sentences that sprang like fire out of the dimness of the mist  dawn came  from a hilltop they made out the roofs of a town and stopped to wonder at its silence as though through long ages past no happy footstep had echoed there  the fog lifted  the morning was newborn and clean and they fairly sang as they clattered up to an old coaching inn and demanded breakfast of an amazed rustic pottering about the inn yard in a smock  he did not know that to a thrilling mr wrenn heor perhaps it was his smockwas the hero in an english melodrama  nor doubtless did the english crisp bacon and eggs which a sleepy housemaid prepared know that they were theater properties  why they were english eggs served at dawn in an english inna stonefloored raftered room with a starling hanging in a little cage of withes outside the latticed window  and there were no trippers to bother them  mr wrenn really used the word trippers in his cogitations he had it from istra  when he informed her of this occult fact she laughed  you know mighty well mouse that you have a sneaking wish there were one yankee stranger here to see our glory  i guess thats right  but maybe im just as bad  for once their tones had not been those of teacher and pupil but of comrades  they set out from the inn through the brightening morning like lively boys on a vacation tramp  the sun crept out with the warmth and the dust and istras steps lagged  as they passed the outlying corner of a farm where a strawstack was secluded in a clump of willows istra smiled and sighed  im pretty tired dear  im going to sleep in that strawstack  ive always wanted to sleep in a strawstack  its comme il faut for vagabonds in the best set you know  and one can burrow  exciting eh  she made a pillow of her khaki jacket while he dug down to a dry place for her  he found another den on the other side of the stack  it was afternoon when he awoke  he sprang up and rushed around the stack  istra was still asleep curled in a pathetically small childish heap her tired face in repose against the brownyellow of her khaki jacket  her red hair had come down and shone about her shoulders  she looked so frail that he was frightened  surely too shed be very angry with him for letting her come on this jaunt  he scribbled on a leaf from his addressbookreligiously carried for six years but containing only four addressesthis note   gone to get stuff for bxfst be right backw w   and softly crawling up the straw left the note by her head he hastened to a farmhouse  the farmwife was inclined to be curious  o curious farmwife you of the creamthick essex speech and the shuffling feet you were brave indeed to face bill wrenn the great with his curt selfpossession for he was on a mission for istra and he cared not for the goggling eyes of all england  what though he was a bunnyfaced man with an innocuous mustache  istra would be awakening hungry  that was why he bullied you into selling him a stewpan and a bundle of faggots along with the tea and eggs and a bread loaf and a jar of the marmalade your husbands farm had been making these two hundred years  and you should have had coffee for him not tea woman of essex  when he returned to their outdoor inn the late afternoon glow lay along the rich fields that sloped down from their wellconcealed nook  istra was still asleep but her cheek now lay wistfully on the crook of her thin arm  he looked at the auburnframed paleness of her face its lines of thought and ambition unmasked unprotected by the swift changes of expression which defended her while she was awake  he sobbed if he could only make her happy  but he was afraid of her moods  he built a fire by a brooklet beyond the willows boiled the eggs and toasted the bread and made the tea with cream ready in a jar  he remembered boyhood camping days in parthenon and old camp lore  he returned to the stack and called istraoh istra  she shook her head nestled closer into the straw then sat up her hair about her shoulders  she smiled and called down good morning  why its afternoon  did you sleep well dear  yes  did you  gee i hope you did  never better in my life  im so sleepy yet  but comfy i needed a quiet sleep outdoors and its so peaceful here breakfast  i roar for breakfast  wheres the nearest house  got breakfast all ready  youre a dear  she went to wash in the brook and came back with eyes dancing and hair trim and they laughed over breakfast glancing down the slope of golden hazy fields  only once did istra pass out of the land of their intimacy into some hinterland of analysiswhen she looked at him as he drank his tea aloud out of the stewpan and wondered  is this really you here with me  but you arent a boulevardier  i must say i dont understand what youre doing here at all  nor a caveman either  i dont understand it  but you shant be worried by bad istra  lets see we went to grammarschool together  yes and we were in college  dont you remember when i was baseball captain  you dont  gee you got a bad memory  at which she smiled properly and they were away for suffolk again   i suppose now itll go and rain said istra viciously at dusk  it was the first time she had spoken for a mile  then after another quartermile  please dont mind my being silent im sort of stiff and my feet hurt most unromantically  you wont mind will you  of course he did mind and of course he said he didnt he artfully skirted the field of conversation by very west sixteenth street observations on a town through which they passed while she merely smiled wearily and at best remarked yes thats so whether it was so or not  he was reflecting  istras terrible tired  i ought to take care of her  he stopped at the woodpillared entrance of a temperance inn and commanded  come  well have something to eat here  to the astonishment of both of them she meekly obeyed with  if you wish  it cannot be truthfully said that mr wrenn proved himself a person of savoir faire in choosing a temperance hotel for their dinner  istra didnt seem so much to mind the fact that the tablecloth was coarse and the waterglasses thick and that everywhere the elbow ran into a superfluity of greasy pepper and salt castors  but when she raised her head wearily to peer around the room she started glared at mr wrenn and accused are you by any chance aware of the fact that this place is crowded with tourists  there are two family parties from davenport or omaha i know they are  oh they aint such badlooking people protested mr wrenn  just because he had induced her to stop for dinner the poor man thought his masculine superiority had been recognized  oh theyre terrible  cant you see it  oh youre hopeless  why that big guythat big man with the rimless spectacles looks like he might be a good civil engineer and i think that lady opposite him  theyre americans  sore we  im not  i thoughtwhy  of course i was born there but  well just the same i think theyre nice people  now see here  must i argue with you  can i have no peace tired as i am  those trippers are speaking of quaint english flavor  can you want anything more than that to damn them  and theyve been touring by motorseeing every inn on the road  maybe its fun for  now dont argue with me  i know what im talking about why do i have to explain everything  theyre hopeless  mr wrenn felt a good wholesome desire to spank her but he said most politely  youre awful tired  dont you want to stay here tonight  or maybe some other hotel and ill stay here  no  dont want to stay any place  want to get away from myself she said exactly like a naughty child  so they tramped on again  darkness was near  they had plunged into a country which in the night seemed to be a stretch of desolate moorlands  as they were silently plodding up a hill the rain came  it came with a roar a pitiless drenching against which they fought uselessly soaking them slapping their faces blinding their eyes  he caught her arm and dragged her ahead  she would be furious with him because it rained of course but this was no time to think of that he had to get her to a dry place  istra laughed  oh isnt this great  were real vagabonds now  why  doesnt that khaki soak through  arent you wet  to the skin she shouted gleefully  and i dont care were doing something  poor dear is it worried  ill race you to the top of the hill  the dark bulk of a building struck their sight at the top and they ran to it  just now mr wrenn was ready to devour alive any irate householder who might try to turn them out  he found the building to be a ruined stablethe door off the hinges the desolate thatch falling in  he struck a match and holding it up standing straight the master all unconscious for once in his deprecating life of the wrennishness of mr wrenn he discovered that the thatch above the horsemanger was fairly waterproof  come on  up on the edge of the manger istra he ordered  this is a perfectly good place for a murder she grinned as they sat swinging their legs  he could fancy her grinning  he was sure about it and well content  have i been so very grouchy mouse  dont you want to murder me  ill try to find you a long pin  nope i dont think so much  i guess we can get along without it this time  oh dear dear  this is very dreadful  youre so used to me now that you arent even scared of me any more  gee  i guess ill be scared of you all right as soon as i get you into a dry place but i aint got time now  sitting on a manger  aint this the funniest place  now i must beat it out and find a house  there ought to be one somewheres near here  and leave me here in the darknesses and wetnesses  not a chance the rainll soon be over anyway  really i dont mind a bit i think its rather fun  her voice was natural again natural and companionable and brave she laughed as she stroked her wet shoulder and held his hand sitting quietly and bidding him listen to the soft forlorn sound of the rain on the thatch  but the rain was not soon over and their dangling position was very much like riding a rail  im so uncomfortable fretted istra  see here istra please i think id better go see if i cant find a house for you to get dry in  i feel too wretched to go any place  too wretched to move  well then ill make a fire here  there aint much danger  the place will catch fire she began querulously  but he interrupted her  oh let the darn place catch fire im going to make a fire i tell you  i dont want to move  itll just be another kind of discomfort thats all  why couldnt you try and take a little bit of care of me anyway  oh honey he wailed in youthful bewilderment  i did try to get you to stay at that hotel in town and get some rest  well you ought to have made me  dont you realize that i took you along to take care of me  uh  now dont argue about it  i cant stand argument all the time  he thought instantly of lee theresa zapp quarreling with her mother but he said nothing  he gathered the driest bits of thatch and wood he could find in the litter on the stable floor and kindled a fire while she sat sullenly glaring at him her face wrinkled and tired in the wan firelight  when the blaze was going steadily a compact and safe little fire he spread his coat as a seat for her and called cheerily  come on now honey heres a regular home and hearthstone for you  she slipped down from the manger edge and stood in front of him looking into his eyeswhich were level with her own  you are good to me she half whispered and smoothed his cheek then slipped down on the outspread coat and murmured come sit here by me and well both get warm  all night the rain dribbled but no one came to drive them away from the fire and they dozed side by side their hands close and their garments steaming  istra fell asleep and her head drooped on his shoulder  he straightened to bear its weight though his back twinged with stiffness and there he sat unmoving through an hour of pain and happiness and confused meditation studying the curious backgroundthe dark roof of broken thatch the agecorroded walls the littered earthen floor  his hand pressed lightly the clammy smoothness of the wet khaki of her shoulder his wet sleeve stuck to his arm and he wanted to pull it free  his eyes stung  but he sat tight while his mind ran round in circles considering that he loved istra and that he would not be entirely sorry when he was no longer the slave to her moods that this adventure was the strangest and most romantic also the most idiotic and useless in history  toward dawn she stirred and slipping stiffly from his position he moved her so that her back which was still wet faced the fire  he built up the fire again and sat brooding beside her dozing and starting awake till morning  then his head bobbed and he was dimly awake again to find her sitting up straight looking at him in amazement  it simply cant be thats all  did you curl me up  im nice and dry all over now  it was very good of you  youve been a most commendable person  but i think well take a train for the rest of our pilgrimage  it hasnt been entirely successful im afraid  perhaps wed better  for a moment he hated her with her smooth politeness after a night when she had been unbearable and human by turns  he hated her bedraggled hair and tired face  then he could have wept so deeply did he desire to pull her head down on his shoulder and smooth the wrinkles of weariness out of her dear face the dearer because they had endured the weariness together  but he said well lets try to get some breakfast first istra  with their garments wrinkled from rain half asleep and rather cross they arrived at the esthetic but respectable colony of aengusmere by the noon train       chapter xi  he buys an orange tie      the aengusmere caravanserai is so unyieldingly cheerful and artistic that it makes the ordinary person long for a dingy oldfashioned room in which he can play solitaire and chew gum without being rebuked with exasperating patience by the wall stencils and clever etchings and polished brasses  it is adjectiferous  the common room which is uncommon for hotel parlor is all in superlatives and chintzes  istra had gone up to her room to sleep bidding mr wrenn do likewise and avoid the wrong bunch at the caravanserai for besides the wrong bunch of interesting people there were she explained a right bunch of working artists  but he wanted to get some new clothes to replace his rainwrinkled readymades he was tottering through the common room wondering whether he could find a clothingshop in aengusmere when a shrill gurgle from a wingchair by the roughbrick fireplace halted him  ohhhh mister wrenn mr wrenn there sat mrs stettinius the poetlady of olympias rooms on great james street  ohhhh mr wrenn you bad man do come sit down and tell me all about your wonderful trek with istra nash  i just met dear istra in the upper hall  poor dear she was so crumpled but her hair was like a sunset over mountain peaksyou know as yeats says                  a stormy sunset were her lips                a stormy sunset on doomed ships   only of course this was her hair and not her lipsand she told me that you had tramped all the way from london  ive never heard of anything so romanticor no i wont say romantici do agree with dear olympiaisnt she a magnificent womanso fearless and progressivedidnt you adore meeting hershe is our modern joan of arcsuch a noble figurei do agree with her that romantic love is passe that we have entered the era of glorious companionship that regards varietism as exactly as romantic as monogamy butbutwhere was ii think your gipsying down from london was most exciting  now do tell us all about it mr wrenn first i want you to meet miss saxonby and mr gutch and dear yilyena dourschetsky and mr howard bancock binchof course you know his poetry  and then she drew a breath and flopped back into the wingchairs muffling depths  during all this mr wrenn had stood frightened and unprotected and rainwrinkled before the gathering by the fireless fireplace wondering how mrs stettinius could get her nose so blue and yet so powdery  despite her encouragement he gave no fuller account of the gipsying than  whyuhwe just tramped down till russianjewish yilyena rolled her ebony eyes at him and insisted  yez you mus tale us about it  now yilyena had a pretty neck colored like a cigar of mild flavor and a trick of smiling  she was accustomed to having men obey her  mr wrenn stammered  whyuhwe just walked and we got caught in the rain  say miss nash was a wonder  she never peeped when she got soaked throughshe just laughed and beat it like everything  and we saw a lot of quaint english places along the roadgot away from all them touriststrippersyou know  a perfectly strange person a heavy old man with horn spectacles and a soft shirt who had joined the group unbidden cleared his throat and interrupted  is it not a strange paradox that in traveling the most observant of all pursuits one should have to encounter the eternal bourgeoisie  from the cockney greek chorus about the unlighted fire  yes  everywhere  uh began mr gutch  he apparently had something to say but the chorus went on  and just as swelteringly monogamic in port said as in brum  yes thats so  mr wrrrenn thrilled mrs stettinius the lady poet didnt you notice that they were perfectly oblivious of all economic movements that their observations never postdated ruins  i guess they wanted to make sure they were admirin the right things ventured mr wrenn with secret terror  yes thats so came so approvingly from the greek chorus that the personal pupil of mittyford phd made his first epigram  it isnt so much what you like as what you dont like that shows if youre wise  yes they gurgled and mr wrenn much pleased with himself smiled au prince upon his new friends  mrs stettinius was getting into her stride for a few remarks upon the poetry of industrialism when mr gutch who had been uhing for some moments trying to get in his remark winked with sly rudeness at miss saxonby and observed  i fancy romance isnt quite dead yet y know  our friends here seem to have had quite a romantic little journey then he winked again  say what do you mean demanded bill wrenn hoteyed fists clenched but very quiet  oh im not blaming you and miss nashquite the reverse tittered the gutch person wagging his head sagely  then bill wrenn with his fist at mr gutchs nose spoke his mind  say you whitefaced unhealthy dirtyminded lump i aint much of a fighter but im going to muss you up sos you cant find your ears if you dont apologize for those insinuations  oh mr wrenn  he didnt mean  i didnt mean  he was just spoofing  i was just spoofing  bill wrenn watching the dramatization of himself as hero was enjoying the drama  you apologize then  why certainly mr wrenn  let me explain  oh dont explain snortled miss saxonby  yes from mr bancock binch explanations are so conventional old chap  do you see themmr wrenn selfconscious and ready to turn into a blind belligerent bill wrenn at the first disrespect the talkers sitting about and assassinating all the princes and proprieties and poor things taking mr wrenn quite seriously because he had uncovered the great truth that the important thing in sightseeing is not to see sights  he was most unhappy mr wrenn was and wanted to be away from there he darted as from a spring when he heard istras voice from the edge of the group calling come here a sec billy  she was standing with a chairback for support tired but smiling  i cant get to sleep yet  dont you want me to show you some of the buildings here  oh yes  if mrs stettinius can spare you  this by way of remarking on the fact that the female poet was staring volubly  gggggg said mrs stettinius which seemed to imply perfect consent  istra took him to the belvedere on a little slope overlooking the lawns of aengusmere scattered with low bungalows and rosegardens  it is beautiful isnt it  perhaps one could be happy hereif one could kill all the people except the architect she mused  oh it is he glowed  standing there beside her happiness enveloping them looking across the marvelous sward bill wrenn was at the climax of his comedy of triumph  admitted to a world of lawns and bungalows and big studio windows standing in a belvedere beside istra nash as her friend  mouse dear she said hesitatingly the reason why i wanted to have you come out here why i couldnt sleep i wanted to tell you how ashamed i am for having been peevish being petulant last night  im so sorry because you were very patient with me you were very good to me  i dont want you to think of me just as a crochety woman who didnt appreciate you you are very kind and when i hear that youre married to some nice girl ill be as happy as can be  oh istra he cried grasping her arm i dont want any girl in the worldi meanoh i just want to be let go round with you when youll let me  no no dear  you must have seen last night thats impossible please dont argue about it now im too tired  i just wanted to tell you i appreciatedand when you get back to america you wont be any the worse for playing around with poor istra because she told you about different things from what youve played with about rearing children as individuals and painting in tempera and all those things  andand i dont want you to get too fond of me because weredifferent but we have had an adventure even if it was a little moist she paused then cheerily  well im going to beat it back and try to sleep again  goodby mouse dear  no dont come back to the caraadvancedserai  play around and see the animiles  gby  he watched her straight swaying figure swing across the lawn and up the steps of the halftimbered inn  he watched her enter the door before he hastened to the shops which clustered about the railway station outside of the poetic preserves of the colony proper  he noticed as he went that the men crossing the green were mostly clad in norfolk jackets and knickers so he purchased the first pair of unrespectable unankleconcealing trousers he had owned since small boyhood and a jacket of rough serge with a gaudy buckle on the belt  also he actually dared an orange tie  he wanted something for istra at dinnera sprise he whispered under his breath with fond babying  for the first time in his life he entered a florists shop  normally you know the poor of the city cannot afford flowers till they are dead and then for but one day  he came out with a bunch of orchids and remembered the days when he had envied the people he had seen in florists shops actually buying flowers  when he was almost at the caravanserai he wanted to go back and change the orchids for simpler flowers roses or carnations but he got himself not to   the linen and glassware and silver of the caravanserai were almost as coarse as those of a temperance hotel for all the raftered ceiling and the etchings in the diningroom  hunting up the stewardess of the inn a bustling young woman who was reading keats energetically at an officelike desk mr wrenn begged  i wonder could i get some special cups and plates and stuff for high tea tonight  i got a kind of party  how many  the stewardess issued the words as though he had put a penny in the slot  just two  kind of a birthday party  mendacious mr wrenn  certainly  of course theres a small extra charge  i have a royal satsuma teaservicepractically royal satsuma at leastand some special limoges  i think royal satsma would be nice  and some silverware  surely  and could we get some special stuff to eat  what would you like  why  mendacious mr wrenn as we have commented  he put his head on one side rubbed his chin with nice consideration and condescended  what would you suggest  for a party high tea  why perhaps consomme and omelet bergerac and a salad and a sweet and cafe diable  we have a chef who does french eggs rather remarkably  that would be simple but  yes that would be very good gravely granted the patron of cuisine  at six for two  as he walked away he grinned within  gee i talked to that omelet berg rac like id known it all my life  other sprises for istras party he sought  lets see suppose it really were her birthday wouldnt she like to have a letter from some important guy  he queried of himself  hed write her a makeblieve letter from a duke  which he did purchasing a stamp he humped over a desk in the common room and with infinite pains he inked the stamp in imitation of a postmark and addressed the letter to lady istra nash mouse castle suffolk  some one sat down at the desk opposite him and he jealously carried the task upstairs to his room  he rang for pen and ink as regally as though he had never sat at the wrong end of a buzzer  after half an hour of trying to visualize a duke writing a letter he produced this   lady istra nash           mouse castle  dear madamwe hear from our friend sir william wrenn that some folks are saying that today is not your birthday  want to stop your celebration so if you should need somebody to make them believe today is your birthday we have sent our secretary sir percival montague  sir william wrenn will hide him behind his chair and if they bother you just call for sir percival and he will tell them  permit us dear lady nash to wish you all the greetings of the season and in close we beg to remain as ever                               yours sincerely                                         duke vere de vere   he was very tired  when he lay down for a minute with a pillow tucked over his head he was almost asleep in ten seconds  but he sprang up washed his prickly eyes with cold water and began to dress  he was shy of the knickers and golfstockings but it was the orange tie that gave him real alarm  he dared it though and went downstairs to make sure they were setting the table with glory befitting the party  as he went through the common room he watched the three or four groups scattered through it  they seemed to take his clothes as a matter of course  he was glad  he wanted so much to be a credit to istra  returning from the diningroom to the common room he passed a group standing in a window recess and looking away from him he overheard  who is the remarkable new person with the orange tie and the rococo buckle on his jacket beltthe one that just went through  did you ever see anything so funny  his collar didnt come within an inch and a half of fitting his neck  he must be a poet  i wonder if his verses are as jerrybuilt as his garments  mr wrenn stopped  another voice  and the beautiful lack of development of his legs  its like the good old cycling days when every drapers assistant went bankholidaying  i dont know him but i suppose hes some tuppenyhapny illustrator  or perhaps he has convictions about fried bananas and dines on a bean saute  o aengusmere  shades of aengus  not at all  when they look as gentle as he they always hate the capitalists as a militant hates a cabinet minister  he probably dines on the left ear of a southafrican millionaire every evening before exercise at the barricades  i say look over there theres a real artist going across the green  you can tell hes a real artist because hes dressed like a navvy and  mr wrenn was walking away across the common room quite sure that every one was eying him with amusement  and it was too late to change his clothes  it was six already  he stuck out his jaw and remembered that he had planned to hide the letter from the duke in istras napkin that it might be the greater surprise  he sat down at their table  he tucked the letter into the napkin folds  he moved the vase of orchids nearer the center of the table and the table nearer the open window giving on the green  he rebuked himself for not being able to think of something else to change  he forgot his clothes and was happy  at sixfifteen he summoned a boy and sent him up with a message that mr wrenn was waiting and high tea ready  the boy came back muttering miss nash left this note for you sir the stewardess says  mr wrenn opened the greenandwhite caravanserai letter excitedly  perhaps istra too was dressing for the party he loved all sprises just then  he read   mouse dear im sorrier than i can tell you but you know i warrned you that bad istra was a creature of moods and just now my mood orders me to beat it for paris which im doing on the 517 train  i wont say goodbyi hate goodbys theyre so stupid dont you think  write me some time better make it care amer express co paris because i dont know yet just where ill be  and please dont look me up in paris because its always better to end up an affair without explanations dont you think  you have been wonderfully kind to me and ill send you some good thoughtforms shall i                                                   i n   he walked to the office of the caravanserai blindly quietly he paid his bill and found that he had only fifty dollars left he could not get himself to eat the waiting high tea  there was a sevenfourteen train for london  he took it  meantime he wrote out a cable to his new york bank for a hundred and fifty dollars  to keep from thinking in the train he talked gravely and gently to an old man about the brave days of england when men threw quoits  he kept thinking over and over to the tune set by the rattling of the train trucks  friends  i got to make friends now i know what they are  funny some guys dont make friends  mustnt forget  got to make lots of em in new york  learn how to make em  he arrived at his room on tavistock place about eleven and tried to think for the rest of the night of how deeply he was missing morton of the cattleboat now thatnow that he had no friend in all the hostile world   in a london  a b c restaurant mr wrenn was talking to an american who had a clipped mustache brisk manners a knightofpythias pin and a mind for duckshooting hardwareselling and cigars  no more england for mine the american snapped goodhumoredly  im going to get out of this foggy hole and get back to gods country just as soon as i can  i want to find out whats doing at the store and i want to sit down to a plate of flapjacks  im good and plenty sick of tea and marmalade  why i wouldnt take this fool country for a gift  no sir  me for gods countrysleepy eye brown county minnesota you bet  you dont like england much then mr wrenn carefully reasoned  like it  like this damp crowded hole where they cant talk english and have a fool coinagesay thats a great system that metric system theyve got over in france but herewhy they dont know whether kansas city is in kansas or missouri or both right as rainthats what a fellow said to me for all right  ever hear such nonsense  and tea for breakfast not for me  no sir  im going to take the first steamer  with a gigantic smokepuff of disgust the man from sleepy eye stalked out jingling the keys in his trousers pocket cocking up his cigar and looking as though he owned the restaurant  mr wrenn picturing him greeting the singer tower from an incoming steamer longed to see the tower  gee ill do it  he rose and from that table in the basement of an a b c restaurant he fled to america  he dashed upstairs fidgeted while the cashier made his change rang for a bus whisked into his room slammed his things into his suitcase announced to it wildly that they were going home and scampered to the northwestem station  he walked nervously up and down till the liverpool train departed  suppose istra wanted to make up and came back to london was a terrifying thought that hounded him  he dashed into the waitingroom and wrote to her on a souvenir postcard showing the abbey  called back to americawill write  address care of souvenir company twentyeighth street  but he didnt mail the card  once settled in a secondclass compartment with the train in motion he seemed already much nearer america and humming to the great annoyance of a lady with bangs he planned his new great workthe making of friends the discovery some day if istra should not relent of somebody to go home to  there was no end to the societies and lodges and stuff he was going to join directly he landed  at liverpool he suddenly stopped at a postbox and mailed his card to istra  that ended his debate  of course after that he had to go back to america  he sailed exultantly one month and seventeen days after leaving portland       chapter xii  he discovers america      in his whitepainted steerage berth mr wrenn lay with a scratchpad on his raised knees and a small mean pillow doubled under his head writing sample followup letters to present to the souvenir and art novelty company interrupting his work at intervals to add to a list of the books which beginning about five minutes after he landed in new york he was going to master  he puzzled over marie corelli  morton liked miss corelli so much but would her works appeal to istra nash  he had worked for many hours on a letter to istra in which he avoided mention of such indecent matters as steerages and immigrants  he was grateful he told her for all you learned me and he had thought that aengusmere was a beautiful place though he now saw what you meant about them interesting people and his new york address would be the souvenir company  he tore up the several pages that repeated that oldest most melancholy cry of the lover which rang among the deodars from viking ships from the moonlit courtyards of provence the cry which always sounded about mr wrenn as he walked the deck i want you so much i miss you so unendingly i am so lonely for you dear  for no more clearly no more nobly did the golden aucassin or lean dante word that cry in their thoughts than did mr william wrenn our mr wrenn  a thirdclass steward with a mangy mustache and setterlike tan eyes came teetering downstairs each step like a nervous pencil tap on a table and peered over the side of mr wrenns berth  he loved mr wrenn who was proven a scholar by the reading of real bound booksan english history and a secondhand copy of haunts of historic english writers purchased in liverpooland who was willing to listen to the stewards serial story of how his woman mrs wargle faithlessly consorted with foddle the catsmeat man when the steward was away and when he was home cooked for him lights and liver that unquestionably were purchased from the same catsmeat man  he now leered with a fond and watery gaze upon mr wrenns scholarly pursuits and announced in a whisper  theyve sighted land  land  oh aye  mr wrenn sat up so vigorously that he bumped his head he chucked his papers beneath the pillow with his right hand while the left was feeling for the side of the berth land he bellowed to drowsing cabinmates as he vaulted out  the steerage promenadedeck ironsided blackfloored ending in the iron approaches to the galley at one end and the iron superstructures about a hatch at the other was like a grim swart oilily clean machineshop aisle so inclosed so overroofed that the side toward the sea seemed merely a long factory window  but he loved it and except when he had guiltily remembered the books he had to read he had stayed on deck worshiping the naive bright attire of immigrants and the dark roll and glory of the sea  now out there was a blue shading made by a magic pencil land his land where he was going to become the beloved comrade of all the friends whose likenesses he saw in the whitecaps flashing before him  humming he paraded down to the buffet where small beer and smaller tobacco were sold to buy another pound of striped candy for the offspring of the russian jews  the children knew he was coming  fat rascals he chuckled touching their dark cheeks pretending to be frightened as they pounded soft fists against the iron side of the ship or rolled unregarded in the scuppers  their shawled mothers knew him too and as he shyly handed about the candy the chattering stately line of jewish elders nodded their beards like the forest primeval in a breeze saying words of blessing in a strange tongue  he smiled back and made gestures and shouted  land  land with several variations in key to make it sound foreign  but he withdrew for the sacred moment of seeing the land of promise he was newly discoveringthe long island shore the grassclad redouts at fort wadsworth the vast pile of new york skyscrapers standing in a mist like an enormous burned forest  singer tower  butterick building he murmured as they proceeded toward their dock  thats something like  lets see yes sir by golly right up there between the met  tower and the timesgood old souvenir company office  jiminy  one dollar to albanysomething like a sign that isgood old dollar  to thunder with their darn shillings  home  gee theres where i used to moon on a wharf  gosh the old town looks good  and all this was his to conquer for friendships sake  he went to a hotel  while he had to go back to the zapps of course he did not wish by meeting those old friends to spoil his first day  no it was cheerfuler to stand at a window of his cheap hotel on seventh avenue watching the good old american crowdgermans irishmen italians and jews  he went to the nickelorion and grasped the hand of the tickettaker the brassbutton man ejaculating  how are you  well hows things going with the old show  i been away couple of months  fine and dandy  been away uh  well its good to get back to the old town heh  summer hotel  unk  why youre the waiter at pat maloneys aint you  next morning mr wrenn made himself go to the souvenir and art novelty company  he wanted to get the teasing due him for staying away so short a time over as soon as possible  the office girl addressing circulars seemed surprised when he stepped from the elevator and blushed her usual shy gratitude to the men of the office for allowing her to exist and take away six dollars weekly  then into the entryroom ran rabin one of the traveling salesmen  why hullo wrenn  wondered if that could be you  back so soon  thought you were going to europe  just got back  couldnt stand it away from you old scout  you must have been learning to sass back real smart in the old country heh  going to be with us again  well see you again soon  glad see you back  he was not madly excited at seeing rabin still the drummer was part of the good old souvenir company the one place in the world on which he could absolutely depend the one place where they always wanted him  he had been absently staring at the sampletables noting new novelties  the office girl speaking sweetly but as to an outsider inquired  who did you wish to see mr wrenn  why mr guilfogle  hes busy but if youll sit down i think you can see him in a few minutes  mr wrenn felt like the prodigal son with no calf in sight at having to wait on the callers bench but he shook with faint excited gurgles of mirth at the thought of the delightful surprise mr mortimer

leaving a good job  you didnt get on the continent did you  no i  well  oh say hows the grub in london  cheaper than it is here  the wife was saying this morning wed have to stop eating if the high cost of living goes on going up  yes its quite a little cheaper  you can get fine tea for two and three cents a cup  clothes is cheaper too  but i dont care much for the english though there is all

watch out for him  oh i will indeed i will  did he spring any of this fairy tale just now  well kind of  say thanks im awful obliged to  say for the love of mike dont let him know i told you  no no i sure wont  they parted  eager though he was for the great moment of again seeing his comrade charley carpenter mr wrenn dribbled toward the bookkeepingroom mournfully planning to tell charley of guilfogles wickedness  the head bookkeeper shook his head at mr wrenns inquiry  charley aint here any longer  aint here  no  he got through  he got to boozing pretty bad and one morning about three weeks ago when he had a pretty bad hangover he told guilfogle what he thought of him so of course guilfogle fired him  oh thats too bad  say you dont know his address do you  east a hundred and eighteenth  well im glad to see you back wrenn  didnt expect to see you back so soon but always glad to see you  going to be with us  i aint sure said mr wrenn crabbedly then shook hands warmly with the bookkeeper to show there was nothing personal in his snippishness  for nearly a hundred blocks mr wrenn scowled at an advertisement of corn flakes in the third avenue elevated without really seeing it  should he go back to the souvenir company at all  yes  he would  that was the best way to start making friends but he would get our friend guilfogle at recess he assured himself with an outthrust of the jaw like that of the great bill wrenn  he knew guilfogles lead now and he would show that gentleman that he could play the game  hed take that lower salary and pretend to be frightened but when he got the chance  he did not proclaim even to himself what dreadful thing he was going to do but as he left the elevated he said over and over shaking his closed fist inside his coat pocket  when i get the chancewhen i get it   the flatbuilding where charley carpenter lived was one of hundreds of pressedbrick structures apparently all turned out of the same mold  it was filled with the smells of steamy washing and fried fish  languid with the heat mr wrenn crawled up an infinity of iron steps and knocked three times at charleys door  no answer  he crawled down again and sought out the janitress who stopped watching an icewagon in the street to say  i guess youll be finding him asleep up there sir  he do be lying there drunk most of the day  his wifes left him  the landlords give him notice to quit end of august  warm day sir  be you a billcollector  mostly its billcollectors that  yes it is hot  superior in manner but deeply dejected mr wrenn rang the downstairs bell long enough to wake charley pantingly got himself up the interminable stairs and kicked the door till charleys voice quavered inside  who zhat  its me charley  wrenn  youre in yurp  cant fool me  g way from there  three other doors on the same landing were now partly open and blocked with the heads of frowsy inquisitive women  the steamy smell was thicker in the darkness  mr wrenn felt prickly then angry at this curiosity and again demanded  lemme in i say  tell you it aint you  i know you  charley carpenters pale face leered out  his tousled hair was stuck to his forehead by perspiration his eyes were red and vaguely staring  his clothes were badlv wrinkled  he wore a collarless shirt with a frilled bosom of virulent pink its cuffs grimy and limp  its ol wrenn  cm in  cm in quick  collectors always hanging around  they cant catch me  you bet  he closed the door and wabbled swiftly down the long drab hall of the railroad flat evidently trying to walk straight  the reeking stifling main room at the end of the hall was terrible as charleys eyes  flies boomed everywhere  the oak table which charley and his bride had once spent four happy hours in selecting was littered with half a dozen empty whiskyflasks collars torn sensational newspapers dirty plates and coffeecups  the cheap brocade cover which a bride had once joyed to embroider with red and green roses was half pulled off and dragged on the floor amid the cigarette butts durham tobacco and bacon rinds which covered the greenandyellow carpetrug  this much mr wrenn saw  then he set himself to the hard task of listening to charley who was muttering  back quick aint you ol wrenn  you come up to see me didnt you  youre m friend aint you eh  i got an awful hangover aint i  you dont care do you ol wrenn  mr wrenn stared at him weakly but only for a minute perhaps it was his cattleboat experience which now made him deal directly with such drunkenness as would have nauseated him three months before perhaps his attendance on a weary istra  come now charley you got to buck up he crooned  all ri  whats the trouble  how did you get going like this  wife left me  i was drinking  you think im drunk dont you but i aint  she went off with her sisteralways hated me  she took my money out of savingsbankthree hundred all money i had cept fifty dollars  ill fix her  ill kill her  took to hitting the booze  goglefogle fired me  dont care  drink all i want  keep young fellows from getting it  say go down and get me pint  just finished up pint  got to have onedie of thirst  bourbon  get  ill go and get you a drink charleyjust one drink savvyif youll promise to get cleaned up like i tell you afterward  all ri  mr wrenn hastened out with a whiskyflask muttering feverishly gee i got to save him returning he poured out one drink as though it were medicine for a refractory patient and said soothingly  now well take a cold bath heh  and get cleaned up and sobered up  then well talk about a job heh  aw dont want a bath  say i feel better now  lets go out and have a drink  gimme that flask  where j yuh put it  mr wrenn went to the bathroom turned on the coldwater tap returned and undressed charley who struggled and laughed and let his whole inert weight rest against mr wrenns shoulder though normally charley could have beaten three mr wrenns he was run into the bathroom and poked into the tub  instantly he began to splash throwing up water in handfuls singing  the water poured over the side of the tub  mr wrenn tried to hold him still but the wet sleek shoulders slipped through his hand like a wet platter  wholesomely vexed he turned off the water and slammed the bathroom door  in the bedroom he found an unwrinkled winterweight suit and one clean shirt  in the livingroom he hung up his coat covering it with a newspaper pulled the broom from under the table and prepared to sweep  the disorder was so great that he made one of the inevitable discoveries of every housekeeper and admitted to himself that he  didnt know where to begin  he stumblingly lugged a heavy pile of dishes from the centertable to the kitchen shook and beat and folded the tablecover stuck the chairs atop the table and began to sweep  at the door a shining wet naked figure stood bellowing  hey  what d yuh think youre doing  cut it out  just sweeping charley from mr wrenn and an uninterrupted tuff tuff tuff from the broom  cut it out i said  whose house is this  gwan back in the bathtub charley  say d yuh think you can run me  get out of this or ill throw you out  got house way i want it  bill wrenn the cattleman rushed at him smacked him with the broom drove him back into the tub and waited  he laughed it was all a good joke his friend charley and he were playing a little game  charley also laughed and splashed some more then he wept and said that the water was cold and that he was now deserted by his only friend  oh shut up remarked bill wrenn and swept the bathroom floor  charley stopped swashing about to sneer  lil ministering angel aint you  you think youre awful good dont you  come up here and bother me  when i aint well salvation army  you  aw lemme lone will you  bill wrenn kept on sweeping  get out you  there was enough energy in charleys voice to indicate that he was getting sober  bill wrenn soused him under once more so thoroughly that his own cuffs were reduced to a state of flabbiness  he dragged charley out helped him dry himself and drove him to bed  he went out and bought dishtowels soap washingpowder and collars of charleys size which was an inch larger than his own he finished sweeping and dusting and washing the dishesall of them  hewho had learned to comfort istrahe really enjoyed it  his sense of order made it a pleasure to see a plate yellow with dried egg glisten iridescently and flash into shining whiteness or a room corner filled with dust and tobacco flakes become again a nice square clean corner with the baseboard shining gee just like it was new  an irate grocer called with a bill for fifteen dollars  mr wrenn blandly heard his threats all through pretending to himself that this was his home whose honor was his honor he paid the man eight dollars on account and loftily dismissed him he sat down to wait for charley reading a newspaper most of the time but rising to pursue stray flies furiously stumbling over chairs and making murderous flappings with a folded newspaper  when charley awoke after three hours clear of mind but not at all clear as regards the roof of his mouth mr wrenn gave him a very little whisky with considerable coffee toast and bacon the toast was not bad  now charley he said cheerfully your bats over aint it old man  say you been darn decent to me old man  lord how youve been sweeping up  how was iwas i pretty soused  honest you were fierce  you will sober up now wont you  well its no wonder i had a classy hangover wrenn  i was at the amusieren

ill be down tonight  and ill get right after that job  it is doubtful whether mr wrenn would ever have returned to the zapps had he not promised to see charley there even while he was carrying his suitcase down west sixteenth broiling by degrees in the sunshine he felt like rushing up to charleys and telling him to come to the hotel instead  lee theresa taking the day off with a headache answered the bell and ejaculated  well  so its you is it  i guess it is  what are you back so soon  why you aint been gone more than a month and a half have you  beware daughter of southern pride  the little yankee is regarding your fullblown curves and empty eyes with rebellion though he says ever so meekly  yes i guess it is about that miss theresa  well i just knew you couldnt stand it away from us i suppose youll want your room back  ma heres mr wrenn back againmr wrenn  ma  ohhhh sounded goaty zapps voice in impish disdain below  mr wrenns back  hee hee  couldnt stand it  aint that like a yankee  a slap a wail then mrs zapps elephantine slowness on the stairs from the basement  she appeared buttoning her collar smiling almost pleasantly for she disliked mr wrenn less than she did any other of her lodgers  back already mist wrenn  ah declare ah was saying to lee theresa just yestday ah just knew youd be wishing you was back with us  wont you come in  he edged into the parlor with how is the sciatica mrs zapp  ah aint feeling right smart  my room occupied yet  he was surveying the airless parlor rather heavily and his curt manner was not pleasing to the head of the house of zapp who remarked funereally  it aint taken just now mist wrenn but ah dunno there was a gennulman alooking at it just yesterday and he said hed be permanent if he came  ah declare mist wrenn ah dunnos ah like to have my gennulmen just get up and go without giving me notice  lee theresa scowled at her  mr wrenn retorted i did give you notice  ah know butwell ah reckon ah can let you have it but ahll have to have four and a half a week instead of four  prices is all going up so ah declare ah was just saying to lee tresa ah dunno what were all going to do if the dear lord dont look out for us  and mist wrenn ah dunnos ah like to have you coming in so late nights  but ah reckon ah can accommodate you  its a good deal of a favor isnt it mrs zapp  mr wrenn was dangerously polite  let gentility look out for the sharp practices of the yankee  yes but  it was our hero our madman of the seven and seventy seas our revolutionist friend of istra who leaped straight from the saltincrusted decks of his laboring steamer to the musty parlor and declared quietly but unmovablypractically unmovablywell then i guess id better not take it at all  so thats the way youre going to treat us bellowed mrs zapp  you go off and leave us with an unoccupied room and oh  you poor white trashyou  ma  you shut up and go downstairsssss theresa hissed go on  mrs zapp wabbled regally out  lee theresa spoke to mr wrenn  ma aint feeling a bit well this afternoon  im sorry she talked like that  you will come back wont you  she showed all her teeth in a genuine smile and in her anxiety reached his heart  remember you promised you would  well i will but  bill wrenn was fading an affrighted specter  the but was the last glimpse of him and that theresa overlooked as she bustlingly chirruped  i knew you would understand  ill skip right up and look at the room and put on fresh sheets   one month one hot new york month passed before the imperial mr guilfogle gave him back the job and then at seventeen dollars and fifty cents a week instead of his former nineteen dollars  mr wrenn refused upon pretexts to go out with the manager for a drink and presented him with twenty suggestions for new novelties and circular letters  he rearranged the unsystematic methods of jake the cub and two days later he was at work as though he had never in his life been farther from the souvenir company than newark       chapter xiii  he is our mr wrenn      dear istrai am back in new york feeling very well  hope this finds you the same  i have been wanting to write to you for quite a while now but there has not been much news of any kind  so i have not written to you  but now i am back working for the souvenir company  i hope you are having a good time in paris it must be a very pretty city  i have often wished to be there perhaps some day i shall go  i several erasures here have been reading quite a few books since i got back  think now i shall get on better with my reading  you told me so many things about books  so on  i do appreciate it  in closing i am yours very sincerely                                              william wrenn   there was nothing else he could say  but there were a terrifying number of things he could think as he crouched by the window overlooking west sixteenth street whose dull hue had not changed during the centuries while he had been tramping england her smile he rememberedand he cried  oh i want to see her so much  her gallant dash through the rainand again the cry  at last he cursed himself why dont you do something that d count for her and not sit around yammering for her like a fool  he worked on his plan to bring the south into linethe souvenir companys line  again and again he sprang up from the writingtable in his hot room when the presence of istra came and stood compellingly by his chair  but he worked  the souvenir company salesmen had not been able to get from the south the business which the company deserved if right and justice were to prevail  on the steamer from england mr wrenn had conceived the idea that a dixieland inkwell with the confederate and union flags draped in graceful cast iron would make an admirable present with which to draw the attention of the southem trade  the inkwell was to be followed by a series of letters sent on the slightest provocation on order or reorder tactfully hoping the various healths of the southland were good and the baseball season important all to insure a welcome to the salesmen on the southem route  he drew up his letters he sketched his inkwell he got up the courage to talk with the office manager  to forget love and the beloved men have ascended in aeroplanes and conquered african tribes  to forget love a new busy much absorbed mr wrenn very much ours bustled into mr guilfogles office slapped down his papers on the desk and demanded  heres that plan about gettin the south interested that i was telling you about  say honest id like awful much to try it on  id just have to have part time of one stenographer  well you know our stenographers are pretty well crowded but you can leave the outline with me  ill look it over said mr guilfogle  that same afternoon the manager enthusiastically o kd the plan  to enthusiasticallyo k is an office technology for saying gloomily  well i dont suppose it d hurt to try it anyway but for the love of mike be careful and let me see any letters you send out  so mr wrenn dictated a letter to each of their southern merchants sending him a dixieland inkwell and inquiring about the crops  he had a stenographer an efficient intolerant young woman who wrote down his halting words as though they were examples of bad english she wanted to show her friends and waited for the next word with cynical amusement  by gosh growled bill wrenn the cattleman ill show her im running this  ill show her shes got another think coming but he dictated so busily and was so hot to get results that he forgot the girls air of highclass martyrdom  he watched the southern baseball results in the papers  he seized on every salesman on the southern route as he came in and inquired about the religion and politics of the merchants in his district  he even forgot to worry about his next rise in salary and found it much more exciting to rush back for an important letter after a quick lunch than to watch the time and make sure that he secured every minute of his lunchhour  when october cameoctober of the vagabond with the leaves brilliant out on the palisades and sixth avenue movingpicture palaces cool again and gaymr wrenn stayed late under the mercuryvapor lights making card crossfiles of the southern merchants their hobbies and prejudices and whistling as he worked stopping now and then to slap the desk and mutter by gosh im gettin emgettin em  he rarely thought of istra till he was out on the street again proud of having worked so late that his eyes ached  in fact his chief troubles these days came when mr guilfogle wouldnt let him put through an idea  their first battle was over mr wrenns signing the letters personally for the letters the office manager felt were as much ours as was mr wrenn and should be signed by the firm after some difficulty mr wrenn persuaded him that one of the best ways to handle a personal letter was to make it personal they nearly cursed each other before mr wrenn was allowed to use his own judgment  its not at all certain that mr guilfogle should have yielded whats the use of a manager if his underlings use judgment  the next battle mr wrenn lost  he had demanded a monthly holiday for his stenographer  mr guilfogle pointed out that shed merely be the worse off for a holiday that it d make her discontented that it was a kindness to her to keep her mind occupied  mr wrenn was however granted a new typewriter in a manner which revealed the fact that the souvenir company was filled with almost too much mercy in permitting an employee to follow his own selfish and stubborn desires  you cannot trust these employees  mr wrenn was getting so absorbed in his work that he didnt even act as though it was a favor when mr guilfogle allowed him to have his letters to the trade copied by carbon paper instead of having them blurred by the wet tissuepaper of a copybook  the manager did grant the request but he was justly indignant at the curt manner of the rascal whereupon our bumptious revolutionist our friend to anarchists and redheaded artists demanded a raise and said that he didnt care a hang if the qualified letters never went out  the kindness of chiefs  for mr guilfogle apologized and raised the madmans wage from seventeen dollars and fifty cents a week to his former nineteen dollars  he had expected eighteen dollars he had demanded twentytwo dollars and fifty cents he was worth on the labor market from twentyfive to thirty dollars while the profit to the souvenir company from his work was about sixty dollars minus whatever salary he got  not only that  mr guilfogle slapped him on the back and said youre doing good work old man  its fine  i just dont want you to be too reckless  that night wrenn worked till eight  after his raise he could afford to go to the theater since he was not saving money for travel  he wrote small letters to istra and read the books he believed she would approvea paris baedeker and the second volume of tolstois war and peace which he bought at a secondhand bookstall for five cents he became interested in popular and inaccurate french and english histories and secreted any amount of footnote anecdotes about guy fawkes and rushlights and the divine right of kings he thought almost every night about making friends which he intendedjust as much as everto do as soon as sometime arrived  on the day on which one of the southern merchants wrote him about his sonfine young fellow sirhas every chance of rising to a lieutenancy on the atlanta police forcemr wrenns eyes were moist  here was a friend already  sure  he would make friends  then there was the cripple with the capitol corner news and souvenir stand in austin texas  mr wrenn secreted two extra dixieland inkwells and a yale football banner and sent them to the cripple for his brothers who were in the agricultural college  the ordersyes they were growing larger  the southern salesmen took him out to dinner sometimes  but he was shy of them  they were so knowing and had so many smokingroom stories  he still had not found the friends he desired   miggletons restaurant on fortysecond street was a romantic discovery  though it had popular pricesplain omelet fifteen centsit had red and green bracket lights missionstyle tables and music played by a sparrowlike pianist and a violinist  mr wrenn never really heard the music but while it was quavering he had a happier appreciation of the silkhatharry humorous pictures in the journal which he always propped up against an oilcruet  that never caused him inconvenience he had no convictions in regard to salads he would drop the paper to look out of the window at the lazydays improvement companys electric sign showing gardens of paradise on the instalment plan and dream ofwell he hadnt the slightest idea whatsomething distant and deliciously likely to become intimate  once or twice he knew that he was visioning the girl in soft brown whom he would go home to and who in a lazydays suburban residence would play just such music for him and the friends who lived near by  she would be as clever as istra but oh more sos you can go regular places with her  often he got good ideas about letters south to be jotted down on envelope backs from that music  at last comes the historic matchbox incident  on that october evening in 1910 he dined early at miggletons the thirtycent table dhote was perfect  the creamofcorn soup was he went so far as to remark to the waitress simply slick the waldorf salad had two whole walnuts in his portion alone  the fat man with the white waistcoat whom he had often noted as dining in this same corner of the restaurant smiled at him and said pleasant evening as he sat down opposite mr wrenn and smoothed the two sleek bangs which decorated the front of his nearly bald head  the music included a potpourri of airs from the merry widow which set his foot tapping  all the while he was conscious that hed made the seattle novelty and stationery corner store come through with a fivehundreddollar order on one of his letters  the journal contained an editorial essay on friendship which would have been and was a credit to cicero  he laid down the paper stirred his large cup of coffee and stared at the motherofpearl buttons on the waistcoat of the fat man who was now gulping down soup opposite him  my land he was thinking friendship  i aint even begun to make all those friends i was going to  havent done a thing oh i will i must  nice night said the fat man  yuhit sure is brightly agreed mr wrenn  reglar indiansummer weather  yes isnt it i feel like taking a walk on riverside driveblieve i will  wish i had time  but i gotta get down to the storecigarstore  im on nights three times a week  yuh  ive seen you here most every time i eat early mr wrenn purred  yuh  the rest of the time i eat at the boardinghouse  silence  but mr wrenn was fighting for things to say means of approach for the chance to become acquainted with a new person for all the friendly human ways he had desired in nights of loneliness  wonder when theyll get the grand central done asked the fat man  i spose itll take quite a few years said mr wrenn conversationally  yuh  i spose it will  silence  mr wrenn sat trying to think of something else to say  lonely people in city restaurants simply do not get acquainted  yet he did manage to observe  great building thatll be in the friendliest manner  silence  then the fat man went on  wonder what wolgast will do in his mill  dont believe he can stand up  wolgast was mr wrenn seemed to remember a pugilist  he agreed vaguely  pretty hard all right  go out to the areoplane meet asked the fat man  no  but id like to see it  gee there must be kind ofkind of adventure in them things heh  yuhsure is  first machine i saw thoughi was just getting off the train at belmont park and there was an areoplane up in the air and it looked like one of them big mechanical beetles these fellows sell on the street buzzing around up there  i was kind of disappointed  but what do you think  it was that j a d mccurdy in a curtiss biplanei think it wasand by golly he got to circling around and racing and tipping sos i thought id loose my hat off i was so excited  and say what do you think  i see mccurdy himself afterward standing near one of thethe handgarshandsome young chap not over twentyeight or thirty built like a halfmiler  and then i see ralph johnstone and arch hoxey  gee mr wrenn was breathing  dipping and doing thewhat do you call itdutch sausageroll or something like that  yelled my head off  oh it must have been great to see em and so close too  yuhit sure was  there seemed to be no other questions to settle  mr wrenn slowly folded up his paper pursued his check under three plates and the menucard to its hidingplace beyond the catsupbottle and left the table with a regretful good night  at the desk of the cashier a decorative blonde he put a cent in the machine which goodnaturedly drops out boxes of matches no box dropped this time though he worked the lever noisily  out of order asked the cashier lady  heres two boxes of matches  guess youve earned them  well well well well sounded the voice of his friend the fat man who stood at the desk paying his bill  pretty easy heh  two boxes for one cent  sting the restaurant  cocking his head he carefully inserted a cent in the slot and clattered the lever turning to grin at mr wrenn who grinned back as the machine failed to work  let me try it caroled mr wrenn and pounded the lever with the enthusiasm of comradeship  nothing doing lady crowed the fat man to the cashier  i guess i draw two boxes too eh  and im in a cigarstore hows that for stinging your competitors heh  ho ho ho  the cashier handed him two boxes with an embarrassed simper and the fat man clapped mr wrenns shoulder joyously  my turn shouted a young man in a fuzzy green hat and a brightbrown suit who had been watching with the sudden friendship which unites a crowd brought together by an accident  mr wrenn was glowing  no it aintits mine he achieved i invented this game  never had he so stood forth in a crowd he was a bill wrenn with the cosmopolitan polish of a floorwalker  he stood beside the fat man as a friend of sorts a person to be taken perfectly seriously  it is true that he didnt add to this spiritual triumph the triumph of getting two more boxes of matches for the cashiergirl exclaimed  no indeedy its my turn and lifted the match machine to a high shelf behind her  but mr wrenn went out of the restaurant with his old friend the fat man saying to him quite as would a wit i guess we get stung eh  yuh gurgled the fat man  walking down to your store  yuhsurewont you walk down a piece  yes i would like to  which way is it  fourth avenue and twentyeighth  walk down with you  fine  and the fat man seemed to mean it  he confided to mr wrenn that the fishing was something elegant at trulen new jersey that he was some punkins at the casting of flies in fishing that he wished exceedingly to be at trulen fishing with flies but was prevented by the manager of the cigarstore that the manager was an old devil that his the fat mans own name was tom poppins that the store had a slick new brand of manila cigars kept in a swell new humidor bought upon the advice of himself mr poppins that one of the young clerks in the store had done fine in the modified marathon that the cubs had had a great team this year that hed be glad to give mrmr wrenn ehone of those manila cigarsgreat cigars they were too and that he hadnt laughed so much for a month of sundays as he had over the way they stung miggletons on them matches  all this in the easy affectionate slightly wistful manner of fat men  mr poppinss large round friendly childish eyes were never sarcastic  he was the man who makes of a crowd in the pullman smokingroom old friends in half an hour  in turn mr wrenn did not shy off he hinted at most of his lifelong ambitions and a fair number of his sorrows and when they reached the store not only calmly accepted but even sneezingly ignited one of the slick new manila cigars  as he left the store he knew that the golden age had begun he had a friend  he was to see tom poppins the coming thursday at miggletons and now he was going to find morton  he laughed so loudly that the policeman at thirtyfourth street looked selfconscious and felt secretively to find out what was the matter with his uniform  now this evening hed try to get on the track of morton  well perhaps not this eveningthe pennsylvania offices wouldnt be open but some time this week anyway  two nights later as he waited for tom poppins at miggletons he lashed himself with the thought that he had not started to find morton good old morton of the cattleboat  but that was forgotten in the wonder of tom poppinss account of mrs artys a boardinghouse where all the folks likes each other  youve never fed at a boardinghouse eh said tom  well i guess most of em are pretty poor feed  and pretty sad bunch but mrs artys is about as near like home as most of us poor bachelors ever gets  nice crowd there  if mrs artymrs r t ferrard is her name but we always call her mrs artyif she dont take to you she dont mind letting you know she wont take you in at all but if she does shell worry over the holes in your socks as if they was her husbands  all the bunch there drop into the parlor when they come in pretty near any time clear up till twelvethirty and talk and laugh and rush the growler and play five hundred  just like home  mrs artys nearly as fat as i am but she can be pretty spry if theres something she can do for you  nice crowd there too except that teddemhes one of these here willyboy actors always out of work i guess mrs arty is kind of sorry for him say wrennyou seem to me like a good fellowwhy dont you get acquainted with the bunch  maybe youd like to move up there some time  you was telling me about what a cranky old party your landlady is  anyway come on up there to dinner  on me got anything on for next monday evening  nno  come on up theneast thirtieth  gee id like to  well why dont you then  get there about six  ask for me monday  monday wednesday and friday i dont have to get to the store evenings  come on youll find out if you like the place  by jiminy i will mr wrenn slapped the table socially   at last he was through just through with loafing around and not getting acquainted he told himself  he was tired of zapps  there was nothing to zapps  he would go up to mrs artys and nowhe was going to find morton  next morning marveling at himself for not having done this easy task before he telephoned to the pennsylvania railroad offices asked for morton and in onehalf minute heard  yes  this is harry morton  hullo mr morton ill just bet you cant guess who this is  i guess youve got me  well who do you think it  jack  hunka  uncle henry  nope  mr wrenn felt lonely at finding himself so completely outside mortons own world that he was not thought of he hastened to claim a part in that world  say mr morton i wonder if youve ever heard of a cattleboat called the merian  isay  is this bill wrenn  yes  well well well  where areyou  whend you get back  oh i been back quite a little while morty  tried to get hold of youalmost called up couple of times  im in my officesouvenir companynow  back on the old job  say id like to see you  well id like to see you old bill  got a date for dinner this evening morty  nno  no i dont think ive got anything on  mortons voice seemed to sound a doubt  mr wrenn reflected that morton must be a society person and he made his invitation highly polite  well say old man id be awful happy if you could come over and feed on me  cant you come over and meet me morty  yyes i guess i can  yes ill do it  wherell i meet you  how about twentyeighth and sixth avenue  thatll be all right bill  bout six oclock  fine  be awful nice to see you again old morty  same here  gooby   gazing across the table at miggletons mr wrenn saw in the squat familiar body and sturdy face of morton of the cattleboat a stranger slightly uneasy and very quiet wearing garments that had nothing whatever to do with the cattleboatsa crimson scarf with a horseshoepin of brazilian diamonds and sleek brown readymade clothes with ornately curved cuffs and pocket flaps  morton would say nothing of his wanderings after their parting in liverpool beyond  oh i just bummed around  places warm tonight  for this time of year  thrice he explained i was kind of afraid youd be sore at me for the way i left you thats why ive never looked you up  thrice mr wrenn declared that he had not been sore then ceased trying to make himself understood  their talk wilted  both of them played with their knives a good deal  morton built a set of triangles out of toothpicks while pretending to give hushed attention to the pianists rendition of mammys little cootsie bootsie coon while mr wrenn stared out of the window as though he expected to see the building across get afire immediately  when either of them invented something to say they started chattering with guilty haste and each agreed hectically with any opinion the other advanced  mr wrenn surprised himself in the thought that morton hadnt anything very new to say which made him feel so disloyal that he burst out effusively  say come on now old man i just got to hear about what you did after you left liverpool  i  well  i never got out of liverpool  worked in a restaurant  but next time  ill go clean to constantinople  morton exploded  and i did see a lot of english life in liverpool  mr wrenn talked long and rapidly of the worlds baseball series and regal vs  walkover shoes  he tried to think of something they could do  suddenly  say morty i know an awful nice guy down here in a cigarstore  lets go down and see him  all right  tom poppins was very cordial to them  he dragged brown canvas stools out of the tobaccoscented room where cigars were made and the three of them squatted in the back of the store while tom gossiped of the juarez races taft cigarwrappers and jews morton was aroused to tell the timemellowed story of the judge and the darky  he was cheerful and laughed much and frequently said ah there cull in general commendation  but he kept looking at the clock on the jog in the wall over the watercooler  just at ten he rose abashedly hesitated and murmured  well i guess ill have to be beating it home  from mr wrenn  oh morty  so early  tom  whats the big hurry  ive got to run clear over to jersey city  morton was cordial but not convincing  sayuhmorton said tom kindly of face his bald head shining behind his twin bangs as he rose im going to have wrenn up to dinner at my boardinghouse next monday  like to have you come along  its a fine placemrs artyshes the landladyshes a wonder  theres going to be a vacant room theremaybe you two fellows could frame it up to take it heh understand i dont get no rakeoff on this but we all like to do what we can for m  no no said morton  sorry  couldnt do it  staying with my brotherinlawcosts me only bout half as much as it would i dont do much chasing around when im in town  im going to save up enough money for a good long hike  im going clean to st petersburg  but ive had a good time tonight  glad  great stuff about you fellows on the cattleship said tom  morton hastened on protectively a bit critically  you fellows sport around a good deal dont you  i cant afford to well good night  glad to met you mr poppins  g night old wr  going to the ferry  for jersey  ill walk over with you said mr wrenn  their walk was quiet and for mr wrenn tragically sad  he saw morton presumably doing the wandering he had once planned  he felt that while making his vast new circle of friends he was losing all the wild adventurousness of bill wrenn  and he was parting with his first friend  at the ferryhouse morton pronounced his well so long old fellow with an affection that meant finality  mr wrenn fled back to tom poppinss store  on the way he was shocked to find himself relieved at having parted with morton the cigarstore was closed  at home mrs zapp waylaid him for his rent a day overdue and he was very curt  that was to keep back the o god how rotten i feel with which in his room he voiced the desolation of loneliness  the ghost of morton dead and forgotten was with him all next day till he got home and unbelievably found on the staid blackwalnut zapp hatrack a letter from paris in a gray foreignappearing envelope with istras intensely black scrawl on it  he put off the luxury of opening the letter till after the rites of brushing his teeth putting on his slippers pounding his rockingchair cushion into softness  panting with the joy to come he stared out of the window at a giant and glorious figure of istrathe laughing istra of breakfast campfirewhich towered from the street below  he sighed joyously and read   mouse dear just a word to let you know i havent forgotten you and am very glad indeed to get your letters  not much to write about  frightfully busy with work and fool parties  you are a dear good soul and i hope youll keep on writing me  in haste                                                        i n longer letter next time   he came to the end so soon  istra was gone again       chapter xiv  he enters society      england in all its istraness scarce gave mr wrenn a better thrill for his collection than the thrill he received on the november evening when he saw the white doorway of mrs r t ferrard in a decorous row of houses on thirtieth street near lexington avenue  it is a block where the citizens have civic pride  a newspaper has not the least chance of lying about on the asphaltsome householder with a frequently barbered mustache will indignantly pounce upon it inside of an hour  no awe  is caused by the sight of vestibules floored with marble in alternate black and white tiles scrubbed not by landladies but by maids  there are dotted swiss curtains at the basement windows and irish point curtains on the first floors  there are two polished brass doorplates in a stretch of less than eight houses distinctly it is not a quarter where children fill the street with shouting and little sticks  occasionally a taxicab drives up to some door without a crowd of small boys gathering and young men in evening clothes are not infrequently seen to take out young ladies wearing tightfitting gowns of black and light scarfs over their heads  a middle western college fraternity has a clubhouse in the block and four of the houses are privateone of them belonging to a police inspector and one to a school principal who wears spats  it is a block that is satisfied with itself as different from the zapp district where landladies in gingham run out to squabble with berryvenders as the zapp district is from the ghetto  mrs arty ferrards house is a poor relation to most of the residences there  the black areaway rail is broken and the basementdoor grill is rusty  but at the windows are redandwhitefigured chintz curtains with a 298 bisque figurine of an unclothed lady between them the door is of spotless white with a bellpull of polished brass  mr wrenn yanked this bellpull with an urbane briskness which he hoped would conceal his nervousness and delight in dining out  for he was one of the lonely men in new york  he had dined out four times in eight years  the woman of thirtyfive or thirtyeight who opened the door to him was very fat twothirds as fat as mrs zapp but she had young eyes  her mouth was small arched and quivering in a grin  this is mr wrenn isnt it she gurgled and leaned against the doorpost merry apparently indolent  im mrs ferrard mr poppins told me you were coming and he said you were a terribly nice man and i was to be sure and welcome you  come right in  her indolence turned to energy as she charged down the hall to the large double door on the right and threw it open revealing to him a scene of splendor and revelry by night  several persons they seemed dozens in their liveliness were singing and shouting to piano music in the midst of a general redness and brightness of furnishingsred paper and worn red carpet and a high ceiling with circular moldings tinted in pink handpainted pictures of old mills and ladies brooding over salmon sunsets and an especially handpainted christmas scene with snow of inlaid motherofpearl animated the walls  on a goldenoak centertable was a large lamp with a mosaic shade and through its mingled bits of green and red and pearl glass stormed the brilliance of a mantlelight  the room was crowded with tufted plush and imitationleather chairs sidetables and corner brackets a couch and a ladys desk  green and red and yellow vases adorned with figures of youthful lovers crammed the top of the piano at the farther end of the room and the polished blackmarble mantel of the fireplace  the glaring gas raced the hearthfire for snap and glare and excitement  the profusion of furniture was like a tumult the redness and oakness and polishedness of furniture was a dizzying activity and it was all overwhelmingly magnified by the laughter and singing about the piano  tom poppins lumbered up from a couch of terrifically new and red leather and mr wrenn was introduced to the five new people in the room with dismaying swiftness  there seemed to be fifty times five unapproachable and magnificent strangers from whom he wanted to flee  of them all he was sure of only twoa miss nelly somebody and what sounded like horatio hood tem teddem it was  he wished that he had caught miss nellys last name which at dinner proved to be croubel for he was instantly taken by her sweetness as she smiled held out a wellshaped hand and said so pleased meet you mr wrenn  she returned to the front of the room and went on talking to a lank spinster about ruchings but mr wrenn felt that he had known her long and as intimately as it was possible to know so clever a young woman  nelly croubel gave him the impression of a delicate prettiness a superior sort of prettiness like that of the daughter of the big white house on the hill the squires house at parthenon though nelly was not unusually pretty  indeed her mouth was too large her hair of somewhat ordinary brown  but her face was always changing with emotions of kindliness and life  her skin was perfect her features fine rather greek her smile quick yet sensitive  she was several inches shorter than mr wrenn and all curves  her blouse of white silk lay tenderly along the adorably smooth softness of her young shoulders  a smart patentleather belt encircled her sleek waist  thin black lisle stockings showed a modestly arched and rather small foot in a black pump  she looked as though she were trained for business awake selfreliant selfrespecting expecting to have to get things done all done yet she seemed indestructibly gentle indestructibly good and believing and just a bit shy  nelly croubel was twentyfour or twentyfive in years older in business and far younger in love  she was born in uptons grove pennsylvania  there for eighteen years she had played skip to malue at parties hid away the notes with which the boys invited her to picnics at baptist beach read much walter scott and occasionally taught sundayschool  her parents died when she was beginning her fourth year in high school and she came to new york to work in wanamacys toy department at six dollars a week during the holiday rush  her patience with fussy old shoppers and her large salestotals had gained her a permanent place in the store  she had loftily climbed to the position of second assistant buyer in the lingerie department at fourteen dollars and eighty cents a week that was quite all of her history except that she attended a presbyterian church nearly every sunday  the only person she hated was horatio hood teddem the cheap actor who was playing the piano at mr wrenns entrance  just now horatio was playing ragtime with amazing rapidity stamping his foot and turning his head to smirk at the others  mrs arty led her chattering flock to the basement diningroom which had pink wallpaper and a mountainous sideboard  mr wrenn was placed between mrs arty and nelly croubel  out of the mist of strangeness presently emerged the personality of miss mary proudfoot a lively but religious spinster of forty who made doilies for the dorcas womens exchange and had two hundred dollars a year family income  to the right of the redglass pickledish were the elderly ebbittssamuel ebbitt esq also mrs ebbitt  mr ebbitt had come from hartford five years before but he always seemed just to have come from there he was in a realestate office he was gray illtempered impatiently honest and addicted to rheumatism and the newspapers  mrs ebbitt was addicted only to mr ebbitt  across the table was felt the presence of james t duncan who looked like a dignified redmustached sundayschool superintendent but who traveled for a cloak and suit house gambled heavily on poker and auction pinochle and was esteemed for his straight back and knowledge of trains  which is all of them  as soon as mrs arty had guided annie the bashful maid in serving the vegetable soup and had coaxed her into bringing mr wrenn a napkin she took charge of the conversation a luxury which she would never have intrusted to her flocks amateurish efforts  mr poppins said she had spoken of meeting a friend of mr wrenns  mr morton was it not  a very nice man she understood  was it true that mr wrenn and mr morton had gone clear across the atlantic on a cattleboat  it really was  oh how interesting contributed pretty nelly croubel beside mr wrenn her young eyes filled with an admiration which caused him palpitation and difficulty in swallowing his soup  he was confused by hearing old samuel ebbitt state  uhhhhback in 18uh1872 the vessel prissieno it was 1873 no it must have been 72  it was 1872 father said mrs ebbitt  1873  i was on a coastingvessel young man  but we didnt carry cattle  mr ebbitt inspected horatio hood teddem darkly clicked his spectacle case sharply shut and fell to eating as though he had settled all this nonsense  with occasional witty interruptions from the actor mr wrenn told of pitching hay of the wit of morton and the wickedness of satan the boss  but you havent told us about the brave things you did cooed mrs arty  she appealed to nelly croubel  ill bet he was a cool one  dont you think he was nelly  im sure he was  nellys voice was like a flute  mr wrenn knew that there was just one thing in the world that he wanted to do to persuade miss nelly croubel that though he was a solid business man indeed yes and honorable he was a cool one who had chosen in wandering oer this world so wide the most perilous and cattleboaty places  he tried to think of something modest yet striking to say while tom was arguing with miss mary proudfoot the respectable spinster about the ethics of giving away streetcar transfers  as they finished their floating custard mr wrenn achieved do you come from new york miss croubel and listened to the tale of sleighingparties in uptons grove pennsylvania  he was absolutely happy  this is like getting home he thought  and theyre classy folks to get home tonow that i can tell em apart  gee miss croubel is a peach  and brainsgolly  he had a frightened hope that after dinner he would be able to get into a corner and talk with nelly but tom poppins conferred with horatio hood teddenm and called mr wrenn aside  teddem had been acting with a movingpicture company for a week and had three passes to the celebrated waldorf photoplay theater  mr wrenn had bloodthirstily disapproved horatio hoods effeminate remarks such as tee hee and oh you naughty man but when he heard that this mollycoddle had shared in the glory of making moving pictures he went proudly forth with him and tom  he had no chance to speak to mrs arty about taking the room to be vacated  he wished that charley carpenter or the zapps could see him sitting right beside an actor who was shown in the pictures miraculously there before them asking him how they made movies just as friendly as though they had known each other always  he wanted to do something to entertain his friends beyond taking them out for a drink  he invited them down to his room and they came  teddem was in wonderful form he mimicked every one they saw so amiably that tom poppins knew the actor wanted to borrow money the party were lovingly humming the popular song of the timeany little girl thats a nice little girl is the right little girl for meas they frisked up the gloomy steps of the zapps  entering poppins and teddem struck attitudes on the inside stairs and sang aloud  mr wrenn felt enormously conscious of mrs zapp down below  he kept listening as he led them upstairs and lighted the gas but teddem so imitated colonel roosevelt with two waterglasses for eyeglasses and a small hatbrush for mustache that mr wrenn was moved wrigglingly to exclaim  say im going out and get some beer  or d you rather have something else  some cheese sandwiches  how about em  fine said tom and teddem together  not only did mr wrenn buy a large newspapercovered bundle of bottles of beer and swisscheese sandwiches but also a small can of caviar and salty crackers  in his room he spread a clean towel then two clean towels on the bureau and arrayed the feast with two waterglasses and a shavingmug for cups  horatio hood teddem spreading caviar on a sandwich and loudly singing his masterpiece waal i swan stopped short and fixed amazed eyes on the door of the room  mr wrenn hastily turned  the light fellas on a cliff of crumbly gray rockon mrs zapp in the open door vast in her ungirdled gray wrapper her arms folded glowering speechlessly  mist wrenn she began in a high voice that promised to burst into passion  but she was addressing the formidable adventurer bill wrenn he had to protect his friends  he sprang up and walked across to her  he said quietly i didnt hear you knock mrs zapp  ah didnt knock and ah want you should  then please do knock unless you want me to give notice  he was quivering  his voice was shrill  from the hall below theresa called up ma come down here  ma  but mrs zapp was too well started  if you think ahm going to stand for a lazy sneaking little drunkard keeping the whole street awake and here it is prett nearly midnight  just then mr william wrenn saw and heard the most astounding thing of his life and became an etemal slave to tom poppins  toms broad face became hard his voice businesslike  he shouted at mrs zapp  beat it or ill run you in  trouble with you is you old hag you dont appreciate a nice quiet little chap like wrenn and you try to bully himand him here for years  get out or ill put you out  im no lamb and i wont stand for any of your monkeyshines  get out  this aint your room hes rented ithes paid the rentits his room  get out  kindly tom poppins worked in a cigarstore and was accustomed to talk back to drunken men six feet tall  his voice was tremendous and he was fatly immovable he didnt a bit mind the fact that mrs zapp was still glaring speechless  but behold an ally to the forlorn lady  when theresa in the hall below heard tom she knew that mr wrenn would room here no more  she galloped upstairs and screeched over her mothers shoulder  you will pick on a lady will you you drunken scumyouyou cadsill have you arrested so quick you  look here lady said tom gently  im a plainclothes man a detective  his large voice purred like a tigertabbys  i dont want to run you in but i will if you dont get out of here and shut that door  or you might go down and call the cop on this block  hell run you infor breaking code 2762 of the penal law  trespass and flotsamthats what it is  uneasy frightened then horrified mrs zapp swung bulkily about and slammed the door  sick guilty banished from home though he felt mr wrenns voice quavered with an attempt at dignity  im awful sorry she butted in while you fellows was here i dont know how to apologize  forget it old man rolled out toms bass  come on lets go up to mrs artys  but gee its nearly a quarter to eleven  thats all right  we can get up there by a little after and mrs arty stays up playing cards till after twelve   golly  mr wrenn agitatedly ejaculated under his breath as they noisily entered mrs artysthough not noisily on his part  the parlor door was open  mrs artys broad back was toward them and she was announcing to james t duncan and miss proudfoot with whom she was playing threehanded five hundred well ill just bid seven on hearts if youre going to get so set up  she glanced back nodded said come in children picked up the widow and discarded with quick twitches of the cards  the frightened mr wrenn feeling like a shipwrecked landlubber compared this gaming smoking woman unfavorably with the intense respectability of his dear lost patron mrs zapp he sat uneasy till the hand of cards was finished feeling as though they were only tolerating him  and nelly croubel was nowhere in sight  suddenly said mrs arty  and now you would like to look at that room mr wrenn unless im wrong  whyuhyes i guess i would like to  come with me child she said in pretended severity  tom you take my hand in the game and dont let me hear youve been bidding ten on no suit without the joker  she led mr wrenn to the settee hatrack in the hall  the thirdfloorback will be vacant in two weeks mr wrenn  we can go up and look at it now if youd like to  the man who has it now works nightshes some kind of a head waiter at rectors or something like that and hes out till three or four  come  when he saw that thirdfloorback the room that the smart people at mrs artys were really willing to let him have he felt like a man just engaged  it was all in soft greengrassgreen matting palegreen walls chairs of white wicker with green cushions the bed a couch with a denim cover and four sofa pillows  it gave him the impression of being a guest on fifth avenue  its kind of a plain room mrs arty said doubtfully  the furniture is kind of plain  but my headwaiter manit was furnished for a friend of hishe says he likes it better than any other room in the house  it is comfortable and you get lots of sunlight and  ill takehow much is it please with board  she spoke with a takeitorleaveit defiance  elevenfifty a week  it was a terrible extravagance much like marrying a sick woman on a salary of ten a week he reflected nineteen minus elevenfifty left him only sevenfifty for clothes and savings and things andbut ill take it he said hastily  he was frightened at himself but glad very glad  he was to live in this heaven he was going to be away from that zapp woman and nelly croubelwas she engaged to some man  he wondered  mrs arty was saying  first i want to ask you some questions though  please sit down  as she creaked into one of the wicker chairs she suddenly changed from the cigaretterolling chaffing cardplayer to a woman dignified reserved commanding  mr wrenn you see miss proudfoot and miss croubel are on this floor  miss proudfoot can take care of herself all right but nelly is such a trusting little thingshes like my daughter  shes the only one ive ever given a reduced rate toand i swore i never would to anybody  do youuhdrinkdrink

company on twentyeighth street  if you want to call them up i guess the managerll give me a pretty good recommend  i dont believe ill need it mr wrenn  its my business to find out what sort of animiles men are by just talking to them she rose smiled plumped out her hand  you will be nice to nelly wont you  im going to fire that teddem outdont tell him but i ambecause he gets too fresh with

you to our midst  ill bet your socks arent darned properly  im going to sneak in and take a look at them once i get you caged up here  but i wont read your loveletters now lets go down by the fire where its comfy       chapter xv  he studies five hundred savouir faire and lotsasnap office mottoes      on a couch of glossy red leather with glossy black buttons and stiff fringes also of glossy red leather mr william wrenn sat upright and was very confiding to miss nelly croubel who was curled among the satin pillows with her skirts drawn carefully about her ankles  he had been at mrs artys for two weeks now he wore a new lightblue tie and his trousers were pressed like sheet steel  yes i suppose youre engaged to some one miss nelly and youll go off and leave usgo off to that blamed

 her big eyes seemed to fill with light  he caught himself wanting to kiss the softness of her shoulder but he said only  well i aint much of a scrapper but id try to make it interesting for him  tell me did you ever have a fight  when you were a boy  were you such a bad boy  i never did when i was a boy butwelli did have a couple of fights when i was on the cattleboat and in england  neither of

park  would you go on a picnic with me some day next spring hastily i mean with miss proudfoot and mrs arty and me  i should be pleased to she was prim but trusting about it oh listen mr wrenn did you

and just dream and dream for hours  after ive spent sunday up thereshe was dreaming now he saw and his heart was passionately tender toward heri dont hardly mind a bit having to go back to the store monday morning  youve been up along there havent you  me  why i guess im the guy that discovered the palisades yes it is wonderful up there  oh you are are you  i read about that in american history but honestly mr wrenn i do believe you care for tramps and thingsnot like that teddem or mr duncanthey always want to just stay in townor even tom though hes an old dear  mr wrenn looked jealous with a small hot jealousy  she hastened on with  of course i mean hes just like a big brother  to all of us  it was sweet to both of them to her to declare and to him to hear that neither tom nor any other possessed her heart  their shy glances were like an outreach of tenderly touching hands as she confided mrs arty and he get up picnics and when were out on the palisades he says to meyou know sometimes he almost makes me think he is sleepy though i do believe he just sneaks off under a tree and talks to mrs arty or reads a magazinebut i was saying he always says to me well sister i suppose you want to mousey round and dream by yourselfyou wont talk to a growly old bear like me  well im glad of it i want to sleep  i dont want to be bothered by you and your everlasting chatter  get out i blieve he just says that cause he knows i wouldnt want to run off by myself if they didnt think it was proper  as he heard her lively effort to imitate toms bass mr wrenn laughed and pounded his knee and agreed  yes toms an awfully fine fellow isnt he  i love to get out some place by myself too  i like to wander round places and make up the doggondest fool little stories to myself about them just as bad as a kiddy that way  and you read such an awful lot mr wrenn  my  oh tell me have you ever read anything by harold bell wright or myrtle reed mr wrenn  they write such sweet stories  he had not but he expressed an unconquerable resolve so to do and with immediateness  she went on  mrs arty told me you had a real big librarynearly a hundred books anddo you mind  i went in your room and peeked at them  no course i dont mind  if theres any of them youd like to borrow any time miss nelly i would be awful glad to lend them to you  but rats  why i havent got hardly any books  thats why you havent wasted any time learning five hundred and things isnt it  because youve been so busy reading and so on  yes kind of  mr wrenn looked modest  havent you always been lots ofoh havent you always magined lots  she really seemed to care  mr wrenn felt excitedly sure of that and imparted  yes i guess i have  and ive always wanted to travel a lot  so have i  isnt it wonderful to go around and see new places  yes isnt it he breathed  it was great to be in englandthough the people there are kind of chilly some ways even when im on a wharf here in new york i feel just like i was off in china or somewheres  id like to see china  and india  gee when i hear the waves down at coney island or some placeyou know how the waves sound when they come in well sometimes i almost feel like they was talking to a guyyou knowtelling about ships  and oh say you know the whitecapsarent they just like the waves was motioning at youthey want you to come and beat it with youover to china and places  why mr wrenn youre a regular poet  he looked doubtful  honest im not teasing you you are a poet  and i think its fine that mr teddem was saying that nobody could be a poet or like that unless they drank an awful lot anduhoh not be honest and be on a job  but you arent like that  are you  he looked selfconscious and mumbled earnestly well i try not to be  but i am going to make you go to church  youll be a socialist or something like that if you get to be too much of a poet and dont  miss nelly please may i go to church with you  why  next sunday  why yes i should be pleased  are you a presbyterian though  whyuhi guess im kind of a congregationalist but still theyre all so much alike  yes they really are  and besides what does it matter if we all believe the same and try to do right and sometimes thats hard when youre poor and it seems likelike  seems like what mr wrenn insisted  ohnothing  my youll have to get up awful early sunday morning if youd like to go with me  my church starts at tenthirty  oh id get up at five to go with you  stupid  now youre just trying to jolly me you are because you men arent as fond of church as all that i know you arent  youre real lazy sunday

why i havent done much reading  but i would like to travel andsay wouldnt it be great toi suppose im sort of a kid about it of course a guy has to tend right to business but it would be greatsay a man was in europe withwitha friend and they both knew a lot of historysay they both knew a lot about guy fawkes he was the guy that tried to blow up the english parliament and then when they were there in london they could almost think they saw him and they could go round together and look at shelleys windowhe was a poet at oxfordoh it would be great with awith a friend  yes wouldnt it  i wanted to work in the book department one time  its so nice your being  ready for five hundred bellowed tom poppins in the hall below  ready partneryou wrenn  tom was to initiate mr wrenn into the game playing with him against mrs arty and miss mary proudfoot  mrs arty sounded the occasions pitch of high merriment by delivering from the doorway the sacred old saying  well the ladies against the men eh  a general grunt that might be spelled hmmmmhm assented  im a good suffragette she added  watch us squat the men mary  like to smash windows  lets seeits red fours black fives up remarked tom as he prepared the pack of cards for playing  yes i would  it makes me so tired asseverated mrs arty to think of the old goats that men put up for candidates when they know theyre solemn old fools  id just like to get out and vote my head off  well i think the womans place is in the home sniffed miss proudfoot decisively tucking away a doily she was finishing for the womens exchange and jabbing at her bangs  they settled themselves about the glowing glancing glittering goldenoak centertable  miss proudfoot shuffled sternly  mr wrenn sat still and frightened like a shipwrecked professor on a raft with two gamblers and a pressagent though nelly was smiling encouragingly at him from the couch where she had started her embroiderya large christmas lamp mat for the wife of the presbyterian pastor at uptons grove  dont you wish your little friend horatio hood teddem was here to play with you remarked tom  i do not declared mrs arty  still there was one thing about horatio  i never had to look up his account to find out how much he owed me  he stopped calling me little buttercup when he owed me ten dollars and he even stopped slamming the front door when he got up to twenty  o mr wrenn did i ever tell you about the time i asked him if he wanted to have annie sweep  gerty protested miss proudfoot while nelly on the couch ejaculated mechanically that story but mrs arty chuckled fatly and continued  i asked him if he wanted me to have annie sweep his nightshirt when she swept his room  he changed it next day  your bid mr poppins said miss proudfoot severely  first i want to tell wrenn how to play  you see wrenn heres the schedule  we play avondale schedule you know  oh yes said mr wrenn timorously  he had once heard of carbondalein new jersey or pennsylvania or somewherebut that didnt seem to help much  well you see you either make or go back continued tom plus and minus you know  joker is high then right bower left and ace  thenuhlets see high bid takes the catwiddie you knowand discards  ten tricks  follow suit like whist of course  i guess thats allthat ought to give you the hang of it anyway  i bid six on no trump  as tom poppins finished these instructions given in the cardplayers rapid dontaskmeanymorefoolquestions manner mr wrenn felt that he was choking  he craned up his neck trying to ease his stiff collar  so then he was a failure a social outcast already  so then he couldnt learn five hundred and he had been very proud of knowing one card from another perfectly having played a number of games of twohanded poker with tim on the cattleboat but what the dickens did leftcatfollow suit mean  and to fail with nelly watching him  he pulled at his collar again  thus he reflected while mrs arty and tom were carrying on the following brilliant but cryptic societydialogue  mrs arty  well i dont know  tom  not failure but low bid is crime little one  mrs arty  mary shall i make  tom  hey  no talking cross table  mrs arty  umletmesee  tom  bid up bid up  bid a little seven on hearts  mrs arty  just for that i will bid seven on hearts smarty  tom  oh how we will squat you  what you bidding wrenn  behind mr wrenn nelly croubel whispered to him  bid seven on no suit  youve got the joker  her delicate forefinger its nail shining was pointing at a curious card in his hand  seven nosut he mumbled  eight hearts snapped miss proudfoot  nelly drew up a chair behind mr wrenns  he listened to her soft explanations with the desperate respect and affection which a green subaltern would give to a general in battle  tom and he won the hand  he glanced back at nelly with awe then clutched his new hand fearfully dizzily staring at it as though it might conceal one of those malevolent deceivers of which nelly had just warned hima left bower  good  spadessee said nelly  fifteen minutes later mr wrenn felt that tom was hoping he would lead a club  he played one and the whole table said thats right  fine  on his shoulder he felt a light tap and he blushed like a sunset as he peeped back at nelly   mr wrenn the society light was our mr wrenn of the souvenir company all this time  indeed at present he intended to keep on taking the job seriously until that most mistily distant time which we all await when something turns up  his fondling of the southern merchants was showing such results that he had grown from an interest in whatever papers were on his desk to a belief in the divine necessity of the job as a whole  not now as of old did he keep the personal letters in his desk tied up ready for a sudden departure for vienna or kamchatka  also he wished to earn much more money for his new career of luxury  mr guilfogle had assured him that there might be chances aheadbusiness had been prospering two new road salesmen and a citytrade man had been added to the staff and whereas the firm had formerly been jobbers only buying their novelties from manufacturers now they were having printed for them their own lotsasnap cardboard office mottoes which were making a big hit with the trade  through his friend rabin the salesman mr wrenn got better acquainted with two great menmr l j glover the purchasing agent of the souvenir company and john hensen the newly engaged head of motto manufacturing  he wanted to get onto all the different lines of the business sos he could step right in anywhere and from these men he learned the valuable secrets of business wherewith the marts of trade build up prosperity for all of us how to seat a selling agent facing the light so you can see his face better than he can see yours how much ahead of time to telephone the mottoprinter that weve simply got to have proof this afternoon whats the matter with you down there  dont you want our business any more  he also learned something of the various kinds of cardboard and inkwell glass though these of course were merely matters of knowledge not of brilliant business tactics and far less important than what tom poppins and rabin called handing out a snappy line of talk  say youre getting quite chummy latelyreglar society leader rabin informed him  mr wrenns answer was in itself a proof of the soundness of rabins observation  sureim going to borrow some money from you fellows  got to make an impression see  a few hours after this commendation came istras second letter   mouse dear im so glad to hear about the simpatico boarding house  yes indeed i would like to hear about the people in it and you are reading history  thats good  im getting sick of paris and some day im going to stop an absinthe on the boulevard and slap its face to show im a sturdy movingpicture western amurrican and then leap to saddle and pursue the bandit im working like the devil but whats the use  that is i mean unless one is doing the job well as im glad you are  my dear keep it up  you know i want you to be real whatever you are i didnt mean to preach but you know i hate people who arent realthats why i havent much of a flair for myself                          au recrire                                                   i n   after he had read her letter for the third time he was horribly shocked and regarded himself as a traitor because he found that he was only pretending to be enjoyably excited over it  it seemed so detached from himself  flairau recrire now what did those mean  and istra was always so discontented what d she do if she had to be on the job like nelly  oh istra is wonderful  butgeei dunno  and when he who has valorously loved says butgeei dunno love flees in panic  he walked home thoughtfully  after dinner he said abruptly to nelly i had a letter from paris today  honestly  who is she  gggg  oh its always a she  whyuhit is from a girl  i started to tell you about her one day  shes an artist and once we took a long tramp in the country  i met hershe was staying at the same place as i was in london  butoh gee  i dunno shes so blame literary she is a fine persondo you think youd like a girl like that  maybe i would  if she was a man  oh yess  artists are so romantic  but they aint on the job more n half the time he said jealously  yes thats so  his hand stole secretly craftily skirting a cushion to touch herswhich she withdrew laughing  humpa  you go hold your artists hand  oh miss nelly  when i told you about her myself  oh yes of course  she was contrite and they played five hundred animatedly all evening       chapter xvi  he becomes mildly religious and highly literary      the hero of the oneact play at hammersteins victoria vaudeville theater on that december evening was it appeared a wealthy young mineowner in disguise  he was working for the fake mine promoter because he loved the promoters daughter with a love that passed all understanding except that of the girls in the gallery  when the postal authorities were about to arrest the promoter our young hero saved him by giving him a real mine and the ensuing kiss of the daughter ended the suspense in which mr wrenn and nelly mrs arty and tom had watched the play from the sixth row of the balcony  sighing happily nelly cried to the group  wasnt that grand i got so excited  wasnt that young miner a dear  awfully nice said mr wrenn  and gee wasnt that great that office scenewith that safe and the rest of the stuffjust like you was in a real office  but say they wouldnt have a copyingpress in an office like that those fake mine promoters send out such swell letters theyd use carbon copies and not muss the letters all up  by gosh thats right and tom nodded his chin toward his right shoulder in approval  nelly cried  thats so they would  while mrs arty not knowing what a copyingpress was appeared highly commendatory and said nothing at all  during the moving pictures that followed mr wrenn felt proudly that he was taken seriously though he had known them but little over a month  he followed up his conversational advantage by leading the chorus in wondering which one of them two actors the heroine was married to and how much a week they get for acting in that thing  it was tom who invited them to miggletons for coffee and fried oysters  mr wrenn was silent for a while  but as they were stamping through the rivulets of wheeltracks that crisscrossed on a slushy streetcrossing mr wrenn regained his advantage by crying say dont you think that play d have been better if the promoter d had an awful grouch on the young miner and d had to crawfish when the miner saved him  why yes it would nelly glowed at him  wouldnt wonder if it would agreed tom kicking the december slush off his feet and patting mr wrenns back  well look here said mr wrenn as they left broadway with its crowds betokening the approach of christmas and stamped to the quieter side of fortysecond why wouldnt this make a slick play say theres an awfully rich old guy say hes a railway president or something d you see  well hes got a secretary there in the officeon the stage see  the scene is his office  well this guysthe rich old guysdaughter comes in and says shes married to a poor man and she wont tell his name but she wants some money from her dad  you see her dads been planning for her to marry a marquise or some kind of a lord and hes sore as can be and he wont listen to her and he just cusses her out something fierce see  course he doesnt really cuss but hes awful sore and she tells him didnt he marry her mother when he was a poor young man but he wont listen  then the secretary butts inmy idea is hes been kind of keeping in the background seeand hes the daughters husband all the while see  and he tells the old codger how hes got some of hissome of the old fellowspapers that give it away how he done something that was crookedsome kind of dealrebates and stuff see how i meanand the secretarys going to spring this stuff on the newspapers if the old man dont come through and forgive them so of course the president has to forgive them see  you mean the secretary was the daughters husband all along and he heard what the president said right there nelly panted stopping outside miggletons in the light from the oysterfilled window  yes and he heard it all  why i think thats just a fine idea declared nelly as they entered the restaurant  though her little manner of dignity and even restraint was evident as ever she seemed keenly joyous over his genius  say thats a corking idea for a play wrenn exclaimed tom at their table gallantly removing the ladies wraps  it surely is agreed mrs arty  why dont you write it asked nelly  awi couldnt write it  why sure you could bill insisted tom  straight you ought to write it  hey waiter  four fries and coffee you ought to write it  why its a wonder it d make a dev scuse me ladies  itd make a howling hit  you might make a lot of money out of it  the renewed warmth of their wet feet on the redtile floor the scent of fried oysters the din of any little girl on the piano these added color to this moment of mr wrenns great resolve  the four stared at one another excitedly  mr wrenns eyelids fluttered  tom brought his hand down on the table with a soft flat plob and declared  say there might be a lot of money in it  why ive heard that harry smithwrites the words for these musical comediesmakes a mint of money  mr poppins ought to help you in ithes seen such a lot of plays mrs arty anxiously advised  thats a good idea said mr wrenn  it had apparently been ordained that he was to write it  they were now settling important details  so when nelly cried i think its just a fine idea i knew you had lots of imagination tom interrupted her with  no you write it bill  ill help you all i can of course tell you what you ought to do get hold of teddemhes had a lot of stage experience hed help you about seeing the managers that d be the hard partyou can write it all right but youd have to get next to the guys on the inside and teddemsay you certainly ought to write this thing bill  might make a lot of money  oh a lot breathed nelly  heard about a fellow continued tom fellow named gene wolf i think it wasthat was so broke he was sleeping in bryant park and he made a hundred thousand dollars on his first playor no tell you how it was he sold it outright for ten thousandsomething like that anyway  i got that right from a fellow thats met him  still an authors got to go to college and stuff like that mr wrenn spoke as though he would be pleased to have the objection overruled at once which it was with a universal  oh rats  crunching oysters in a brown jacket of flour whose every lump was a crisp delight hearing his genius lauded and himself called bill thrice in a quarterhour mr wrenn was beatified he asked the waiter for some paper and while the four hotly discussed things which it would be slick to have the presidents daughter do he drew up a list of characters on a sheet of paper he still keeps  it is headed miggletons fortysecond street branch  at the bottom appear numerous scribblings of the name nelly    the full page is covered with doodling as well    i think ill call the heroine nelly he mused  nelly croubel blushed  mrs arty and tom glanced at each other mr wrenn realized that he had even at this moment of social triumph made a break  he said hastily i always liked that name  ii had an aunt named that  oh started nelly  she was fine to me when i was a kid mr wrenn added trying to remember whether it was right to lie when in such need  oh its a horrid name declared nelly  why dont you call her something nice like hazelorohdolores  nope nellys an elegant namean elegant name  he walked with nelly behind the others along fortysecond street  to the outsiders eye he was a small respectable clerk slightly stooped with a polite mustache and the dignity that comes from knowing well a narrow world wearing an overcoat too light for winter too busily edging out of the way of people and guiding the nice girl beside him into clear spaces by diffidently touching her elbow too pettily busy to cast a glance out of the crowd and spy the passing poet or king or the iron night sky  he was as undistinguishable a bit of the evening street life as any of the file of streetcars slashing through the wet snow  yet he was the chivalrous squire to the greatest lady of all his realm he was a society author and a man of great prospective wealth and power over mankind  say well have the grandest dinner you ever saw if i get away with the play he was saying  will you come miss nelly  indeed i will  oh you shant leave me out  wasnt i there when  indeed you were  oh well have a reglar feast at the astorartichokes and truffles and all sorts of stuff wouldwould you like it if i sold the play  course i would silly  id buy the business and make rabin managerthe souvenir company  so he came to relate all those intimacies of the job and he was overwhelmed at the ease with which she got onto old goglefogle  his preparations for writing the play were elaborate  he paced toms room till twelvethirty consulting as to whether he had to plan the stagesetting smoking cigarettes in attitudes on chair arms  next morning in the office he made numerous plans of the setting on waste halfsheets of paper at noon he was telephoning at tom regarding the question of whether there ought to be one desk or two on the stage  he skipped the evening meal at mrs artys dining with literary pensiveness at the armenian for he had subtle problems to meditate  he bought a dollar fountainpen which had large goldlike bands and a rather scratchy penpoint and a box of fairly large sheets of paper  pressing his literary impedimenta tenderly under his arm he attended four movingpicture and vaudeville theaters  by eleven he had seen three more oneact plays and a dramatic playlet  he slipped by the parlor door at mrs artys  his room was quiet  the lamplight on the delicately green walls was like that of a regular authors den he was quite sure  he happily tested the fountainpen by writing the names nelly and william wrenn on a bit of wrappingpaper which he guiltily burned in an ashtray washed his face with water which he let run for a minute to cool sat down before his table with a grunt of content went back and washed his hands fiercely threw off the bourgeois encumbrances of coat and collar sat down again got up to straighten a picture picked up his pen laid it down and glowed as he thought of nelly slumbering there near at hand her exquisite cheek nestling silkenly against her arm perhaps and her white dreams  suddenly he roared at himself get on the job there will yuh he picked up the pen and wrote                the millionaires daughter                a one act dramatic playlet                          by                     william wrenn                     characters  john warrington a railway president quite rich nelty warrington mr warringtons daughter reginald thorne his secretary  he was jubilant  his pen whined at top speed scattering a shower of tiny drops of ink   stage scene  an office  very expensive  mr warrington and mr thorne are sitting there  miss warrington comes in  she says   he stopped  he thought  he held his head  he went over to the stationary bowl and soaked his hair with water  he lay on the bed and kicked his heels slowly and gravely smoothing his mustache  fifty minutes later he gave a portentous groan and went to bed  he hadnt been able to think of what miss warrington says beyond i have come to tell you that i am married papa and that didnt sound just right not for a first line it didnt anyway  at dinner next nightsaturdaytom was rather inclined to make references to our author and to remark  well i know where somebody was last night but of course i wont tell  say them authors are a wild lot  mr wrenn who had permitted the teasing of even tim the hatter wasnt going to stand for no kidding from nobodynot when nelly was there and he called for a glass of water with the air of a harvard assistant professor forced to eat in a lunchwagon and slapped on the back by the cook  nelly soothed him  the play is going well isnt it  when he had with a detached grandeur of which he was immediately ashamed vouchsafed that he was already getting right down to brass tacks on it that he had already investigated four more plays and begun the actual writing every one looked awed and asked him assorted questions  at ninethirty that evening he combed and tightly brushed his hair which he had been pawing angrily for an hour and a half went down the hall to nellys hall bedroom and knocked with its mr wrenn  may i ask you something about the play  just a moment he heard her say  he waited panting softly his lips apart  this was to be the first time he had ever seen nellys room  she opened the door part way smiling shyly timidly holding her paleblue dressinggown close  the pale blueness was a modestly brilliant spot against the whiteness of the roomwhite bureau hung with dance programs and a yellow uptons grove high school banner white tiny rocker paleyellow matting whiteandsilver wallpaper and a glimpse of a white soft bed  he was dizzy with the exaltation of that purity but he got himself to say  im kind of stuck on the first part of the play miss nelly please tell me how you think the heroine would speak to her dad would she call him papa or sir do you think  whylet me see  theyre such awful high society  yes thats so  why i should think shed say sir  maybe oh what was it i heard in a play at the academy of music father i have come back to you  saaay thats a fine line  thatll get the crowd going right from the first  i told you youd help me a lot  im awfully glad if i have helped you she said earnestly good nightand good awfully glad but luck with the play good night  good night  thank you a lot miss nelly  church in the morning remember  good night  good night  as it is well known that all playwrights labor with toy theaters before them for working models mr wrenn ran to earth a fine unbroken pasteboard box in which a ninetyeightcent alarmclock had recently arrived  he went out for some glue and three small corks  setting up his box stage he glued a pillbox and a matchbox on the floorthe side of the box it had always been till nowand there he had the mahogany desks  he thrust three matches into the corks and behold three graceful actorsgraceful for corks at least  there was fascination in having them enter through holes punched in the back of the box frisk up to their desks and deliver magic emotional speeches that would cause any audience to weep speeches regarding which he knew everything but the words a detail of which he was still quite ignorant after half an hour of playing with his marionettes  before he went despairingly to bed that saturday night he had added to his manuscript   mr thorne says  here are the papers sir  as a great railway president you should   the rest of that was to be filled in later  how the dickens could he let the public know how truly great his president was  daughter miss nelly comes in  miss nelly  father i have come back to you sir  mr warrington  my daughter  nelly  father i have something to tell you something   breakfast at mrs artys was always an inspiration  in contrast to the lonely dingy meal at the hustler dairy lunch of his zapp days he sat next to a trimly shirtwaisted nelly fresh and enthusiastic after nine hours sleep  so much for ordinary days  but sunday morningthat was paradise  the oilstove glowed and purred like a large tin pussy cat it toasted their legs into dreamy comfort while they methodically stuffed themselves with toast and waffles and coffee  nelly and he always felt gently superior to tom poppins who would be asleeping late as they talked of the joy of not having to go to the office of approaching christmas and of the superiority of uptons grove and parthenon  this morning was to be mr wrenns first attendance at church with nelly  the previous time they had planned to go mr wrenn had spent sunday morning in unreligious fervor at the chelsea dental parlors with a young man in a white jacket instead of at church with nelly  this was also the first time that he had attended a church service in nine years except for mass at st patricks which he regarded not as church but as beauty  he felt tremendously reformed set upon new paths of virtue and achievement  he thought slightingly of those lonely bachelors morton and mittyford ph d  they just didnt know what it meant to a fellow to be going to church with a girl like miss nelly he reflected as he re brushed his hair after breakfast  he walked proudly beside her and made much of the gentility of entering the church as one of the welltodo and intensely bathed congregation  he even bowed to an almost painfully washed and brushed young usher with goldrimmed eyeglasses he thought scornfully of his salad days when he had bowed to the brassbutton man at the nickelorion  the church interior was as comfortable as sundaymorning toast and marmaladehalf a block of red carpet in the aisles shiny solidoak pews gorgeous stainedglass windows and a general polite creaking of ladies best stays and gentlemens stiff shirtbosoms and an odor of the best cologne and mothballs  it lacked but six days till christmas  mr wrenns heart was a little garden and his eyes were moist and he peeped tenderly at nelly as he saw the holly and ivy and the frosted christmas mottoes peace on earth good will to men and the rest that brightened the spaces between windows  christmashappy homeslaughter  since as a boy he had attended the christmas festivities of the old church sundayschool at parthenon and got highly colored candy in a net bag his holidays had been celebrated by buying himself plum pudding at lonely christmas dinners at large cheap restaurants where there was no one to wish him merry christmas except his waiter whom he would quite probably never see again nor ever wish to see  but this christmashe surprised himself and nelly suddenly by hotly thrusting out his hand and touching her sleeve with the searching fingertips of a child comforted from night fears  during the sermon he had an idea  what was it nelly had told him about peter pan  oh yes somebody in it had said  do you believe in fairies say why wouldnt it be great to have the millionaires daughter say to her father do you believe in love  gee i believe in love he yearned to himself as he felt nellys arm unconsciously touch his  tom poppins had horatio hood teddem in that afternoon for a hot toddy  horatio looked very boyish very confiding and borrowed five dollars from mr wrenn almost painlessly so absorbed was mr wrenn in learning from horatio how to sell a play  to know the address of the firm of wendelbaum  schirtz playbrokers located in a broadway theater building seemed next door to knowing a broadway manager  when horatio had gone tom presented an idea which he had ponderously conceived during his sunday noonhour at the cigarstore  why not have three of ussay me and you and mrs artytalk the play just like we was acting it  he enthusiastically forced the plan on mr wrenn  he pounded downstairs and brought up mrs arty  he dashed about the room shouting directions  he dragged out his bureau for the railroadpresidents desk and a table for the secretary and after some consideration and much rubbing of his chin with two slams and a bang he converted his hard green morrischair into an office safe  the play was on  mr t poppins in the role of the president entered with a stern high expression on his face threw a good morning thorne at wrenn his secretary and peeled off his gloves mr wrenn noted the gloves they were a touch  mr wrenn approached diffidently his face expressionless lest mrs arty laugh at him  here  say what do you think would be a good way for the secretary to tell the crowd that the other guy is the president  say how about this  the vicepresident of the railway would like to have you sign these sir as president  thats fine exclaimed mrs arty whose satin dress was carefully spread over her swelling knees as she sat in the oak rocker like a cheerful bronze monument to sunday propriety but dont you think hed say when its convenient to you sir  gee thats dandy  the play was on  it ended at seven  mr wrenn took but fifteen minutes for sunday supper and wrote till one of the morning finishing the first draft of his manuscript  revision was delightful for it demanded many conferences with nelly sitting at the parlor table with shoulders confidentially touching  they were the more intimate because tom had invited mr wrenn nelly and mrs arty to the grand christmas eve ball of the cigarmakers union at melpomene hall nelly asked of mr wrenn almost as urgently as of mrs arty whether she should wear her new white mull or her older rosecolored china silk  two days before christmas he timidly turned over the play for typing to a haughty public stenographer who looked like lee theresa zapp  she yawned at him when he begged her to be careful of the manuscript  the gloriously pinkbound and redunderlined typed manuscript of the play was mailed to messrs  wendelbaum  schirtz playbrokers at 615 pm christmas eve   the four walked down sixth avenue to the cigarmakers ball they made an indian file through the christmas shopping crowds and stopped frequently and noisily before the streetbooths glamour of tinsel and teddybears  they shrieked all with one rotund mad laughter as tom poppins capered over and bought for seven cents a pink bisque doll which he pinned to the lapel of his plaid overcoat  they drank hot chocolate at the olympic confectionery store pretending to each other that they were shivering with cold  it was here that nelly reached up and patted mr wrenns paleblue tie into better lines  in her hair was the scent which he had come to identify as hers  her white furs brushed against his overcoat  the cigarmakers with seven of them in full eveningdress and two in dinnercoats were already dancing on the waxy floor of melpomene hall when they arrived  a full orchestra was pounding and scraping itself into an hysteria of merriment on the platform under the red stuccofronted balcony and at the bar behind the balcony there was a spirit of beer and revelry by night  mr wrenn embarrassedly passed large groups of pretty girls he felt very light and insecure in his new gunmetalfinish pumps now that he had taken off his rubbers and essayed the slippery floor  he tried desperately not to use his handkerchief too conspicuously though he had a cold  it was not till the choosing of partners for the next dance when tom poppins stood up beside nelly their arms swaying a little their feet tapping that mr wrenn quite got the fact that he could not dance  he had casually said to the others a week before that he knew only the square dances which as a boy he had learned at parties at parthenon  but they had reassured him  oh come onwell teach you how to dance at the ballit wont be formal besides well give you some lessons before we go playwriting and playing five hundred had prevented their giving him the lessons  so he now sat terrified as a twostep began and he saw what seemed to be thousands of glittering youths and maidens whirling deftly in a most involved course getting themselves past each other in a way which he was sure he could never imitate  the orchestra yearned over music as rich and smooth as milk chocolate which made him intensely lonely for nelly though she was only across the room from him  tom poppins immediately introduced nelly to a facetious cigar salesman who introduced her to three of the beaux in evening clothes while tom led out mrs arty  mr wrenn sitting in a row of persons who were not at all interested in his sorrows glowered out across the hall and wished oh so bitterly to flee home  nelly came up glowing laughing with blackmustached and pearlwaistcoated men and introduced him to them but he glanced at them disapprovingly and always she was carried off to dance again  she found and hopefully introduced to mr wrenn a wallflower who came from yonkers and had never heard of tom poppins or aeroplanes or oxford or any other topic upon which mr wrenn uneasily tried to discourse as he watched nelly waltz and smile up at her partners  presently the two sat silent  the wallflower excused herself and went back to her mama from yonkers  mr wrenn sat sulking hating his friends for having brought him hating the sweetness of nelly croubel and saying to himself ohsureshe dances with all those other menme im only the poor fool that talks to her when shes tired and tries to cheer her up  he did not answer when tom came and told him a new story he had just heard in the barroom  once nelly landed beside him and bubblingly insisted on his coming out and trying to learn to dance  he brightened but shyly remarked oh no i dont think id better  just then the blackestmustached and pearlwaistcoatedest of all the cigar salesmen came begging for a dance and she was gone with only now get up your courage  im going to make you dance  at the intermission he watched her cross the floor with the hateful cigar salesman slender in her tight crisp new white mull flourishing her fan and talking with happy rapidity she sat down beside him  he said nothing he still stared out across the glassy floor  she peeped at him curiously several times and made a low tapping with her fan on the side of her chair  she sighed a little  cautiously but very casually she said arent you going to take me out for some refreshments mr wrenn  oh sureim good enough to buy refreshments for her he said to himself  poor mr wrenn he had not gone to enough parties in parthenon and he hadnt gone to any in new york  at nearly forty he was just learning the drab sulkiness and churlishness and black jealousy of the lover  to her  why didnt you go out with that guy with the black mustache  he still stared straight ahead  she was bigeyed a tear showing  why billy was all she answered  he clenched his hands to keep from bursting out with all the pitiful tears which were surging in his eyes  but he said nothing  billy what  he turned shyly around to her his hand touched hers softly  oh im a beast he said rapidly low his undertone trembling to her ears through the laughter of a group next to them  i didnt mean that but i wasi felt like such a muttnot being able to dance  oh nelly im awfully sorry you know i didnt meancome on lets go get something to eat  as they consumed icecream fudge doughnuts and chicken sandwiches at the refreshment counter they were very intimate resenting the presence of others  tom and mrs arty joined them  tom made nelly light her first cigarette  mr wrenn admired the shy way in which taking the tiniest of puffs she kept drawing out her cigarette with little pouts and nose wriggles and pretended sneezes but he felt a lofty gladness when she threw it away after a minute declaring that shed never smoke again and that she was going to make all three of her companions stop smoking now that she knew how horrid and sneezy it was so there  with what he intended to be deep subtlety mr wrenn drew her away to the barroom and these two children over two glasses of gingerale looked their innocent and rustic love so plainly that mrs arty and tom sneaked away  nelly cut out a dance which she had promised to a cigarmaker and started homeward with mr wrenn  lets not take a cari want some fresh air after that smoky place she said  but it was grand  lets walk up fifth avenue  fine  tired nelly  a little  he thought her voice somewhat chilly  nellyim so sorryi didnt really have the chance to tell you in there how sorry i was for the way i spoke to you gee it was fierce of mebut i felti couldnt dance andoh  no answer  and you did mind it didnt you  why i didnt think you were so very nice about itwhen id tried so hard to have you have a good time  oh nelly im so sorry  there was tragedy in his voice  his shoulders which he always tried to keep as straight as though they were in a vise when he walked with her were drooping  she touched his glove  oh dont billy its all right now i understand  lets forget  oh youre too good to me  silence  as they crossed twentythird on fifth avenue she took his arm he squeezed her hand  suddenly the world was all young and beautiful and wonderful  it was the first time in his life that he had ever walked thus with the arm of a girl for whom he cared cuddled in his  he glanced down at her cheap white furs snowflakes tremulous on the fur were turned into diamond dust in the light from a streetlamp which showed as well a tiny place where her collar had been torn and mended ever so carefully  then in a millionth of a second he who had been a wanderer in the lonely gray regions of a detached mans heart knew the pity of love all its emotion and the infinite care for the beloved that makes a man of a rusty salesclerk he lifted a face of adoration to the misty wonder of the bare trees whose tracery of twigs filled madison square to the metropolitan tower with its vast upward stretch toward the ruddy sky of the citys winter night  all these mysteries he knew and sang  what he said was  gee those trees look like a reglar picture  the tower just kind of fades away  dont it  yes it is pretty she said doubtfully but with a pressure of his arm  then they talked like a summertime brook planning that he was to buy a christmas bough of evergreen which she would smuggle to breakfast in the morning  through their chatter persisted the new intimacy which had been born in the pain of their misunderstanding   on january 10th the manuscript of the millionaires daughter was returned by playbrokers wendelbaum  schirtz with this letter   dear sirwe regret to say that we do not find play available we inclose our readers report on the same  also inclose bill for ten dollars for readingfee which kindly remit at early convenience   he stood in the hall at mrs artys just before dinner he reread the letter and slowly opened the readers report which announced   millionaires daughter  oneact vlle  utterly impos amateurish to the limit  dialogue sounds like burlesque of laura jean libbey  can it   nelly was coming downstairs  he handed her the letter and report then tried to stick out his jaw  she read them  her hand slipped into his  he went quickly toward the basement and made himself read the letterthough not the reportto the tableful  he burned the manuscript of his play before going to bed  the next morning he waded into the job as he never had before  he was gloomily certain that he would never get away from the job  but he thought of nelly a hundred times a day and hoped that sometime some spring night of a burning moon he might dare the great adventure and kiss her  istra theoretically he remembered her as a great experience but what nebulous bodies these theories are   that slow but absolutely accurate fivehundred player mr william wrenn known as billy glanced triumphantly at miss proudfoot who was his partner against mrs arty and james t duncan the travelingman on that night of late february his was the last bid in the crucial hand of the rubber game the others waited respectfully  confidently he bid nine on no trump  good lord billl exclaimed james t duncan  ill make it  and he did  he arose a victor  there was no uneasiness but rather all the social polish of mrs artys at its best in his manner as he crossed to mrs ebbitts chair and asked  how is mr ebbitt tonight  pretty rheumatic  miss proudfoot offered him a lime tablet and he accepted it judicially  i believe these tablets are just about as good as park  tilfords he said cocking his head  say dunk ill match you to see who rushes a growler of beer  tomll be here pretty soonstore ought to be closed by now  well have some ready for him  right bill agreed james t duncan  mr wrenn lost  he departed after secretively obtaining not one but two pitchers in one of which he got a pint of dark and in the other a surprise  he bawled upstairs to nelly come on down nelly cant you  got a growler of icecream soda for the ladies  it is true that when tom arrived and fell to conversational blows with james t duncan over the merits of a tom collins mr wrenn was not brilliant for the reason that he took tom collins to be a man instead of the drink he really is  yet as they went upstairs miss proudfoot said to nelly mr wrenn is quiet but i do think in some ways hes one of the nicest men ive seen in the house for years  and he is so earnest and i think hell make a good pinochle player besides five hundred  yes said nelly  i think he was a little shy at first  i was always shy  but he likes us and i like folks that like folks  yes said nelly       chapter xvii  he is blown by the whirlwind      he was blown by the whirlwind and followed a wandering flame through perilous seas to a happy shorequoth francois   on an april monday evening when a small moon passed shyly over the city and the streets were filled with the sound of hurdygurdies and the spring cries of dancing children mr wrenn pranced down to the basement diningroom early for nelly croubel would be down there talking to mrs arty and he gaily wanted to make plans for a picnic to occur the coming sunday he had a shy unacknowledged hope that he might kiss nelly after such a picnic he even had the notion that he might some daywell other fellows had been married why not  miss mary proudfoot was mending a rent in the current tablecloth with delicate swift motions of her silveryskinned hands  she informed him  mr duncan will be back from his southern trip in five days  well have to have a grand closing progressive five hundred tournament  mr wrenn was too much absorbed in wondering whether miss proudfoot would make some of her celebratedand justly celebratedmincedham sandwiches for the picnic to be much interested  he was not much more interested when she said mrs ferrards got a letter or something for you  then as dinner began mrs ferrard rushed in dramatically and said theres a telegram for you mr wrenn  was it death  whose death  the table panted mr wrenn with them  thats what a telegram meant to them  their eyes were like a circle of charging bayonets as he opened and read the messagea ships wireless   meet me hesperidaistra   its justaa business message he managed to say and splashed his soup  this was not the place to take the feelings out of his thumping heart and examine them  dinner was begun  picnics were conversationally considered in all their more important phaseshistorical dietetical and social  mr wrenn talked much and a little wildly  after dinner he galloped out to buy a paper  the ss hesperiida was due at ten next morning  it was an evening of frightened confusion  he tottered along lexington avenue on a furtive walk  he knew only that he was very fond of nelly yet pantingly eager to see istra  he damned himselfdamned is literalevery other minute for a cad a doublefaced traitor and all the other horrifying things a man is likely to declare himself to be for making the discovery that two women may be different and yet equally likable  and every other minute he reveled in an adventurous gladness that he was going to see istraactually incredibly going to see her just the next day  he returned to find nelly sitting on the steps of mrs artys  hello  hello  both good sound observations and all they could say for a time while mr wrenn examined the under side of the iron steps rail minutely  billywas it something serious the telegram  no it wasmiss nash the artist i told you about asked me to meet her at the boat  i suppose she wants me to help her with her baggage and the customs and all them things  shes just coming from paris  oh yes i see  so lacking in jealousy was nelly that mr wrenn was disappointed though he didnt know why  it always hurts to have ones thunderous tragedies turn out realistic dialogues  i wonder if you would like to meet her  shes awful well educated but i dunnomaybe shed strike you as kind of snobbish  but she dresses i dont think i ever seen anybody so elegant  in dressing i mean  coursehastilyshes got money and so she can afford to  but shesoh awful nice some ways  i hope you likei hope she wont  oh i shant mind if shes a snob  of course a lady gets used to that working in a department store she said chillily then repented swiftly and begged  oh i didnt mean to be snippy billy  forgive me  im sure miss nash will be real nice  does she live here in new york  noin california  i dont know how long shes going to stay here  wellwellhummm  im getting so sleepy  i guess id better go up to bed  good night   uneasy because he was away from the office displeased because he had to leave his beloved letters to the southern trade angry because he had had difficulty in getting a pass to the wharf and furious finally because he hadnt slept mr wrenn nursed all these cumulative emotions attentively and waited for the coming of the hesperida  he was wondering if hed want to see istra at all  he couldnt remember just how she looked  would he like her  the great steamer swung sideto and was coaxed alongside the wharf  peering out between rows of crowding shoulders mr wrenn coldly inspected the passengers lining the decks  istra was not in sight  then he knew that he was wildly agitated about her  suppose something had happened to her  the smallish man who had been edging into the crowd so politely suddenly dashed to the group forming at the gangplank and pushed his way rudely into the front rank  his elbow dug into the proper waistcoat of a proper plump old gentleman but he didnt know it  he stood grasping the rope rail of the plank gazing goggleeyed while the plank was lifted to the steamers deck and the long line of smiling and waving passengers disembarked  then he saw hertall graceful nonchalant uninterested in a smart check suit with a lively hat of black straw carrying a new gladstone bag  he stared at her  gee he gasped  im crazy about her i am all right  she saw him and their smiles of welcome made them one she came from the plank and hastily kissed him  really here she laughed  well well well well im so glad to see you  glad to see you mouse dear  have good tr  dont ask me about it  there was a married man sans wife who persecuted me all the way over  im glad you arent going to fall in love with me  whyuh  lets hustle over and get through the customs as soon as we can  wheres n  oh how clever of it its right by m theres one of my trunks already  how are you mouse dear  but she didnt seem really to care so very much and the old bewilderment she always caused was over him  it is good to get back after all andmouse dear i know you wont mind finding me a place to live the next few days will you she quite took it for granted  well find a place this morning nestce pas  not too expensive  ive got just about enough to get back to california  man fashion he saw with acute clearness the pile of work on his desk and man fashion responded  no be glad tuh  how about the place where youre living  you spoke about its being so clean and all  the thought of nelly and istra together frightened him  why i dont know as youd like it so very much  oh itll be all right for a few days anyway  is there a room vacant  he was sulky about it  he saw much trouble ahead  why yes i suppose there is  mouse dear istra plumped down on a trunk in the confused billows of incoming baggage customs officials and indignant passengers that surged about them on the rough floor of the vast dockhouse  she stared up at him with real sorrow in her fine eyes  why mouse  i thought youd be glad to see me  ive never rowed with you have i  ive tried not to be temperamental with you  thats why i wired you when there are others ive known for years  oh i didnt mean to seem grouchy i didnt  i just wondered if youd like the house  he could have knelt in repentance before his goddess what time she was but a lonely girl in the clatter of new york  he went on  and weve got kind of separated and i didnt knowbut i guess ill alwaysohkind of worship you  its all right mouse  itsheres the customs men  now istra nash knew perfectly that the customs persons were not ready to examine her baggage as yet  but the discussion was ended and they seemed to understand each other  gee theres a lot of rich jew ladies coming back this time said he  yes  they had diamonds three times a day she assented  gee this is a big place  yes so did they testify to fixity of friendship till they reached the house and istra was welcomed to that teddems room as a new guest   dinner began with the ceremony due mrs arty  there was no lack of the sacred old jokes  tom poppins did not fail to bellow bring on the dishwater nor miss mary proudfoot to cheep demurely dont y knaow in a tone which would have been recognized as fascinatingly english anywhere on the american stage  then the talk stopped dead as istra nash stood agaze in the doorwaypale and intolerant her red hair twisted high on her head tall and slim and uncorseted in a gray tightfitting gown  every head turned as on a pivot first to istra then to mr wrenn  he blushed and bowed as if he had been called on for a speech stumblingly arose and said  uhuhuhyou met mrs ferrard didnt you istra  shell introduce you to the rest  he sat down wondering why the deuce hed stood up and unhappily realized that nelly was examining istra and himself with cool hostility  in a flurry he glowered at istra as she nonchalantly sat down opposite him beside mrs arty and incuriously unfolded her napkin  he thought that in her cheerful face there was an expression of devilish amusement  he blushed  he furiously buttered his bread as mrs arty remarked to the assemblage  ladies and gentlemen i want you all to meet miss istra nash miss nashyouve met mr wrenn miss nelly croubel our baby tom poppins the great fivehundred player mrs ebbitt mr ebbitt miss proudfoot  istra nash lifted her bowed eyes with what seemed shyness hesitated said thank you in a clear voice with a precise pronunciation and returned to her soup as though her pleasant communion with it had been unpleasantly interrupted  the others began talking and eating very fast and rather noisily miss mary proudfoots thin voice pierced the clamor  i hear you have just come to new york miss nash  yes  is this your first visit to  no  miss proudfoot rancorously took a long drink of water  nelly attempted bravely  do you like new york miss nash  yes  nelly and miss proudfoot and tom poppins began discussing shoestores all at once and very rapidly while hot and uncomfortable mr wrenn tried to think of something to say good lord suppose istra queered him at mrs artys then he was angry at himself and all of them for not appreciating her  how exquisite she looked with her tired white face  as the soupplates were being removed by annie the maid with an elaborate confusion and a general passing of plates down the line istra nash peered at the maid petulantly  mrs arty frowned then grew artificially pleasant and said  miss nash has just come back from paris  shes a regular european traveler just like mr wrenn  mrs samuel ebbitt piped  mr ebbitt was to europe  in 1882  no twant fannie twas in 1881 complained mr ebbitt  miss nash waited for the end of this interruption as though it were a noise which merely had to be endured like the elevated  twice she drew in her breath to speak and the whole table laid its collective knife and fork down to listen  all she said was  oh will you pardon me if i speak of it now mrs ferrard but would you mind letting me have my breakfast in my room tomorrow  about nine  just something simplea canteloupe and some shirred eggs and chocolate  oh no why yes certainly mumbled mrs arty while the table held its breaths and underneath them gasped  chocolate  a canteloupe  shirred eggs  in her roomat nine  all this was very terrible to mr wrenn  he found himself in the position of a man scheduled to address the brewers association and the w c t u  at the same hour valiantly he attempted  miss nash oughta be a good person for our picnics  shes a regular shark for outdoor tramping  oh yes mr wrenn and i tramped most all night in england one time said istra innocently  the eyes of the table asked mr wrenn what he meant by it he tried to look at nelly but something hurt inside him  yes he mumbled  quite a long walk  miss mary proudfoot tried again  is it pleasant to study in paris  mrs arty said you were an artist  no  then they were all silent and the rest of the dinner mr wrenn alternately discussed olympia johns with istra and picnics with nelly  there was an undertone of pleading in his voice which made nelly glance at him and even become kind  with quiet insistence she dragged istra into a discussion of rue de la paix fashions which nearly united the shattered table and won mr wrenns palpitating thankfulness  after dessert istra slowly drew a plain gold cigarettecase from a brocade bag of silvery gray  she took out a match and a thin russian cigarette which she carefully lighted  she sat smoking in one of her best attitudes pointed elbows on the table coolly contemplating a huge picture called hunting the stag on the wall behind mr wrenn  mrs arty snapped to the servant annie bring me my cigarettes but mrs arty always was penitent when she had been nasty andthough istra did not at once seem to know that the landlady had been nastymrs arty invited her up to the parlor for afterdinner so cordially that istra could but grant perhaps i will and she even went so far as to say i think youre all to be envied having such a happy family  yes thats so reflected mrs arty  yes added mr wrenn  and nelly  thats so  the whole table nodded gravely yes thats so  im sureistra smiled at mrs artythat its because a woman is running things  now think what catanddog lives youd lead if mr wrenn or mrpopple was itwere ruling  they applauded  they felt that she had been humorous  she was again and publicly invited up to the parlor and she came though she said rather shortly that she didnt play five hundred but only bumblepuppy bridge a variety of whist which mr wrenn instantly resolved to learn  she reclined reclined is perfectly accurate on the redleather couch among the pillows and smoked two cigarettes relapsing into nos for conversation  mr wrenn said to himself almost spitefully as she snubbed nelly too good for us is she  but he couldnt keep away from her  the realization that istra was in the room made him forget most of his melds at pinochle and when miss proudfoot inquired his opinion as to whether the coming picnic should be held on staten island or the palisades he said vaguely yes i guess that would be better  for he was wanting to sit down beside istra nash just be near her he had to be  so he ventured over and was instantly regarding all the rest as outsiders whom his wise comrade and himself were studying  tell me mouse dear why do you like the people here  the peepul i mean  they dont seem so very remarkable  enlighten poor istra  well theyre awful kind  ive always lived in a house where the folks didnt hardly know each other at all except mrs zappshe was the landladyand i didnt like her very much but here tom poppins and mrs arty andthe restthey really like folks and they make it just like a home  miss croubel is a very nice girl  she works for wanamacysshe has quite a big job there  she is assistant buyer in the  he stopped in horror  he had nearly said in the lingery department he changed it to in the clothing department and went on doubtfully  mr duncan is a travelingman  hes away on a trip  which one do you play with  so nelly likes towell make blievemagine  how did you  oh i watched her looking at you  i think shes a terribly nice pinkface  and just now youre comparing her and me  gee he said  she was immensely pleased with herself  tell me what do these people think about at least what do you talk about  say  sssh  not so loud my dear  say i know how you mean  you feel something like what i did in england  you cant get next to what the folks are thinking and it makes you sort of lonely  well i  just then tom poppins rolled jovially up to the couch  he had carried his many and perspiring pounds over to third avenue because miss proudfoot reflected ive got a regular sweet tooth tonight  he stood before istra and mr wrenn theatrically holding out a bag of chocolate drops in one hand and peanut brittle in the other and grandiloquently  which shall it be your highness  nobody loves a fat man so he has to buy candy sos theyll let him stick around  les see you take chocolates bill  name your drink miss nash she looked up at him gravely and politelytoo gravely and politely  she didnt seem to consider him a nice person  neither thank you sharply as he still stood there he moved away hurt bewildered  istra was going on i havent been here long enough to be lonely yet but in any case when mr wrenn interrupted  youve hurt toms feelings by not taking any candy and gee hes awful kind  have i mockingly  yes you have  and there aint any too many kind people in this world  oh yes of course you re right  i am sorry really i am  she dived after toms retreat and cheerfully addressed him  oh i do want some of those chocolates  will you let me change my mind  please do  yes maam you sure can said broad tom all one pleased chuckle poking out the two bags  istra stopped beside the fivehundred table to smile in a lordly way down at mrs arty and say quite humanly  im so sorry i cant play a decent game of cards  im afraid im too stupid to learn  you are very lucky i think  mr wrenn on the couch was horribly agitated  wasnt istra coming back  she was  she detached herself from the hubbub of invitations to learn to play five hundred and wandered back to the couch murmuring  was bad istra good  am i forgiven  mouse dear i didnt mean to be rude to your friends  as the bubbles rise through water in a cookingpot as the surface writhes and then after the long wait suddenly the water is aboil so was the emotion of mr wrenn now that istra the lordly had actually done something he suggested  istra that was all he could say but from his eyes had gone all reserve  her glance back was as frank as hisonly it had more of the mother in it it was like a kindly pat on the head and she was the mother as she mused  so you have missed me then  missed you  did you think of me after you came here  oh i knowi was forgotten poor istra abdicates to the pretty pinkface  oh istra dont  icant we just go out for a little walk soso we can talk  why we can talk here  oh geetheres so many people around  golly when i came back to americageei couldnt hardly sleep nights  from across the room came the boisterous somewhat coarsetimbred voice of tom speaking to nelly  oh yes of course you think youre the only girl that ever seen a vodville show  we aint never seen a vodville show  oh no  nelly and miss proudfoot dissolved in giggles at the wit  mr wrenn gazed at them detached these were not his people and with startled pride he glanced at istras face delicately carven by thought as he stumbled hotly on  just couldnt sleep nights at all  then i got on the job  lets see youre still with that same company  yes  souvenir and art novelty company  and i got awfully on the job there and so i managed to forget for a little while and  so you really do like me even after i was so beastly to you in england  oh that wasnt nothing  but i was always thinking of you even when i was on the job  its gratifying to have some one continue taking me seriously  really dear i do appreciate it  but you mustntyou mustnt  oh gee i just cant get over ityou here by meaint it curious  then he persisted with the tale of his longing which she had so carefully interrupted  the people here are awful kind and good and you can bank on em  butoh   from across the room toms pretended jeers lighted up with miss proudfoots giggles as paper lanterns illumine coney island from tom  yes youre a hot dancer all right  i suppose you can do the boston and all them swell dances  wahhhhh   but istra oh gee youre like poetrylike all them things a feller cant get but he tries to when he reads shakespeare and all those poets  oh dear boy you mustnt  we will be good friends  i do appreciate having some one care whether im alive or not but i thought it was all understood that we werent to take playing together seriously that it was to be merely playingnothing more  but anyway you will let me play with you here in new york as much as i can  oh come on lets go for a walkletslets go to a show  im awfly sorry but i promiseda mans going to call for me and were going to a stupid studio party on bryant park  bore isnt it the day of landing  and poor istra dreadfully landsick  oh then hopefully dont go  lets  im sorry mouse dear but im afraid i cant break the date  fact i must go up and primp now  dont you care a bit he said sulkily  why yes of course  but you wouldnt have istra disappoint a nice johnny after hes bought him a cunnin new weskit would you  good night dear  she smiledthe mother smileand was gone with a lively good night to the room in general   nelly went up to bed early  she was tired she said  he had no chance for a word with her  he sat on the steps outside alone a long time  sometimes he yearned for a sight of istras ivory face  sometimes with a fierce compassion that longed to take the burden from her he pictured nelly working all day in the rushing department store on which the fetid city summer would soon descend   they did have their walk the next night istra and mr wrenn but istra kept the talk to laughing burlesques of their tramp in england  somehowhe couldnt tell exactly whyhe couldnt seem to get in all the remarks he had inside him about how much he had missed her  wednesdaythursdayfriday he saw her only at one dinner or on the stairs departing volubly with cleverlooking men in evening clothes to taxis waiting before the house  nelly was very pleasant just thatpleasant  she pleasantly sat as his partner at five hundred and pleasantly declined to go to the moving pictures with him  she was getting more and more tired staying till seven at the store preparing what she called special stunts for the summer white sale  friday evening he saw her soft fresh lips drooping sadly as she toiled up the front steps before dinner  she went to bed at eight at which time istra was going out to dinner with a thin hatchetfaced sarcasticlooking man in a norfolk jacket and a fluffy black tie  mr wrenn resented the norfolk jacket  of course the kingly men in evening dress would be expected to take istra away from him but a norfolk jackethe did not call it that  though he had worn one in the fair village of aengusmere it was still to him a coat with a belt  he thought of nelly all evening  he heard herthere on the same floor with himtalking to miss proudfoot who stood at nellys door three hours after she was supposed to be asleep  no nelly was saying with evidently fictitious cheerfulness no it was just a little headache  its much better  i think i can sleep now  thank you very much for coming  nelly hadnt told mr wrenn that she had a severe headacheshe who had once a few weeks before run to him with a cut in her soft small finger demanding that he bind it up  he went slowly to bed  he had lain awake half an hour before his agony so overpowered him that he flung out of bed  he crouched low by the bed like a child his legs curled under him the wooden sideboard pressing into his chest in one long line of hot pain while he prayed  o god o god forgive me forgive me oh forgive me  here i been forgetting nelly and i love her and comparing her with istra and not appreciating her and nelly always so sweet to me and trusting me soo god keep me away from wickedness  he huddled there many minutes praying the scorching pressure of the bedside growing more painful  all the while the campfire he had shared with istra was burning within his closed eyes and istra was visibly lording it in a london flat filled with clever people and he was passionately aware that the line of her slim breast was like the lip of a shell the line of her pallid cheek defined by her flamecolored hair something utterly fine something he could not express  oh he groaned she is like that poetry stuff in shakespeare thats so hard to get  ill be extra nice to nelly at the picnic sunday  her trusting me so and then meo god keep me away from wickedness   as he was going out saturday morning he found a note from istra waiting in the hall on the hatrack   do you want to play with poor istra tomorrow sat  afternoon and perhaps evening mouse  you have saturday afternoon off dont you  leave me a note if you can call for me at 130                                                       i n   he didnt have saturday afternoon off but he said he did in his note and at onethirty he appeared at her door in a new spring suit purchased on tuesday a new spring hat very fuzzy and gay purchased saturday noon and the walkingstick he had bought on tottenham court road but decently concealed from the boardinghouse  istra took him to what she called a futurist play she explained it all to him several times and she stood him tea and muffins and recalled mrs cattermoles establishment with full attention to mrs cattermoles bulbous but earnest nose  they dined at the brevoort and were back at ninethirty for said istra she was just a bit tired mouse  they stood at the door of istras room  istra said  you may come injust for a minute  it was the first time he had even peeped into her room in new york  the old shyness was on him and he glanced back  nelly was just coming upstairs staring at him where he stood inside the door her lips apart with amazement  ladies distinctly did not entertain in their rooms at mrs artys  he wanted to rush out to explain to invite her in toto he stuttered in his thought and by now nelly had hastened past her face turned from them  uneasily he tilted on the front of a caneseated rockingchair glaring at a pile of books before one of istras trunks  istra sat on the bedside nursing her knee  she burst out  o mouse dear im so bored by everybodyevery sort of everybody  of course i dont mean you youre a good pal ohparis is too complexespecially when you cant quite get the nasal vowelsand new york is too youthful and earnest and dos puentes california will be plain hell  and all my little partiesi start out on them happily always as naive as a kiddy going to a birthday party and then i get there and find i cant even dance square dances as the kiddy does and go homeoh damn it damn it damn it  am i shocking you  well what do i care if i shock everybody  her slim pliant length was flung out along the bed and she was crying  her beautiful hands clutched the corners of a pillow bitterly  he crept over to the bed patting her shoulder slowly and regularly too frightened of her mood even to want to kiss her  she looked up laughing tearfully  please say there there there dont cry  it always goes with pats for weepy girls you know  o mouse you will be good to some woman some day  her long strong arms reached up and drew him down  it was his head that rested on her shoulder  it seemed to both of them that it was he who was to be petted not she  he pressed his cheek against the comforting hollow of her curving shoulder and rested there abandoned to a forlorn and growing happiness the happiness of getting so far outside of his tight world of wrennishness that he could give comfort and take comfort with no prim worried thoughts of wrenn  istra murmured  perhaps thats what i needsome one to need me  only  she stroked his hair  now you must go dear  youits better now  im afraid i aint helped you much its kinda t other way round  oh yes indeed its all right now  just nerves  nothing more now good night  please wont you come to the picnic tomorrow  its  no  sorry but cant possibly  please think it over  no no no no dear  you go and forget me and enjoy yourself and be good to your pinkfacenelly isnt it  she seems to be terribly nice and i know you two will have a good party  you must forget me  im just a teacher of playing games who hasnt been successful at any game whatever  not that it matters i dont care  i dont really  now good night       chapter xviii  and follows a wandering flame through perilous seas      they had picnic dinner early up there on the palisades  nelly and mr wrenn mrs arty and tom miss proudfoot and mrs samuel ebbitt the last of whom kept ejaculating  well i aint run off like this in ten years  they squatted about a redcotton tablecloth spread on a rock broadly discussing the sandwiches and cold chicken and lemonade and stuffed olives and laughing almost to a point of distress over toms accusation that miss proudfoot had secreted about her person a bottle of rye whisky  nelly was very pleasant to mr wrenn but she called him neither billy nor anything else and mostly she talked to miss proudfoot smiling at him but saying nothing when he managed to get out a jest about mrs artys chewinggum  when he moved to her side with a wooden plate of creamcheese sandwiches which tom humorously termed coldcream wafers mr wrenn started to explain how he had come to enter istras room  why shouldnt you nelly asked curtly and turned to miss proudfoot  she doesnt seem to care much he reflected relieved and stabbed in his humble vanity and reattracted to nelly all at once  he was anxious about her opinion of istra and her opinion of himself and slightly defiant as she continued to regard him as a respectable person whose name she couldnt exactly remember  hadnt he the right to love istra if he wanted to he desired to know of himself  besides what had he done  just gone out walking with his english hotel acquaintance istra  he hadnt been in her room but just a few minutes  fine reason that was for nelly to act like a blooming iceberg  besides it wasnt as if he were engaged to nelly or anything like that besides of course istra would never care for him  there were several other besideses with which he harrowed himself while trying to appear picnically agreeable  he was getting very much confused and was slightly abrupt as he said to nelly lets walk over to that high rock on the edge  a dusky afterglow filled the sky before them as they silently trudged to the rock and from the top of the sheer cliff contemplated the smooth and steelygray hudson below  nelly squeaked her fear at the drop and clutched his arm but suddenly let go and drew back without his aid  he groaned within i havent the right to help her  he took her arm as she hesitatingly climbed from the rock down to the ground  she jerked it free curtly saying  no thank you  she was repentant in a moment and cheerfully  miss nash took me in her room yesterday and showed me her things  my shes got such beyootiful jewels  la vlieres and pearls and a swell amethyst brooch  my  she told me all about how the girls used to study in paris and how sorry she would be to go back to california and keep house  keep house  nelly let him suffer for a moment before she relieved him with for her father  oh  did she say she was going back to california soon  not till the end of the summer maybe  oh  oh nelly  for the first time that day he was perfectly sincere  he was trying to confide in her  but the shame of having emotions was on him  he got no farther  to his amazement nelly mused  she is very nice  he tried hard to be gallant  yes she is interesting but of course she aint anywheres near as nice as you are nelly be  oh dont billy  the quick agony in her voice almost set them both weeping  the shared sorrow of separation drew them together for a moment then she started off with short swift steps and he tagged after  he found little to say  he tried to comment on the river  he remarked that the apartmenthouses across in new york were bright in the sunset that in fact the upper windows looked like there was a fire in there her sole comment was yes  when they rejoined the crowd he was surprised to hear her talking volubly to miss proudfoot  he rejoiced that she was game but he did not rejoice long  for a frightened feeling that he had to hurry home and see istra at once was turning him weak and cold  he didnt want to see her she was intruding but he had to gogo at once and the agony held him all the way home while he was mechanically playing the part of stern reformer and agreeing with tom poppins that the horrors of the recent triangle shirtwaistfactory fire showed that something oughta be donesomething sure oughta be  he trembled on the ferry till nelly with a burst of motherly tenderness in her young voice suddenly asked  why youre shivering dreadfully  did you get a chill  naturally he wanted the credit of being known as an invalid and pitied and nursed but he reluctantly smiled and said oh no it aint anything at all  then istra called him again and he fumed over the slowness of their landing  and at home istra was out  he went resolutely down and found nelly alone sitting on a round paleyellow straw mat on the steps  he sat by her  he was very quiet not at all the jovial young man of the picnic properly following the boardinghousedistrict rule that males should be jocular and show their appreciation of the ladies by kidding them  and he spoke with a quiet graciousness that was almost courtly with a note of weariness and spiritual experience such as seldom comes into the boardinghouses to slay joy and bring wisdom and give words shyness  he had as he sat down intended to ask her to go with him to a movingpicture show  but inspiration was on him  he merely sat and talked  when mr wrenn returned from the office two evenings later he found this note awaiting him   dear mousefriend has asked me to join her in studio  have beat it  sorry not see you  say goodby  come see me sometimephone before and see if im inspring xxxaddress xx south washington sq  in haste                        istra   he spent the evening in not going to the studio  several times he broke away from a pinochle game to rush upstairs and see if the note was as chilly as he remembered  it always was  then for a week he awaited a more definite invitation from her which did not come  he was uneasily polite to nelly these days and tremulously appreciative of her gentleness  he wanted to brood but he did not take to his old habit of long solitary walks  every afternoon he planned one for the evening every evening found that he wanted to be around with folks  he had a sort of youthful defiant despair so he jested much at the cardtable by way of practising his new game of keeping people from knowing what he was thinking  he took sophisticated pleasure in noting that mrs arty no longer condescended to him he managed to imitate toms writing on a card which he left with a bunch of jonquils in nellys room and nearly persuaded even tom himself that tom was the donor  probably because he didnt much care what happened he was able to force mr mortimer r guilfogle to raise his salary to twentythree dollars a week mr guilfogle went out of his way to admit that the letters to the southern trade had been a firstrate stunt son  john henson the head of the souvenir companys manufacturing department invited mr wrenn home to dinner and the account of the cattleboat was much admired by mrs henson and the three young hensons  a few days later in midjune there was an unusually cheerful dinner at the boardinghouse  nelly turned to mr wrennyes he was quite sure about it she was speaking exclusively to him with a lengthy and most merry account of the manner in which the floor superintendent had called down the unkindest of the aislesmen  he longed to give his whole self in his answer to be in the absolute community of thought that lovers know  but the image of istra was behind his chair  istrahe had to see hernow this evening  he rushed out to the corner drugstore and reached her by telephone  yess admitted istra a little grudgingly she was going to be at the studio that evening though shewell there was going to be a little partysome friendsbutyes shed be glad to have him come  grimly mr wrenn set out for washington square  since this scientific treatise has so exhaustively examined mr wrenns reactions toward the esthetic one need give but three of his impressions of the studio and people he found on washington squarenamely  a that the big room was bare ill kept and not comparable to the redplush splendor of mrs artys for all its pretension to superiority  why a lot of the pictures werent framed  and you should have seen the giltness and fruitborderness of the frames at mrs artys  b that the people were brothersintalk to the inmates of the flat on great james street london only far less and friendly  c that mr wrenn was now a man of friends and if the blooming bohemians as he called them didnt like him they were permitted to go to the dickens  istra was always across the room from him somehow  he found himself glad  it made their parting definite  he was going back to his own people he was deciding  as he rose with elaborate boardinghouse apologies to the room at large for going and a cheerful but not intimate good night to istra she followed him to the door and into the dark long hallway without  good night mouse dear  im glad you got a chance to talk to the silver girl  but was mr hargis rude to you  i heard him talking single taxor was it matisseand hes usually rude when he talks about them  no  he was all right  then what is worrying you  ohnothing  good ni  you are going off angry  arent you  no butoh there aint any use of ourof me being is there  nno  matissethe guy you just spoke aboutand these artists here tonight in bobtail dresssuitsi wouldnt know when to wear one of them things and when a swallowtailif i had one evenor when a prince albert or  oh not a prince albert mouse dear  say a frockcoat  sure  thats what i mean  its like that matisse guy  i dont know about none of the things youre interested in  while youve been away from mrs artyslord ive missed you so  but when i try to train with your bunch or when you spring matisse he seemed peculiarly to resent the unfortunate french artist on me i sort of get onto myselfand now it aint like it was in england ive got a bunch of my own i can chase around with anyway i got onto myself tonight  i spose its partly because i been thinking you didnt care much for my friends  but mouse dear all this isnt news to me  surely you whove gipsied with me arent going to be so obvious so banal as to blame me because youve cared for me are you child  oh no no no i didnt mean to do that  i just wantedoh gee  i dunnowell i wanted to have things between us definite  i do understand  youre quite right  and now were just friends arent we  yes  then goodby  and sometime when im back in new yorkim going to california in a few daysi think ill be able to get back herei certainly hope sothough of course ill have to keep house for friend father for a while and maybe ill marry myself with a local magnate in desperationbut as i was saying dear when i get back here well have a good dinner nicht wahr  yes andgoodby  she stood at the top of the stairs looking down  he slowly clumped down the wooden treads boiling with the amazing discoveries that he had said goodby to istra that he was not sorry and that now he could offer to nelly croubel everything  istra suddenly called  o mouse wait just a moment  she darted like a swallow  she threw her arm about his shoulder and kissed his cheek  instantly she was running upstairs again and had disappeared into the studio   mr william wrenn was walking rapidly up riverside drive thinking about his letters to the southern merchants  while he was leaving the studio building he had perfectly seen himself as one who was about to go through a tumultuous agony after which he would be free of all the desire for istra and ready to serve nelly sincerely and humbly  but he found that the agony was all over  even to save his dignity as one who was being dramatic he couldnt keep his thoughts on istra  every time he thought of nelly his heart was warm and he chuckled softly  several times out of nothing came pictures of the supercilious persons whom he had heard solving the problems of the world at the studio on washington square and he muttered  oh hope they choke  istras all right though she learnt me an awful lot  butgee  im glad she aint in the same house i suppose id agnize round if she was  suddenly at no particular street corner on riverside drive just a street he fled over to broadway and the subway  he had to be under the same roof with nelly  if it were only possible to see her that night  but it was midnight  however he formulated a plan  the next morning he would leave the office find her at her department store and make her go out to manhattan beach with him for dinner that night  he was home  he went happily up the stairs  he would dream of nelly and  nellys door opened and she peered out drawing her peignoir about her  oh she said softly is it you  yes  my youre up late  do youare you all right  he dashed down the hall and stood shyly scratching at the straw of his newest hat  why yes nelly course  pooroh dont tell me you have a headache again  noi was awful foolish of course but i saw you when you went out this evening and you looked so savage and you didnt look very well  but now its all right  then good night  oh nolistenplease do  i went over to the place miss nash is living at because i was pretty sure that i aint hipped on hersort of hypnotized by herany more  and i found i aint i aint  i dont know what to say i want toi want you to know that from going to try and see if i cant get you to care for me  he was dreadfully earnest and rather quiet with the dignity of the man who has found himself  im scared he went on about saying this because maybe youll think ive got an idea im kind of a little tin god and all ive got to do is to say which girl ill want and shell come arunning but it isnt that it isnt  its just that i want you to know im going to give all of me to you now if i can get you to want me  and i am glad i knew istrashe learnt me a lot about books and all so i have more to me or maybe will have for you  its nellypromise youll bemy friendpromiseif you knew how i rushed back here tonight to see you  billy  she held out her hand and he grasped it as though it were the sacred symbol of his dreams  tomorrow she smiled with a hint of tears ill be a reglar lady i guess and make you explain and explain like everything but now im just glad  yes defiantly i will admit it if i want to  i am glad  her door closed       chapter xix  to a happy shore      upon an evening of november 1911 it chanced that of mrs artys flock only nelly and mr wrenn were at home  they had finished two hot games of pinochle and sat with their feet on a small amiable oilstove  mr wrenn laid her hand against his cheek with infinite content  he was outlining the situation at the office  the business had so increased that mr mortimer r guilfogle the manager had told rabin the head travelingsalesman that he was going to appoint an assistant manager  should he mr wrenn queried try to get the position  the other candidates rabin and henson and glover were all good friends of his and furthermore could he run a bunch of guys if he was over them  why of course you can billy  i remember when you came here you were sort of shy  but now youre most the star boarder and wont those others be trying to get the job away from you of course  yes thats so  why billy some day you might be manager  say that would be great wouldnt it  but hones nell do you think i might have a chance to land the assistants job  i certainly do  oh nellygee you make meoh learn to bank on myself  he kissed her for the second time in his life  mr guilfogle stated mr wrenn next day i want to talk to you about that assistant managership  the manager in his new office and his new flowered waistcoat had acted interested when our steady and reliable mr wrenn came in  but now he tried to appear dignified and impatient  that he began  ive been here longer than any of the other men and i know every line of the business now even the manufacturing  you remember i held down hensons job when his wife was sick  yes but  and i guess jake thinks i can boss all right and miss leavenbetz too  now will you kindly low me to talk a little wrenn  i know a little something about how things go in the office myself i dont deny youre a good man  maybe some day you may get to be assistant manager  but im going to give the first try at it to glover  hes had so much more experience with meeting people directlypersonally  but youre a good man  yes ive heard that before but ill be goldarned if ill stick at one desk all my life just because i save you all the trouble in that department guilfogle and now  now now now now  calm down hold your horses my boy  this aint a melodrama you know  yes i know i didnt mean to get sore but you know  well now ill tell you what im going to do  im going to make you head of the manufacturing department instead of getting in a new man and shift henson to purchasing  ill put jake on your old job and expect you to give him a lift when he needs it  and youd better keep up the most important of the jollyingletters i guess  well i like that all right  i appreciate it  but of course i expect more paytwo mens work  lets see what you getting now  twentythree  well thats a good deal you know  the overhead expenses have been increasing a lot faster than our profits and weve  huh  got to see where new business is coming in to justify the liberal way weve treated you men before we can afford to do much salaryraisingthough were just as glad to do it as you men to get it but  huh  if we go to getting extravagant well go bankrupt and then we wont any of us have jobs  still i am willing to raise you to twentyfive though  thirtyfive  mr wrenn stood straight  the manager tried to stare him down panic was attacking mr wrenn and he had to think of nelly to keep up his defiance  at last mr guilfogle glared then roared well confound it wrenn ill give you twentyninefifty and not a cent more for at least a year  thats final  understand  all right chirped mr wrenn  gee he was exulting to himself never thought id get anything like that  twentyninefifty more n enough to marry on now  im going to get twentyninefifty   married five months ago tonight honey said mr wrenn to nelly his wife in their bronx flat and thus set down october 17 1913 as a great date in history  oh i know it billy  i wondered if youd remember  you just ought to see the dessert im makingbut thats a sprise  remember  should say i did  see what ive got for somebody  he opened a parcel and displayed a pair of redworsted bedslippers a creation of one of the greatest redworsted artists in the whole land  yes and he could afford them too was he not making thirtytwo dollars a weekhe who had been poor and his chances for the assistant managership looked good  oh theyll be so comfy when it gets cold  youre a dear oh billy the janitress says the jewish lady across the court in number seventy is so lazy she wears her corsets to bed  did the janitress get the coal put in nell  yes but her husband is laid off again  i was talking to her quite a while this afternoon  oh dear i do get so lonely for you sweetheart with nothing to do  but i did read some kim this afternoon  i liked it  thats fine  but its kind of hard  maybe illoh i dont know i guess ill have to read a lot  he patted her back softly and hoped  maybe some day we can get a little house out of town and then you can garden  sorry old siddons is laid off again  is the gasstove working all right now  umhuh honey  i fixed it  say let me make the coffee nell  youll have enough to do with setting the table and watching the sausages  all rightee hun  but oh billy im so shamed  i was going to get some potato salad and ive just remembered i forgot she hung her head with a fingertip to her pretty lips and pretended to look dreadfully ashamed  would you mind so veree much skipping down to bachmeyers for some  ahh is it just fearful neglected when it comes home all tired out  no indeedy  but you got to kiss me first else i wont go at all  nelly turned to him and as he held her her head bent far back she lay tremblingly inert against his arms staring up at him panting  with her head on his shouldera soft burden of love that his shoulder rejoiced to bearthey stood gazing out of the narrow kitchen window of their sixthstory flat and noticed for the hundredth time that the trees in a vacant lot across were quite as red and yellow as the millionaire trees in central park along fifth avenue  sometime mused mr wrenn well live in jersey where theres trees and trees and treesand maybe therell be kiddies to play under them and then you wont be lonely honey theyll keep you some busy  you skip along now and dont be talking nonsense or ill not give you one single wee bit of dinner  then she blushed adorably with infinite hope  he hastened out of the kitchen with the happy glance he never failed to give the livingroomits redpapered walls with shiny imitationoak woodwork the rows of steins on the platerack the imitationoak diningtable with a vase of newly dusted paper roses the morris chair with nellys sewing on a tiny wicker table beside it the large giltframed oleograph of pikes peak by moonlight  he clattered down the slate treads of the stairs  he fairly vaulted out of doors  he stopped startled  across the ragged vacant lots to the west a vast sunset processional marched down the sky  it had not been visible from their flat which looked across east river to the tame grassy shore of a realestate boomers suburb  gee he mourned its the first time ive noticed a sunset for a month  i used to see knights flags and mandalay and all sorts of stuff in sunsets  wistfully the exile gazed at his lost kingdom till the october chill aroused him  but he learned a new way to cook eggs from the proprietor of the delicatessen store and his plans for spending the evening playing pinochle with nelly and reading the evening paper aloud set him chuckling softly to himself as he hurried home through the brisk autumn breeze with seven cents worth of potato salad  the end
