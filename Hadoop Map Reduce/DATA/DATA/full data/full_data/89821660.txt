theatre  i had promised to take mrs latham and irene to see the french plays which were then being acted by marie lerouxs celebrated palais royal company i wasnt at the time exactly engaged to poor irene it has always been a comfort to me that i wasnt engaged to her though i knew irene herself considered it practically equivalent to an understood engagement we had known one another intimately from childhood upward for the lathams were a sort of second cousins of ours three times removed and we had always called one another by our christian names and been very fond of one another in a simple girlish and boyish fashion as long as we could either of us remember still i maintain there was no definite understanding between us and if mrs latham thought i had been paying irene attentions she must have known that a young man of two and twenty with a decent fortune and a nice estate down in devonshire was likely to look about him for a while before he thought of settling down and marrying quietly  i had brought the yacht up to london bridge and was living on board in picnic style and running about town casually when i took irene and her mother to see faustine at the ambiguities as soon as we had got in and taken our places irene whispered to me touching my hand lightly with her fan just look at the very dark girl on the other side of you harry did you ever in your life see anybody so perfectly beautiful  it has always been a great comfort to me too that irene herself was the first person to call my attention to césarine vivians extraordinary beauty  i turned round as if by accident and gave a passing glance where irene waved her fan at the girl beside me she was beautiful certainly in a terrible grand statuesque style of beauty and i saw at a glimpse that she had southern blood in her veins perhaps negro perhaps moorish perhaps only spanish or italian or provençal her features were proud and somewhat jewishlooking her eyes large dark and haughty her black hair waved slightly in sinuous undulations as it passed across her high broad forehead her complexion though a dusky olive in tone was clear and rich and daintily transparent and her lips were thin and very slightly curled at the delicate corners with a peculiarly imperious and almost scornful expression of fixed disdain i had never before beheld anywhere such a magnificently repellent specimen of womanhood for a second or so as i looked her eyes met mine with a defiant inquiry and i was conscious that moment of some strange and weird fascination in her glance that seemed to draw me irresistibly towards her at the same time that i hardly dared to fix my gaze steadily upon the piercing eyes that looked through and through me with their keen penetration  shes very beautiful no doubt i whispered back to irene in a low undertone though i must confess i dont exactly like the look of her shes a trifle too much of a tragedy queen for my taste a lady macbeth or a beatrice cenci or a clytemnestra i prefer our simple little english prettiness to this southern splendour its more to our english liking than these tall and stately italian enchantresses besides i fancy the girl looks as if she had a drop or two of black blood somewhere about her  oh no irene cried warmly impossible harry shes exquisite exquisite italian you know or something of that sort italian girls have always got that peculiar gipsylike type of beauty  low as we spoke the girl seemed to know by instinct we were talking about her for she drew away the ends of her light wrap coldly in a significant fashion and turned with her operaglass in the opposite direction as if on purpose to avoid looking towards us  a minute later the curtain rose and the first act of halévys faustine distracted my attention for the moment from the beautiful stranger  marie leroux took the part of the great empress she was grand stately imposing no doubt but somehow it seemed to me she didnt come up quite so well as usual that evening to ones ideal picture of the terrible audacious superb roman woman i leant over and murmured so to irene dont you know why irene whispered back to me with a faint movement of the playbill toward the beautiful stranger  no i answered i havent really the slightest conception  why she whispered smiling just look beside you could anybody bear comparison for a moment as a faustine with that splendid creature in the stall next to you  i stole a glance sideways as she spoke it was quite true the girl by my side was the real faustine the exact embodiment of the dramatists creation and marie leroux with her stagey effects and her actresss pretences could not in any way stand the contrast with the genuine empress who sat there eagerly watching her  the girl saw me glance quickly from her towards the actress and from the actress back to her and shrank aside not with coquettish timidity but half angrily and half as if flattered and pleased at the implied compliment papa she said to the very englishlooking gentleman who sat beyond her ce monsieurci i couldnt catch the end of the sentence  she was french then not italian or spanish yet a more perfect englishman than the man she called papa it would be difficult to discover on a long summers day in all london  my dear her father whispered back in english if i were you and the rest of that sentence also was quite inaudible to me  my interest was now fully roused in the beautiful stranger who sat evidently with her father and sister and drank in every word of the play as it proceeded with the intensest interest as for me i hardly cared to look at the actors so absorbed was i in my queenly neighbour i made a bare pretence of watching the stage every five minutes and saying a few words now and again to irene or her mother but my real attention was all the time furtively directed to the girl beside me not that i was taken with her quite the contrary she distinctly repelled me but she seemed to exercise over me for all that the same strange and indescribable fascination which is often possessed by some horrible sight that you would give worlds to avoid and yet cannot for your life help intently gazing upon  between the third and fourth acts irene whispered to me again i cant keep my eyes off her harry shes wonderfully beautiful confess now arent you over head and ears in love with her  i looked at irenes sweet little peaceful english face and i answered truthfully no irene if i wanted to fall in love i should find somebody  nonsense harry irene cried blushing a little and holding up her fan before her nervously shes a thousand times prettier and handsomer in every way  prettier  than i am  at that moment the curtain rose and marie leroux came forward once more with her imperial diadem in the very act of defying and bearding the enraged emperor  it was a great scene the whole theatre hung upon her words for twenty minutes the effect was sublime even i myself felt my interest aroused at last in the consummate spectacle i glanced round to observe my neighbour she sat there straining her gaze upon the stage and heaving her bosom with suppressed emotion in a second the spell was broken again beside that tall dark southern girl in her queenly beauty with her flashing eyes and quivering nostrils intensely moved by the passion of the play the mere actress who mouthed and gesticulated before us by the footlights was as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal my companion in the stalls was the genuine faustine the player on the stage was but a false pretender  as i looked a cry arose from the wings a hushed cry at first a buzz or hum rising louder and ever louder still as a red glare burst upon the scene from the background then a voice from the side boxes rang out suddenly above the confused murmur and the ranting of the actors fire fire  almost before i knew what had happened the mob in the stalls like the mob in the gallery was surging and swaying wildly towards the exits in a general struggle for life of the fierce old selfish barbaric pattern dense clouds of smoke rolled from the stage and filled the length and breadth of the auditorium tongues of flame licked up the pasteboard scenes and hangings like so much paper women screamed and fought and fainted men pushed one another aside and hustled and elbowed in one wild effort to make for the doors at all hazards to the lives of their neighbours never before had i so vividly realized how near the savage lies to the surface in our best and highest civilized society i had to realize it still more vividly and more terribly afterwards  one person alone i observed calm and erect resisting quietly all pushes and thrusts and moving with slow deliberateness to the door as if wholly unconcerned at the universal noise and hubbub and tumult around her it was the dark girl from the stalls beside me  for myself my one thought of course was for poor irene and mrs latham fortunately i am a strong and wellbuilt man and by keeping the two women in front of me and thrusting hard with my elbows on either side to keep off the crush i managed to make a tolerably clear road for them down the central row of stalls and out on to the big external staircase the dark girl now separated from her father and sister by the rush was close in front of me by a careful side movement i managed to include her also in our party she looked up to me gratefully with her big eyes and her mouth broke into a charming smile as she turned and said in perfect english i am much obliged to you for your kind assistance irenes cheek was pale as death but through the strange young ladys olive skin the bright blood still burned and glowed amid that frantic panic as calmly as ever  we had reached the bottom of the steps and were out into the front when suddenly the strange lady turned around and gave a little cry of disappointment mes lorgnettes mes lorgnettes she said then glancing round carelessly to me she went on in english i have left my operaglasses inside on the vacant seat i think if you will excuse me ill go back and fetch them  its impossible i cried my dear madam utterly impossible theyll crush you underfoot theyll tear you to pieces  she smiled a strange haughty smile as if amused at the idea but merely answered i think not and tried to pass lightly by me  i held her arm i didnt know then she was as strong as i was dont go i said imploringly they will certainly kill you it would be impossible to stem a mob like this one  she smiled again and darted back in silence before i could stop her  irene and mrs latham were now fairly out of all danger go on irene i said loosing her arm policeman get these ladies safely out i must go back and take care of that mad woman  go go quick irene cried if you dont go shell be killed harry  i rushed back wildly after her battling as well as i was able against the frantic rush of panicstricken fugitives and found my companion struggling still upon the main staircase i helped her to make her way back into the burning theatre and she ran lightly through the dense smoke to the stall she had occupied and took the operaglasses from the vacant place then she turned to me once more with a smile of triumph people lose their heads so she said in all these crushes i came back on purpose to show papa i wasnt going to be frightened into leaving my operaglasses i should have been eternally ashamed of myself if i had come away and left them in the theatre  quick i answered gasping for breath if you dont make haste we shall be choked to death or the roof itself will fall in upon us and crush us  she looked up where i pointed with a hasty glance and then made her way back again quickly to the staircase as we hurried out the timbers of the stage were beginning to fall in and the engines were already playing fiercely upon the raging flames i took her hand and almost dragged her out into the open when we reached the strand we were both wet through and terribly blackened with smoke and ashes pushing our way through the dense crowd i called a hansom she jumped in lightly thank you so much she said quite carelessly will you kindly tell him where to drive twentyseven seymour crescent  ill see you home if youll allow me i answered under these circumstances i trust i may be permitted  as you like she said smiling enchantingly you are very good my name is césarine vivian papa will be very much obliged to you for your kind assistance  i drove round to the lathams after dropping miss vivian at her fathers door to assure myself of irenes safety and to let them know of my own return unhurt from my perilous adventure irene met me on the doorstep pale as death still thank heaven she cried harry youre safe back again and that poor girl what has become of her  i left her i said at seymour crescent  irene burst into a flood of tears oh harry she cried i thought she would have been killed there it was brave of you indeed to help her through with it   ii  next day mr vivian called on me at the oxford and cambridge the address on the card i had given his daughter i was in the club when he called and i found him a pleasant goodnatured cornishman with very little that was strange or romantic in any way about him he thanked me heartily but not too effusively for the care i had taken of miss vivian overnight and he was not so overcome with parental emotion as not to smoke a very good havana or to refuse my offer of a brandy and seltzer we got on very well together and i soon gathered from what my new acquaintance said that though he belonged to one of the best families in cornwall he had been an english merchant in haiti and had made his money chiefly in the coffee trade he was a widower i learned incidentally and his daughters had been brought up for some years in england though at their mothers request they had also passed part of their lives in convent schools in paris and rouen mrs vivian was a haitian you know he said casually catholic of course the girls are catholics theyre good girls though theyre my own daughters and césarine your friend of last night is supposed to be clever im no judge myself i dont know about it oh by the way césarine said she hadnt thanked you half enough herself yesterday and i was to be sure and bring you round this afternoon to a cup of tea with us at seymour crescent  in spite of the impression mdlle césarine had made upon me the night before i somehow didnt feel at all desirous of meeting her again i was impressed it is true but not favourably there seemed to me something uncanny and weird about her which made me shrink from seeing anything more of her if i could possibly avoid it and as it happened i was luckily engaged that very afternoon to tea at irenes i made the excuse and added somewhat pointedlyon purpose that it might be repeated to mdlle césarinemiss latham is a very old and particular friend of minea friend whom i couldnt for worlds think of disappointing  mr vivian laughed the matter off i shall catch it from césarine he said goodhumouredly for not bringing her cavalier to receive her formal thanks in person our westindian born girls you know are very imperious but if you cant you cant of course so theres an end of it and its no use talking any more about it  i cant say why but at that moment in spite of my intense desire not to meet césarine again i felt i would have given whole worlds if he would have pressed me to come in spite of myself but as it happened he didnt  at five oclock i drove round in a hansom as arranged to irenes having almost made up my mind if i found her alone to come to a definite understanding with her and call it an engagement she wasnt alone however as i entered the drawingroom i saw a tall and graceful lady sitting opposite her holding a cup of tea and with her back towards me the lady rose moved round and bowed to my immense surprise i found it was césarine  i noted to myself at the moment too that in my heart though i had seen her but once before i thought of her already simply as césarine and i was pleased to see her fascinated spellbound  césarine smiled at my evident surprise papa and i met miss latham this afternoon in bond street she said gaily in answer to my mute inquiry and we stopped and spoke to one another of course about last night and papa said you couldnt come round to tea with us in the crescent because you were engaged already to miss latham and miss latham very kindly asked me to drive over and take tea with her as i was so anxious to thank you once more for your great kindness to me yesterday  and miss vivian was good enough to waive all ceremony irene put in and come round to us as you see without further introduction  i stopped and talked all the time i was there to irene but somehow whatever i said césarine managed to intercept it and i caught myself quite guiltily looking at her from time to time with an inexpressible attraction that i could not account for  byandby mr vivians carriage called for césarine and i was left a few minutes alone with irene  well what do you think of her irene asked me simply  i turned my eyes away i dare not meet hers i think shes very handsome i replied evasively  handsome i should think so shes wonderful shes splendid and doesnt she talk magnificently too harry  shes clever certainly i answered shuffling but i dont know why i mistrust her irene  i rose and stood by the door with my hat in my hand hesitating and trembling i felt as if i had something to say to irene and yet i was half afraid to venture upon saying it my fingers quivered a thing very unusual with me at last i came closer to her after a long pause and said irene  irene started and the colour flushed suddenly into her cheeks yes harry she answered tremulously  i dont know why but i couldnt utter it it was but to say i love you yet i hadnt the courage i stood there like a fool looking at her irresolutely and then  the door opened suddenly and mrs latham entered and interrupted us   iii  i didnt speak again to irene the reason was that three days later i received a little note of invitation to lunch at seymour crescent from césarine vivian  i didnt want to accept it and yet i didnt know how to help myself i went determined beforehand as soon as ever lunch was over to take away the yacht to the scotch islands and leave césarine and all her enchantments for ever behind me i was afraid of her thats the fact positively afraid of her i couldnt look her in the face without feeling at once that she exerted a terrible influence over me  the lunch went off quietly enough however we talked about haiti and the west indies about the beautiful foliage and the lovely flowers about the moonlight nights and the tropical sunsets and césarine grew quite enthusiastic over them all you should take your yacht out there some day mr tristram she said softly there is no place on earth so wild and glorious as our own beautiful neglected haiti  she lifted her eyes full upon me as she spoke i stammered out like one spellbound i must certainly go on your recommendation mdlle césarine  why mademoiselle she asked quickly then perceiving i misunderstood her by the start i gave she added with a blush i mean why not miss vivian in plain english  because you arent english i said confusedly youre haitian in reality nobody could ever for a moment take you for a mere englishwoman  i meant it for a compliment but césarine frowned i saw i had hurt her and why but i did not apologize yet i was conscious of having done something very wrong and i knew i must try my best at once to regain my lost favour with her  you will take some coffee after lunch césarine said as the dishes were removed  oh certainly my dear her father put in you must show mr tristram how we make coffee in the west indian fashion  césarine smiled and poured it outblack coffee very strong and into each cup she poured a little glass of excellent pale neat cognac it seemed to me that she poured the cognac like a conjurors trick but everything about her was so strange and lurid that i took very little notice of the matter at that particular moment it certainly was delicious coffee i never tasted anything like it  after lunch we went into the drawingroom and thence césarine took me alone into the pretty conservatory she wanted to show me some of her beautiful haitian orchids she said she had brought the orchids herself years ago from haiti how long we stood there i could never tell i seemed as if intoxicated with her presence i had forgotten now all about my distrust of her i had forgotten all about irene and what i wished to say to her i was conscious only of césarines great dark eyes looking through and through me with their piercing glance and césarines figure tall and stately but very voluptuous standing close beside me and heaving regularly as we looked at the orchids she talked to me in a low and dreamy voice and whether the château larose at lunch had got into my head or whatever it might be i felt only dimly and faintly aware of what was passing around me i was unmanned with love i suppose but however it may have been i certainly moved and spoke that afternoon like a man in a trance from which he cannot by any effort of his own possibly awake himself  yes yes i overheard césarine saying at last as through a mist of emotion you must go some day and see our beautiful mountainous haiti i must go myself i long to go again i dont care for this gloomy dull sunless england a hand seems always to be beckoning me there i shall obey it some day for haitiour lovely haiti is too beautiful  her voice was low and marvellously musical mademoiselle césarine i began timidly  she pouted and looked at me mademoiselle again she said in a pettish way i told you not to call me so didnt i  well then césarine i went on boldly she laughed low a little laugh of triumph but did not correct or check me in any way  césarine i continued lingering i know not why over the syllables of the name i will go as you say i shall see haiti why should we not both go together  she looked up at me eagerly with a sudden look of hushed inquiry you mean it she asked trembling visibly you mean it mr tristram you know what you are saying  césarine i answered i mean it i know it i cannot go away from you and leave you something seems to tie me i am not my own master césarine i love you  my head whirled as i said the words but i meant them at the time and heaven knows i tried ever after to live up to them  she clutched my arm convulsively for a moment her face was aglow with a wonderful light and her eyes burned like a pair of diamonds but the other girl she cried her miss latham the one you call irene you are  in love with her are you not tell me  i have never proposed to irene i replied slowly i have never asked any other woman but you to marry me césarine  she answered me nothing but my face was very near hers and i bent forward and kissed her suddenly to my immense surprise instead of struggling or drawing away she kissed me back a fervent kiss with lips hard pressed to mine and the tears trickled slowly down her cheeks in a strange fashion you are mine she cried mine for ever i have won you she shall not have you i knew you were mine the moment i looked upon you the hand beckoned me i knew i should get you  come up into my den mr tristram and have a smoke my host interrupted in his bluff voice putting his head in unexpectedly at the conservatory door i think i can offer you a capital manilla  the sound woke me as if from some terrible dream and i followed him still in a sort of stupor up to the smoking room   iv  that very evening i went to see irene my brain was whirling even yet and i hardly knew what i was doing but the cool air revived me a little and by the time i reached the lathams i almost felt myself again  irene came down to the drawingroom to see me alone i saw what she expected and the shame of my duplicity overcame me utterly  i took both her hands in mine and stood opposite her ashamed to look her in the face and with the terrible confession weighing me down like a burden of guilt irene i blurted out without preface or comment i have just proposed to césarine vivian  irene drew back a moment and took a long breath then she said with a tremor in her voice but without a tear or a cry i expected it harry i thought you meant it i saw you were terribly horribly in love with her  irene i cried passionately and remorsefully flinging myself upon the sofa in an agony of repentance i do not love her i have never cared for her im afraid of her fascinated by her i love you irene you and you only the moment im away from her i hate her i hate her for heavens sake tell me what am i to do i do not love her i hate her irene  irene came up to me and soothed my hair tenderly with her hand dont harry she said with sisterly kindliness dont speak so dont give way to it i know what you feel i know what you think but i am not angry with you you mustnt talk like that if she has accepted you you must go and marry her i have nothing to reproach you with nothing nothing never say such words to me again let us be as we have always been friends only  irene i cried lifting up my head and looking at her wildly it is the truth i do not love her except when i am with her and then some strange enchantment seems to come over me i dont know what it is but i cant escape it in my heart irene in my heart of hearts i love you and you only i can never love her as i love you irene my darling my darling tell me how to get myself away from her  hush irene said laying her hand on mine persuasively youre excited tonight harry you are flushed and feverish you dont know what youre saying you mustnt talk so if you do youll make me hate you and despise you you must keep your word now and marry miss vivian   v  the next six weeks seem to me still like a vague dream everything happened so hastily and strangely i got a note next day from irene it was very short dearest harrymamma and i think under the circumstances it would be best for us to leave london for a few weeks i am not angry with you with best love ever yours affectionately irene  i was wild when i received it i couldnt bear to part so with irene i would find out where they were going and follow them immediately i would write a note and break off my mad engagement with césarine i must have been drunk or insane when i made it i couldnt imagine what i could have been doing  on my way round to inquire at the lathams a carriage came suddenly upon me at a sharp corner a lady bowed to me from it it was césarine with her father they pulled up and spoke to me from that moment my doom was sealed the old fascination came back at once and i followed césarine blindly home to her house to luncheon her accepted lover  in six weeks more we were really married  the first seven or eight months of our married life passed away happily enough as soon as i was actually married to césarine that strange feeling i had at first experienced about her slowly wore off in the closer commonplace daily intercourse of married life i almost smiled at myself for ever having felt it césarine was so beautiful and so queenly a person that when i took her down home to devonshire and introduced her to the old manor i really found myself immensely proud of her everybody at teignbury was delighted and struck with her and what was a great deal more to the point i began to discover that i was positively in love with her myself into the bargain she softened and melted immensely on nearer acquaintance the faustina air faded slowly away when one saw her in her own home among her own occupations and i came to look on her as a beautiful simple innocent girl delighted with all our country pleasures fond of a breezy canter on the slopes of dartmoor and taking an affectionate interest in the ducks and chickens which i could hardly ever have conceived even as possible when i first saw her in seymour crescent the imperious mysterious terrible césarine disappeared entirely and i found in her place to my immense relief that i had married a graceful gentle tenderhearted english girl with just a pleasant occasional touch of southern fire and impetuosity  as winter came round again however césarines cheeks began to look a little thinner than usual and she had such a constant troublesome cough that i began to be a trifle alarmed at her strange symptoms césarine herself laughed off my fears its nothing harry she would say nothing at all i assure you dear a few good rides on the moor will set me right again its all the result of that horrid london im a countryborn girl and i hate big towns i never want to live in town again harry  i called in our best exeter doctor and he largely confirmed césarines own simple view of the situation theres nothing organically wrong with mrs tristrams constitution he said confidently no weakness of the lungs or heart in any way she has merely run downoutlived her strength a little a winter in some warm genial climate would set her up again i havent the least hesitation in saying  let us go to algeria with the yacht reeney i suggested much reassured  why algeria césarine replied with brightening eyes oh harry why not dear old haiti you said once you would go there with meyou remember when darling why not keep your promise now and go there i want to go there harry im longing to go there and she held out her delicately moulded hand in front of her as if beckoning me and drawing me on to haiti after her  ah yes why not the west indies the exeter doctor answered meditatively i think i understood you that mrs tristram is west indian born quite so quite so her native air depend upon it thats the best place for her by all means i should say try haiti  i dont know why but the notion for some reason displeased me immensely there was something about césarines eyes somehow when she beckoned with her hand in that strange fashion which reminded me exactly of the weird uncanny indescribable impression she had made upon me when i first knew her still i was very fond of césarine and if she and the doctor were both agreed that haiti would be the very best place for her it would be foolish and wrong for me to interfere with their joint wisdom depend upon it a woman often knows what is the matter with her better than any man even her husband can possibly tell her  the end of it all was that in less than a month from that day we were out in the yacht on the broad atlantic with the cliffs of falmouth and the lizard point fading slowly behind us in the distance and the white spray dashing in front of us like fingers beckoning us on to haiti   vi  the bay of portauprince is hot and simmering a deep basin enclosed in a ringing semicircle of mountains with scarce a breath blowing on the harbour and with tall cocoanut palms rising unmoved into the still air above on the low sandspits that close it in to seaward the town itself is wretched squalid and hopelessly ramshackled a despondent collection of tumbledown wooden houses interspersed with indescribable negro huts mere human rabbithutches where parents and children herd together in one higgledypiggledy tropical confusion i had never in my days seen anything more painfully desolate and dreary and i feared that césarine who had not been here since she was a girl of fourteen would be somewhat depressed at the horrid actuality after her exalted fanciful ideals of the remembered haiti but to my immense surprise as it turned out césarine did not appear at all shocked or taken aback at the squalor and wretchedness all around her on the contrary the very air of the place seemed to inspire her from the first with fresh vigour her cough disappeared at once as if by magic and the colour returned forthwith to her cheeks almost as soon as we had fairly cast anchor in haitian waters  the very first day we arrived at portauprince césarine said to me with more shyness than i had ever yet seen her exhibit if you wouldnt mind it harry i should like to go at once this morningand see my grandmother  i started with astonishment your grandmother césarine i cried incredulously my darling i didnt know you had a grandmother living  yes i have she answered with some slight hesitation and i think if you wouldnt object to it harry id rather go and see her alone the first time at least please dearest  in a moment the obvious truth which i had always known in a vague sort of fashion but never thoroughly realized flashed across my mind in its full vividness and i merely bowed my head in silence it was natural she should not wish me to see her meeting with her haitian grandmother  she went alone through the streets of portauprince without inquiry like one who knew them familiarly of old and i dogged her footsteps at a distance unperceived impelled by the same strange fascination which had so often driven me to follow césarine wherever she led me after a few hundred yards she turned out of the chief business place and down a tumbledown alley of scattered negro cottages till she came at last to a rather better house that stood by itself in a little dusty garden of guavatrees and cocoanuts a rude paling built negrowise of broken barrelstaves nailed rudely together separated the garden from the compound next to it i slipped into the compound before césarine observed me beckoned the lazy negro from the door of the hut with one finger placed as a token of silence upon my lips dropped a dollar into his open palm and stood behind the paling looking out into the garden beside me through a hole made by a knot in one of the barrel staves  césarine knocked with her hand at the door and in a moment was answered by an old negress tall and bony dressed in a loose sacklike gown of coarse cotton print with a big red bandanna tied around her short grey hair and a huge silver cross dangling carelessly upon her bare and wrinkled black neck she wore no sleeves and bracelets of strange beads hung loosely around her shrunken and skinny wrists a more hideous old hag i had never in my life beheld before and yet i saw without waiting to observe it that she had césarines great dark eyes and even white teeth and something of césarines figure lingered still in her lithe and sinuous yet erect carriage  grandmère césarine said convulsively flinging her arms with wild delight around that grim and withered gaunt black woman it seemed to me she had never since our marriage embraced me with half the fervour she bestowed upon this hideous old african witch creature  hé césarine it is thee then my little one the old negress cried out suddenly in her thin high voice and her muffled haitian patois i did not expect thee so soon my cabbage thou hast come early be the welcome one my granddaughter  i reeled with horror as i saw the wrinkled and haggard african kissing once more my beautiful césarine it seemed to me a horrible desecration i had always known of course since césarine was a quadroon that her grandmother on one side must necessarily have been a fullblooded negress but i had never yet suspected the reality could be so hideous so terrible as this  i crouched down speechless against the paling in my disgust and astonishment and motioned with my hand to the negro in the hut to remain perfectly quiet the door of the house closed and césarine disappeared but i waited there as if chained to the spot under a hot and burning tropical sun for fully an hour unconscious of anything in heaven or earth save the shock and surprise of that unexpected disclosure  at last the door opened again and césarine apparently came out once more into the neighbouring garden the gaunt negress followed her close with one arm thrown caressingly about her beautiful neck and shoulders in london césarine would not have permitted anybody but a great lady to take such a liberty with her but here in haiti she submitted to the old negresss horrid embraces with perfect calmness why should she not indeed it was her own grandmother  they came close up to the spot where i was crouching in the thick drifted dust behind the low fence and then i heard rather than saw that césarine had flung herself passionately down upon her knees on the ground and was pouring forth a muttered prayer in a tongue unknown to me and full of harsh and uncouth gutturals it was not latin it was not even the coarse creole french the negro patois in which i heard the people jabbering to one another loudly in the streets around me it was some still more hideous and barbaric language a mass of clicks and inarticulate noises such as i could never have believed might possibly proceed from césarines thin and scornful lips  at last she finished and i heard her speaking again to her grandmother in the creole dialect grandmother you will pray and get me one you will not forget me a boy a pretty one an heir to my husband it was said wistfully with an infinite longing i knew then why she had grown so pale and thin and haggard before we sailed away from england  the old hag answered in the same tongue but in her shrill withered note you will bring him up to the religion my little one will you  césarine seemed to bow her head i will she said he shall follow the religion mr tristram shall never know anything about it  they went back once more into the house and i crept away afraid of being discovered and returned to the yacht sick at heart not knowing how i should ever venture again to meet césarine  but when i got back and had helped myself to a glass of sherry to steady my nerves from the little flask on césarines dressingtable i thought to myself hideous as it all seemed it was very natural césarine should wish to see her grandmother after all was it not better that proud and haughty as she was she should not disown her own flesh and blood and yet the memory of my beautiful césarine wrapped in that hideous old black womans arms made the blood curdle in my very veins  as soon as césarine returned however gayer and brighter than i had ever seen her the old fascination overcame me once more and i determined in my heart to stifle the horror i could not possibly help feeling and that evening as i sat alone in the cabin with my wife i said to her césarine we have never spoken about the religious question before but if it should be ordained we are ever to have any little ones of our own i should wish them to be brought up in their mothers creed you could make them better catholics i take it than i could ever make them christians of any sort  césarine answered never a word but to my intense surprise she burst suddenly into a flood of tears and flung herself sobbing on the cabin floor at my feet in an agony of tempestuous cries and writhings   vii  a few days later when we had settled down for a three months stay at a little bungalow on the green hills behind portauprince césarine said to me early in the day i want to go away today harry up into the mountains to the chapel of notre dame de bon secours  i bowed my head in acquiescence i can guess why you want to go reeney i answered gently you want to pray there about something thats troubling you and if im not mistaken its the same thing that made you cry the other evening when i spoke to you down yonder in the cabin  the tears rose hastily once more into césarines eyes and she cried in a low distressed voice harry harry dont talk to me so you are too good to me you will kill me you will kill me  i lifted her head from the table where she had buried it in her arms and kissed her tenderly reeney i said i know how you feel and i hope notre dame will listen to your prayers and send you what you ask of her but if not you need never be afraid that i shall love you any the less than i do at present  césarine burst into a fresh flood of tears no harry she said you dont know about it you cant imagine it to us you know who have the blood of africa running in our veins it is not a mere matter of fancy it is an eternal disgrace for any woman of our race and descent not to be a mother i cannot help it it is the instinct of my people we are all born so we cannot feel otherwise  it was the only time either of us ever alluded in speaking with one another to the sinister half of césarines pedigree  you will let me go with you to the mountains reeney i asked ignoring her remark you mustnt go so far by yourself darling  no harry you cant come with me it would make my prayers ineffectual dearest you are a heretic you know harry you are not catholic notre dame wont listen to my prayer if i take you with me on my pilgrimage my darling  i saw her mind was set upon it and i didnt interfere she would be away all night she said there was a resthouse for pilgrims attached to the chapel and she would be back again at maisonette our bungalow the morning after  that afternoon she started on her way on a mountain pony i had just bought for her accompanied only by a negro maid i couldnt let her go quite unattended through those lawless paths beset by cottages of half savage africans so i followed at a distance aided by a black groom and tracked her road along the endless hillsides up to a fork in the way where the narrow bridlepath divided into two one of which bore away to leftward leading my guide told me to the chapel of notre dame de bon secours  at that point the guide halted he peered with hand across his eyebrows among the tangled brake of treeferns with a terrified look then he shook his woolly black head ominously i cant go on monsieur he said turning to me with an unfeigned shudder madame has not taken the path of our lady she has gone to the left along the other road which leads at last to the vaudoux temple  i looked at him incredulously i had heard before of vaudoux it is the hideous african canibalistic witchcraft of the relapsing halfheathen haitian negroes but césarine a vaudoux worshipper it was too ridiculous the man must be mistaken or else césarine had taken the wrong road by some slight accident  next moment a horrible unspeakable doubt seized upon me irresistibly what was the unknown shrine in her grandmothers garden at which césarine had prayed in those awful gutturals whatever it was i would probe this mystery to the very bottom i would know the truth come what might of it  go you coward i said to the negro i have no further need of you i will make my way alone to the vaudoux temple  monsieur the man cried trembling visibly in every limb they will tear you to pieces if they ever discover you near the temple they will offer you up as a victim to the vaudoux  pooh i answered contemptuous of the fellows slavish terror where madame a woman dares to go i her husband am certainly not afraid to follow her  monsieur he replied throwing himself submissively in the dust on the path before me madame is creole she has the blood of the vaudoux worshippers flowing in her veins nobody will hurt her she is free of the craft but monsieur is a pure white and uninitiated if the vaudoux people catch him at their rites they will rend him in pieces and offer his blood as an expiation to the unspeakable one  go i said with a smile turning my horses head up the righthand path toward the vaudoux temple i am not afraid i will come back again to maisonette tomorrow  i followed the path through a tortuous maze beset with prickly cactus agave and fernbrake till i came at last to a spur of the hill where a white wooden building gleamed in front of me in the full slanting rays of tropical sunset a skull was fastened to the lintel of the door i knew at once it was the vaudoux temple  i dismounted at once and led my horse aside into the brake though i tore his legs and my own as i went with the spines of the cactus plants and tying him by the bridle to a mountain cabbage palm in a spot where the thick underbrush completely hid us from view i lay down and waited patiently for the shades of evening  it was a moonless night according to the vaudoux fashion and i knew from what i had already read in west indian books that the orgies would not commence till midnight  from time to time i rubbed a fusee against my hand without lighting it and by the faint glimmer of the phosphorus on my palm i was able to read the figures of my watch dial without exciting the attention of the neighbouring vaudoux worshippers  hour after hour went slowly by and i crouched there still unseen among the agave thicket at last as the hands of the watch reached together the point of twelve i heard a low but deep rumbling noise coming ominously from the vaudoux temple i recognized at once the familiar sound it was the note of the bullroarer that mystic instrument of pointed wood whirled by a string round the head of the hierophant by whose aid savages in their secret rites summon to their shrines their gods and spirits i had often made one myself for a toy when i was a boy in england  i crept out through the tangled brake and cautiously approached the back of the building a sentinel was standing by the door in front a powerful negro armed with revolver and cutlas i skulked round noiselessly to the rear and lifting myself by my hands to the level of the one tiny window i peered in through a slight scratch on the white paint with which the glass was covered internally  i only saw the sight within for a second then my brain reeled and my fingers refused any longer to hold me but in that second i had read the whole terrible incredible truth i knew what sort of a woman she really was whom i had blindly taken as the wife of my bosom  before a rude stone altar covered with stuffed alligator skins human bones live snakes and hideous sorts of african superstition a tall and withered black woman stood erect naked as she came from her mothers womb one skinny arm raised aloft and the other holding below some dark object that writhed and struggled awfully in her hand on the slab of the altar even as she held it i saw in a flash of the torches behind it was the black hag i had watched before at the portauprince cottage  beside her whiter of skin and faultless of figure stood a younger woman beautiful to behold imperious and haughty still like a greek statue unmoved before that surging horrid background of naked black and cringing savages her head was bent and her hand pressed convulsively against the swollen veins in her throbbing brow and i saw at once it was my own wifea vaudoux worshippercésarine tristram  in another flash i knew the black woman had a sharp flint knife in her uplifted hand and the dark object in the other hand i recognized with a thrill of unspeakable horror as a negro girl of four years old or thereabouts gagged and bound and lying on the altar  before i could see the sharp flint descend upon the naked breast of the writhing victim my fingers in mercy refused to bear me and i fell half fainting on the ground below too shocked and unmanned even to crawl away at once out of reach of the awful unrealizable horror  but by the sounds within i knew they had completed their hideous sacrifice and that they were smearing over césarinemy own wifethe woman of my choicewith the warm blood of the human victim  sick and faint i crept away slowly through the tangled underbrush tearing my skin as i went with the piercing cactus spines untied my horse from the spot where i had fastened him and rode him down without drawing rein cantering round sharp angles and down horrible ledges till he stood at last white with foam by the grey dawn in front of the little piazza at maisonette   viii  that night the thunder roared and the lightning played with tropical fierceness round the tall hilltops away in the direction of the vaudoux temple the rain came down in fearful sheets and the torrents roared and foamed in cataracts and tore away great gaps in the rough paths on the steep hillsides but at eight oclock in the morning césarine returned drenched with wet and with a strange frown upon her haughty forehead  i did not know how to look at her or how to meet her  my prayers are useless she muttered angrily as she entered some heretic must have followed me unseen to the chapel of notre dame de bon secours the pilgrimage is a failure  you are wet i said trembling change your things césarine i could not pretend to speak gently to her  she turned upon me with a fierce look in her big black eyes her instinct showed her at once i had discovered her secret tell them and hang me she cried fiercely  it was what the law required me to do i was otherwise the accomplice of murder and cannibalism but i could not do it profoundly as i loathed her and hated her presence now i couldnt find it in my heart to give her up to justice as i knew i ought to do  i turned away and answered nothing  presently she came out again from her bedroom with her wet things still dripping around her smoke that she said handing me a tiny cigarette rolled round in a leaf of fresh tobacco  i will not i answered with a vague surmise taking it from her fingers i know the smell it is manchineal you cannot any longer deceive me  she went back to her bedroom once more i sat dazed and stupefied in the bamboo chair on the front piazza what to do i knew not and cared not i was tied to her for life and there was no help for it save by denouncing her to the rude haitian justice  in an hour or more our english maid came out to speak to me im afraid sir she said mrs tristram is getting delirious she seems to be in a high fever shall i ask one of these poor black bodies to go out and get the english doctor  i went into my wifes bedroom césarine lay moaning piteously on the bed in her wet clothes still her cheeks were hot and her pulse was high and thin and feverish i knew without asking what was the matter with her it was yellow fever  the nights exposure in that terrible climate and the ghastly scene she had gone through so intrepidly had broken down even césarines iron constitution  i sent for the doctor and had her put to bed immediately the black nurse and i undressed her between us we found next her bosom tied by a small red silken thread a tiny bone fresh and ruddylooking i knew what it was and so did the negress it was a human fingerbonethe last joint of a small childs fourth finger the negress shuddered and hid her head it is vaudoux monsieur she said i have seen it on others madame has been paying a visit i suppose to her grandmother  for six long endless days and nights i watched and nursed that doomed criminal doing everything for her that skill could direct or care could suggest to me yet all the time fearing and dreading that she might yet recover and not knowing in my heart what either of our lives could ever be like if she did live through it  a merciful providence willed it otherwise  on the sixth day the fatal vomito negro set inthe symptom of the last incurable stage of yellow feverand i knew for certain that césarine would die she had brought her own punishment upon her at midnight that evening she died delirious  thank god she had left no child of mine behind her to inherit the curse her mothers blood had handed down to her   ix  on my return to london whither i went by mail direct leaving the yacht to follow after me i drove straight to the lathams from waterloo station mrs latham was out the servant said but miss irene was in the drawingroom  irene was sitting at the window by herself working quietly at a piece of crewel work she rose to meet me with her sweet simple little english smile i took her hand and pressed it like a brother  i got your telegram she said simply harry i know she is dead but i know something terrible besides has happened tell me all dont be afraid to speak of it before me i am not afraid for my part to listen  i sat down on the sofa beside her and told her all without one word of excuse or concealment from our last parting to the day of césarines death in haiti and she held my hand and listened all the while with breathless wonderment to my strange story  at the end i said irene it has all come and gone between us like a hideous nightmare i cannot imagine even now how that terrible woman with all her power could ever for one moment have bewitched me away from you my beloved my queen my own hearts darling  irene did not try to hush me or to stop me in any way she merely sat and looked at me steadily and said nothing  it was fascination i cried infatuation madness delirium enchantment  it was worse than that harry irene answered rising quietly it was poison it was witchcraft it was sheer african devilry  in a flash of thought i remembered the cup of coffee at seymour crescent the curious sherry at portauprince the cigarette with the manchineal she had given me on the mountains and i saw forthwith that irene with her womans quickness had divined rightly it was more than infatuation it was intoxication with african charms and west indian poisons  what a man does in such a womans hands is not his own doing irene said slowly he has no more control of himself in such circumstances than if she had drugged him with chloroform or opium  then you forgive me irene  i have nothing to forgive harry i am grieved for you i am frightened then bursting into tears my darling my darling i love you i love you     lucretia   i will acknowledge that i was certainly a very young man in the year 67 indeed i was only just turned of twenty and was inordinately proud of a slight downy fringe on my upper lip which i was pleased to speak of as my moustache still i was a sturdy young fellow enough in spite of my consumptive tendencies and not given to groundless fears in a general way but i must allow that i was decidedly frightened by my adventure in the richmond hotel on the christmas eve of that aforesaid year of grace it may be a foolish reminiscence yet i dare say you wont mind listening to it  when i say the richmond hotel you must not understand me to speak of the star and garter in the town of that ilk situated in the county of surrey england the richmond where i passed my uncomfortable christmas eve stands on the banks of the pretty st francis river in lower canada i had gone out to the colony in the autumn of that year to look after a small property of my mothers near kamouraska and i originally intended to spend the winter in quebec but as november and december wore away and the snow grew deeper and deeper upon the plains of abraham i became gradually aware that a canadian winter was not the best adapted tonic in the world for a hearty young man with a slight hereditary predisposition to consumption i had seen enough of arctic life in quebec during those two initial months to give me a good idea of its pleasures and its drawbacks i had steered by taboggan down the icecone at the falls of montmorenci i had driven a sleigh têteàtête with a french canadian belle to a surprise picnic in a house at sainte anne i had skated snowshoed and curled to my hearts content and i had caught my death of cold on the frozen st lawrence not to mention such minor misfortunes as getting my nose ears and feet frostbitten during a driving party up the banks of the chaudière so a few days before christmas i determined to strike south i would go for a tour through virginia and the carolinas to escape the cold weather waiting for the return of the summer sun to catch a glimpse of niagara and the great lakes  for this purpose i must first go to montreal and that being the case what could be more convenient than to spend christmas day itself with the rector at richmond to whom i had letters of introduction his wife being in fact a first cousin of my mothers richmond lies halfway on the grand trunk line between quebec and montreal and it would be more pleasant by breaking my journey there to eat my turkey and plumpudding in a friends family than in that somewhat cheerless hotel the dominion hall so off i started from the point levy station at four oclock on the twentyfourth of december hoping to arrive at my journeys end about one oclock on christmas morning  now those were the days just after the great american civil war when gold was almost unknown either in the states or canada and everybody used greasy dollar notes of uncertain and purely local value hence i was compelled to take the money for expenses on my projected tour in the only form of specie which was available that of solid silver a hundred and fifty pounds in silver dollars amounts to a larger bulk and a heavier weight than you would suppose and i thought it safer to carry the sum in my own hands loosely bundled into a large leather reticule hinc illoe lacrimoethat was the real cause of my nights adventure and of the present story  when i got into the long open american railwaycarriage with its comfortable stove and warm footbricks i found only one seat vacant and that was a red velvet sofa opposite to another occupied by a girl of singular beauty i can remember to this day exactly how she was dressed i dare say my lady readers will think it horribly oldfashioned at the present time but it was the very latest and most enchanting style in the year 67 on her head was a coquettish little cheeseplate bonnet bound round with one of those warm soft fleecy woollen veils or headwraps which canadian girls know as nubias her dress was a short winter walking costume of the period trimmed with fur and vandyked at the bottom so as to show a glimpse of the quilted down petticoat underneath her little highheeled boots displayed by the short costume were buttoned far above the ankle and bound with fur to match the dress while a tiny tassel at the side added just a suspicion of parisian coquetry her cloak was lined with sable or what seemed so to my undiscriminating eyes and her rug was a splendid piece of wolverine skins as to her eyes her lips her figure i had rather not attempt them i can manage clothes but not goddesses altogether quite a dream of canadian beauty not devoid of that indefinable grace which goes only with the french blood  i was not bold in 67 and i would have preferred to take any other seat rather than face this divine apparition but there was no help for it since all the others were filled so i sat down a little sheepishly i dare say almost before we were well out of the station we had got into a conversation and it was she who began it  you are an englishman i think she said looking at me with a frank and pleasant smile  yes i answered colouring though why i should have been ashamed of my nationality for that solitary moment of my life i cannot imagineunless perhaps because she was a canadian but how on earth did you discover it  you would have been more warmly wrapped up if you had lived long in canada she replied in spite of our stoves and hot bricks youll find yourself very cold before you get to your journeys end  yes i said i suppose its rather chilly late at night in these big cars  dreadfully oh quite terribly you ought to have a rug you really ought wont you let me lend you one i have another under the seat here  but you brought that for yourself i interposed you will want it byandby when it gets a little colder  oh no i shant this is warm enough for me its wolverine you have a mother  what an extraordinary question i thought and what an unusually friendly girl was she really quite as simpleminded as she seemed or could she be the designing woman of the novels yes i admitted to her cautiously that i possessed a maternal parent who was at that moment safely drinking her tea in a terrace at south kensington  i have none she said with an emphasis on the personal pronoun and a sort of appealing look in her big eyes but you should take care of yourself for her sake you really must take my rug hundreds oh thousands of young englishmen come out here and kill themselves their first winter by imprudence  thus adjured i accepted the rug with many thanks and apologies and wrapped myself warmly up in the corner with a splendid view of my visàvis  exactly at that moment the ticket collector came round upon his official tour now on american and canadian railways you do not take your ticket beforehand but pay your fare to the collector who walks up and down through the open cars from end to end between every station i lifted up my bag of silver which lay on the seat beside me and imprudently opened it to take out a few dollars full in sight of my enchanting neighbour i saw her look with unaffected curiosity at the heap of coin within and i was proud at being able to give such an unequivocal proof of my high respectabilityfor what better guarantee of all the noblest moral qualities can any man produce all the world over than a bag of dollars  what a lot of money she said as the collector passed on what can you want with it all in coin  im going on a tour in the southern states i confided in reply and i thought it better to take specie i was very proud ten or twelve years ago of that word specie  and i suppose those are your initials on the reticule what a pretty monogram your mother gave you that for a birthday present  you must be a conjurer or a clairvoyant i said smiling so she did and i added that the initials represented my humble patronymic and baptismal designations  my names lucretia said my neighbour artlessly as a child might have said it without a word as to surname or qualifying circumstances and from that moment she became to me simply lucretia i think of her as lucretia to the present day as she spoke she pointed to the word engraved in tiny letters on her pretty silver locket  i suppose she thought my confidence required a little more confidence in return for after a slight pause she repeated once more my names lucretia and i live at richmond  richmond i cried why thats just where im going do you know the rector  mr pritchard oh yes intimately hes our greatest friend are you going to stop with him  for a day or two at least on my way to montreal mrs pritchard is my mothers cousin  how delightful then we may consider ourselves acquaintances but you dont mean to knock them up tonight theyll all be in bed long before one oclock  no i havent even written to tell them i was coming i answered they gave me a general invitation and said i might drop in whenever i pleased  then you must stop at the hotel tonight im going there myself my people keep the hotel  was it possible i was thunderstruck i had pictured lucretia to myself as at least a countess of the ancien régime a few of whom still linger on in montreal and elsewhere her locket her rugs her eyes her chiselled features all of them seemed to me redolent of the old french noblesse and here it turned out that this living angel was only the daughter of an innkeeper but in that primitive and pleasant canadian society such things i thought can easily be no doubt she is the petted child of the house the one heiress of the old mans savings and after spending a winter holiday among the gaieties of quebec she is now returning to pass the christmas season with her own family i will not conceal the fact that i had already fallen over head and ears in love with lucretia at first sight and that frank avowal made me love her all the more besides these canadian hotelkeepers are often very rich and was not her manner perfect and was she not an intimate friend of the rector and his wife all these things showed at least that she was accustomed to refined society i caught myself already speculating as to what my mother would think of such a match  in five minutes it was all arranged about the hotel and i had got into the midst of a swimming conversation with lucretia she told me about herself and her past how she had been educated at a convent in montreal and loved the nuns oh so dearly though she was a protestant herself and only french on her mothers side this i thought was well as a safeguard against parental prejudice she told me all the gossip of richmond and whom i should meet at the rectors and what a dull little town it was but quebec was delightful and montrealoh if she could only live in montreal it would be perfect bliss and so i thought myself if only lucretia would live there with me but i prudently refrained from saying so as i thought it rather premature or perhaps i blushed and stammered too much to get the words out had she ever been in europe no never but she would so like it ah it would be delightful to spend a month or two in paris i suggested with internal pictures of a honeymoon floating through my brain yes that would be most enjoyable she answered altogether lucretia and i kept chatting uninterruptedly the whole way to richmond and the other passengers must have voted us most unconscionable bores for they evidently could not sleep by reason of our incessant talking we did not sleep nor wish to sleep and i am bound to say that a more frankly enchanting or seemingly guileless girl than lucretia i have never met from that day to this  at last we reached richmond depôt as the canadians call the stations very cold and tired externally but lively enough as regards the internal fires we got out and looked after our luggage a sleepy porter promised to bring it next morning to the hotel there were no sleighs in waitingrichmond is too much of a country station for thatso i took my reticule in my hand threw lucretias rug across her shoulders and proceeded to walk with her to the hotel  now the depôt is in a suburb known as melbourne while richmond itself lies on the other side of the river st francis here crossed by a long covered bridge a sort of rough wooden counterpart of the famous one at lucerne as we passed out into the cold night it was snowing heavily and the frost was very bitter lucretia took my arm without a word of prelude as naturally as if she were my sister and guided me through the snowcovered path to the bridge when we got under the shelter of the wooden covering we had to pass through the long dark gallery as black as night heading only for the dim square of moonlight at the other end but lucretia walked and chatted on as unconcernedly as if she had always been in the habit of traversing that lonely tunnellike bridge with a total stranger every evening of her life i confess i was surprised i fancied a prim english girl in a similar situation and i began to wonder whether all this artlessness was really as genuine as it looked  at the opposite end of the bridge we emerged upon a street of wooden frame houses in one of them only was there a light thats the hotel said lucretia nodding towards it and again i suffered a thrill of disappointment i had pictured to myself a great solid building like the st lawrence hall at montreal forgetting that richmond was a mere country village and here i found a bit of a frame cottage as the whole domain of lucretias supposed father it was too awful  we reached the door and entered fresh surprises were in store for me the passage led into a bar where halfadozen french canadians were sitting with bottles and glasses playing some game of cards one rather roughlooking young man jumped up in astonishment as we entered and exclaimed why lucretia we didnt expect you for another hour i meant to take the sleigh for you i could have knocked him down for calling her by her christian name but the conviction flashed upon me that this was lucretias brother he glanced up at the big yankee clock on the mantelpiece which pointed to a quarter past twelve then pulled out his watch and whistled stopped three quarters of an hour ago by jingo was his comment why i forgot to wind it up upon my word lucretia im awfully sorry but who is the gentleman  a friend of the pritchards tom dear who wants a bed here tonight i couldnt imagine why the sleigh didnt come for me its so unlike you not to remember it and she gave him a look to melt adamant  tom was profuse in his apologies and made it quite clear that his intentions at least had been most excellent besides he kissed lucretia with so much brotherly tenderness that i relented of my desire to knock him down then brother and sister retired for a while apparently to see after my bedroom and i was left alone in the bar  i cannot say i liked the look of it the men were drinking whiskey and playing écartétwo bad things i thought in my twentyyearold propriety my dear mother hated gambling which hatred she had instilled into my youthful mind and this was evidently a backwoods gamblinghouse moreover i carried a bag of silver coin quite large enough to make it well worth while to rob me the appearances were clearly against lucretias home but surely lucretia herself was a guarantee for anything  presently tom returned and told me my room was ready i followed him up the stairs with a beating heart and a heavy reticule at the top of the landing lucretia stood smiling my candle in her hand and showed me into the room tom and she looked around to see that all was comfortable and then they both shook hands with me which certainly seemed a curious thing for an innkeeper and his sister as soon as they were gone i began to look about me and consider the situation the room had two doors but the key was gone from both i opened one towards the passage but found no key outside the other which probably communicated with a neighbouring bedroom was locked from the opposite side moreover there had once been a common bolt on this second door but it had been removed i looked close at the screwholes and was sure they were quite fresh could the bolt have been taken off while i was waiting in the bar all at once it flashed upon my mind that i had been imprudently confiding in my disclosures to lucretia i had told her that i carried a hundred and fifty pounds in coin an easy thing to rob and a difficult thing to identify she had heard that nobody was aware of my presence in richmond except herself and her brother i had not written to tell the pritchards i was coming and she knew that i had not told any one of my whereabouts because i did not decide where i should go until i talked with her about the matter no one in canada would miss me if these people chose to murder me for my money and innkeepers often murder their guests i thought nobody would think of inquiring or know where to inquire for me weeks would elapse before my mother wrote from england to ask my whereabouts and by that time all traces might well be lost i left quebec only telling the people at my hotel that i was going to montreal then i thought of lucretias eagerness to get into conversation her observation about my money her suggestion that i should come to the richmond hotel and how could she a small innkeepers daughter afford to get all those fine furs and lockets by fair means did she really know the pritchards or was it likely considering her position all these things came across me in a moment what a fool i had been ever to think of trusting such a girl  i got up and walked about the room it was evidently lucretias own bedroom part of the decoy said i to myself sapiently but could so beautiful a girl really hurt one a piece of music was lying on the dressingtable i took it up and looked at it casually gracious heavens it was a song from lucrezia borgia her very name betrayed her she too was a lucretia i walked over to the mantelpiece a little ivory miniature hung above the centre i gave it a glance as i passed incredible it was the beatrice cenci talk of beautiful women why they poison one they stab one they burn one alive with a smile on their lips lucretia must have a taste for murderesses evidently she is a connoisseur  at least thought i i shall sell my life dearly i could not go to bed but i pulled the bedstead over against one of the doorsthe locked oneand i laid the mattress down in front of the other then i lay down on the mattress my moneybag under my head and put the poker conveniently by my side if they came to rob and murder me they should at least have a broken head to account for next day but i soon got tired of this defensive attitude and reflected that if i must lie awake all night i might as well have something to read so i went over to the little bookcase and took down the first book which came to hand it bore on the outside the title oeuvres de victor hugo tome ier théâtre this at any rate said i to myself will be light and interesting i returned to my mattress opened the volume and began to read le roi samuse  i had never before dipped into that terrible drama and i devoured it with a horrid avidity i read how triboulet bribed the gipsy to murder the king how the gipsys sister beguiled him into the hut how the plot was matured and how the sack containing the corpse was delivered over to triboulet it was an awful play to read on such a night and in such a place with the wind howling round the corners and the snow gathering deeply upon the windowpanes i was in a considerable state of fright when i began it i was in an agony of terror before i had got halfway through now and then i heard footsteps on the stairs again i could distinguish two voices one a womans whispering outside the door a little later the other door was very slightly opened and then pushed back again stealthily by a mans hand still i read on at last just as i reached the point where triboulet is about to throw the corpse into the river my candle a mere end began to sputter in its socket and after a few ineffectual flickers suddenly went out leaving me in the dark till morning  i lay down once more trembling but wearied out a few minutes later the voices came again the further door was opened a second time and i saw dimly a pair of eyes not i felt sure lucretias peering in the gloom and reflecting the light from the snow on the window a mans voice said huskily in an undertone its all right now and then there was a silence i knew they were coming to murder me i clutched the poker firmly stood on guard over the dollars and waited the assault the moment that intervened seemed like a lifetime  a minute five minutes a quarter of an hour they are evidently trying to take me off my guard perhaps they saw the poker in any case they must have felt the bedstead against the door that would show them that i expected them i held my watch to my ear and counted the seconds then the minutes then the hours when the candle went out it was three oclock i counted up till about halfpast five  after that i must have fallen asleep from very weariness my head glided back upon the reticule and i dozed uneasily until morning every now and then i started in my sleep but the murderers hung back when i awoke it was eight oclock and the dollars were still safe under my head i rose wearily washed myself and arranged the tumbled clothes in which i had slept for my portmanteau had not yet arrived from the depôt next i put back the bed and mattress and then i took the dollars and went downstairs to the bar hardly knowing whether to laugh at my last nights terror or to congratulate myself on my lucky escape from a den of robbers at the foot of the stairs whom should i come across but lucretia herself  in a moment the doubt was gone she was enchanting quite a different style of dress but equally lovely and suitable a long figured gown of some fine woollen material giving very nearly the effect of a plain neat print and made quite simply to fit her perfect little figure a plain linen collar and a quiet silver brooch hair tied in a single broad knot above the head instead of yesterdays chignon and cheeseplate altogether a model winter morning costume for a cold climate and as she advanced frankly holding out her hand with a smile i could have cut my own throat with a pocketknife as a merited punishment for daring to distrust her such is human nature at the ripe age of twenty  we were so afraid you didnt sleep tom and i she said with a little tone of anxiety we saw a light in your room till so very late and tom opened the door a wee bit once or twice to see if you were sleeping but he said you seemed to have pulled the mattress on the floor i do hope you werent ill  what on earth could i answer dare i tell this angel how i had suspected her impossible well i stammered out colouring up to my eyes i was rather overtired and couldnt get to rest so i put the candle on a chair took a book and lay on the floor so as to have a light to read by but i slept very well after the candle went out thank you  there were none but french books in the room though she said quickly perhaps you read french  i read le roi samuse or part of it said i  oh what a dreadful play to read on christmas eve cried lucretia with a little deprecating gesture but you must come and have your breakfast  i followed her into the diningroom a pretty little brightlooking room behind the bar frightened as i was during the night i could not fail to notice how tastefully the bedroom was furnished but this little salleàmanger was far prettier the paper the carpet the furniture were all models of what cheap and simple cottage decorations ought to be they breathed of lucretia the montreal nuns had evidently taught her what art at home meant the table was laid and the white tablecloth with its bright silver and sprays of evergreen in the vase looked delightfully appetising i began to think i might manage a breakfast after all  how pretty all your things are i said to lucretia  do you think so she answered i chose them and i laid the table  i looked surprised but in a moment more i was fairly overwhelmed when lucretia left the room for a minute and then returned carrying a tray covered with dishes these she rapidly and dexterously placed upon the table and then asked me to take my seat  but said i hesitating am i to understand you dont mean to say are you  going  to wait upon me  lucretias face was one smile of innocent amusement from her white little forehead to her chiselled little chin why yes she answered laughing of course i am i always wait upon our guests when im at home and i cooked these salmon cutlets which im sure youll find nice if you only try them while theyre hot with which recommendation she uncovered all the dishes and displayed a breakfast that might have tempted st anthony not being st anthony i can do lucretias breakfast the justice to say that i ate it with unfeigned heartiness  so my princess was after all the domestic manager and assistant cook of a small country inn not a countess not even a murderess which is at least romantic but only a prosaic housekeeper yet she was a princess for all that did she not read victor hugo and play lucrezia borgia and spread her own refinement over the village tavern in no other country could you find such a strange mixture of culture and simplicity but it was new it was interesting and it was piquant lucretia in her morning dress officiously insisting upon offering me the buckwheat pancakes with her own white hands was lucretia still and i fell deeper in love than ever  after breakfast came a serious difficulty i must go to the pritchards but before i went i must pay yet how was i to ask for my bill i couldnt demand it of lucretia so i sat a while ruminating and at last i said i wonder how people do when they want to leave this house  why said lucretia promptly they order the sleigh  yes i answered sheepishly no doubt but how do they manage about paying  lucretia smiled she was so absolutely transparent and so accustomed to her simple way of doing business that i suppose she did not comprehend my difficulty they ask me of course and i tell them what they owe you owe us halfadollar  halfadollartwo shillings sterlingfor a night of romance and terror a bed and bedroom a regal breakfast andlucretia to wait upon one it was too ridiculous and these were the good simple canadian villagers whom i had suspected of wishing to rob and murder me i never felt so ashamed of my own stupidity in the whole course of my life  i must pay it somehow i supposed but i could not bear to hand over two shilling pieces into lucretias outstretched palm it was desecration it was sheer sacrilege but lucretia took the halfdollar with the utmost calmness and went out to order the sleigh  i drove to the rectors after saying goodbye to lucretia with a clear determination that before i left richmond she should have consented to become my wife of course there were social differences but those would be forgotten in south kensington and nobody need ever know what lucretia had been in canada besides she was fit to shine in the society of duchessesa society into which i cannot honestly pretend that i habitually penetrate  the rector and his wife gave me a hearty welcome and i found mrs pritchard a good motherly sort of bodyjust the right woman for helping on a romantic lovematch so in the course of the morning as we walked back from church i managed to mention to her casually that a very nice young woman had come down in the train with me from quebec  you dont mean lucretia cried good mrs pritchard  lucretia i answered in a cold sort of way i think that was her name in fact i remember she told me so  oh yes everybody calls her lucretiaindeed shes hardly got any other name shes the dearest creature in the world as simple as a child yet the most engaging and kindhearted girl you ever met she was brought up by some nuns at montreal and being a very clever girl with a great deal of taste she was their favourite pupil and has turned out a most cultivated person  does she paint i asked thinking of the beatrice  oh beautifully her ivory miniatures always take prizes at the toronto exhibition and she plays and sings charmingly  are they well off  very for canadians lucretia has money of her own and they have a good farm besides the hotel  she said she knew you very well i ventured to suggest  oh yes in fact shes coming here this evening we have an early dinneryou know our simple canadian habitsand a few friends will drop in to high tea after evening service she and tom will be among themyou met tom of course  i had the pleasure of making toms acquaintance at one oclock this morning i answered but excuse my asking it isnt it a little odd for you to mix with people in their position  the rector smiled and put in his word this is a democratic country he said a mere farmer community after all we have little society in richmond and are very glad to know such pleasant intelligent people as tom and lucretia  but then the convenances i urged secretly desiring to have my own position strengthened when i got to the hotel last night or rather this morning there were a lot of roughlooking hulking fellows drinking whiskey and playing cards  ah i dare say old picard and young le patourel from melbourne and the post office people sitting over a quiet game of écarté while they waited for the last train the english mail was in last night as for the whiskey thats the custom of the country we canadians do nothing without whiskey a single glass of mortons proof does nobody any harm  and these were my robbers and gamblers a party of peaceable farmers and sleepy post officials sitting up with a sober glass of toddy and beguiling the time with écarté for love in expectation of her majestys mails i shall never again go to bed with a poker by my side as long as i live  about seven oclock our friends came in lucretia was once more charming this time in a long evening dress a peachcoloured silk with squarecut boddice and a little lace cap on her black hair i dare say i saw almost the full extent of her wardrobe in those three changes but the impression she produced upon me was still that of boundless wealth however as she had money of her own i no longer wondered at the richness of her toilette and i reflected that a comfortable little settlement might help to outweigh any possible prejudice on my mothers part  lucretia was the soul of the evening she talked she flirted innocently with every man in the room myself included she played divinely and she sang that very song from lucrezia borgia in a rich contralto voice as she rose at last from the piano i could contain myself no longer i must find some opportunity of proposing to her there and then i edged my way to the little group where she was standing flushed with the compliments on her song talking to our hostess near the piano as i approached from behind i could hear that they were speaking about me and i caught a few words distinctly i paused to listen it was very wrong but twenty is an impulsive age  oh a very nice young man indeed lucretia was saying and we had a most enjoyable journey down he talked so simply and seemed such an innocent boy so i took quite a fancy to him my heart beat about two hundred pulsations to the minute such a clever intelligent talker too full of wide english views and interests so different from our narrow provincial canadian lads oh lucretia i feel sure of you now love at first sight on both sides evidently and then he spoke to me so nicely about his mother i was quite grieved to think he should be travelling alone on christmas eve and so pleased when i heard he was to spend his christmas with you dear i thought what i should have felt if  i listened with all my ears what could lucretia be going to say  if one of my own dear boys was grown up and passing his christmas alone in a strange land  i reeled the room swam before me it was too awful so all that lucretia had ever felt was a mere motherly interest in me as a solitary english boy away from his domestic turkey on the twentyfifth of december terrible hideous blighting fact lucretia was married  the rectors refreshments in the adjoining diningroom only went to the length of spongecake and weak claretcup i managed to get away from the piano without fainting and swallowed about a quart of the intoxicating beverage by tumblerfuls when i had recovered sufficiently from the shock to trust my tongue i ventured back into the drawingroom it struck me then that i had never yet heard lucretias surname when she and her brother arrived in the early part of the evening mrs pritchard had simply introduced them to me by saying i think you know tom and lucretia already colonial manners are so unceremonious  i joined the fatal group once more do you know i said addressing lucretia with as little tremor in my voice as i could easily manage its very curious but i have never heard your surname yet  dear me cried lucretia i quite forgot our name is arundel  and which is mr arundel i continued i should like to make his acquaintance  why answered lucretia with a puzzled expression of face youve met him already here he is and she took a neighbouring young man in unimpeachable evening dress gently by the arm he turned round it required a moments consideration to recognize in that tall and gentlemanly young fellow with the plain gold studs and turndown collar my rough acquaintance of last night tom himself  i saw it in a flash what a fool i had been i might have known they were husband and wife nothing but a pure piece of infatuated preconception could ever have made me take them for brother and sister but i had so fully determined in my own mind to win lucretia for myself that the notion of any other fellow having already secured the prize had never struck me  it was all the fault of that incomprehensible canadian society with its foolish removal of the natural barriers between classes my mother was quite right i should henceforth be a highanddry conservative in all matters matrimonial return home in the spring with heart completely healed and after passing correctly through a london season marry the daughter of a general or a warwickshire squire with the full consent of all the high contracting parties at st georges hanover square with this noble and moral resolution firmly planted in my bosom i made my excuses to the rector and his good little wife and left richmond for ever the very next morning without even seeing lucretia once again  but somehow i have never quite forgotten that journey from quebec on christmas eve and though i have passed through several london seasons since that date and undergone increasingly active sieges from mammas and daughters as my briefs on the oxford circuit grow more and more numerous i still remain a bachelor with solitary chambers in st jamess i sometimes fancy it might have been otherwise if i could only once have met a second paragon exactly like lucretia     the third time   i  if harry lewin had never come to stoke peveril edie meredith would certainly have married her cousin evan  for evan meredith was the sort of man that any girl of edies temperament might very easily fall in love with tall handsome with delicate clearcut celtic face piercing yet pensive black welsh eyes and the true cymric gifts of music and poetry evan meredith had long been his pretty cousins prime favourite among all the young men of all herefordshire she had danced with him over and over again at every county ball she had talked with him incessantly at every lawntennis match and gardenparty she had whispered to him quietly on the sofa in the far corner while distinguished amateurs were hammering away conscientiously at the grand piano and all the world of herefordshire took it for granted that young mr meredith and his second cousin were in the delightfully vague slang of society almost engaged  suddenly like a flaming meteor across the quiet evening skies harry lewin burst in all his dashing splendour upon the peaceful and limited herefordshire horizon he came from that land of golden possibilities australia but he was irish by descent and his father had sent him young to eton and oxford where he picked up the acquaintance of everybody worth knowing and a sufficient knowledge of things in general to pass with brilliant success in english society in his vacations having no home of his own to go to he had loitered about half the capitals and spas of europe so that vichy and carlsbad monte carlo and spezzia berlin and st petersburg were almost as familiar to him as london and scarborough nobody knew exactly what his father had been some said a convict some a goldminer some a bushranger but whatever he was he was at least exceedingly rich and money covers a multitude of sins quite as well and as effectually as charity when harry lewin came into his splendid property at his fathers death and purchased the insolvent lord tinterns old estate at stoke peveril half the girls and all the mothers in the whole of herefordshire rose at once to a fever of anxiety in their desire to know upon which of the marriageable young women of the county the wealthy newcomer would finally bestow himself in holy matrimony  there was only one girl in the stoke district who never appeared in the slightest degree flattered or fluttered by harry lewins polite attentions and that girl was edie meredith though she was only the country doctors daughterhardly in our set at all you know the county people said depreciatinglyshe had no desire to be the mistress of peveril court and she let harry lewin see pretty clearly that she didnt care the least in the world for that distinguished honour  it was at a garden party at stoke peveril rectory that edie meredith met one afternoon her cousin evan and the rich young irishaustralian harry lewin had stood talking to her with his easy jaunty manner so perfectly selfpossessed so full of irish courtesy and etonian readiness when evan meredith watching them half angrily out of his dark welsh eyes from the corner by the laburnum tree walked slowly over to interrupt their têteàtête of set purpose he chose certainly an awkward moment for his earnest serious face and figure showed to ill advantage just then and there beside the lighthearted cheery young oxonians edie fancied as he strolled up to her that she had never seen her cousin evan look so awkward so countrified and so awfully welsh on the border counties to look like a welshman is of course almost criminal she wondered she had overlooked till now the fact that his was distinctly a local and rustic sort of handsomeness he looked like a herefordshire squireen gentleman while harry lewin with his irish chivalry and his oxford confidence looked like a cosmopolitan and a man of society  as evan came up glancing blackly at him from under his dark eyebrows harry lewin moved away carelessly raising his hat and strolling off as if quite unconcerned to make way for the newcomer evan nodded to him a distant nod and then turned to his cousin edie  youve been talking a great deal with that fellow lewin he said sharply almost angrily glancing straight at her with his big black eyes  edie was annoyed at the apparent assumption of a right to criticise her mr lewins a very agreeable man she answered quietly without taking the least notice of his angry tone i always like to have a chat with him evan hes been everywhere and knows all about everythingparis and vienna and i dont know where so very different of course from our stoke young men whove never been anywhere in their whole lives beyond bristol or hereford  bristol and hereford are much better places ive no doubt for a man to be brought up in than paris or vienna evan meredith retorted hastily the hot blood flushing up at once into his dusky cheek but as you seem to be so very much taken up with your new admirer edie im sure im very sorry i happened at such an unpropitious moment to break in upon your conversation  so am i edie answered quietly and with emphasis  she hardly meant it though she was vexed with evan but evan took her immediately at her word without another syllable he raised his hat turned upon his heel and left her standing there alone at some little distance from her mother by the edge of the oval grassplot it was an awkward position for a girl to be left infor everybody would have seen that evan had retired in high dudgeonhad not harry lewin promptly perceived it and with quiet tact managed to return quite casually to her side and walk back with her to her mothers protection so as to hide at once her confusion and her blushes as for evan he wandered off moodily by himself among the lilacs and arbutus bushes of the lower shrubbery  he had been pacing up and down there alone for half an hour or more nursing his wrath and jealousy in his angry heart when he saw between the lilac branches on the upper walk the flash of edies pretty white dress followed behind at a discreet distance by the rustle of mrs merediths black satin edie was walking in front with harry lewin and mrs meredith attempting vainly to affect a becoming interest in the rectors conversation was doing the proprieties at twenty paces  as they passed evan meredith heard harry lewins voice murmuring something in a soft gentle persuasive flow not a word of which he could catch individually though the general accent and intonation showed him at once that harry was pleading earnestly with his cousin edie evan could have written her versespretty enough verses tooby the foolscap ream but though he had the welsh gift of rhyme he hadnt the irish gift of fluency and eloquence and he knew in his own heart that he could never have poured forth to any woman such a steady long impassioned flood of earnest solicitation as harry lewin was that moment evidently pouring forth to his cousin edie he held his breath in silent expectation and waited ten whole endless secondsa long eternityto catch the tone of edies answer  instead of the mere tone he caught distinctly the very words of that low soft musical reply edie murmured after a slight pause no no mr lewin i must noti cannot i do not love you  evan meredith waited for no more he knew partly from that short but ominous pause and still more from the halfhearted hesitating way in which the nominal refusal was faintly spoken that his cousin edie would sooner or later accept his rival he walked away fiercely indignant and going home sat down to his desk and wrote at whiteheat an angry letter beginning simply edith meredith in which he released her formally and unconditionally from the engagement which both of them declared had never existed  whether his letter expedited harry lewins wooing or not it is at least certain that in the end evan merediths judgment was approved by the result and before the next christmas came round again edie was married to harry lewin and duly installed as mistress of peveril court   ii  the first three months of edie lewins married life passed away happily and pleasantly harry was always kindness itself to her and as she saw more of him she found in him what she had not anticipated an unsuspected depth and earnestness of purpose she had thought him at first a brilliant dashing clever irishman she discovered upon nearer view that he had something more within him than mere showy external qualities he was deeply in love with her he respected and admired her and in the midst of all his manly chivalry of demeanour towards his wife there was a certain indefinable air of selfrestraint and constant watchfulness over his own actions which edie noticed with some little wifely pride and pleasure she had not married a mere handsome rich young fellow she had married a man of character and determination  about three months after their marriage harry lewin was called away for the first time to leave his bride an unexpected letter from his lawyer in londonimmediate businessthose bothering australian shares and companies would edie forgive him he would run up for the day only starting early and getting back late the same night its a long run from stoke to london but you can just manage it if you fit your trains with dexterous ingenuity so harry went and edie was left alone for the first time in her life in the big rooms of peveril court for a whole day  that very afternoon evan meredith and his father happened to call it was evans first visit to the bride for he couldnt somehow make up his mind to see her earlier he was subdued silent constrained regretful but he said nothing in allusion to the pastnothing but praise of the peveril court grounds the beauty of the house the charm of the surroundings the magnificence of the old romneys and sir joshuas  you have a lovely place edie he said hesitating a second before he spoke the old familiar name but bringing it out quite naturally at last and your husband i hope i may have thethe pleasure of seeing him again  edie coloured he has gone up to town today she answered simply  by himself  by himself evan  evan meredith coughed uneasily and looked at her with a silent look which said more plainly than words could have said it already  he will be back this evening edie went on apologetically answering aloud his unspoken thought iim sorry he isnt here to see you evan  im sorry too very sorry evan answered with a halfstifled sigh he didnt mean to let her see the ideas that were passing through his mind but his quick irrepressible celtic nature allowed the internal emotions to peep out at once through the thin cloak of that conventionally polite expression of regret edie knew he meant he was very sorry that harry should have gone away so soon and left her  that evening about ten oclock as edie sitting alone in the blue drawingroom was beginning to wonder when harrys dogcart would be heard rolling briskly up the front avenue there came a sudden double rap at the front door and the servant brought in a sealed telegram edie tore it open with some misgiving it was not from harry she read it hastily from proprietor nortons hotel jermyn street london to mrs lewin peveril court stoke peveril herefordshire mr lewin unfortunately detained in town by urgent business he will not be able to return before tomorrow  edie laid down the telegram with a sinking heart in itself there was nothing so very strange in harrys being detained by business men are always being detained by business she knew it was a way they had a masculine peculiarity but why had not harry telegraphed himself why had he left the proprietor of nortons hotel to telegraph for him why was he at nortons hotel at all and if he really was there why could he not have written the telegram himself it was very mysterious perplexing and inexplicable tears came into edies eyes and she sat long looking at the flimsy pink government paper as if the mere inspection of the hateful message would help her to make out the meaning of the enclosed mystery  soon the question began to occur to her what should she do for the nights arrangements peveril court was so big and lonely she hated the idea of stopping there alone should she have out the carriage and drive round to spend the night as of old at her mothers but no it was late and the servants would think it so very odd of her people would talk about it they would say harry had stopped away from her unexpectedly and that she had gone back in a pique to her own home young wives she knew are always doing those foolish things and always regretting them afterwards when they find the whole county magnifying the molehill into a veritable mountain much as she dreaded it she must spend the night alone in that big bedroomthe haunted bedroom where the last of the peverils died poor little edie with her simple small village ways she hated that great rambling house and all its halls and staircases and corridors but there was no help for it she went tearfully up to her own room and flung herself without undressing on the great bed with the heavy crimson tapestry hangings  there she lay all night tossing and turning crying and wondering dozing off at times and starting up again fitfully but never putting out the candles on the dressingtable which had burned away deep in the sockets by the time morning began to peep through the grey venetians of the east window   iii  next morning evan meredith heard accidentally that harry lewin had stopped for the night in london and had telegraphed unexpectedly to edie that he had been detained in town on business  evan shook his head with an ominous look poor child he said to himself pityingly she would marry a man who had been brought up in paris and vienna  and when harry came back that evening by the late train evan meredith was loitering casually by the big iron gates of peveril court to see whether edies husband was really returning  there was a very grave and serious look on harrys face that surprised and somewhat disconcerted evan he somehow felt that harrys expression was not that of a careless dissipated fellow and he said to himself this time a little less confidently perhaps after all i may have been misjudging him  edie was standing to welcome her husband on the big stone steps of the old manor house he stepped from the dogcart not lightly with a spring as was his usual wont but slowly and almost remorsefully like a man who has some evil tidings to break to those he loves dearest but he kissed edie as tenderly as evereven more tenderly she somehow imagined and he looked at her with such a genuine look of love that edie thought it was well worth while for him to go away for the sake of such a delightful meeting  well darling she asked as she went with him into the great diningroom why didnt you come back to the little wifie as you promised yesterday  harry looked her full in the face not evasively or furtively but with a frank open glance and answered in a very quiet voice i was detained on business edie  what business edie asked a little piqued at the indefiniteness of the answer  business that absolutely prevented me from returning harry replied with a short air of perfect determination  edie tried in vain to get any further detail out of him to all her questions harry only answered with the one set and unaltered formula i was detained on important business  but when she had asked him for the fiftieth time in the drawingroom that evening he said at last not at all angrily but very seriously it was business edie closely connected with your own happiness if i had returned last night you would have been sorry for it sooner or later i stayed away for your own sake darling please ask me no more about it  edie couldnt imagine what he meant but he spoke so seriously and smoothed her hand with such a tender loving gesture that she kissed him fervently and brushed away the tears from her swimming eyes without letting him see them as for harry he sat long looking at the embers in the smouldering fire and holding his pretty little wifes hand tight in his without uttering a single syllable at last just as they were rising to go upstairs he laid his hand upon the mantelpiece as if to steady himself and said very earnestly edie with gods help i hope it shall never occur again  what harry darling what do you mean what will never occur again  he paused a moment that i should be compelled to stop a night away from you unexpectedly he answered then very slowly  and when he had said it he took up the candle from the little side table and walked away with two tears standing in his eyes to his own dressingroom  from that day forth edie lewin noticed two things first that her husband seemed to love her even more tenderly and deeply than ever and second that his strange gravity and selfrestraint seemed to increase daily upon him  and evan meredith watching closely his cousin and her husband thought to himself with a glow of satisfactionfor he was too generous and too true in his heart to wish ill to his rivalafter all he loves her truly he is really in love with her edie will be rich now and will have a good husband what could i ever have given her compared to what harry lewin can give her it is better so i must not regret it   iv  for five or six months more life passed as usual at peveril court or at harry lewins new town house in curzon street mayfair the season came and went pleasantly enough with its round of dances theatres and dinners and in the autumn edie lewin found herself once more back for the shooting in dear old herefordshire harry was always by her side the most attentive and inseparable of husbands he seemed somehow to cling to her passionately as if he could not bear to be out of her sight for a single moment edie noticed it and felt grateful for his love evan meredith noticed it too and reproached himself bitterly more than once that he should ever so unworthily have distrusted the man who had been brought up in paris and vienna  one day however harry had ridden from stoke to hereford for the exercise alone and edie expected him back to dinner but at halfpast seven just as the gong in the hall was burrring loudly a telegram arrived once more for mrs lewin which edie tore open with trembling fingers it was almost exactly the same mystifying message over again only this time it was sent by harry himself not by an unknown hotelkeeping deputy i have been suddenly detained here by unexpected business do not expect me home before tomorrow shall return as early as possible god bless you  those last words so singular in a telegram roused and accentuated all edies womanly terrors god bless youwhat on earth could harry mean by that solemn adjuration under such strange and mysterious circumstances there was something very serious the matter edie felt sure but what it could be she could not even picture to herself her instinctive fears did not take that vulgarly mistrustful form that they might have taken with many a woman of lower and more suspicious nature she knew and trusted harry far too well for that she was too absolutely certain of his whole unshaken love and tenderness but the very vagueness and indefiniteness of the fears she felt made them all the harder and more terrible to bear when you dont know what it is you dread your fancy can dress up its terrors afresh every moment in some still more painful and distressing disguise  if harry had let her know where he was stopping she would have ordered the carriage then and there and driven over to hereford not to spy him out but to be with him in his trouble or difficulty that however was clearly impossible for harry had merely sent his telegram as from h lewin hereford and to go about from hotel to hotel through the county town inquiring whether her husband was staying there would of course have been open to the most ridiculous misinterpretation everybody would have said she was indeed keeping a tight hand upon him so with many bitter tears brushed hastily away edie went down in solemn and solitary state to dinner hating herself for crying so foolishly and burning hot with the unpleasant consciousness that the butler and footman were closely observing her face and demeanour if she could have dined quite alone in her own boudoir very furtively it wouldnt have been quite so dreadful but to keep up appearances with a sinking heart before those two eminently respectable and officious menservantsit was really enough to choke one  that night again edie lewin never slept for more than a few troubled minutes together and whenever she awoke it was with a start and a scream and a vague consciousness of some impending evil  when harry came again next day he didnt laugh it off carelessly and lightly he didnt soothe her fears and uneasiness with ready kisses and prompt excuses he didnt get angry with her and tell her not to ask him too many questions about his own business he met her as gravely and earnestly as before with the same tender loving half selfreproachful tone and yet with the same evident desire and intention to love and cherish her more fondly than ever edie was relieved but she was by no means satisfied she knew harry loved her tenderly devotedly but she knew also there was some sort of shadow or secret looming ominously between them  another wife supposed dead he would have trusted her and told her another love oh no she could trust him it was impossible  and so the weeks wore away and edie wondered all to no purpose at last by dint of constant wondering she almost wore out the faculty of wonder and half ceased to think about it any longer  but she noticed that from day to day the old bright brilliant irish character was slowly fading out of harrys nature and that in its place there was growing up a settled noble not unbecoming earnestness he seemed perhaps a trifle less striking and attractive than formerly but a great deal worthier of any true womans enduring love and admiration  evan meredith noticed the change as well he and harry had grown now into real friends harry saw and recognized the genuine depth of evans nature evan had made amends and apologies to harry for a single passing rudeness or two both liked the other better for the momentary rivalry and for the way he had soon forgotten it hes a good fellow evan said to his father often and edie with her quiet simple english nature has made quite another man of himgiven him the ballast and the even steadiness he once wanted   v  spring came and then summer and with summer the annual visitation of garden parties the trenches at malbury manor were going to give a garden party and harry and edie drove across to it edie took her husband over in the ponycarriage with the two little greys she loved so well to drive herself the very prettiest and bestmatched ponies everybody said in the whole county of hereford  as they walked about on the lawn together they met edies father and mother somehow edie happened to fasten herself accidentally upon her mother while harry strolled away alone and stood talking with something of his old brilliancy to one group or another of loungers independently for awhile edie missed him he had gone off to look at the conservatories or something then she saw him chatting with canon wilmington and his daughters over by one of the refreshment tables and handing them champagne cup and ices while he talked with unusual volubility and laughter presently he came up to her again and to her great surprise said with a yawn edie this is getting dreadfully slow i cant stand it any longer i think i shall just slip away quietly and walk home you can come after me whenever you like with the ponies goodbye till dinner god bless you darling  it wasnt a usual form of address with him and edie vaguely noted it in passing but thought nothing more about the matter after the first moment goodbye harry she said laughingly perhaps evan will see me home goodbye  harry smiled rather sadly evan has ridden over on one of my cobs he answered quietly and so i suppose hell have to ride back again  hes the best fellow that ever lived evan said as harry turned away with a friendly nod upon my word im quite ashamed of the use i make of your husbands stables edie  nonsense evan were always both delighted when you will use anything of ours as if it were your own  at six oclock the ponies were stopping the way and edie prepared to drive home alone she took the byeroad at the back of the grounds in preference to the turnpike because it wouldnt be so crowded or so dusty for her to drive upon  they had gone about a mile from the house and had passed the beehive where a group of halftipsy fellows was loitering upon the road outside the tavern when a few hundred yards further edie suddenly checked the greys for no immediately apparent reason  got a stone in his hoof maam the groom asked looking down curiously at the off horse and preparing to alight for the expected emergency  no edie answered with a sudden shake of her head look there william on the road in front of us what a disgusting brute i nearly ran over him  the groom looked in the direction where edie pointed with her whip and saw lying on the ground straight before the horses heads a drunken man asleep and helpless with a small pocket flask clasped in his hand quite empty  pick him up edie said in a tone of disgust carry him over and lay him on the side of the road there will you william  the man went off to do as he was directed at that moment evan meredith coming up from behind on harrys cob called out lightly can i help you edie whats the matter ho one of those beastly fellows from the beehive yonder hold a minute william youve got a regular job theremore than an armful drunken men are heavy to carry wait a bit and ill come and help you  ho rode forward to the grooms side just as the groom raised in his arms the drunkards head and exposed to view his downturned face then with a sudden cry of horror and pity evan meredith not faltering for a moment drove his heel into his horses flank and rode off speechless with conflicting emotions leaving edie there alone face to face with her fallen husband  it was harry lewin  apoplexy epilepsy an accident a sunstroke no no edie could comfort herself with none of those instantaneous flashes of conjecture for his face and his breath would alone have told the whole story even if the empty flask in his drunken hand had not at once confirmed the truth of her first apprehension she sat down beside him on the green roadside buried her poor face in her trembling hands and cried silently silently silently for twenty minutes  the groom standing motionless officially beside her let her tears have free vent and knew not what to say or do under such extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances  one thing only edie thought once or twice in the midst of that awful blinding discovery thank god that evan meredith had not stopped there to see her misery and degradation an englishman might have remained like a fool with the clumsy notion of assisting her in her trouble and getting him safely home to peveril court for her evan with his quick welsh perception had seen in a second that the only possible thing for her own equals to do on such an occasion was to leave her alone with her unspeakable wretchedness  after a while she came to a little by dint of crying and pure exhaustion and began to think that something must at least be done to hide this terrible disgrace from the prying eyes of all herefordshire  she rose mechanically without a word and motioning the groom to take the feet she lifted harrys headher own husbands headthat drunken wretchs headgreat heavens which was it and helped to lay him silently on the floor of the pony carriage he was helpless and motionless as a baby her eyes were dry now and she hardly even shuddered she got into the carriage again covered over the breathing mass of insensible humanity at the bottom with her light woollen wrapper and drove on in perfect silence till she reached peveril court as she drew up in front of the door the evening was beginning to close in rapidly the groom still silent jumped from the carriage and ran up the steps with his usual drilled accuracy to ring the bell edie beckoned to him imperiously with her hand to stop and come back to her he paused and turned down the steps again to hear what she wished edies lips were dry she couldnt utter a word but she pointed mutely to her husbands prostrate form and the groom understood at once that she wished him to lift harry out of the carriage hastily and furtively they carried him in at the library doorthe first room inside the houseand there they laid him out upon the sofa edie putting one white finger passionately on her lip to enjoin silence as soon as that was done she sat down to the table with marvellous resolution and wrote out a cheque for twenty pounds from her own chequebook then at last she found speech with difficulty william she said her dry husky throat almost choking with the effort take that instead of notice go away at onceill drive you to the stationgo to london and never say a single word of this to any one  william touched his hat in silence and walked back slowly to the carriage edie now flushed and feverish but dry of lips and erect of mien turned the key haughtily in the door and stalked out to the greys once more silently still she drove to the station and saw william take the london train you shall have a character she said very quietly write to me for it but never say a word of this for your life to anybody  william touched his hat once more and went away meaning conscientiously in his own soul to keep this strange and unexpected compact  then edie drove herself back to peveril court feeling that only evan meredith knew besides and she could surely count at least on evans honour  but tomorrow tomorrow what could she ever do tomorrow  hot and tearless still she rang the drawingroom bell mr lewin will not be home tonight she said with no further word of explanation i shall not dine tell watkins to bring me a cup of tea in my own bedroom  the maid brought it and edie drank it it moistened her lips and broke the fever then she flung herself passionately upon the bed and cried and cried and cried wildly till late in the evening  eleven oclock came twelve oclock one she heard them tolling out from the old clocktower clanging loudly from the church steeple clinking and tinkling from all the timepieces in all the rooms of peveril court but still she lay there and wept and sobbed and thought of nothing she didnt even figure it or picture it to herself her grief and shame and utter abasement were too profound for mind to fathom she only felt in a dim vague halfunconscious fashion that harrythe harry she had loved and worshippedwas gone from her for ever and ever  in his place there had come that irrational speechless helpless thing that lay below breathing heavily in its drunken sleep down on the library sofa   vi  by halfpast one the lights had long been out in all the rooms and perfect silence reigned throughout the household impelled by a wild desire to see him once more even though she loathed him edie took a bedroom candle in her hand and stole slowly down the big staircase  loathed him loved himay loved him even so loved him and the more she loved him the more utterly loathed him  if it had been any lesser or lower man she might have forgiven him but himharryit was too unspeakable  creeping along the passage to the library door she paused and listened inside there was a noise of footsteps pacing up and down the room hurriedly he had come to himself then he had slept off his drunken helplessness she paused and listened again to hear further  harry was stalking to and fro across the floor with fiery eagerness sobbing bitterly to himself and pausing every now and then with a sort of sudden spasmodic hesitation from time to time she heard him mutter aloud she must have seen me she must have seen me they will tell her they will tell her oh god they will tell her  should she unlock the door and fling herself wildly into his arms her instinct told her to do it but she faltered and hesitated a drunkard a drunkard oh no she could not the evil genius conquered the good and she checked the impulse that alone could have saved her  she crept up again with heart standing still and failing within her and flung herself once more upon her own bed  two oclock three halfpast three a quarter to four  how long the night seems when you are watching and weeping  suddenly at the quarterhour just gone a sharp ring at a bell disturbed her lethargya ring two or three times repeated which waked the butler from his sound slumber  edie walked out cautiously to the top of the stairs and listened the butler stood at the library door and knocked in vain edie heard a letter pushed under the door and in a muffled voice heard harry saying give that letter to your mistress hardytomorrow morning  a vague foreboding of evil overcame her she stole down the stairs in the blank dark and took the letter without a word from the halfdressed and wondering butler then she glided back to her own room sat down eagerly by the dressingtable and began to read it       edie       this is the third time and i determined with myself that the      third time should be the last one once in london once at      hereford once now i can stand it no longer my father died a      drunkard my mother died a drunkard i cannot resist the      temptation it is better i should not stop here i have tried hard      but i am beaten in the struggle i loved you dearly i love you      still far too much to burden your life by my miserable presence i      have left you everything evan will make you happier than i could      forgive me    harry  she dropped the letter with a scream and almost would have fainted  but even before the faintness could wholly overcome her another sound rang out sharper and clearer far from the room below her it brought her back to herself immediately it was the report of a pistol  edie and the butler hurried back in breathless suspense to the library door it was locked still edie took the key from her pocket and turned it quickly when they entered the candles on the mantelpiece were burning brightly and harry lewins body shot through the heart lay in a pool of gurgling blood right across the spattered hearthrug     the gold wulfric   part i  i  there are only two gold coins of wulfric of mercia in existence anywhere one of them is in the british museum and the other one is in my possession  the most terrible incident in the whole course of my career is intimately connected with my first discovery of that gold wulfric it is not too much to say that my entire life has been deeply coloured by it and i shall make no apology therefore for narrating the story in some little detail i was stopping down at lichfield for my summer holiday in july 1879 when i happened one day accidentally to meet an old ploughman who told me he had got a lot of coins at home that he had ploughed up on what he called the field of battle a place i had already recognized as the site of the mercian kings wooden palace  i went home with him at once in high glee for i have been a collector of old english gold and silver coinage for several years and i was in hopes that my friendly ploughmans find might contain something good in the way of anglosaxon pennies or shillings considering the very promising place in which he had unearthed it  as it turned out i was not mistaken the little hoard concealed within a rude piece of anglosaxon pottery now no 127 in case lix at the south kensington museum comprised a large number of common frankish merovingian coins i beg mr freemans pardon for not calling them merwings together with two or three kentish pennies of some rarity from the mints of ethelbert at canterbury and dover amongst these minor treasures however my eye at once fell upon a single gold piece obviously imitated from the imperial roman aureus of the pretender carausius which i saw immediately must be an almost unique bit of money of the very greatest numismatic interest i took it up and examined it carefully a minutes inspection fully satisfied me that it was indeed a genuine mintage of wulfric of mercia the like of which i had never before to my knowledge set eyes upon  i immediately offered the old man five pounds down for the whole collection he closed with the offer forthwith in the most contented fashion and i bought them and paid for them all upon the spot without further parley  when i got back to my lodgings that evening i could do nothing but look at my gold wulfric i was charmed and delighted at the actual possession of so great a treasure and was burning to take it up at once to the british museum to see whether even in the national collection they had got another like it so being by nature of an enthusiastic and impulsive disposition i determined to go up to town the very next day and try to track down the history of my wulfric itll be a good opportunity i said to myself to kill two birds with one stone emilys people havent gone out of town yet i can call there in the morning arrange to go to the theatre with them at night and then drive at once to the museum and see how much my find is worth  next morning i was off to town by an early train and before one oclock i had got to emilys  why harold she cried running down to meet me and kiss me in the passage for she had seen me get out of my hansom from the drawingroom window how on earth is it that youre up in town today i thought you were down at lichfield still with your oxford reading party  so i am i answered officially at lichfield but ive come up today partly to see you and partly on a piece of business about a new coin ive just got hold of  a coin emily answered pretending to pout me and a coin thats how you link us together mentally is it i declare harold i shall be getting jealous of those coins of yours some day im certain you cant even come up to see me for a day it seems unless youve got some matter of a coin as well to bring you to london moral never get engaged to a man with a fancy for collecting coins and medals  oh but this is really such a beauty emily i cried enthusiastically just look at it now isnt it lovely do you notice the inscriptionwulfric rex ive never yet seen one anywhere else at all like it  emily took it in her hands carelessly i dont see any points about that coin in particular she answered in her bantering fashion more than about any other old coin that youd pick up anywhere  that was all we said then about the matter subsequent events engrained the very words of that short conversation into the inmost substance of my brain with indelible fidelity i shall never forget them to my dying moment  i stopped about an hour altogether at emilys had lunch and arranged that she and her mother should accompany me that evening to the lyceum then i drove off to the british museum and asked for leave to examine the anglosaxon coins of the mercian period  the superintendent who knew me well enough by sight and repute as a responsible amateur collector readily gave me permission to look at a drawerful of the earliest mercian gold and silver coinage i had brought one or two numismatic books with me and i sat down to have a good look at those delightful cases  after thoroughly examining the entire series and the documentary evidence i came to the conclusion that there was just one other gold wulfric in existence besides the one i kept in my pocket and that was the beautiful and wellpreserved example in the case before me it was described in the last edition of sir theophilus wraxtons northumbrian and mercian numismatist as an absolutely unique gold coin of wulfric of mercia in imitation of the wellknown aureus of the false emperor carausius i turned to the catalogue to see the price at which it had been purchased by the nation to my intense surprise i saw it entered at a hundred and fifty pounds  i was perfectly delighted at my magnificent acquisition  on comparing the two examples however i observed that though both struck from the same die and apparently at the same mint to judge by the letter they differed slightly from one another in two minute accidental particulars my coin being of course merely stamped with a hammer and then cut to shape after the fashion of the time was rather more closely clipped round the edge than the museum specimen and it had also a slight dent on the obverse side just below the w of wulfric in all other respects the two examples were of necessity absolutely identical  i stood for a long time gazing at the case and examining the two duplicates with the deepest interest while the museum keeper a man of the name of mactavish whom i had often seen before on previous visits walked about within sight as is the rule on all such occasions and kept a sharp lookout that i did not attempt to meddle with any of the remaining coins or cases  unfortunately as it turned out i had not mentioned to the superintendent my own possession of a duplicate wulfric nor had i called mactavishs attention to the fact that i had pulled a coin of my own for purposes of comparison out of my waistcoat pocket to say the truth i was inclined to be a little secretive as yet about my gold wulfric because until i had found out all that was known about it i did not want anybody else to be told of my discovery  at last i had fully satisfied all my curiosity and was just about to return the museum wulfric to its little round compartment in the neat case having already replaced my own duplicate in my waistcoat pocket when all at once i cant say how i gave a sudden start and dropped the coin with a jerk unexpectedly upon the floor of the museum  it rolled away out of sight in a second and i stood appalled in an agony of distress and terror in the midst of the gallery  next moment i had hastily called mactavish to my side and got him to lock up the open drawer while we two went down on hands and knees and hunted through the length and breadth of the gallery for the lost wulfric  it was absolutely hopeless plain sailing as the thing seemed we could see no trace of the missing coin from one end of the room to the other  at last i leaned in a cold perspiration against the edge of one of the glass cabinets and gave it up in despair with a sinking heart its no use mactavish i murmured desperately the things lost and we shall never find it  mactavish looked me quietly in the face in that case sir he answered firmly by the rules of the museum i must call the superintendent he put his hand with no undue violence but in a strictly official manner upon my right shoulder then he blew a whistle im sorry to be rude to you sir he went on apologetically but by the rules of the museum i cant take my hand off you till the superintendent gives me leave to release you  another keeper answered the whistle send the superintendent mactavish said quietly a coin missing  in a minute the superintendent was upon the spot when mactavish told him i had dropped the gold wulfric of mercia he shook his head very ominously this is a bad business mr tait he said gloomily a unique coin as you know and one of the most valuable in the whole of our large anglosaxon collection  is there a mousehole anywhere i cried in agony any place where it might have rolled down and got mislaid or concealed for the moment  the superintendent went down instantly on his own hands and knees pulled up every piece of the cocoanut matting with minute deliberation searched the whole place thoroughly from end to end but found nothing he spent nearly an hour on that thorough search meanwhile mactavish never for a moment relaxed his hold upon me  at last the superintendent desisted from the search as quite hopeless and approached me very politely  im extremely sorry mr tait he said in the most courteous possible manner but by the rules of the museum i am absolutely compelled either to search you for the coin or to give you into custody it may you know have got caught somewhere about your person no doubt you would prefer of the two that i should look in all your pockets and the folds of your clothing  the position was terrible i could stand it no longer  mr harbourne i said breaking out once more from head to foot into a cold sweat i must tell you the truth i have brought a duplicate gold wulfric here today to compare with the museum specimen and i have got it this very moment in my waistcoat pocket  the superintendent gazed back at me with a mingled look of incredulity and pity  my dear sir he answered very gently this is altogether a most unfortunate business but im afraid i must ask you to let me look at the duplicate you speak of  i took it trembling out of my waistcoat pocket and handed it across to him without a word the superintendent gazed at it for a moment in silence then in a tone of the profoundest commiseration he said slowly mr tait i grieve to be obliged to contradict you this is our own specimen of the gold wulfric  the whole museum whirled round me violently and before i knew anything more i fainted   ii  when i came to i found myself seated in the superintendents room with a policeman standing quietly in the background  as soon as i had fully recovered consciousness the superintendent motioned the policeman out of the room for a while and then gently forced me to swallow a brandy and soda  mr tait he said compassionately after an awkward pause you are a very young man indeed and i believe hitherto of blameless character now i should be very sorry to have to proceed to extremities against you i know to what lengths in a moment of weakness the desire to possess a rare coin will often lead a connoisseur under stress of exceptional temptation i have not the slightest doubt in my own mind that you did really accidentally drop this coin that you went down on your knees honestly intending to find it that the accident suggested to you the ease with which you might pick it up and proceed to pocket it that you yielded temporarily to that unfortunate impulse and that by the time i arrived upon the scene you were already overcome with remorse and horror i saw as much immediately in your very countenance nevertheless i determined to give you the benefit of the doubt and i searched over the whole place in the most thorough and conscientious manner as you know i found nothing mr tait i cannot bear to have to deal harshly with you i recognize the temptation and the agony of repentance that instantly followed it sir i give you one chance if you will retract the obviously false story that you just now told me and confess that the coin i found in your pocket was in fact as i know it to be the museum specimen i will forthwith dismiss the constable and will never say another word to any one about the whole matter i dont want to ruin you but i cant of course be put off with a falsehood think the matter carefully over with yourself do you or do you not still adhere to that very improbable and incredible story  horrified and terrorstricken as i was i couldnt avoid feeling grateful to the superintendent for the evident kindness with which he was treating me the tears rose at once into my eyes  mr harbourne i cried passionately you are very good very generous but you quite mistake the whole position the story i told you was true every word of it i bought that gold wulfric from a ploughman at lichfield and it is not absolutely identical with the museum specimen which i dropped upon the floor it is closer clipped round the edges and it has a distinct dent upon the obverse side just below the w of wulfric  the superintendent paused a second and scanned my face very closely  have you a knife or a file in your pocket he asked in a much sterner and more official tone  no i replied neitherneither  you are sure  certain  shall i search you myself or shall i give you in custody  search me yourself i answered confidently  he put his hand quietly into my lefthand breast pocket and to my utter horror and dismay drew forth what i had up to that moment utterly forgotten a pair of folding pocket nailscissors in a leather case of course with a little file on either side  my heart stood still within me  that is quite sufficient mr tait the superintendent went on severely had you alleged that the museum coin was smaller than your own imaginary one you might have been able to put in the facts as good evidence but i see the exact contrary is the case you have stooped to a disgraceful and unworthy subterfuge this base deception aggravates your guilt you have deliberately defaced a valuable specimen in order if possible to destroy its identity  what could i say in return i stammered and hesitated  mr harbourne i cried piteously the circumstances seem to look terribly against me but nevertheless you are quite mistaken tho missing wulfric will come to light sooner or later and prove me innocent  he walked up and down the room once or twice irresolutely and then he turned round to me with a very fixed and determined aspect which fairly terrified me  mr tait he said i am straining every point possible to save you but you make it very difficult for me by your continued falsehood i am doing quite wrong in being so lenient to you i am proposing in short to compound a felony but i cannot bear without letting you have just one more chance to give you in charge for a common robbery i will let you have ten minutes to consider the matter and i beseech you i beg of you i implore you to retract this absurd and despicable lie before it is too late for ever just consider that if you refuse i shall have to hand you over to the constable out there and that the whole truth must come out in court and must be blazoned forth to the entire world in every newspaper the policeman is standing here by the door i will leave you alone with your own thoughts for ten minutes  as he spoke he walked out gravely and shut the door solemnly behind him the clock on the chimneypiece pointed with its hands to twenty minutes past three  it was an awful dilemma i hardly knew how to act under it on the one hand if i admitted for the moment that i had tried to steal the coin i could avoid all immediate unpleasant circumstances and as it would be sure to turn up again in cleaning the museum i should be able at last to prove my innocence to mr harbournes complete satisfaction but on the other hand the liefor it was a liestuck in my throat i could not humble myself to say i had committed a mean and dirty action which i loathed with all the force and energy of my nature no no come what would of it i must stick by the truth and trust to that to clear up everything  but if the superintendent really insisted on giving me in charge how very awkward to have to telegraph about it to emily fancy saying to the girl you are in love with i cant go with you to the theatre this evening because i have been taken off to gaol on a charge of stealing a valuable coin from the british museum it was too terrible  yet after all i thought to myself if the worst comes to the worst emily will have faith enough in me to know it is ridiculous and indeed the imputation could in any case only be temporary as soon as the thing gets into court i could bring up the lichfield ploughman to prove my possession of a gold wulfric and i could bring up emily to prove that i had shown it to her that very morning how lucky that i had happened to take it out and let her look at it my case was happily as plain as a pikestaff it was only momentarily that the weight of the evidence seemed so perversely to go against me  turning over all these various considerations in my mind with anxious hesitancy the ten minutes managed to pass away almost before i had thoroughly realized the deep gravity of the situation  as the clock on the chimneypiece pointed to the halfhour the door opened once more and the superintendent entered solemnly well mr tait he said in an anxious voice have you made up your mind to make a clean breast of it do you now admit after full deliberation that you have endeavoured to steal and clip the gold wulfric  no i answered firmly i do not admit it and i will willingly go before a jury of my countrymen to prove my innocence  then god help you poor boy the superintendent cried despondently i have done my best to save you and you will not let me policeman this is your prisoner i give him in custody on a charge of stealing a gold coin the property of the trustees of this museum valued at a hundred and seventyfive pounds sterling  the policeman laid his hand upon my wrist you will have to go along with me to the station sir he said quietly  terrified and stunned as i was by the awfulness of the accusation i could not forget or overlook the superintendents evident reluctance and kindness mr harbourne i cried you have tried to do your best for me i am grateful to you for it in spite of your terrible mistake and i shall yet be able to show you that i am innocent  he shook his head gloomily i have done my duty he said with a shudder i have never before had a more painful one policeman i must ask you now to do yours   iii  the police are always considerate to respectablelooking prisoners and i had no difficulty in getting the sergeant in charge of the lockup to telegraph for me to emily to say that i was detained by important business which would prevent me taking her and her mother to the theatre that evening but when i explained to him that my detention was merely temporary and that i should be able to disprove the whole story as soon as i went before the magistrates he winked most unpleasantly at the constable who had brought me in and observed in a tone of vulgar sarcasm we have a good many gentlemen here who says the same sirdont we jim but they dont always find it so easy as they expected when they stands up afore the beak to prove their statements  i began to reflect that even a temporary prison is far from being a pleasant place for a man to stop in  next morning they took me up before the magistrate and as the museum authorities of course proved a primâ facie case against me and as my solicitor advised me to reserve my defence owing to the difficulty of getting up my witness from lichfield in reasonable time i was duly committed for trial at the next sessions of the central criminal court  i had often read before that people had been committed for trial but till that moment i had no idea what a very unpleasant sensation it really is  however as i was a person of hitherto unblemished character and wore a good coat made by a fashionable tailor the magistrate decided to admit me to bail if two sureties in five hundred pounds each were promptly forthcoming for the purpose luckily i had no difficulty in finding friends who believed in my story and as i felt sure the lost wulfric would soon be found in cleaning the museum i suffered perhaps a little less acutely than i might otherwise have done owing to my profound confidence in the final triumph of the truth  nevertheless as the case would be fully reported next morning in all the papers i saw at once that i must go straight off and explain the matter without delay to emily  i will not dwell upon that painful interview i will only say that emily behaved as i of course knew she would behave she was horrified and indignant at the dreadful accusation and woman like she was very angry with the superintendent he ought to have taken your word for it naturally harold she cried through her tears but what a good thing anyhow that you happened to show the coin to me i should recognize it anywhere among ten thousand  thats well darling i said trying to kiss away her tears and cheer her up a little i havent the slightest doubt that when the trial comes we shall be able triumphantly to vindicate me from this terrible groundless accusation   iv  when the trial did actually come on the museum authorities began by proving their case against me in what seemed the most horribly damning fashion the superintendent proved that on such and such a day in such and such a case he had seen a gold coin of wulfric of mercia the property of the museum he and mactavish detailed the circumstances under which the coin was lost the superintendent explained how he had asked me to submit to a search and how to avoid that indignity i had myself produced from my waistcoatpocket a gold coin of wulfric of mercia which i asserted to be a duplicate specimen and my own property the counsel for the crown proceeded thus with the examination  do you recognize the coin i now hand you  i do  what is it  the unique gold coin of wulfric of mercia belonging to the museum  you have absolutely no doubt as to its identity  absolutely none whatsoever  does it differ in any respect from the same coin as you previously saw it  yes it has been clipped round the edge with a sharp instrument and a slight dent has been made by pressure on the obverse side just below the w of wulfric  did you suspect the prisoner at the bar of having mutilated it  i did and i asked him whether he had a knife in his possession he answered no i then asked him whether he would submit to be searched for a knife he consented and on my looking in his pocket i found the pair of nailscissors i now produce with a small file on either side  do you believe the coin might have been clipped with those scissors  i do the gold is very soft having little alloy in its composition and it could easily be cut by a strongwristed man with a knife or scissors  as i listened i didnt wonder that the jury looked as if they already considered me guilty but i smiled to myself when i thought how utterly emilys and the ploughmans evidence would rebut this unworthy suspicion  the next witness was the museum cleaner his evidence at first produced nothing fresh but just at last counsel set before him a paper containing a few scraps of yellow metal and asked him triumphantly whether he recognized them he answered yes  there was a profound silence the court was interested and curious i couldnt quite understand it all but i felt a terrible sinking  what are they asked the hostile barrister  they are some fragments of gold which i found in shaking the cocoanut matting on the floor of gallery 27 the saturday after the attempted theft  i felt as if a mine had unexpectedly been sprung beneath me how on earth those fragments of soft gold could ever have got there i couldnt imagine but i saw the damaging nature of this extraordinary and inexplicable coincidence in half a second  my counsel crossexamined all the witnesses for the prosecution but failed to elicit anything of any value from any one of them on the contrary his questions put to the metallurgist of the mint who was called to prove the quality of the gold only brought out a very strong opinion to the effect that the clippings were essentially similar in character to the metal composing the clipped wulfric  no wonder the jury seemed to think the case was going decidedly against me  then my counsel called his witnesses i listened in the profoundest suspense and expectation  the first witness was the ploughman from lichfield he was a wellmeaning but very puzzleheaded old man and he was evidently frightened at being confronted by so many clever wigwearing barristers  nevertheless my counsel managed to get the true story out of him at last with infinite patience dexterity and skill the old man told us finally how he had found the coins and sold them to me for five pounds and how one of them was of gold with a queer head and goggle eyes pointed full face upon its surface  when he had finished the counsel for the crown began his crossexamination he handed the ploughman a gold coin did you ever see that before he asked quietly  to be sure i did the man answered looking at it openmouthed  what is it  its the bit i sold mr tait therethe bit as i got out o the old basin  counsel turned triumphantly to the judge my lord he said this thing to which the witness swears is a gold piece of ethelwulf of wessex by far the commonest and cheapest gold coin of the whole anglosaxon period  it was handed to the jury side by side with the wulfric of mercia and the difference as i knew myself was in fact extremely noticeable all that the old man could have observed in common between them must have been merely the archaic anglosaxon character of the coinage  as i heard that i began to feel that it was really all over  my counsel tried on the reexamination to shake the old mans faith in his identification and to make him transfer his story to the wulfric which he had actually sold me but it was all in vain the ploughman had clearly the dread of perjury for ever before his eyes and wouldnt go back for any consideration upon his first sworn statement no no mister he said over and over again in reply to my counsels bland suggestion you aint going to make me forswear myself for all your cleverness  the next witness was emily she went into the box pale and redeyed but very confident my counsel examined her admirably and she stuck to her point with womanly persistence that she had herself seen the clipped wulfric and no other coin on the morning of the supposed theft she knew it was so because she distinctly remembered the inscription wulfric rex and the peculiar way the staring open eyes were represented with barbaric puerility  counsel for the crown would only trouble the young lady with two questions the first was a painful one but it must be asked in the interests of justice were she and the prisoner at the bar engaged to be married to one another  the answer came slowly and timidly yes  counsel drew a long breath and looked her hard in the face could she read the inscription on that coin now producedhanding her the ethelwulf  great heavens i saw at once the plot to disconcert her but was utterly powerless to warn her against it  emily looked at it long and steadily no she said at last growing deadly pale and grasping the woodwork of the witnessbox convulsively i dont know the character in which it is written  of course not for the inscription was in the peculiar semirunic anglosaxon letters she had never read the words wulfric rex either i had read them to her and she had carried them away vaguely in her mind imagining no doubt that she herself had actually deciphered them  there was a slight pause and i felt my blood growing cold within me then the counsel for the crown handed her again the genuine wulfric and asked her whether the letters upon it which she professed to have read were or were not similar to those of the ethelwulf  instead of answering emily bent down her head between her hands and burst suddenly into tears  i was so much distressed at her terrible agitation that i forgot altogether for the moment my own perilous position and i cried aloud my lord my lord will you not interpose to spare her any further questions  i think the judge said to the counsel for the crown you might now permit the witness to stand down  i wish to reexamine my lord my counsel put in hastily  no i said in his ear no whatever comes of it not another question i had far rather go to prison than let her suffer this inexpressible torture for a single minute longer  emily was led down still crying bitterly into the body of the court and the rest of the proceedings went on uninterrupted  the theory of the prosecution was a simple and plausible one i had bought a common anglosaxon coin probably an ethelwulf valued at about twentytwo shillings from the old lichfield ploughman i had thereupon conceived the fraudulent idea of pretending that i had a duplicate of the rare wulfric i had shown the ethelwulf clipped in a particular fashion to the lady whom i was engaged to marry i had then defaced and altered the genuine wulfric at the museum into the same shape with the aid of my pocket nailscissors and i had finally made believe to drop the coin accidentally upon the floor while i had really secreted it in my waistcoat pocket the theory for the defence had broken down utterly and then there was the damning fact of the gold scrapings found in the cocoanut matting of the british museum which was to me the one great inexplicable mystery in the whole otherwise comprehensible mystification  i felt myself that the case did indeed look very black against me but would a jury venture to convict me on such very doubtful evidence  the jury retired to consider their verdict i stood in suspense in the dock with my heart loudly beating emily remained in the body of the court below looking up at me tearfully and penitently  after twenty minutes the jury retired  guilty or not guilty  the foreman answered aloud guilty  there was a piercing cry in the body of the court and in a moment emily was carried out half fainting and half hysterical  the judge then calmly proceeded to pass sentence he dwelt upon the enormity of my crime in one so well connected and so far removed from the dangers of mere vulgar temptations he dwelt also upon the vandalism of which i had been guiltymyself a collectorin clipping and defacing a valuable and unique memorial of antiquity the property of the nation he did not wish to be severe upon a young man of hitherto blameless character but the national collection must be secured against such a peculiarly insidious and cunning form of depredation the sentence of the court was that i should be kept in  five years penal servitude  crushed and annihilated as i was i had still strength to utter a single final word my lord i cried the missing wulfric will yet be found and will hereafter prove my perfect innocence  remove the prisoner said the judge coldly  they took me down to the courtyard unresisting where the prison van was standing in waiting  on the steps i saw emily and her mother both crying bitterly they had been told the sentence already and were waiting to take a last farewell of me  oh harold emily cried flinging her arms around me wildly its all my fault its my fault only by my foolish stupidity ive lost your case ive sent you to prison oh harold i can never forgive myself ive sent you to prison ive sent you to prison  dearest i said it wont be for long i shall soon be free again theyll find the wulfric sooner or later and then of course theyll let me out again  harold she cried oh harold harold dont you see dont you understand this is a plot against you it isnt lost it isnt lost that would be nothing its stolen its stolen  a light burst in upon me suddenly and i saw in a moment the full depth of the peril that surrounded me   part ii  i  it was some time before i could sufficiently accustom myself to my new life in the isle of portland to be able to think clearly and distinctly about the terrible blow that had fallen upon me in the midst of all the petty troubles and discomforts of prison existence i had no leisure at first fully to realize the fact that i was a convicted felon with scarcely a hopenot of release for that i cared littlebut of rehabilitation  slowly however i began to grow habituated to the new hard life imposed upon me and to think in my cell of the web of circumstance which had woven itself so irresistibly around me  i had only one hope emily knew i was innocent emily suspected like me that the wulfric had been stolen emily would do her best i felt certain to heap together fresh evidence and unravel this mystery to its very bottom  meanwhile i thanked heaven for the hard mechanical daily toil of cutting stone in portland prison i was a strong athletic young fellow enough i was glad now that i had always loved the river at oxford my arms were stout and muscular i was able to take my part in the regular work of the gang to which i belonged had it been otherwisehad i been set down to some quiet sedentary occupation as firstclass misdemeanants often are i should have worn my heart out soon with thinking perpetually of poor emilys terrible trouble  when i first came the deputygovernor knowing my case well had there not been leaders about me in all the papers very kindly asked me whether i would wish to be given work in the bookkeeping department where many educated convicts were employed as clerks and assistants but i begged particularly to be put into an outdoor gang where i might have to use my limbs constantly and so keep my mind from eating itself up with perpetual thinking the deputygovernor immediately consented and gave me work in a quarrying gang at the west end of the island near deadmans bay on the edge of the chesil  for three months i worked hard at learning the trade of a quarryman and succeeded far better than any of the other new hands who were set to learn at the same time with me their heart was not in it mine was anything to escape that gnawing agony  the other men in the gang were not agreeable or congenial companions they taught me their established modes of intercommunication and told me several facts about themselves which did not tend to endear them to me one of them 1247 was put in for the manslaughter of his wife by kicking he was a lowbrowed brutal london drayman and he occupied the next cell to mine where he disturbed me much in my sleepless nights by his loud snoring another a much slighter and more intelligentlooking man was a skilled burglar sentenced to fourteen years for cracking a crib in the neighbourhood of hampstead a third was a sailor convicted of gross cruelty to a defenceless lascar they all told me the nature of their crimes with a brutal frankness which fairly surprised me but when i explained to them in return that i had been put in upon a false accusation they treated my remarks with a galling contempt that was absolutely unsupportable after a short time i ceased to communicate with my fellowprisoners in any way and remained shut up with my own thoughts in utter isolation  byandby i found that the other men in the same gang were beginning to dislike me strongly and that some among them actually whispered to one anotherwhat they seemed to consider a very strong point indeed against methat i must really have been convicted by mistake and that i was a regular stuckup sneaking methodist they complained that i worked a great deal too hard and so made the other felons seem lazy by comparison and they also objected to my prompt obedience to our warders commands as tending to set up an exaggerated and impossible standard of discipline  between this warder and myself on the other hand there soon sprang up a feeling which i might almost describe as one of friendship though by the rules of the establishment we could not communicate with one another except upon matters of business i liked him for his uniform courtesy kindliness and forbearance while i could easily see that he liked me in return by contrast with the other men who were under his charge he was one of those persons whom some experience of prisons then and since has led me to believe less rare than most people would imaginemen in whom the dreary life of a prison warder instead of engendering hardness of heart and cold unsympathetic sternness has engendered a certain profound tenderness and melancholy of spirit i grew quite fond of that one honest warder among so many coarse and criminal faces and i found on the other hand that my fellowprisoners hated me all the more because as they expressed it in their own disgusting jargon i was sucking up to that confounded dog of a barker it happened once when i was left for a few minutes alone with the warder that he made an attempt for a moment contrary to regulations to hold a little private conversation with me  1430 he said in a low voice hardly moving his lips for fear of being overlooked what is your outside name  i answered quietly without turning to look at him harold tait  he gave a little involuntary start what he cried not him that took a coin from the british museum  i bridled up angrily i did not take it i cried with all my soul i am innocent and have been put in here by some terrible error  he was silent for half a second then he said musingly sir i believe you you are speaking the truth i will do all i can to make things easy for you  that was all he said then but from that day forth he always spoke to me in private as sir and never again as 1430  an incident arose at last out of this condition of things which had a very important effect upon my future position  one day about three months after i was committed to prison we were all told off as usual to work in a small quarry on the cliffside overhanging the long expanse of pebbly beach known as the chesil i had reason to believe afterwards that a large open fishing boat lying upon the beach below at the moment had been placed there as part of a concerted scheme by the friends of the hampstead burglar and that it contained ordinary clothing for all the men in our gang except myself only the idea was evidently that the gang should overpower the warder seize the boat change their clothes instantly taking turns about meanwhile with the navigation and make straight off for the shore at lulworth where they could easily disperse without much chance of being recaptured but of all this i was of course quite ignorant at the time for they had not thought well to intrust their secret to the ears of the sneaking virtuous methodist  a few minutes after we arrived at the quarry i was working with two other men at putting a blast in when i happened to look round quite accidentally and to my great horror saw 1247 the brutal wifekicker standing behind with a huge block of stone in his hands poised just above the warders head in a threatening attitude the other men stood around waiting and watching i had only just time to cry out in a tone of alarm take care warder hell murder you when the stone descended upon the warders head and he fell at once bleeding and half senseless upon the ground beside me in a second while he shrieked and struggled the whole gang was pressing savagely and angrily around him  there was no time to think or hesitate before i knew almost what i was doing i had seized his gun and ammunition and standing over his prostrate body i held the men at bay for a single moment then 1247 advanced threateningly and tried to put his foot upon the fallen warder  i didnt wait or reflect one solitary second i drew the trigger and fired full upon him the bang sounded fiercely in my ears and for a moment i could see nothing through the smoke of the rifle  with a terrible shriek he fell in front of me not dead but seriously wounded  the boat the boat the others cried loudly knock him down kill him take the boat all of you  at that moment the report of my shot had brought another warder hastily to the top of the quarry  help help i cried come quick and save us these brutes are trying to murder our warder  the man rushed back to call for aid but the way down the zigzag path was steep and tortuous and it was some time before they could manage to get down and succour us  meanwhile the other convicts pressed savagely around us trying to jump upon the warders body and force their way past to the beach beneath us i fired again for the rifle was doublebarrelled but it was impossible to reload in such a tumult so after the next shot which hit no one i laid about me fiercely with the butt end of the gun and succeeded in knocking down four of the savages one after another by that time the warders from above had safely reached us and formed a circle of fixed bayonets around the rebellious prisoners  thank god i cried flinging down the rifle and rushing up to the prostrate warder he is still alive he is breathing he is breathing  yes he murmured in a faint voice i am alive and i thank you for it but for you sir these fellows here would certainly have murdered me  you are badly wounded yourself 1430 one of the other warders said to me as the rebels were rapidly secured and marched off sullenly back to prison look your own arm is bleeding fiercely  then for the first time i was aware that i was one mass of wounds from head to foot and that i was growing faint from loss of blood in defending the fallen warder i had got punched and pummelled on every side just the same as one used to get long ago in a bully at football when i was a boy at rugby only much more seriously  the warders brought down seven stretchers one for me one for the wounded warder one for 1247 whom i had shot and four for the convicts whom i had knocked over with the butt end of the rifle they carried us up on them strongly guarded in a long procession  at the door of the infirmary the governor met us 1430 he said to me in a very kind voice you have behaved most admirably i saw you myself quite distinctly from my drawingroom windows your bravery and intrepidity are well deserving of the highest recognition  sir i answered i have only tried to do my duty i couldnt stand by and see an innocent man murdered by such a pack of bloodthirsty ruffians  the governor turned aside a little surprised who is 1430 he asked quietly  a subordinate consulting a book whispered my name and supposed crime to him confidentially the governor nodded twice and seemed to be satisfied  sir the wounded warder said faintly from his stretcher 1430 is an innocent man unjustly condemned if ever there was one   ii  on the thursday week following when my wounds were all getting well the whole body of convicts was duly paraded at halfpast eleven in front of the governors house  the governor came out holding an officiallooking paper in his right hand no 1430 he said in a loud voice stand forward and i stood forward  no 1430 i have the pleasant duty of informing you in face of all your fellowprisoners that your heroism and selfdevotion in saving the life of warder james woollacott when he was attacked and almost overpowered on the twentieth of this month by a gang of rebellious convicts has been reported to her majestys secretary of state for the home department and that on his recommendation her majesty has been graciously pleased to grant you a free pardon for the remainder of the time during which you were sentenced to penal servitude  for a moment i felt quite stunned and speechless i reeled on my feet so much that two of the warders jumped forward to support me it was a great thing to have at least ones freedom but in another minute the real meaning of the thing came clearer upon me and i recoiled from the bare sound of those horrid words a free pardon i didnt want to be pardoned like a convicted felon i wanted to have my innocence proved before the eyes of all england for my own sake and still more for emilys sake rehabilitation was all i cared for  sir i said touching my cap respectfully and saluting the governor according to our wonted prison discipline i am very greatly obliged to you for your kindness in having made this representation to the home secretary but i feel compelled to say i cannot accept a free pardon i am wholly guiltless of the crime of which i have been convicted and i wish that instead of pardoning me the home secretary would give instructions to the detective police to make a thorough investigation of the case with the object of proving my complete innocence till that is done i prefer to remain an inmate of portland prison what i wish is not pardon but to be restored as an honest man to the society of my equals  the governor paused for a moment and consulted quietly in an undertone with one or two of his subordinates then he turned to me with great kindness and said in a loud voice no 1430 i have no power any longer to detain you in this prison even if i wished to do so after you have once obtained her majestys free pardon my duty is to dismiss you at once in accordance with the terms of this document however i will communicate the substance of your request to the home secretary with whom such a petition so made will doubtless have the full weight that may rightly attach to it you must now go with these warders who will restore you your own clothes and then formally set you at liberty but if there is anything further you would wish to speak to me about you can do so afterward in your private capacity as a free man at two oclock in my own office  i thanked him quietly and then withdrew at two oclock i duly presented myself in ordinary clothes at the governors office  we had a long and confidential interview in the course of which i was able to narrate to the governor at full length all the facts of my strange story exactly as i have here detailed them he listened to me with the greatest interest checking and confirming my statements at length by reference to the file of papers brought to him by a clerk when i had finished my whole story he said to me quite simply mr tait it may be imprudent of me in my position and under such peculiar circumstances to say so but i fully and unreservedly believe your statement if anything that i can say or do can be of any assistance to you in proving your innocence i shall be very happy indeed to exert all my influence in your favour  i thanked him warmly with tears in my eyes  and there is one point in your story he went on to which i who have seen a good deal of such doubtful cases attach the very highest importance you say that gold clippings pronounced to be similar in character to the gold wulfric were found shortly after by a cleaner at the museum on the cocoanut matting of the floor where the coin was examined by you  i nodded blushing crimson that i said seems to me the strangest and most damning circumstance against me in the whole story  precisely the governor answered quietly and if what you say is the truth as i believe it to be it is also the circumstance which best gives us a clue to use against the real culprit the person who stole the coin was too clever by half or else not quite clever enough for his own protection in manufacturing that last fatal piece of evidence against you he was also giving you a certain clue to his own identity  how so i asked breathless  why dont you see the thief must in all probability have been somebody connected with the museum he must have seen you comparing the wulfric with your own coin he must have picked it up and carried it off secretly at the moment you dropped it he must have clipped the coin to manufacture further hostile evidence and he must have dropped the clippings afterwards on the cocoanut matting in the same gallery on purpose in order to heighten the suspicion against you  you are right i cried brightening up at the luminous suggestionyou are right obviously and there is only one man who could have seen and heard enough to carry out this abominable plotmactavish  well find him out and prove the case against him mr tait the governor said warmly and if you send him here to us i can promise you that he will be well taken care of  i bowed and thanked him and was about to withdraw but he held out his hand to me with perfect frankness  mr tait he said i cant let you go away so let me have your hand in token that you bear us no grudge for the way we have treated you during your unfortunate imprisonment and that i for my part am absolutely satisfied of the truth of your statement   iii  the moment i arrived in london i drove straight off without delay to emilys i had telegraphed beforehand that i had been granted a free pardon but had not stopped to tell her why or under what conditions  emily met me in tears in the passage harold harold she cried flinging her arms wildly around me oh my darling my darling how can i ever say it to you mamma says she wont allow me to see you here any longer  it was a terrible blow but i was not unprepared for it how could i expect that poor conventional commonplace old lady to have any faith in me after all she had read about me in the newspapers  emily i said kissing her over and over again tenderly you must come out with me then this very minute for i want to talk with you over matters of importance whether your mother wishes it or not you must come out with me this very minute  emily put on her bonnet hastily and walked out with me into the streets of london it was growing dark and the neighbourhood was a very quiet one or else perhaps even my own emily would have felt a little ashamed of walking about the streets of london with a man whose hair was still cropped short around his head like a common felons  i told her all the story of my release and emily listened to it in profound silence  harold she cried my darling harold when i told her the tale of my desperate battle over the fallen warder you are the bravest and best of men i knew you would vindicate yourself sooner or later what we have to do now is to show that mactavish stole the wulfric i know he stole it i read it at the trial in his cleanshaven villains face i shall prove it still and then you will be justified in the eyes of everybody  but how can we manage to communicate meanwhile darling i cried eagerly if your mother wont allow you to see me how are we ever to meet and consult about it  theres only one way haroldonly one way and as things now stand you mustnt think it strange of me to propose it harold you must marry me immediately whether mamma will let us or not  emily i cried my own darling your confidence and trust in me makes me i cant tell you how proud and happy that you should be willing to marry me even while i am under such a cloud as this gives me a greater proof of your love than anything else you could possibly do for me but darling i am too proud to take you at your word for your sake emily i will never marry you until all the world has been compelled unreservedly to admit my innocence  emily blushed and cried a little as you will harold dearest she answered trembling i can afford to wait for you i know that in the end the truth will be established   iv  a week or two later i was astonished one morning at receiving a visit in my london lodgings from the warder woollacott whose life i had been happily instrumental in saving at portland prison  well sir he said grasping my hand warmly and gratefully you see i havent yet entirely recovered from that terrible morning i shall bear the marks of it about me for the remainder of my lifetime the governor says i shall never again be fit for duty so theyve pensioned me off very honourable  i told him how pleased i was that he should have been liberally treated and then we fell into conversation about myself and the means of reestablishing my perfect innocence  sir said he i shall have plenty of leisure and shall be comfortably off now if theres anything that i can do to be of service to you in the matter i shall gladly do it my time is entirely at your disposal  i thanked him warmly but told him that the affair was already in the hands of the regular detectives who had been set to work upon it by the governors influence with the home secretary  byandby i happened to mention confidentially to him my suspicions of the man mactavish an idea seemed to occur to the warder suddenly but he said not a word to me about it at the time a few days later however he came back to me quietly and said in a confidential tone of voice well sir i think we may still manage to square him  square who mr woollacott i dont understand you  why mactavish sir i found out he had a small house near the museum and his wife lets a lodging there for a single man ive gone and taken the lodging and i shall see whether in the course of time something or other doesnt come out of it  i smiled and thanked him for his enthusiasm in my cause but i confess i didnt see how anything on earth of any use to me was likely to arise from this strange proceeding on his part   v  it was that same week i believe that i received two other unexpected visitors they came together one of them was the superintendent of coins at the british museum the other was the wellknown antiquary and great authority upon the anglosaxon coinage sir theophilus wraxton  mr tait the superintendent began not without some touch of natural shamefacedness in his voice and manner i have reason to believe that i may possibly have been mistaken in my positive identification of the coin you showed me that day at the museum as our own specimen of the gold wulfric if i was mistaken then i have unintentionally done you a most grievous wrong and for that wrong should my suspicions turn out illfounded i shall owe you the deepest and most heartfelt apologies but the only reparation i can possibly make you is the one i am doing today by bringing here my friend sir theophilus wraxton he has a communication of some importance to make to you and if he is right i can only beg your pardon most humbly for the error i have committed in what i believed to be the discharge of my duties  sir i answered i saw at the time you were the victim of a mistake as i was the victim of a most unfortunate concurrence of circumstances and i bear you no grudge whatsoever for the part you bore in subjecting me to what is really in itself a most unjust and unfounded suspicion you only did what you believed to be your plain duty and you did it with marked reluctance and with every desire to leave me every possible loophole of escape from what you conceived as a momentary yielding to a vile temptation but what is it that sir theophilus wraxton wishes to tell me  well my dear sir the old gentleman began warmly i havent the slightest doubt in the world myself that you have been quite unwarrantably disbelieved about a plain matter of fact that ought at once to have been immediately apparent to anybody who knew anything in the world about the gold anglosaxon coinage no reflection in the world upon you harbourne my dear friendno reflection in the world upon you in the matter but you must admit that youve been pigheadedly hasty in jumping to a conclusion and ignorantly determined in sticking to it against better evidence my dear sir i havent the very slightest doubt in the world that the coin now in the british museum is not the one which i have seen there previously and which i have figured in the third volume of my early northumbrian and mercian numismatist quite otherwise quite otherwise i assure you  how do you recognize that it is different sir i cried excitedly the two coins were struck at just the same mint from the same die and i examined them closely together and saw absolutely no difference between them except the dent and the amount of the clipping  quite true quite true the old gentleman replied with great deliberation but look here sir here is the drawing i took of the museum wulfric fourteen years ago for the third volume of my northumbrian numismatist that drawing was made with the aid of careful measurements which you will find detailed in the text at page 230 now here again is the duplicate wulfricpermit me to call it your wulfric and if you will compare the two youll find i think that though your wulfric is a great deal smaller than the original one taken as a whole yet on one diameter the diameter from the letter u in wulfric to the letter r in rex it is nearly an eighth of an inch broader than the specimen i have there figured well sir you may cut as much as you like off a coin and make it smaller but hang me if by cutting away at it for all your lifetime you can make it an eighth of an inch broader anyhow in any direction  i looked immediately at the coin the drawing and the measurements in the book and saw at a glance that sir theophilus was right  how on earth did you find it out i asked the bland old gentleman breathlessly  why my dear sir i remembered the old coin perfectly having been so very particular in my drawing and measurement and the moment i clapped eyes on the other one yesterday i said to my good friend harbourne here harbourne said i somebodys been changing your wulfric in the case over yonder for another specimen changing it said harbourne not a bit of it clipping it you mean no no my good fellow said i do you suppose i dont know the same coin again when i see it and at my time of life too this is another coin not the same one clipped its bigger across than the old one from there to there no it isnt says he but it is i answer just you look in my northumbrian and mercian and see if it isnt so you must be mistaken says harbourne if i am ill eat my head says i well we get down the numismatist from the bookshelf then and there and sure enough it turns out just as i told him harbourne turned as white as a ghost i can tell you as soon as he discovered it why says he ive sent a poor young fellow off to portland prison only three or four months ago for stealing that very wulfric and then he told me all the story very well said i then the only thing youve got to do is just to go and call on him tomorrow and let him know that youve had it proved to you fairly proved to you that this is not the original wulfric  sir theophilus i said im much obliged to you what you point out is by far the most important piece of evidence ive yet had to offer mr harbourne have you kept the gold clippings that were found that morning on the cocoanut matting  i have mr tait the superintendent answered anxiously and sir theophilus and i have been trying to fit them upon the coin in the museum shelves and i am bound to admit i quite agree with him that they must have been cut off a specimen decidedly larger in one diameter and smaller in another than the existing onein short that they do not fit the clipped wulfric now in the museum   vi  it was just a fortnight later that i received quite unexpectedly a telegram from rome directed to me at my london lodgings i tore it open hastily it was signed by emily and contained only these few words we have found the museum wulfric the superintendent is coming over to identify and reclaim it can you manage to run across immediately with him  for a moment i was lost in astonishment delight and fear how and why had emily gone over to rome who could she have with her to take care of her and assist her how on earth had she tracked the missing coin to its distant hidingplace it was all a profound mystery to me and after my first outburst of joy and gratitude i began to be afraid that emily might have been misled by her eagerness and anxiety into following up the traces of the wrong coin  however i had no choice but to go to rome and see the matter ended and i went alone wearing out my soul through that long journey with suspense and fear for i had not managed to hit upon the superintendent who through his telegram being delivered a little the sooner had caught a train six hours earlier than the one i went by  as i arrived at the central station at rome i was met to my surprise by a perfect crowd of familiar faces first emily herself rushed to me kissed me and assured me a hundred times over that it was all right and that the missing coin was undoubtedly recovered then the superintendent more shamefaced than ever and very grave but with a certain moisture in his eyes confirmed her statement by saying that he had got the real museum wulfric undoubtedly in his pocket then sir theophilus who had actually come across with lady wraxton on purpose to take care of emily added his assurances and congratulations last of all woollacott the warder stepped up to me and said simply im glad sir that it was through me as it all came out so right and even  tell me how it all happened i cried almost faint with joy and still wondering whether my innocence had really been proved beyond all fear of cavil  then woollacott began and told me briefly the whole story he had consulted with the superintendent and sir theophilus without saying a word to me about it and had kept a close watch upon all the letters that came for mactavish a rare anglosaxon coin is not a chattel that one can easily get rid of every day and woollacott shrewdly gathered from what sir theophilus had told him that mactavish or whoever else had stolen the coin would be likely to try to dispose of it as far away from england as possible especially after all the comments that had been made on this particular wulfric in the english newspapers so he took every opportunity of intercepting the postman at the front door and looking out for envelopes with foreign postage stamps at last one day a letter arrived for mactavish with an italian stamp and a cardinals red hat stamped like a crest on the flap of the envelope woollacott was certain that things of that sort didnt come to mactavish every day about his ordinary business braving the penalties for appropriating a letter he took the liberty to open this suspicious communication and found it was a note from cardinal trevelyan the popes chamberlain and a wellknown collector of antiquities referring to early church history in england and that it was in reply to an offer of mactavishs to send the cardinal for inspection a rare gold coin not otherwise specified the cardinal expressed his readiness to see the coin and to pay a hundred and fifty pounds for it if it proved to be rare and genuine as described woollacott felt certain that this communication must refer to the gold wulfric he therefore handed the letter to mrs mactavish when the postman next came his rounds and waited to see whether mactavish any day afterwards went to the post to register a small box or packet meanwhile he communicated with emily and the superintendent being unwilling to buoy me up with a doubtful hope until he was quite sure that their plan had succeeded the superintendent wrote immediately to the cardinal mentioning his suspicions and received a reply to the effect that he expected a coin of wulfric to be sent him shortly sir theophilus who had been greatly interested in the question of the coin kindly offered to take emily over to rome in order to get the criminating piece as soon as it arrived from cardinal trevelyan that was in turn the story that they all told me piece by piece in the central station at rome that eventful morning  and mactavish i asked of the superintendent eagerly  is in custody in london already he answered somewhat sternly i had a warrant out against him before i left town on this journey  at the trial the whole case was very clearly proved against him and my innocence was fully established before the face of all my fellowcountrymen a fortnight later my wife and i were among the rocks and woods at ambleside and when i returned to london it was to take a place in the department of coins at the british museum which the superintendent begged of me to accept as some further proof in the eyes of everybody that the suspicion he had formed in the matter of the wulfric was a most unfounded and wholly erroneous one the coin itself i kept as a memento of a terrible experience but i have given up collecting on my own account entirely and am quite content nowadays to bear my share in guarding the national collection from other depredators of the class of mactavish     my uncles will   i  my dear mr payne said my deceased uncles lawyer with an emphatic wag of his forefinger i assure you theres no help for it the language of the will is perfectly simple and explicit either you must do as your late uncle desired or you must let the property go to the representative of his deceased wifes family  but surely blenkinsopp i said deprecatingly we might get the court of chancery to set it aside as being contrary to public policy or something of that sort i know you can get the court of chancery to affirm almost anything you ask them especially if its something a little abstruse and out of the common it gratifies the courts opinion of its own acumen now clearly its contrary to public policy that a man should go and make his own nephew ridiculous by his last will and testament isnt it  mr blenkinsopp shook his head vigorously bless my soul mr payne he answered helping himself to a comprehensive pinch from his snuffbox an odious habit confined i believe at the present day to family solicitors bless my soul my dear sir the things simply impossible heres your uncle the late anthony aikin esquire deceased a person of sound mind and an adult male above the age of twentyone yearsto be quite accurate oetatis suoe seventyeightmakes his will and duly attests the same in the presence of two witnesses everything quite in order not a single point open to exception in any way well he gives and bequeaths to his nephew theodore payne gentlemanthats youafter a few unimportant legacies the bulk of his real and personal estate provided only that you adopt the surname of aikin prefixed before and in addition to your own surname of payne butand this is very importantif you dont choose to adopt and use the said surname of aikin in the manner hereinbefore recited then and in that case my dear sirwhy then and in that case as clear as currant jelly the whole said residue of his real and personal estate is to go to the heir or heirsatlaw of the late amelia maria susannah aikin wife of the said anthony aikin esquire deceased nothing could be simpler or plainer in any way and theres really nothing on earth for you to do except to choose between the two alternatives so clearly set before you by your deceased uncle  but look here you know blenkinsopp i said appealingly no fellow can really be expected to go and call himself aikinpayne now can he its positively too ridiculous mightnt i stick the payne before the aikin and call myself payneaikin eh that wouldnt be quite so absurdly suggestive of a perpetual toothache but aikinpayne why the comic papers would take it up immediately every footman in london would grin audibly when he announced me i fancy i hear the fellows this very moment flinging open the door with a violent attempt at seriousness and shouting out mr hachingpain ha ha ha with a loud guffaw behind the lintel it would be simply unendurable  my dear sir answered the unsympathetic blenkinsopp most unsympathetic profession an attorneys really the law doesnt take into consideration the question of the probable conduct of footmen it must be aikinpayne or nothing i admit the collocation does sound a little ridiculous to be sure but your uncles will is perfectly unequivocal upon the subjectin fact ahem i drew it up myself to say the truth and unless you call yourself aikinpayne in the manner hereinbefore recited then and in that case observe theres no deception then and in that case the heir or heirsatlaw of the late amelia maria susannah aforesaid will be entitled to benefit under the will as fully in every respect as if the property was bequeathed directly to him her or them by name and to no other person  and who the dickens are these heirsatlaw blenkinsopp i ventured to ask after a moments pause during which the lawyer had refreshed himself with another prodigious sniff from his snuffbox  who the dickens are they mr payne i should say mr aikinpayne ahemwhy how the dickens should i know sir you dont suppose i keep a genealogical table and full pedigree of all the second cousins of all my clients hung up conspicuously in some spare corner of my brain do you eh upon my soul i really havent the slightest notion all i know about them is that the late mrs amelia maria susannah aikin deceased had one sister who married somebody or other somewhere against mr anthony aikins wishes and that he never had anything further to say to her at any time but where shes gone and how she fares nobody knows and nobody cares sir as the poet justly remarks  i was not previously acquainted with the poets striking observation on this matter but i didnt stop to ask mr blenkinsopp in what authors work these stirring lines had originally appeared i was too much occupied with other thoughts at that moment to pursue my investigations into their authorship and authenticity upon my word blenkinsopp i said ive really half a mind to shy the thing up and go on with my schoolmastering  mr blenkinsopp shrugged his shoulders believe me my dear young friend he said sententiously twelve hundred a year is not to be sneezed at without inquiring too precisely into the exact state of your existing finances i should be inclined to say your present engagement cant be worth to you more than three hundred a year  i nodded acquiescence the exact figure i murmured  and your private means are  nonexistent i answered frankly  then my dear sir excuse such plainness of speech in a man of my profession but if you throw it up you will be a perfect fool sir a perfect fool i assure you  but perhaps blenkinsopp the nextofkin wont step in to claim it  doesnt matter a bit my dear fellow executors are bound to satisfy themselves before paying you over your legacy that you have assumed and will use the name of aikin before and in addition to your own name of payne in the manner hereinbefore recited theres no getting over that in any way  i sighed aloud twelve hundred a year is certainly very comfortable i said but its a confounded bore that one should have a condition tacked on to it which will make one a laughingstock for life to all the buffoons and idiots of ones acquaintance  blenkinsopp nodded in modified assent after all he answered i wouldnt mind taking it on the same terms myself  well said i che sara sara if it must be it must be and you may put an advertisement into the times accordingly tell the executors that i accept the condition   ii  i wont stop in town said i to myself to be chaffed by all the fellows at the club and in the masters room at st martins ill run over on the continent until the wags confound them have forgotten all about it im a sensitive man and if theres anything on earth i hate its cheap and easy joking and punning on a name or a personal peculiarity which lays itself open obviously to stupid buffoonery of course i shall chuck up the schoolmastering nowits an odious trade at any timeand i may as well take a pleasant holiday while im about it let me seenice or cannes or florence would be the best thing at this time of year escape the november fogs and january frosts lets make it cannes then and try the first effect of my new name upon the corpus vile of the cannois  so i packed up my portmanteau hurriedly took the 745 to paris and that same evening found myself comfortably ensconced in a wagon lit making my way as fast as the lyons line would carry me en route for the blue mediterranean  the hôtel du paradis at cannes is a very pleasant and well managed place where i succeeded in making myself perfectly at home i gave my full name to the concierge boldly thank heaven i thought aikinpayne will sound to her just as good a label to ones back as howard or cholmondely she wont see the absurdity of the combination she was a fat vaudoise swiss by origin and she took it without moving a muscle but she answered me in very tolerable englishme who thought my parisian accent unimpeachable vary well sirr your lettares shall be sent to your apartments i saw there was the faintest twinkle of a smile about the corner of her mouth and i felt that even she a mere foreigner a swiss concierge perceived at once the incongruity of the two surnames incongruity thats the worst of it would that they were incongruous but its their fatal and obvious congruity with one another that makes their juxtaposition so ridiculous call a man payne and i venture to say though i was to the manner born and its me that says it as oughtnt to say it you couldnt find a neater or more respectable surname in all england call him plain aikin and though that perhaps is less aristocratic its redeemed by all the associations of childhood with the earliest literature we imbibed through the innocuous pages of evenings at home but join the two together in the order of alphabetical precedence and you get an aikinpayne which is a thing to make a sensitive man compelled to bear it for a lifetime turn permanently red like a boiled lobster my uncle must have done it on purpose in order to inflict a deadly blow on what he would doubtless have called my confounded selfconceit  however i changed my tourist suit for a black cutaway and made my way down to the salleàmanger the dinner was good in itself and was enlivened for me by the presence of an extremely pretty girl of say nineteen who sat just opposite and whose natural protector i soon managed to draw casually into a general conversation i say her natural protector because though i took him at the time for her father i discovered afterwards that he was really her uncle experience has taught me that when you sit opposite a pretty girl at an hotel you ought not to open fire by directing your observations to herself in person you should begin diplomatically by gaining the confidence of her male relations through the wisdom or the orthodoxy of your political and social opinions mr shacklefordthat i found afterwards was the uncles namehappened to be a fiery tory while i have the personal misfortune to be an equally rabid radical but on this occasion i successfully dissembled acquiescing with vague generality in his denunciation of my dearest private convictions and by the end of dinner we had struck up quite an acquaintance with one another  ruby said the aunt to the pretty girl as soon as dinner was over shall we take a stroll out in the gardens  ruby what a charming name really i wonder now what is her surname and what a beautiful graceful figure as she rises from the table and throws her little pale blue indian silk scarf around her pretty shoulders clearly ruby is a person whose acquaintance i ought to cultivate  uncle wont come of course said ruby with a pleasant smile what teeth the evening air would be too much for him you know she added looking across to me almost everybody at cannes is in the invalid line and mustnt stir out after sunset aunt and i are unfashionable enough to be quite strong and to go in for a stroll by moonlight  i happen to be equally out of the cannes fashion i said directing my observation with great strategic skill rather to the aunt than to miss ruby in person and if you will allow me i should be very glad to accompany you  so we turned out on the terrace of the paradis and walked among the datepalms and prickly pears that fill the pretty tropical garden it was a lovely moonlight evening in october and october is still almost a summer month in the riviera the feathery branches of the palms stood out in clearcut outline against the pale moonlit sky the white houses of cannes gleamed with that peculiarly soft greenish mediterranean tint in the middle distance and the sea reflected the tremulous shimmer in the background between the jagged sierra of the craggy esterel and the long low outline of the ile ste marguerite altogether it was an ideal poets evening the very evening to stroll for the first time with a beautiful girl through the charmed alleys of a provençal garden  ruby estcourtshe gave me her name before longwas quite as pleasant to talk to as she was beautiful and graceful to behold fortunately her aunt was not one of the race of talkative old ladies and she left the mass of the conversation entirely to ruby and myself in the course of half an hour or so spent in pacing up and down that lovely terrace i had picked out bit by bit all that i most wanted to know about ruby estcourt she was an orphan without brothers or sisters and evidently without any large share of this worlds goods and she lived with her aunt and uncle who were childless people and who usually spent the summer in switzerland retiring to the riviera every winter for the benefit of mr shacklefords remaining lung quite simple and unaffected ruby seemed though she had passed most of her lifetime in the tooknowing atmosphere of continental hotels among that cosmopolitan public which is so very sharpsighted that it fancies it can see entirely through such arrant humbug as honour in men and maidenly reserve in women still from that world ruby estcourt had somehow managed to keep herself quite unspotted and a simpler prettier more natural little fairy you wouldnt find anywhere in the english villages of half a dozen counties  it was all so fresh and delightful to methe palms the mediterranean the balmy evening air the gleaming white town and pretty ruby estcourtthat i walked up and down on the terrace as long as they would let me and i was really sorry when good mrs shackleford at last suggested that it was surely getting time for uncles game of cribbage as they turned to go ruby said good evening and then hesitating for a moment as to my name said quite simply and naturally why you havent yet told us who you are have you  i coloured a littlehappily invisible by moonlightas i answered that was an omission on my part certainly when you told me you were miss estcourt i ought to have mentioned in return that my own name was aikinpayne theodore aikinpayne if you please may i give you a card  aching pain ruby said with a smile did i hear you right aching pain is it oh what a very funny name  i drew myself up as stiffly as i was able not aching pain i said with a doleful misgiving in my heartit was clear everybody would put that odd misinterpretation upon it for the rest of my days not aching pain but aikinpayne miss estcourt aikin aikin the aikins of staffordshire payne payne the paynes of surrey my original surname was payne a surname that i venture to say im a little proud of but my uncle mr aikin from whom i inherit property i thought that was rather a good way of putting it wished me to adopt his family name in addition to my ownin fact made it a condition sine quâ non of my receiving the property  payneaikin ruby said turning the names over to herself slowly ah yes i see excuse my misapprehension mrmr aikinpayne it was very foolish of me but really you know it does sound so very ludicrous doesnt it now  i bit my lip and tried to smile back again absurd that a man should be made miserable about such a trifle and yet i will freely confess that at that moment in spite of my uncles twelve hundred a year i felt utterly wretched i bowed to pretty little ruby as well as i was able and took a couple more turns by myself hurriedly around the terrace  was it only fancy or did i really detect as ruby estcourt said the two names over to herself just now that she seemed to find the combination a familiar one i really didnt feel sure about it but it certainly did sound as if she had once known something about the paynes or the aikins ah well there are lots of paynes and aikins in the world no doubt but alas there is only one of them doomed to go through life with the absurd label of an aikinpayne fastened upon his unwilling shoulders   iii  good morning mrmr aikinpayne said ruby estcourt stumbling timidly over the name as we met in the salleàmanger at breakfast next day i hope you dont feel any the worse for the chilly air last evening  i bowed slightly you seem to have some difficulty in remembering my full name miss estcourt i said suggestively suppose you call me simply mr payne ive been accustomed to it till quite lately and to tell you the truth i dont altogether relish the new addition  i should think not indeed ruby answered frankly i never heard such a ridiculous combination in all my life before im sure your uncle must have been a perfect old bear to impose it upon you  it was certainly rather cruel of him i replied as carelessly as i could or at least rather thoughtless i dare say though the absurdity of the two names put together never struck him what are you going to do with yourselves today mr shackleford everybody at cannes has nothing to do but to amuse themselves i suppose  mr shackleford answered that they were going to drive over in the morning to vallauris and that if i cared to share a carriage with them he would be happy to let me accompany his party nothing could have suited my book better i was alone i wanted society and amusement and i had never seen a prettier girl than ruby estcourt here was the very thing i needed ready cut out to my hand by propitious fortune i found out as time went on that mr shackleford being a person of limited income and a bad walker had only one desire in life which was to get somebody else to pay half his carriage fares for him by arrangement we went to a great many places together and he always divided the expenses equally between us although i ought only to have paid a quarter as his party consisted of three people while i was one solitary bachelor this apparent anomaly he got over on the ingenious ground that if i had taken a carriage by myself it would have cost me just twice as much however as i was already decidedly anxious for pretty little ruby estcourts society this question of financial detail did not weigh heavily upon me besides a man who has just come into twelve hundred a year can afford to be generous in the matter of hackney carriages  we had a delightful drive along the shore of that beautiful blue gulf to vallauris and another delightful drive back again over the hills to the paradis true old mr shackleford proved rather a bore through his anxiety to instruct me in the history and technical nature of keramic ware in general and of the vallauris pottery in particular when i wanted rather to be admiring the glimpses of bordighera and the cap st martin and the snowclad summits of the maritime alps with ruby estcourt but in spite of all drawbacksand old mr shackleford with his universal information really was a serious drawbacki thoroughly enjoyed that first morning by the lovely mediterranean ruby herself was absolutely charming such a light bright fairylike little person moving among the priceless vases and tazzas at clément massiers as if she were an embodied zephyr too gentle even to knock them over with a whiff of her little rampoor shawlbut there i cant describe her and i wont attempt it ruby looking over my shoulder at this moment says i always was an old stupid so that you see closes the question  an old stupid i certainly was for the next fortnight old mr shackleford only too glad to have got hold of a willing victim in the carriagesharing fraud dragged me about the country to every available point of view or object of curiosity within ten miles of the square brougham ruby usually accompanied us and as the two old people naturally occupied the seat of honour at the back of the carriage why of course ruby and i had to sit together with our backs to the horsesa mode of progression which i had never before known to be so agreeable every evening ruby and i walked out on the terrace in the moonlight and i need hardly say that the moon in spite of her pretended coldness is really the most romantic and sentimental satellite in the whole solar system to cut a long story short by the end of the fortnight i was very distinctly in love with ruby and if you wont think the avowal a conceited one i venture to judge by the sequel that ruby was almost equally in love with me  one afternoon towards the close of my second week at cannes ruby and i were sitting together on the retired seat in the grounds beside the pond with the goldfish it was a delicious sunny afternoon with the last touch of southern summer in the air and ruby was looking even prettier than usual in her brocade pattern print dress and her little straw hat with the scarlet poppies ruby always dressedi may say dressesin the very simplest yet most charming fashion there was something in the time and place that moved me to make a confession i had for some time been meditating so i looked straight in her face and not being given to long speeches i said to her just this ruby you are the sweetest girl i ever saw in my life will you marry me  ruby only looked at me with a face full of merriment and burst out laughing why mr payne she said she had dropped that hideous prefix long ago youve hardly known me yet a fortnight and here you come to me with a regular declaration how can i have had time to think about my answer to such a pointblank question  if you like ruby i answered we can leave it open for a little but it occurs to me you might as well say yes at once for if we leave it open common sense teaches me that you probably mean to say yes in the longrun and to clench the matter outright i thought it best to stoop across and kiss ruby just once by way of earnest ruby took the kiss calmly and sedately so then i knew the matter was practically settled  but theres one thing mr payne i must really insist upon ruby said very quietly and that is that i mustnt be called mrs aikinpayne if i marry you at all i must marry you as plain mr payne without any aikin so thats clearly understood between us  here was a terrible condition indeed i reasoned with ruby i explained to ruby i told ruby that if she positively insisted upon it i must go back to my three hundred a year and my paltry schoolmastership and must give up my uncle aikins money ruby would hear of no refusal  you have always the alternative of marrying somebody else you know mr payne she said with her most provoking and bewitching smile but if you really do want to marry me you know the conditions  but ruby you would never care to live upon a miserable pittance of three hundred a year i hate the name as much as you do but i think i should try to bear it for the sake of twelve hundred a year and perfect comfort  no ruby was inexorable take me or leave me she said with provoking calmness but if you take me give up your uncles ridiculous suggestion you can have three days to make your mind up till then let us hear no more about the subject   iv  during those three days i kept up a brisk fire of telegrams with old blenkinsopp in chancery lane and at the end of them i came mournfully to the conclusion that i must either give up ruby or give up the twelve hundred a year if i had been a hero of romance i should have had no difficulty at all in deciding the matter i would have nobly refused the money offhand counting it as mere dross compared with the loving heart of a beautiful maiden but unfortunately i am not a hero of romance i am only an ordinary graduate of an english university under these circumstances it did seem to me very hard that i must throw away twelve hundred a year for a mere sentimental fancy and yet on the other hand not only did i hate the name myself but i couldnt bear to impose it on ruby and as to telling ruby that i wouldnt have her because i preferred the money that was clearly quite impossible the more i looked the thing in the face the more certain it appeared that i must relinquish my dream of wealth and go back with ruby to my schoolmastering and my paltry three hundred after all lots of other fellows marry on that sum and to say the truth i positively shrank myself from going through life under the ridiculous guise of an aikinpayne  the upshot of it all was that at the end of the three days i took ruby a little walk alone among the olive gardens behind the shrubbery ruby i said to her falteringly youre the most fantastic selfwilled imperious little person i ever met with and i want to make just one more appeal to you wont you reconsider your decision and take me in spite of the surname  ruby grubbed up a little weed with the point of her parasol and looked away from me steadfastly as she answered with her immovable and annoying calmness no mr payne i really cant reconsider the matter in any way it was you who took three days to make your mind up have you made it up yet or not pray  i have made it up ruby  and you mean she said interrogatively with a faint little tremor in her voice which i had never before noticed and which thrilled through me with the ecstasy of a first discovery  and i mean i answered to marry you ruby if you will condescend to take me and let my uncle aikins money go to halifax can you manage ruby to be happy as a poor schoolmasters wife in a very tiny cottage  to my joy and surprise ruby suddenly seized both my hands in hers kissed me twice of her own accord and began to cry as if nothing could stop her then you do really and truly love me she said through her tears holding fast to my hands all the time then youre really willing to make this great sacrifice for me  ruby i said my darling dont excite yourself so and indeed it isnt a very great sacrifice either for i hate the name so much i hardly know whether i could ever have endured to bear it  you shant bear it ruby cried eagerly now laughing and clapping her hands above me you shant bear it and yet you shall have your uncle aikins money all the same for all that  why what on earth do you mean ruby i asked in amazement surely my darling you cant understand how strict the terms of the will actually are im afraid you have been deluding yourself into a belief in some impossible compromise but you must make your mind up to one thing at once that unless i call myself aikinpayne youll have to live the rest of your life as a poor schoolmasters wife the nextofkin will be sharp enough in coming down upon the money  ruby looked at me and laughed and clapped her hands again but what would you say mr payne she said with a smile that dried up all her tears what would you say if you heard that the nextofkin waswho do you thinkwhy me sir me ruby estcourt  i could hardly believe my ears you ruby i cried in my astonishment you how do you know are you really sure of it  ruby put a lawyers letter into my hand signed by a famous firm in the city read that she said simply i read it through and saw in a moment that what ruby said was the plain truth of it  so you want to do your future husband out of the twelve hundred a year i said smiling and kissing her  no ruby answered as she pressed my hand gently it shall be settled on you since i know you were ready to give it up for my sake and there shall be no more aikinpaynes henceforth and for ever  there was never a prettier or more blushing bride than dear little ruby that day six weeks     the two carnegies   i  harold said ernest carnegie to his twinbrother at breakfast one morning have you got a tooth aching slightly today  yes by jove i have harold answered laying down the times and looking across the table with interest to his brother which one was yours  the third from the canine on the upper left side ernest replied quickly and yours  let me see this is the canine isnt it one two three yes the same of course its really a very singular coincidence how about the time was that as usual  ill tell you in a minute mine came on the day of the guthries hop i was down at brighton that morning what date let me think why the 9th im certain todays what mother  the 23rd said harold glancing for confirmation at the paper the law works itself out once more as regularly as if by machinery im just a fortnight later than you ernest as always  ernest drummed upon the table with his finger for a minute im afraid youll have it rather badly today harold he said after a pause mine got unbearable towards midday and if i hadnt had it looked to in the afternoon i couldnt have danced a single dance to save my life that evening i advise you to go round to the dentists immediately and try to get it stopped before it goes any further  harold finished his cup of coffee and looked out of the window blankly at the fog outside its an awful thought he said at last this living as we two do by clockwork everybody else lives exactly the same way but they dont have their attention called to it as we do just to think that from the day you and i were born ernest it was written in the very fabric of our constitutions that when we were twentythree years and five months old the third molar in our upper left jaws should begin to fail us its really appalling in its unanswerable physical fatalism when ones comes to think upon it  so i said to myself at the guthries the morning it began to give me a twinge said ernest in the selfsame tone it seemed to me such a terrible idea that in a fortnights time as certain as the sun the very same tooth in your head would begin to go as the one that was going in mine its too appalling really  but do you actually mean to say asked pretty little nellie holt the visitor newly come the day before from cheshire that whenever one of you gets a toothache the other one gets a toothache in the same tooth a fortnight later  not a toothache only ernest answeredhe was studying for his degree as a physician and took this department upon himself as by rightbut every other disease or ailment whatsoever were like two clocks wound up to strike at fixed moments only were not wound up to strike exactly together im fourteen days in advance of harold so to speak and whatever happens to me today will happen to him in all probability exactly a fortnight later  how very extraordinary said nellie looking quickly from one handsome clearcut face to its exact counterpart in the other and yet not so extraordinary after allwhen one comes to think how very much alike you both are  ah thats not all said ernest slowly its something that goes a good deal deeper than that miss holt consider that every one of us is born with a certain fixed and recognizable constitution which we inherit from our fathers and mothers in us from our birth upward are the seeds of certain diseases the possibilities of certain actions and achievements one man is born with hereditary consumption another man with hereditary scrofula a third with hereditary genius or hereditary drunkenness each equally innate in the very threads and strands of his system and its all bound to come out sooner or later in its own due and appointed time heres a fellow whose father had gout at forty hes born with such a constitution that as the hands on his lifedial reach forty out comes the gout in his feet wherever he may be as certain as fate its horrible to think of but its the truth and theres no good in disguising it  nellie holt shuddered slightly what a dreadful materialistic creed mr carnegie she said looking at him with a halffrightened air its almost as bad as mohammedan fatalism  no not so bad as that ernest carnegie answered not nearly so bad as that the oriental belief holds that powers above you compel your life against your will we modern scientific thinkers only hold that your own inborn constitution determines your whole life for you will included but whether we like it or dislike it miss holt there are the facts and nobody can deny them if youd lived with a twinsister as harold and i have lived together for twentythree years youd see that the clocks go as they are set with fixed and predestined regularity twins you know are almost exactly alike in all things and in the absolute coincidence of their constitutions you can see the inexorable march of disease and the inexorable unfolding of the predetermined lifehistory far better than in any other conceivable case im a scientific man myself you see and i have such an opportunity of watching it all as no other man ever yet had before me  my dear said mrs carnegie the mother from the head of the table youve no idea how curiously their two lives have always resembled one other when they were babies they were so much alike that we had to tie red and blue ribbons round their necks to distinguish them ernest was red and harold blueno ernest was blue and harold red at least im not quite certain which way it was but i know we have a note of it in the family bible for mr carnegie made it at the time for fear we should get confused between them when we were bathing them so we put the ribbons on the moment they were christened and never took them both off together for a second even to bathe them so as to prevent accidents well do you know dear from the time they were babies they were always alike in everything but ernest was always a fortnight before harold he said mamma one day and just a fortnight later harold said the very same word then ernest said sugar and so did harold in another fortnight ernest began to toddle a fortnight the earliest they took the whooping cough and the measles in the same order and they cut all their teeth so too the same teeth first on each side and just at a fortnights distance from one another its really quite an extraordinary coincidence  the real difficulty would be said harold to find anything in which we didnt exactly resemble one another well now i must be off to this horrid office with the pater are you ready pater ill call in at estwoods in the course of the morning ernest and tell him to look after my teeth i dont want to miss the balfours party this evening curious that we should be going to a party this evening too that isnt fated in our constitutions anyhow is it ernest good morning miss holt the first waltz remember come along pater and he went out followed immediately by his father  i must be going too said ernest looking at his watch i have an appointment with dowson at guys at halfpast tena very interesting case hereditary cataract three brothers all of them get it each as he reaches twelve years old and dowson has performed the operation on two and is going to perform it on the other this very day good morning miss holt the second waltz for me you wont forget will you  how awfully alike they really are mrs carnegie said nellie as they were left alone im sure i shall never be able to tell them apart i dont even know their names yet the one that has just gone out the one thats going to be a doctorthats mr harold isnt it  oh no dear mrs carnegie answered putting her arm round nellies waist affectionately thats ernest harolds the lawyer youll soon learn the difference between them you can tell ernest easily because he usually wears a horrid thing for a scarfpin an ivory skull and crossbones he wears it he says just to distinguish him professionally from harold indeed that was partly why mr carnegie was so anxious that harold should go into his own office so as to make a distinction of profession between them if harold had followed his own bent he would have been a doctor too theyre both full of what they call physiological ideasdreadful things i think them but mr carnegie thought as they were so very much alike already we ought to do something to give them some individuality as he says for if they were both to be doctors or both solicitors you know thered really be no knowing them apart even for ourselves and i assure you my dear as it is now even theyre exactly like one person  are they as alike in character then as they are in face asked nellie  alike in character my dear theyre absolutely identical whatever the one thinks or says or does the other thinks says and does at the same time independently why once ernest went over to paris for a weeks holiday while harold went on some law business of his fathers to brussels would you believe it when they came back theyd each got a present for the other ernest had seen a particular indian silver cigarcase in a shop on the boulevards and he brought it home as a surprise for harold well harold had bought an exactly similar one in the montagne de la cour and brought it home as a surprise for ernest and what was odder still each of them had had the others initials engraved upon the back in some sort of heathenish oriental characters  how very queer said nellie and yet they seem very fond of one another as a rule ones always told that people who are exactly alike in character somehow dont get on together  my dear child theyre absolutely inseparable their devotion to one anothers quite unlimited you see theyve been brought up together played together sympathized with one another in all their troubles and ailments and are sure of a response from each other about everything it was the greatest trouble of their lives when mr carnegie decided that harold must become a solicitor for the sake of the practice they couldnt bear at first to be separated all day and when they got home in the evening ernest from the hospital and harold from the office they met almost like a pair of lovers theyve talked together about their work so much that harold knows almost as much medicine now as ernest while ernests quite at home his father declares in benjamin on sales and chitty on contract its quite delightful to see how fond they are of one another  at five oclock ernest carnegie returned from his hospital he brought two little bunches of flowers with himsome lilies of the valley and a carnationand he handed them with a smile one to his sister and one to pretty little nellie i thought youd like them for this evening miss holt he said i chose a carnation on purpose because i fancied it would suit your hair  oh ernest said his sister you ought to have got a red camelia thats the proper thing for a brunette like nellie  nonsense edie ernest answered i hate camelias ugliest flowers out so stiff and artificial one might as well wear a starchy gauze thing from the milliners  im so glad you brought nellie holt a flower shes a sweet girl ernest isnt she said mrs carnegie a minute or two later as edie and nelly ran upstairs i wish either of you two boys could take a fancy to a nice girl like her now  my dear mother ernest answered turning up his eyes appealingly a little emptyheaded pinkandwhite thing like that i dont know what harold thinks but shed never do for me at any rate very pretty to look at very timid to talk to very nice and shrinking and all that kind of thing i grant you but nothing in her whenever i marry i shall marry a real live woman not a dainty piece of delicate empty drapery  at six oclock mr carnegie and harold came in from the office harold carried in his hand two little buttonhole bouquets of a few white lilies and a carnation miss holt he said as he entered the drawingroom ive brought you and edie a flower to wear at the balfours this evening this is for you edie with the pale pink the dark will suit miss holts hair best  edie looked at ernest and smiled significantly why didnt you get us camelias harold she asked with a faint touch of mischief in her tone  camelias my dear girl what a question i gave miss holt credit for better taste than liking camelias beastly things as stiff and conventional as dahlias or sunflowers you might just as well have a wax rose from an artificial flowermaker while you are about it  edie laughed and looked at nellie see here she said taking up ernests bunches from the little specimen vases where she had put them to keep them fresh in water somebody else has thought of the flowers already  harold laughed too a little uneasily aha he said i see ernest has been beforehand with me as usual im always a day too late it seems to me im the esau of this duet and ernests the jacob well miss holt you must take the will for the deed and after all one will do for your dress and the other for your hair wont they  harold said his father as they went upstairs together to dress for dinner nellie holts a very nice girl and ive reason to believeyou know i dont judge these matters without documentary evidencei have reason to believe that shell come into the greater part of old stanley holts money shes his favourite niece and she benefits largely as i happen to know under his will verbum sap my dear boy shes a pretty girl and has sweet manners in my opinion shed make  my dear pater harold exclaimed interrupting him for heavens sake dont say so pretty enough i grant you and no doubt old stanley holts money would be a very nice thing in its way but just seriously consider now if you were a young man yourself what on earth could you see in nellie holt to attract your love or admiration why she shrinks and blushes every time she speaks to you no no whenever i marry i should like to marry a girl of some presence and some character  well well said his father pausing a second at his bedroom door perhaps if she dont suit you harold shell suit ernest  i should have thought pater you knew us two better than that by this time  but my dear harold you cant both marry the same woman  no we cant pater but its my opinion we shall both fall unanimously in love with her at any rate whenever we happen to see her   ii  the balfours were very rich peoplecity people something in the stockbroking or bankruptcy line i believe ernest carnegie told nelly holt succinctly as they drove round in the brougham with his sister and their dance was of the finest modern moneyed fashion positively reeks with peruvian bonds and deferred egyptians doesnt it said harold as they went up the big open staircase and through the choice exotic flowers on the landing old balfour has so much money they say that if he tries his hardest he cant spend his days income in the twentyfour hours he had a good hard try at it once prince of wales or somebody came to a concert for some sort of public purposehospital or somethingand old b got the whole thing up on the tallest possible scale of expenditure spent a week in preparation had in dozens of powdered footmen ordered palms and orangetrees in boxes from nice hung electric lights all over the drawingroom offered pattalini and goldoni three times as much for their services as the total receipts for the charity were worth and at the end of it all he called in a crack accountant to reckon up the cost of the entertainment well he found with all his efforts hed positively lived fifty pounds within his weeks income extraordinary isnt it  very extraordinary indeed said nellie if its quite true you know  you owe me the first waltz harold said without noticing the reservation dont forget it please miss holt  i say balfour ernest carnegie observed to the son of the house shortly after they had entered the ballroom whos that beautiful tall dark girl over there no not the pink one that other girl behind her in the deep red satin  she oh shes nothing in particular harry balfour answered carelessly the girl in pink was worth eighty thousand and her figure cast into the shade all her neighbours in harry balfours arithmetical eyes her names walters isabel walters daughter of a lawyer fellowno offence meant to your profession carnegie let me see you are the lawyer arent you no knowing you two fellows apart you know especially when youve got white ties on  no im not the lawyer fellow ernest answered quietly im the doctor fellow but it doesnt at all matter were used to it would you mind introducing me to miss walters  certainly not come along i believe shes a very nice girl in her way you know and dances capitally but not exactly in our set you see not exactly in our set  i should have guessed as much to look at her ernest answered with a faint undertone of sarcasm in his voice that was quite thrown away upon harry balfour and he walked across the room after his host to ask isabel walters for the first waltz  tall he thought to himself as he looked at her dark fine face beautiful figure large eyes makes her own dresses strange sort of person to meet at the balfours dances  isabel walters danced admirably isabel walters talked cleverly isabel walters had a character and an individuality of her own in five minutes she had told ernest carnegie that she was the poor relation and in that quality she was asked once yearly to one of the balfours less distinguished dances this is a less distinguished she said quickly but i suppose you go to the more distinguished too  on the contrary ernest answered laughing though i didnt know the nature of the difference before ive no doubt that i have to thank the fact of my being less distinguished myself for the pleasure of meeting you here this evening  isabel smiled quietly its a family distinction only she said of course the balfours wouldnt like the people they ask to know it but we always notice the difference ourselves my mother you know was the first mrs balfours halfsister but in those days i need hardly tell you mr balfour hadnt begun to do great things in grand trunk preferences do you know anything about grand trunk preferences  absolutely nothing ernest replied but to come down to a more practical question are you engaged for the next lancers  a square dance oh why a square dance i hate square dances  i like them said ernest you can talk better  and yet you waltz capitally as a rule i notice the men who like square dances are the sticks who cant waltz without upsetting one no im not engaged for the next lancers yes with pleasure  ernest went off to claim little nellie holt from his brother  by jove ernest harold said as he met him again a little later in the evening thats a lovely girl you were dancing with just now who is she  a miss walters ernest answered drily  ill go and get introduced to her harold went on looking at his brother with a searching glance shes the finest girl in the room and i should like to dance with her  you think so said ernest and he turned away a little coldly to join a group of loungers by the doorway  this is not our lancers yet mr carnegie isabel said as harold stalked up to her with her cousin by his side ours is number seven  im not the same mr carnegie harold said smiling though i see i need no introduction now im number sevens brother and ive come to ask whether i may have the pleasure of dancing number six with you  isabel looked up at him in doubt you are joking surely she said you danced with me just now the first waltz  you see my brother over by the door harold answered but were quite accustomed to be taken for one another pray dont apologize were used to it  before the end of the evening isabel walters had danced three times with ernest carnegie and twice with harold before the end of the evening too ernest and harold were both at once deeply in love with her she was not perhaps what most men would call a lovable girl but she was handsome clever dashing and decidedly original now to both the carnegies alike there was no quality in a woman so admirable as individuality perhaps it was their own absolute identity of tastes and emotions that made them prize the possession of a distinct personality by others so highly but in any case there was no denying the fact that they were both head over ears in love with isabel walters  shes a splendid girl edie said harold as he went down with his sister to the cab in which he was to take her home a splendid girl just the sort of girl i should like to marry  not so nice by half as nellie holt said edie simply but there brothers never do marry the girls their sisters want them to  very unreasonable of the brothers no doubt harold replied with a slight curl of his lip but possibly explicable upon the ground that a man prefers choosing a wife wholl suit himself to choosing one wholl suit his sisters  mother said ernest as he took her down to the brougham with little nellie holt on his other arm thats a splendid girl that isabel walters i havent met such a nice girl as that for a long time  i know a great many nicer his mother answered glancing half unconsciously towards nellie but boys never do marry as their parents would wish them  they do not mother dear said ernest quietly its a strange fact but i dare say its partly dependent upon the general principle that a man is more anxious to live happily with his own wife than to provide a model daughterinlaw for his father and mother  isabel mrs walters said to her daughter as they took their seats in the cab that was waiting for them at the door what on earth did you mean by dancing five times in one evening with that young man with the light moustache and who on earth is he tell me  hes two people mamma isabel answered seriously and i danced three times with one of him and twice with the other i believe at least so he told me his names carnegie and half of hims called ernest and the other half harold though which i danced with which time im sure i cant tell you hes a pair of twins in fact one a doctor and one a lawyer and he talks just the same sort of talk in either case and is an extremely nice young man altogether i really like him immensely  carnegie said mrs walters turning the name over carefully two young carnegies how very remarkable i remember somebody was speaking to me about them and saying they were absolutely indistinguishable not sons of mr carnegie your uncles solicitor are they  yes so harry balfour told me  then isabel theyre very well off i understand i hope people wont think you danced five times in the evening with only one of them they ought to wear some distinctive coat or something to prevent misapprehensions which do you like best the lawyer or the doctor  i like them both exactly the same mamma there isnt any difference at all between them to like one of them better than the other for they both seem very pleasant and very clever and as i havent yet discovered which is which and didnt know from one time to another which i was dancing with i cant possibly tell you which i prefer of two identicals and as to coats mamma you know you couldnt expect one of them to wear a grey tweed suit in a ballroom just to show he isnt the other one  in the passage at the carnegies ernest and harold stopped one moment candle in hand to compare notes with one another before turning into their bedrooms there was an odd constraint about their manner to each other that they had never felt before during their twentythree years of life together  well said ernest inquiringly looking in a hesitating way at his brother  well harold echoed in the same tone  what did you think of it all harold  i think ernest i shall propose to miss walters  there was a moments silence and a black look gathered slowly on ernest carnegies brow then he said very deliberately you are in a great hurry coming to conclusions harold youve seen very little of her yet and remember it was i who first discovered her  harold glanced at him angrily and half contemptuously  you discovered her first he said yes and you are always beforehand with me but you shall not be beforehand with me this time i shall propose to her at once to prevent your anticipating me so now you know my intentions plainly and you can govern yourself accordingly  ernest looked back at him with a long look from head to foot  it is war then he said harold war you will have it we are rivals  yes rivals harold answered and war to the knife if so you wish it  war  war  good night harold  good night ernest  and they turned in to their bedrooms in anger with one another for the first time since they had quarrelled in boyish fashion over tops and marbles years ago together   iii  that night the two carnegies slept very little they were both in love very seriously in love and anybody who has ever been in the same condition must have noticed that the symptoms which may have been very moderate or undecided during the course of the evening become rapidly more pronounced and violent as you lie awake in the solitude of your chamber through the night watches but more than that they had both begun to feel simultaneously the stab of jealousy each of them had been very much taken indeed by isabel walters still if they had seen no chance of a rival looming in the distance they might have been content to wait a little to see a little more of her to make quite sure of their own affection before plunging headlong into a declaration after all its very absurd to ask a girl to be your companion for life on the strength of an acquaintanceship which has extended over the time occupied by three dances in a single evening but then thought each there was the chance of ernests proposing to her or of harolds proposing to her before i do that idea made precipitancy positively imperative and by the next morning each of the young men had fully made up his mind to take the first opportunity of asking isabella walters to be his wife  breakfast passed off very silently neither of the twins speaking much to one another but nobody noticed their reticence much for the morning after the occasional orgy or dance is apt to prove a very limp affair indeed in professional homes where dances are not of nightly occurrence after breakfast harold went off quickly to the office and ernest having bespoken a holiday at the hospital joined his sister and nellie holt in the library  do you know ernest edie said to him mindful of her last nights conversation with her other brother i really believe harold has fallen desperately in love at first sight with that tall miss walters  i can easily believe it ernest answered testily shes very handsome and very clever  edie raised her eyebrows a little but its awfully foolish ernest to fall in love blindfold in that way isnt it now she said with a searching look at her brother he cant possibly know what sort of a girl she really is from half an hours conversation in a ballroom  for my part i dont at all agree with you edie said ernest in his coldest manner i dont believe theres any right way of falling in love except at first sight if a girl is going to please you she ought to please you instantaneously and instinctively at least so i think it isnt a thing to be thought about and reasoned about but a thing to be felt and apprehended intuitively i couldnt reason myself into marrying a girl and whats more i dont want to  he sat down to the table took out a sheet or two of initialed notepaper and began writing a couple of letters one of them which he marked private in the corner ran as follows       my dear miss walters       perhaps you will think it very odd of me to venture upon writing      to you on the strength of such a very brief and casual acquaintance      as that begun last night but i have a particular reason for doing      so which i think i can justify to you when i see you you      mentioned to me that you were asked to the montagus steamlaunch      expedition up the river from surbiton tomorrow but i understood      you to say you did not intend to accept the invitation i write now      to beg of you to be there as i am going and i am particularly      anxious to meet you and have a little conversation with you on a      subject of importance i know you are not a very conventional      person and therefore i think you will excuse me for asking this      favour of you please dont take the trouble to write in reply but      answer by going to the montagus and i shall then be able to      explain this very queer letter in haste    yours very truly   ernest carnegie  he read this note two or three times over to himself looking not very well satisfied with its contents and then at last with the air of a man who determines to plunge and stake all upon a single venture he folded it up and put it in its envelope itll mystify her a little no doubt he thought to himself and being a woman shell be naturally anxious to unravel the mystery but of course shell know i mean to make her an offer and perhaps shell think me a perfect idiot for not doing it outright instead of beating about the bush in this incomprehensible fashion however its too coldblooded proposing to a girl on paper i very much prefer the vivâ voce system its only till tomorrow and i doubt if harold will manage to be beforehand with me in that time hell be deep in business all morning and have no leisure to think about her anyhow alls fair in love and war he said it should be war and ill try to steal a march upon him for all his lawyers quibbles and quiddits  he took another sheet from his blottingbook and wrote a second note much more rapidly than the first one it ran after this fashion       dear mrs montagu       will you think it very rude of me if i ask you to let me be one of      your party on your expedition up the river tomorrow i heard of it      from your son algernon last night at the balfours and i happen to      be very anxious to meet one of the ladies you have invited now      i know youre kindness itself to all your young friends in all      these little matters and im sure you wont be angry with me for      so coolly inviting myself if i hadnt felt perfect confidence in      your invariable goodness i wouldnt have ventured to do so please      dont answer unless youve no room for me but expect me to turn up      at halfpast two    yours very sincerely   ernest carnegie       pswe might call at lady portleburys lawn and look over the      conservatories  now thats bold but judicious ernest said to himself admiringly as he held the letter at armslength after blotting it she might have been angry at my inviting myself though i dont think she would be but im sure shell be only too delighted if i offer to take her guests over aunt portleburys conservatories the postscripts a stroke of genius what a fuss these people will make even over the widow of a stupid old cavalry officer because her husband happens to have been knighted its all the better that shes a widow indeed the delicious vagueness of the title lady is certainly one of its chief recommendations sir antony being out of the way mrs montagus guests cant really tell but that poor dear old aunt portlebury may be a real live countess and he folded his second letter up with the full satisfaction of an approving conscience  when isabel walters received ernest carnegies mysterious note she was certainly mystified by it as he had expected and also not a little gratified he meant to propose to her that was certain and there was never a woman in the whole world who was not flattered by a handsome young mans marked attentions it was a very queer letter no doubt but it had been written skilfully enough to suit the particular personality of isabel walters for ernest carnegie was a keen judge of character and he flattered himself that he knew how to adapt his correspondence to the particular temperament of the persons he happened to be addressing and though isabel had no very distinct idea of what the two carnegies were severally like it could hardly have been much more distinct if she had known them both intimately she felt they were two very goodlooking agreeable young men and she was not particularly averse to the attentions of either after all upon what straws we all usually hang our lovemaking we see one another once or twice under exceptionally deceptive circumstances we are struck at first sight with something that attracts us on either side we find the attraction is mutual we flounder at once into a declaration of undying attachment we get married and on the whole we generally find we were right after all in spite of our precipitancy and we live happily ever afterwards so it was not really very surprising that isabel walters getting such a note from one of the two handsome young mr carnegies should have been in some doubt which of the two identicals it actually was and yet should have felt indefinitely pleased and flattered at the implied attention which was ernest and which harold could only mean to her when she came to think on it which was the one she danced with first last night and which the one she danced with second she decided in her own mind that it would be better for her to go to the montagus picnic tomorrow but to say nothing about it to her mother mamma wouldnt understand the letter she said to herself complacently shes so conventional and when i come back tomorrow i can tell her one of the young carnegies was there and that he proposed to me she need never know there was any appointment   iv  at six oclock harold carnegie returned from the office he too had been thinking all day of isabel walters and the moment he got home he went into the library to write a short note to her before ernest had as usual forestalled him as he did so he happened to see a few words dimly transferred to the paper in the blottingbook they were in ernests handwriting and he was quite sure the four first words read my dear miss walters then ernest had already been beforehand with him after all but not by a fortnight that was one good point not this time by a fortnight he would be even with him yet he would catch up this anticipatory twinbrother of his by force or fraud rather than let him steal away isabel walters from him once and for ever alls fair in love and war he muttered to himself taking up the blottingbook carefully and tearing out the telltale leaf in a furtive fashion thank heaven ernest writes a thick black hand the same as i do and i shall probably be able to read it by holding it up to the light in his own soul harold carnegie loathed himself for such an act of petty meanness but he did it with love and jealousy goading him on and the fear of his own twinbrother stinging him madly he did it remorsefully and shamefacedly but still did it  he took the page up to his own bedroom and held it up to the windowpane blurred and indistinct the words nevertheless came out legibly in patches here and there so that with a little patient deciphering harold could spell out the sense of both letters though they crossed one another obliquely at a slight angle very brief and casual acquaintance  montagus steamlaunch expedition up the river from surbiton tomorrow  am going and am particularly anxious to meet you  this favour of you so thats his plan is it harold said to himself softly softly mr ernest i think i can checkmate you whats this in the one to mrs montagu expect me to turn up at halfpast two aha i thought so checkmate mr ernest checkmate a scholars mate for you hell be at the hospital till halfpast one then hell take the train to clapham junction expecting to catch the southwestern at 210 but tomorrows the first of the month the new timetables come into force ive got one and looked it out already the southwestern now leaves at 24 three minutes before mr ernests train arrives at clapham junction i have him now i have him now depend upon it ill go down instead of him ill get the party under way at once ill monopolize isabel pretty isabel ill find my opportunity at aunt portleburys and ernest wont get down to surbiton till the 250 train then hell find his bird flown already aha thatll make him angry checkmate my young friend checkmate you said it should be war and war you shall have it i thank thee friend for teaching me that word rivals now you said yes rivals dolus an virtus quis in hoste requirat why that comes out of the passage about androgeos an omen a good omen theres nothing like war for quickening the intelligence i havent looked at a virgil since i was in the sixth form and yet the line comes back to me now after five years as pat as the catechism  chuckling to himself at the fraud to stifle conscience for he had a conscience harold carnegie dressed hastily for dinner and went down quickly in a state of feverish excitement dinner passed off grimly enough he knew ernest had written to isabel and ernest guessed from the others excited triumphant manner though he tried hard to dissemble the note of triumph in it that harold must have written tooperhaps forestalling him by a direct proposal in a dim way mrs carnegie guessed vaguely that some coldness had arisen between her two boys the first time for many years and so she held her peace for the most part or talked in asides to nellie holt and her daughter the conversation was therefore chiefly delegated to mr carnegie himself who discoursed with much animation about the iniquitous nature of the new act for reducing costs in actions for the recovery of small debtsa subject calculated to arouse the keenest interest in the minds of nellie and edie  next morning harold carnegie started for the office with prospective victory elate in his very step and yet with the consciousness of his own mean action grinding him down to the pavement as he walked along it what a dirty petty dishonourable subterfuge and still he would go through with it what a selfdegrading bit of treachery and yet he would carry it out pater he said as he walked along i mean to take a holiday this afternoon im going to the montagus waterparty  very inconvenient harold my boy wilkins versus the great northern railway company coming on for hearing and besides ernests going there too they wont want a pair of you will they  cant help it pater harold answered i have particular business at surbiton much more important to me than wilkins versus the great northern railway company  his father looked at him keenly ha he said a lady in the case is there very well my boy if you must you must and thats the end of it a young man in love never does make an efficient lawyer get it over quickly pray get it over quickly thats all i beg of you  i shall get it over i promise you harold answered this very afternoon  the father whistled whew he said thats sharp work too harold isnt it you havent even told me her name yet this is really very sudden but as harold volunteered no further information mr carnegie who was a shrewd man of the world held it good policy to ask him nothing more about it for the present and so they walked on the rest of the way to the fathers office in unbroken silence  at one oclock harold shut up his desk at the office and ran down to surbiton at clapham junction he kept a sharp lookout for ernest but ernest was not there clearly as harold anticipated he hadnt learnt the alteration in the timetables and wouldnt reach clapham junction till the train for surbiton had started  at surbiton harold pushed on arrangements as quickly as possible and managed to get the party off before ernest arrived upon the scene mrs montagu seeing one of the young carnegies duly to hand and never having attempted to discriminate between them in any way was perfectly happy at the prospect of getting landed at lady portleburys without any minute investigation of the intricate question of christian names the montagus were nouveaux riches in the very act of pushing themselves into fashionable society and a chance of invading the portlebury lawn was extremely welcome to them upon any terms whatsoever  isabel walters was looking charming a light morning dress became her even better than the dark red satin of the night before last and she smiled at harold with the smile of a mutual confidence when she took his hand in a way that made his heart throb fast within him from that moment forward he forgot ernest and the unworthy trick he was playing and thought wholly and solely of isabel walters  what a handsome young man he was really and how cleverly and brilliantly he talked all the way up to portlebury lodge everybody listened to him he was the life and soul of the party isabel felt more flattered than ever at his marked attention he was the doctor wasnt he no the lawyer well really how impossible it was to distinguish and remember them and so well connected too if he were to propose to her now she could afford to be so condescending to amy balfour  at lady portleburys lawn the steamlaunch halted and harold managed to get isabel alone among the walks while his aunt escorted the main body of visitors thus thrust upon her hands over the conservatories eager and hasty now he lost no time in making the best of the situation  i guessed as much of course from your letter mr carnegie isabel said playing with her fan with downcast eyes as he pressed his offer upon her and i really didnt know whether it was right of me to come here without showing it to mamma and asking her advice about it but im quite sure i oughtnt to give you an answer at once because ive seen so very little of you let us leave the question open for a little its asking so much to ask one for a definite reply on such a very short acquaintance  no no miss walters harold said quickly for heavens sake give me an answer now i beg of youi implore you i must have an answer at once immediately if you cant love me at first sight for my own sakeas i loved you the moment i saw youyou can never never never love me doubt and hesitation are impossible in true love now or refuse me for ever surely you must know in your own heart whether you can love me or not if your heart tells you that you can then trust ittrust itdont argue and reason with it but say at once you will make me happy for ever  mr carnegie isabel said lifting her eyes for a moment i do think perhapsi dont knowbut perhaps after a little while i could love you i like you very much wont that do for the present why are you in such a hurry for an answer why cant you give me a week or two to decide in  because said harold desperately if i give you a week my brother will ask you and perhaps you will marry him instead of me hes always before me in everything and im afraid hell be before me in this say youll have me miss waltersoh do say youll have me and save me from the misery of a weeks suspense  but mr carnegie how can i say anything when i havent yet made up my own mind about it why i hardly know you yet from your brother  ah thats just it harold cried in a voice of positive pain you wont find any difference at all between us if you come to know us and then perhaps youll be induced to marry my brother but you know this much already that here am i begging and pleading before you this very minute and surely you wont send me away with my prayer unanswered  there was such a look of genuine anguish and passion in his face that isabel walters already strongly prepossessed in his favour could resist no longer she bent her head a little and whispered very softly i will promise mr carnegie i will promise  harold seized her hand eagerly and covered it with kisses isabel he cried in a fever of joy you have promised you are mineminemine you are mine now and for ever  isabel bowed her head and felt a tear standing dimly in her eye though she brushed it away hastily yes she said gently i will be yours i thinki thinki feel sure i can love you  harold took her ungloved hand tenderly in his and drew a ring off her finger before i give you mine he said you will let me take this one i want it for a keepsake and a memorial  isabel whispered yes  harold drew another ring from his pocket and slipped it softly on her third finger isabel saw by the glitter that there was a diamond in it harold had bought it the day before for that very purpose then he took from a small box a plain gold locket with the letter h raised on it i want you to wear this he said as a keepsake for me  but why h isabel asked him looking a little puzzled your names ernest isnt it  harold smiled as well as he was able how absurd it is he said with an effort at gaiety this ridiculous similarity pursues us everywhere no my names harold  isabel stood for a moment surprised and hesitating she really hardly knew for the second which brother she ought to consider herself engaged to then it wasnt you who wrote to me she said with a tone of some surprise and a little start of astonishment  no i certainly didnt write to you but i came here today expecting to see you and meaning to ask you to be my wife i learned from my brother there can be no falsehood in putting it that way he thought vainly to himself that you were to be here and i determined to seize the opportunity ernest meant to have come too but i believe he must have lost the train at clapham junction that was all literally true and yet it sounded simple and plausible enough  isabel looked at him with a puzzled look and felt almost compelled to laugh the situation was so supremely ridiculous it took a moment to think it all out rationally yet after all though the letter came from the other brother ernest it was this particular brother harold she had been talking to and admiring all the day it was this particular brother harold who had gained her consent and whom she had promised to love and to marry and at that moment it would have been doing isabel walters an injustice not to admit that in her own soul she did then and there really love harold carnegie  harold she said slowly as she took the locket and hung it round her neck harold yes now i know then harold carnegie i shall take your locket and wear it always as a keepsake from you and she looked up at him with a smile in which there was something more than mere passing coquettish fancy you see he was really terribly in earnest and the very fact that he should have been so anxious to anticipate his brother and should have anticipated him successfully made her womans heart go forth toward him instinctively as harold himself said he was there bodily present before her while ernest the writer of the mysterious letter was nothing more to her in reality than a name and a shadow harold had asked her and won her and she was ready to love and cleave to harold from that day forth for that very reason what woman of them all has a better reason to give in the last resort for the faith that is in her   v  meanwhile at clapham junction ernest carnegie had arrived three minutes too late for the surbiton train and had been forced to wait for the 240 of that he thought little they would wait for him he knew if they waited an hour for mrs montagu would not for worlds have missed the chance of showing her guests round lady portleburys gardens so he settled himself down comfortably in the snug corner of his firstclass carriage and ran down by the later train in perfect confidence that he would find the steam launch waiting  no sir theyve gone up the river in the launch sir said the man who opened the door for him and i beg pardon sir but i thought you were one of the party  in a moment ernests fancy quickened by his jealousy jumped instinctively at the true meaning of the mans mistake what he said was there a gentleman very like me in a grey coat and straw hatsame ribbon as this one  yes sir exactly sir well indeed i should have said it was yourself sir but i suppose it was the other mr carnegie  it was ernest answered between his clenched teeth almost inarticulate with anger it was he not a doubt of it harold i see it all the treacherythe base treachery how long have they been gone i say how long eh  about half an hour sir they went up towards henley sir  ernest carnegie turned aside reeling with wrath and indignation that his brother his own familiar twinbrother should have played him this abominable disgraceful trick the meanness of it the deceit of it the petty spying and letteropening of it for somehow or otherinconceivable howharold must have opened his brothers letters and then quick as lightning for those two brains jumped together the thought of the blottingbook flashed across ernests mind why he had noticed this morning that a page was gone out of it he must have read the letters and then the trains harold always got a timetable on the first of each month with his cursed methodical lawyer ways and he had never told him about the change of service the dirty low trick the mean trick even to think of it made ernest carnegie sick at heart and bitterly indignant  in a minute he saw it all and thought it all out why did hehow did he why he knew as clearly as if he could read harolds thoughts exactly how the whole vile plot had first risen upon him and worked itself out within his traitorous brain how ah how that was the bitterest the most horrible the deadliest part of it all ernest carnegie knew because he felt in his own inmost soul that had he been put in the same circumstances he would himself have done exactly as harold had done  yes exactly in every respect harold must have seen the words in the blottingbook my dear miss waltersernest remembered how thickly and blackly he had writtenmust have seen those words and in their present condition either of the twins jealous angry suspicious half driven by envy of one another out of their moral senses would have torn out the page then and there and read it all he too would have kept silence about the train he would have gone down to surbiton he would have proposed to isabel walters he would have done in everything exactly as he knew harold must have done it but that did not make his anger and loathing for his brother any the weaker on the contrary it only made them all the more terrible his consciousness of his own equal potential meanness roused his rage against harold to a white heat he would have done the same himself no doubt yes but harold the mean successful actually accomplishing villainharold had really gone down and done it all in positive fact and reality  flushing scarlet and blanching white alternately with the fierceness of his anger ernest carnegie turned down all on fire to the rivers edge should he take a boat and row up after them to prevent the supplanter at least from proposing to isabel unopposed that would at any rate give him something to domuscular work for his arms if nothing else to counteract the fire within him but on second thoughts no it would be quite useless the steam launch had had a good start of him and no oarsman could catch up with it now by any possibility so he walked about up and down near the river chafing in soul and nursing his wrath against harold for three long weary hours and all that time harold falsehearted fairspoken meanspirited harold was enjoying himself and playing the gallant to isabel walters  minute by minute the hours wore away and with every minute ernests indignation grew deeper and deeper at last he heard the snort of the steamlaunch ploughing its way lustily down the river and he stood on the bank waiting for the guilty harold to disembark  as harold stepped from the launch and gave his hand to isabel he saw the white and bloodless face of his brother looking up at him contemptuously and coldly from beside the landing harold passed ashore and close by him but ernest never spoke a word he only looked a moment at isabel and said to her with enforced calmness you got my letter miss walters  isabel hardly comprehending the real solemnity of the occasion answered with a light smile i did mr carnegie but you didnt keep your appointment your brother came and he has been beforehand with you and she touched his hand lightly and went on to join her hostess  still ernest carnegie said nothing but walked on as black as night beside his brother neither spoke a word but after the shaking of hands and farewells were over both turned together to the railway station the carriage was crowded and so ernest still held his tongue  at last when they reached home and stood in the passage together ernest looked at his brother with a look of withering scorn and livid with anger found his voice at last  harold carnegie he said in a low husky tone you are a mean intercepter of other mens letters a sneaking supplanter of other mens appointments a cur and a traitor whom i dont wish any longer to associate with i know what you have done and i know how you have done it you have kept my engagement with isabel walters by reading the impression of my notes on the blottingbook you are unfit for a gentleman to speak to and i cast you off now and for ever  harold looked at him defiantly but said never a word  harold carnegie ernest said again i could hardly believe your treachery until it was forced upon me this is the last time i shall ever speak to you  harold looked at him again this time perhaps with a tinge of remorse in his expression and said nothing but oh ernest  ernest made a gesture with his hands as though he would repel him dont come near me he said harold carnegie dont touch me dont call me by my name i will have nothing more to say or do with you  harold turned away in dead silence and went to his own room trembling with conscious humiliation and selfreproach but he did not attempt to make the only atonement in his power by giving up isabel walters that would have been too much for human nature   vi  when harold carnegie was finally married to isabel walters ernest stopped away from the wedding and would have nothing whatever to say either to bride or bridegroom he would leave his unnatural brother he said solely and entirely to the punishment of his own guilty conscience  still he couldnt rest quiet in his fathers house after harold was gone so he took himself small rooms near the hospital and there he lived his lonely life entirely by himself a solitary man brooding miserably over his own wrongs and harolds treachery there was only one single woman in the world he said with whom he could ever have been really happyisabel walters and harold had stolen isabel walters away from him by the basest treason once he could have loved isabel and her only now because she was harolds wife he bitterly hated her yes hated her with a deadly hatred he hated both of them  months went by slowly for ernest carnegie in the dull drudgery of his hopeless professional life for he cared nothing now for ambition or advancement he lived wholly in the past nursing his wrath and devouring his own soul in angry regretfulness months went by and at last harolds wife gave birth to a babya boy the exact image of his father and his uncle harold looked at the child in the nurses arms and said remorsefully we will call him ernest it is all we can do now isabel we will call him ernest after my dear lost brother so they called him ernest in the faint hope that his uncles heart might relent a little and harold wrote a letter full of deep and bitter penitence to his brother piteously begging his forgiveness for the grievous wrong he had wickedly and deliberately done him but ernest still nursed his righteous wrath silently in his own bosom and tore up the letter into a thousand fragments unanswered  when the baby was five months old edie carnegie came round hurriedly one morning to ernests lodgings near the hospital ernest ernest she cried running up the stairs in great haste we want you to come round and see harold were afraid hes very ill dont say you wont come and see him  ernest carnegie listened and smiled grimly very ill he muttered with a dreadful gleam in his eyes very ill is he and i have had nothing the matter with me how curious very ill i ought to have had the same illness a fortnight ago ha ha the cycle is broken the clocks have ceased to strike together his marriage has altered the run of his constitutionmine remains the same steady striker as ever i thought it would i thought it would perhaps hell die now the mean miserable traitor  edie carnegie looked at him in undisguised horror oh ernest she cried with the utmost dismay your own brother your own brother surely youll come and see him and tell us whats the matter  yes ill come and see him ernest answered unmoved taking up his hat ill come and see him and find out whats the matter but there was an awful air of malicious triumph in his tone which perfectly horrified his trembling sister  when ernest reached his brothers house he went at once to harolds bedside and without a word of introduction or recognition he began inquiring into the nature of his symptoms exactly as he would have done with any unknown and ordinary patient harold told him them all simply and straightforwardly without any more preface than he would have used with any other doctor when ernest had finished his diagnosis he leaned back carelessly in his easy chair folded his arms sternly and said in a perfectly cold clear remorseless voice ah i thought so yes yes i thought so its a serious functional disorder of the heart and theres very little hope indeed that youll ever recover from it no hope at all i may say no hope at all im certain the thing has been creeping upon you creeping upon you evidently for a year past and it has gone too far now to leave the faintest hope of ultimate recovery  isabel burst into tears at the wordscalmly spoken as though they were perfectly indifferent to both speaker and hearers but harold only rose up fiercely in the bed and cried in a tone of the most imploring agony oh ernest ernest if i must die for heavens sake before i die say you forgive me do say do say you forgive me oh ernest dear ernest dear brother ernest for the sake of our long happy friendship for the sake of the days when we loved one another with a love passing the love of women do do say you will at last forgive me  ernest rose and fumbled nervously for a second with the edge of his hat harold carnegie he said at last in a voice trembling with excitement i can never forgive you you acted a mean dirty part and i can never forgive you heaven may perhaps it will but as for me i can never never never forgive you  harold fell back feebly and wearily upon the pillows ernest ernest he cried gasping you might forgive me you ought to forgive me you must forgive me and ill tell you why i didnt want to say it but now you force me i know it as well as if id seen you do it in my place i know to a certainty ernest youd have done exactly as i did ernest carnegie you cant look me straight in the face and tell me that you wouldnt have acted exactly as i did  that terrible unspoken truth long known but never confessed even to himself struck like a knife on ernests heart he raised his hat blindly and walked with unsteady steps out of the sickroom at that moment his own conscience smote him with awful vividness looking into the inmost recesses of his angry heart he felt with a shudder that harold had spoken the simple truth and he dared not lie by contradicting him in harolds place he would have done exactly as harold did and that was just what made his deathless anger burn all the more fiercely and fervidly against his brother  groping his way down the stairs alone in a stunned and dazzled fashion ernest carnegie went home in his agony to his lonely lodgings and sat there solitary with his own tempestuous thoughts for the next eightandforty hours he did not undress or lie down to sleep though he dozed a little at times uneasily in his big armchair he did not eat or drink much he merely paced up and down his room feverishly and sent his boy round at intervals of an hour or two to know how the doctor thought mr harold carnegie was getting on the boy returned every time with uniformly worse and worse reports ernest rubbed his hands in horrid exultation ah he said to himself eagerly he will die he will die he will pay the penalty of his dirty treachery he has brought it all upon himself by marrying that wicked woman he deserves it every bit for his mean conduct  on the third morning edie came round again this time with her mother both had tears in their eyes and they implored ernest with sobs and entreaties to come round and see harold once more before he died harold was raving and crying for him in his weakness and delirium but ernest was like adamant he would not go to see him he said not if they went down bodily on their knees before him  at midday the boy went again and stayed a little longer than usual when he returned he brought back word that mr harold carnegie had died just as the clock was striking the hour ernest listened with a look of terror and dismay and then broke down into a terrible fit of sobbing and weeping when edie came round a little later to tell him that all was over she found him crying like a child in his own easy chair and muttering to himself in a broken fashion how dearly he and harold had loved one another years ago when they were both happy children together  edie took him round to his brothers house and there over the deaf and blind face that lay cold upon the pillows he cried the cry that he would not cry over his living imploring brother oh harold harold he groaned in his broken agony i forgive you i forgive you i too sinned as you did what you would do i would do it was bound up in both our natures in your place i would have done as you did but now the curse of cain is upon me a worse curse than cains is upon me i have more than killed my brother  for a day or two ernest went back heartbroken to his fathers house and slept once more in the old room where he used to sleep so long next door to harolds at the end of three days he woke once from one of his short snatches of sleep with a strange fluttering feeling in his left side he knew in a moment what it was it was the same disease that harold had died of  thank heaven he said to himself eagerly thank heaven thank heaven for that then i didnt wholly kill him his blood isnt all upon my poor unhappy head after all his marriage didnt quite upset the harmony of the two clocks it only made the slower one catch up for a while and pass the faster im a fortnight later in striking than harold this time thats all in three days more the clock will run down and i shall die as he did  and true to time in three days more as the clock struck twelve ernest carnegie died as his brother harold had done before him with the agonized cry for forgiveness trembling on his fevered lipswho knows whether answered or unanswered     olga davidoffs husband   i  tobolsk though a siberian metropolis is really a very pleasant place to pass a winter in like the western american cities where everybody has made his money easily and spends it easily it positively bubbles over with bad champagne cheap culture advanced thought french romances and all the other most recent products of human industry and ingenuity everybody eats pâté de foie gras quotes hartmann and herbert spencer uses electric bells believes in womans rights possesses profound views about the future of asia and had a grandfather who was a savage samoyede or an ignorant buriat society is extremely cultivated and if you scratch it ever so little you see the tartar nevertheless it considers itself the only really polite and enlightened community on the whole face of this evolving terrestrial planet  the davidoffs however who belonged to the most advanced section of mercantile society in all tobolsk were not originally siberians or even russians by birth or nationality old mr davidoff the grandfather who founded the fortunes of the family in st petersburg was a welsh davids and he had altered his name by the timely addition of a slavonic suffix in order to conciliate the national susceptibilities of orthodox russia his son dimitri whom for the same reason he had christened in honour of a russian saint removed the russian branch of the house to tobolsk they were in the siberian furtrade and there marrying a german lady of the name of freytag had one daughter and heiress olga davidoff the acknowledged belle of tobolskan society it was generally understood in tobolsk that the davidoffs were descended from welsh princes as may very likely have been the casethough one would really like to know what has become of all the descendants of welsh subjects if indeed they were not even remotely connected with the prince of wales himself in person  the winter of 1873 as everybody will remember was a very cold one throughout siberia the rivers froze unusually early and troikas had entirely superseded torosses on all the roads as early as the very beginning of october still tobolsk was exceedingly gay for all that in the warm houses of the great merchants with their tropical plants kept at summer heat by stoves and flues all the year round nobody noticed the exceptional rigour of that severe season balls and dances followed one another in quick succession and olga davidoff just twenty enjoyed herself as she had never before done in all her lifetime it was such a change to come to the concentrated gaities and delights of tobolsk after six years of old miss waterlows establishment for young ladies at the laurels clapham  that winter for the first time baron niaz the buriat came to tobolsk  exquisitely polished in manners and very handsome in face and bearing there was nothing of the tartar anywhere visible about baron niaz he had been brought up in paris at a fashionable lycée and he spoke french with perfect fluency as well as with some native sparkle and genuine cleverness his taste in music was unimpeachable even madame davidoff née freytag candidly admitted that his performances upon the violin were singularly brilliant profound and appreciative moreover though a buriat chief he was a most undoubted nobleman at the governors parties he took rank by patent of the emperor nicholas as a real russian baron of the first water to be sure he was nominally a tartar but what of that his mother and his grandmother he declared had both been russian ladies and you had only to look at him to see that there was scarcely a drop of tartar blood still remaining anywhere in him if the halfcaste negro is a brown mulatto the quartercaste a light quadroon and the next remove a practically white octoroon surely baron niaz in spite of his remote buriat greatgrandfathers might well pass for an ordinary everyday civilized russian  olga davidoff was fairly fascinated by the accomplished young baron she met him everywhere and he paid her always the most marked and flattering attention he was a buriat to be sure but at tobolsk you know well one mustnt be too particular about these little questions of origin in an asiatic city  it was at the governors dance just before christmas that the baron got his first good chance of talking with her for ten minutes alone among the fan palms and yuccas in the big conservatory there was a seat in the far corner beside the flowering oleander where the baron led her after the fourth waltz and leant over her respectfully as she played with her chinese fan half trembling at the declaration she knew he was on the point of making to her  mademoiselle davidoff the baron began in french with a lingering cadence as he pronounced her name and a faint tremor in his voice that thrilled responsively through her inmost being mademoiselle davidoff i have been waiting long for this opportunity of speaking to you alone because i have something of some importanceto me at least mademoiselleabout which i wish to confer with you mademoiselle will you do me the honour to listen to me patiently a minute or two the matter about which i wish to speak to you is one that may concern yourself too more closely than you at first imagine  what a funny way to begin proposing to one olga davidoffs heart beat violently as she answered as unconcernedly as possible i shall be glad m le baron im sure to listen to any communication that you may wish to make to me  mademoiselle the young man went on almost timidlyhow handsome he looked as he stood there bending over her in his semibarbaric tartar uniformmademoiselle the village where i live in our own country is a lonely one among the high mountains you do not know the buriat countryit is wild savage rugged pineclad snowclad solitary inaccessible but very beautiful even the russians do not love it but we love it we others who are to the manner born we breathe there the air of liberty and we prefer our own brawling streams and sheer precipices to all the artificial stifling civilization of paris and st petersburg  olga looked at him and smiled quietly she saw at once how he wished to break it to her and held her peace like a wise maiden  yes mademoiselle the young man went on flooding her each moment with the flashing light from his great luminous eyes my village in the buriat country lies high up beside the eternal snows but though we live alone there so far from civilization that we seldom see even a passing traveller our life is not devoid of its own delights and its own interests i have my own people all around me i live in my village as a little prince among his own subjects my people are few but they are very faithful mademoiselle has been educated in england i believe  yes olga answered in london m le baron i am of english parentage and my father sent me there to keep up the connection with his old fatherland where one branch of our house is still established  then mademoiselle you will doubtless have read the tales of walter scott  olga smiled curiously yes she said amused at his naïveté i have certainly read them she began to think that after all the handsome young buriat couldnt mean really to propose to her  well you know in that case what was the life of a highland chieftain in scotland when the highland chieftains were still practically all but independent that mademoiselle is exactly the life of a modern buriat nobleman under the russian empire he has his own little territory and his own little people he lives among them in his own little antiquated fortress he acknowledges nominally the sovereignty of the most orthodox czar and even perhaps exchanges for a russian title the tartar chieftainship handed down to him in unbroken succession from his earliest forefathers but in all the rest he still remains essentially independent he rules over a little principality of his own and cares not a fig in his own heart for czar or governor or general or minister  this is rather treasonable talk for the governors palace olga put in smiling quietly if we were not already in tobolsk we might both perhaps imagine we should be sent to siberia  the baron laughed and showed his two rows of pearly white teeth to the best advantage they might send me to the mines he said for aught i care mademoiselle i could get away easily enough from village to village to my own country and once there it would be easier for the czar to take constantinople and bagdad and calcutta than to track and dislodge alexander niaz in his mountain fortress  alexander niaz olga noted the name to herself hurriedly he was converted then he was an orthodox christian that at least was a good thing for so many of these buriats are still nothing more than the most degraded schamanists and heathens  but mademoiselle the young man went on again playing more nervously now than ever with the jewelled hilt of his dress sword there is one thing still wanting to my happiness among our beautiful siberian mountains i have no lovely châtelaine to help me guard my little feudal castle mademoiselle the buriat women are not fit allies for a man who has been brought up among the civilization and the learning of the great western cities he needs a companion who can sympathize with his higher tastes who can speak with him of books of life of art of music our buriat women are mere household drudges to marry one of them would be utterly impossible mademoiselle my father and my grandfather came away from their native wilds to seek a lady who would condescend to love them in the polite society of tobolsk i have gone farther afield i have sought in paris berlin vienna st petersburg but i saw no lady to whose heart my heart responded till i came back once more to old tobolsk there mademoiselle there i saw one whom i recognized at once as fashioned for me by heaven mademoiselle davidoffi tremble to ask you buti love youwill you share my exile  olga looked at the handsome young man with unconcealed joy and admiration your exile she murmured softly to gain time for a moment and why your exile m le baron  mademoiselle the young buriat continued very earnestly i do not wish to woo or wed you under false pretences before you give me an answer you must understand to what sort of life it is that i venture to invite you our mountains are very lonely to live there would be indeed an exile to you accustomed to the gaieties and the vortex of london olga smiled quietly to herself as she thought for a second of the little drawingroom at the laurels clapham but if you can consent to live in it with me i will do my best to make it as easy for you as possible you shall have music books papers amusementsbut not societyduring the six months of summer which we must necessarily pass at my mountain village you shall visit tobolsk moscow petersburg londonwhich you willduring the six months of holiday in winter above all you shall have the undying love and devotion of one who has never loved another womanalexander niaz mademoiselle you see the conditions can you accept them can you condescend of your goodness to love meto marry me  olga davidoff lifted her fan with an effort and answered faintly m le baron you are very flattering ii will try my best to deserve your goodness  niaz took her pretty little hand in his with oldfashioned politeness and raised it chivalrously to his trembling lips mademoiselle he said you have made me eternally happy my life shall be passed in trying to prove my gratitude to you for this condescension  i think olga answered shaking from head to foot i think m le baron you had better take me back into the next room to my mother   ii  olga davidoffs wedding was one of the most brilliant social successes of that tobolsk season davidoff père surpassed himself in the costliness of his exotics the magnificence of his presents the reckless abundance of his veuve clicquot madame davidoff successfully caught the governor and the general and the english traveller from india viâ the himalayas the baron looked as gorgeous as he was handsome in his half russian half tartar uniform and his oriental display of pearls and diamonds olga herself was the prettiest and most blushing bride ever seen in tobolsk a simple english girl fresh from the proprieties of the laurels at clapham among all that curious mixed cosmopolitan society of semicivilized siberians catholic poles and orthodox russians  as soon as the wedding was fairly over the bride and bridegroom started off by toross to make their way across the southern plateau to the barons village  it was a long and dreary drive that wedding tour in a jolting carriage over siberian roads resting at wayside postinghouses bad enough while they were still on the main line of the imperial mails but degenerating into true centralasian caravanserais when once they had got off the beaten track into the wild neighbourhood of the barons village nevertheless olga davidoff bore up against the troubles and discomforts of the journey with a brave heart for was not the baron always by her side and who could be kinder or gentler or more thoughtful than her buriat husband yes it was a long and hard journey up among those border mountains of the chinese and tibetan frontier but olga felt at home at last when after three weeks of incessant jolting they arrived at the buriat mountain stronghold under cover of the night and niaz led her straightway to her own pretty little european boudoir which he had prepared for her beforehand at immense expense and trouble in his upland village  the moment they entered olga saw a pretty little room papered and carpeted in english fashion with a small piano over in the corner a lamp burning brightly on the tiny sidetable and a roaring fire of logs blazing and crackling upon the simple stone hearth a book or two lay upon the shelf at the side she glanced casually at their titles as she passed and saw that they were some of tourgénieffs latest novels a papercovered zola fresh from paris a volume each of tennyson browning carlyle and swinburne a demidoff an emile augier a revue des deux mondes and a late number of an english magazine she valued these things at once for their own sakes but still more because she felt instinctively that niaz had taken the trouble to get them there for her beforehand in this remote and uncivilized corner she turned to the piano a light piece by sullivan lay open before her and a number of airs from chopin schubert and mendelssohn were scattered loosely on the top one above the other her heart was too full to utter a word but she went straight up to her husband threw her arms tenderly around his neck and kissed him with the utmost fervour niaz smoothed her wavy fair hair gently with his hand and his eyes sparkled with conscious pleasure as he returned her caress and kissed her forehead  after a while they went into the next room to dinnera small hall somewhat barbaric in type but not illfurnished and olga noticed that the two or three servants were very fierce and savagelooking buriats of the most pronounced tartar type the dinner was a plain one plainly served of rough country hospitality but the appointments were all european and though simple good and sufficient niaz had said so much to her of the discomforts of his mountain stronghold that olga was quite delighted to find things on the whole so comparatively civilized clean and european  a few days sojourn in the fortit was rather that than a castle or a villageshowed olga pretty clearly what sort of life she was henceforth to expect her husbands subjects numbered about a hundred and fifty with as many more women and children they rendered him the most implicit obedience and they evidently looked upon him entirely as a superior being they were trained to a military discipline and regularly drilled every morning by niaz in the queer old semichinese courtyard of the mouldering castle olga was so accustomed to a russian military régime that this circumstance never struck her as being anything extraordinary she regarded it only as part of the barons ancestral habits as a practically independent tartar chieftain  week after week rolled away at the fort and though olga had absolutely no one to whom she could speak except her own husband for the buriats knew no russian save the word of command she didnt find time hang heavily on her hands in the quaint oldfashioned village the walks and rides about were really delightful the scenery was grand and beautiful to the last degree the chineselooking houses and tartar dress were odd and picturesque like a scene in a theatre it was all so absurdly romantic after all olga said to herself with a smile more than once it isnt half bad being married to a tartar chieftain up in the border mountains when you actually come to try it only she confessed in her own heart that she would probably always be very glad when the winter came again and she got back from these mountain solitudes to the congenial gaiety of tobolsk or petersburg  and niazwell niaz loved her distractedly no husband on earth could possibly love a woman better  still olga could never understand why he sometimes had to leave her for three or four days together and why during his absence when she was left all alone at night in the solitary fort with those dreadful buriats they kept watch and ward so carefully all the time and seemed so relieved when niaz came back again but whenever she asked him about it niaz only looked grave and anxious and replied with a wouldbe careless wave of the hand that part of his duty was to guard the frontier and that the czar had not conferred a title and an order upon him for nothing olga felt frightened and disquieted on all such occasions but somehow felt from niazs manner that she must not question him further upon the matter  one day after one of these occasional excursions niaz came back in high spirits and kissed her more tenderly and affectionately than ever after dinner he read to her out of a book of french poems a grand piece of victor hugos and then made her sit down to the piano and play him his favourite air from der freischütz twice over when she had finished he leant back in his chair and murmured quietly in french which they always spoke together and this is in the mountains of tartary one would say a soirée of st petersburg or of paris  olga turned and looked at him softly what is the time dearest niaz she said with a smile shall i be able to play you still that dance of pinsutis  niaz pulled out his watch and answered quickly only ten oclock darling you have plenty of time still  something in the look of the watch he held in his hand struck olga as queer and unfamiliar she glanced at it sideways and noticed hurriedly that niaz was trying to replace it unobserved in his waistcoat pocket i havent seen that watch before she said suddenly let me look at it dear will you  niaz drew it out and handed it to her with affected nonchalance but in the undercurrent of his expression olga caught a glimpse of a hangdog look she had never before observed in it she turned over the watch and looked on the back to her immense surprise it bore the initials f de k engraved upon the cover  these letters dont belong to you niaz she said scanning it curiously  niaz moved uneasily in his chair no he answered not to me olga itsits an old family relican heirloom in fact it belonged to my mothers mother she wasa mademoiselle de kérouac i believe from morbihan in brittany  olgas eyes looked him through and through with a strange newborn suspicion what could it all mean she knew he was telling her a falsehood had the watch belongedto some other lady what was the meaning of his continued absences could hebut no it was a mans watch not a ladys and if sowhy if so then niaz had clearly told her a falsehood in that too and must be trying to conceal something about it  that night for the first time olga davidoff began to distrust her buriat husband  next morning getting up a little early and walking on the parapet of the queer old fortress she saw niaz in the court below jumping and stamping in a furious temper upon something on the ground to her horror she saw that his face was all hideously distorted by anger and that as he raged and stamped the tartar cast in his features never before visible came out quite clearly and distinctly olga looked on and trembled violently but dared not speak to him  a few minutes later niaz came in to breakfast gay as usual with a fresh flower stuck prettily in the buttonhole of his undress coat and a smile playing unconcernedly around the clearcut corners of his handsome thinlipped mouth  niaz his wife said to him anxiously where is the watch you showed me last night  his face never altered for a moment as he replied with the same bland and innocent smile as ever my darling i have broken it all to little pieces i saw it annoyed you in some way when i showed it to you yesterday and this morning i took it out accidentally in the lower courtyard the sight of it put me in a violent temper cursed thing i said you shall never again step in so cruelly between me and my darling there take that and that and that rascal and i stamped it to pieces underfoot in the courtyard  olga turned pale and looked at him horrified he smiled again and took her wee hand tenderly in his little one he said you neednt be afraid its only our quick buriat fashion we lose our tempers sometimes but it is soon over it is nothing a little whirlwindand pouf it passes  but niaz you said it was a family heirloom  well darling and for your sake i ground it to powder voilà tout come no more about it it isnt worth the trouble let us go to breakfast   iii  some days later niaz went on an expedition again on the czars service for the protection of the frontier and took more than half his ablebodied tartars on the journey with him olga had never felt so lonely before surrounded now by doubt and mystery in that awful solitary stronghold the broken watch weighed gloomily upon her frightened spirits  niaz was gone for three days as often happened and on the fourth night after she had retired to her lonely bedroom she felt sure she heard his voice speaking low somewhere in the courtyard  at the sound she sprang from her bed and went to the window yes there down in the far corner of the yard without lights or noise and treading cautiously she saw niaz and his men filing quietly in through the dim gloom and bringing with them a number of boxes  her heart beat fast could it be some kind of smuggling they lay so near the passes into turkestan and china and she knew that the merchant track from yarkand to semipalatinsk crossed the frontier not far from niazs village  huddling on her dress hastily she issued out alone and terrified into the dark courtyard and sought over the whole place in the black night for sight of niaz she could find him nowhere  at last she mounted the staircase to the mouldering rampart generally the tartar guards kept watch there constantly but tonight the whole place seemed somehow utterly deserted she groped her way along till she reached the far corner by a patch of ground which niaz had told her was the tartar burialplace  there she came suddenly upon a great crowd of men below on the plain running about and shouting wildly with links and torches niaz stood in the midst erect and military with his russian uniform gleaming fitfully in the flickering torchlight in front of him six turcoman merchants with their hands bound behind their backs knelt upon the ground and beside him two tartars held by either arm a man in european dress whom olga recognized at once as the english traveller from india by way of the himalayas her heart stood still within her with terror and she hung there mute and unseen upon the rampart above wondering what in heavens name this extraordinary scene was going to end in what could it mean what could niaz be doing in it great god it was too horrible  a tartar came forward quietly from the crowd with a curved sword at a word from niaz he raised the sword aloft in the air one second it glanced bright in the torchlight the next second a turcomans head lay rolling in the dust and a little torrent of blood spurted suddenly from the still kneeling corpse olga opened her mouth to scream at the horrid sight but happily her voice at once forsook her as in a dream and she stood fixed to the spot in a perfect fascination of awe and terror  then the tartar moved on obedient to a word and a nod from niaz and raised his sword again above the second turcoman in a moment the second head too rolled down quietly beside the other without a minutes delay as though it formed part of his everyday business the practised headsman went on quietly to the next in order and did not stop till all six heads lay grim and ghastly scattered about unheeded in the dust together olga shut her eyes sickening but still could not scream for very horror  next niaz turned to the english traveller and said something to him in his politest manner olga couldnt catch the words themselves because of the distance but she saw from his gestures that he was apologizing to the englishman for his rough treatment the englishman in reply drew out and handed to niaz a small canvas bag a purse and a watch niaz took them bowing politely hands off he cried to the tartars in russian and they loosed their prisoner then he made a sign and the englishman knelt in a minute more his head lay rolling in the dust below and niaz with a placid smile upon his handsome face turned to give orders to the surrounding tartars  olga could stand it no more she dared not scream or let herself be seen but she turned round sick at heart and groped her way half paralyzed by fear along the mouldering rampart and then turned in at last to her own bedroom where she flung herself upon the bed in her clothes and lay tearless but terrified the whole night through in blinding misery  she did not need to have it all explained to her niaz was nothing more after all than a savage buriat robber chieftain   iv  what a terribly long hypocrisy and suspense those six weeks of dreary waiting before an answer to her letter could come from tobolsk and the governor could send a detachment of the military to rescue her from this nest of murderous banditti  how olga hated herself for still pretending to keep on terms with niaz how she loathed and detested the man with whom she must yet live as wife for that endless time till the day of her delivery  and niaz couldnt help seeing that her manner was changed towards him though he flattered himself that she had as yet only a bare suspicion and no real knowledge of the horrible truth what a sad thing that she should ever even have suspected it what a pity if he could not keep her here to soothe and lighten his winter solitudefor he loved her yes he really loved her and he needed sympathy and companionship in all the best and highest instincts of his inner nature these buriats what were they a miserable set of brutal savages mere hardworking robbers and murderers good enough for the practical rough work of everyday life such as knocking turcoman merchants on the head but utterly incapable of appreciating or sympathizing with the better tastes of civilized humanity it was a hard calling that of chieftain to these tartar wretches especially for a man of musical culture brought up in paris and he had hoped that olga might have helped him through with it by her friendly companionship not of course that he ever expected to be able to tell her the whole truth women will be women and coming to a rough country they cant understand the necessities laid upon one for rough dealing no he could never have expected her to relish the full details of a borderers profession but he was vexed that she should already begin to suspect its nature on so very short an acquaintance he had told her he was like a highland chieftain of the old times did she suppose that the rob roys and roderick dhus of real life used to treat their lowland captives with rosewater and chivalry after all women have really no idea of how things must be managed in the stern realities of actual existence  so the six weeks passed slowly away and olga waited and watched with smiles on her lips in mute terror  at last one day in broad daylight without a moments warning or a single premonitory symptom olga saw the courtyard suddenly filled with men in russian uniforms and a friend of hers a major of infantry at tobolsk rushing in at the head of his soldiers upon the tartar barrack  in one second as if by magic the courtyard had changed into a roaring battlefield the cossacks were firing at the tartars and the tartars were firing at the cossacks there was a din of guns and a smoke of gunpowder and high above all in the buriat language she heard the voice of niaz frantically encouraging his men to action and shouting to them with wild energy in incomprehensible gutturals  the surprise had been so complete that almost before olga realized the situation the firing began to die away the fort was carried and niaz and his men stood disarmed and sullen with bleeding faces in the midst of a hastily formed square of stout cossacks among the dead and dying strewn upon the ground  handsome as ever but how she hated him  his arm was wounded and the russian surgeon led him aside to bind it up to olgas amazement while the surgeon was actually engaged in binding it niaz turned upon him like a savage dog and bit his arm till the teeth met fiercely in the very middle she shut her eyes and half fainted with disgust and horror  the surgeon shook him off with an oath and two cossacks coming up hastily bound his hands behind his back and tied his legs quite regardless of his wounded condition  meanwhile the russian major had sought out olga madame la baronne he said respectfully i congratulate you upon your safety and your recovered freedom your father is with us he will soon be here your letter reached him safely in spite of its roundabout direction and the governor of tobolsk despatched us at once upon this errand of release baron niaz had long been suspected your letter removed all doubts upon the subject  a minute or two later the cossacks marched their prisoners out of the courtyard two and two into the great hall of the stronghold  i wish to bid farewell to my wife niaz cried to the major in a loud voice i shall be sent to the mines i suppose and i shall never see her again in this world most probably  the major allowed him to come near within speaking distance under guard of two cossacks  madame la baronne he hissed out between his clenched teeth this is your hand it was your hand that you gave me in marriage it was your hand that wrote to betray me believe me madame come what may your hand shall pay the penalty  so much he said passionately indeed but with the offended dignity of a civilized being then the tartar in him broke through the thin veneer of european culture and he lolled his tongue out at her in savage derision with a hideous menacing leer like an untamed barbarian till that moment in spite of the horrible massacre she had seen with her own eyes olga had never suspected what profound depths of vulgar savagery lay unperceived beneath alexander niazs handsome and aristocratic european features  one more word he uttered coarsely a word of foul reproach unfit to be repeated which made olgas cheek turn crimson with wrath and indignation even in that supreme moment of conflicting passions she buried her face between her two hands wildly and burst into a sudden flood of uncontrollable tears  march him away cried the major in a stern voice and they marched him away still mocking with the other prisoners  that was the last olga davidoff then saw of her buriat husband   v  after niaz had been tried and condemned for robbery and murder and sent with the usual russian clemency to the mines of oukboul olga davidoff could not bear any longer to live at tobolsk it was partly terror partly shame partly pride but tobolsk or even st petersburg she felt to be henceforth utterly impossible for her  so she determined to go back to her kinsfolk in that dear old quiet england where there are no nihilists and no tartars and no exiles and where everybody lived so placidly and demurely she looked back now upon the laurels clapham as the ideal home of repose and happiness  it was not at clapham however that madame niaz as she still called herself settled down but in a quiet little kentish village where the london branch of the davids family had retired to spend their russian money  frank davids the son of the house was olgas second cousin and when olga had taken the pretty little rosecovered cottage at the end of the village frank davids found few things more pleasant in life than to drop in of an afternoon and have a chat with his russian kinswoman olga lived there alone with her companion and in spite of the terrible scenes she had so lately gone through she was still a girl very young very attractive and very pretty  what a wonderfully different life the lawntennis with frank and the curate and the davids girls up at the big house from the terror and isolation of the buriat stronghold under the soothing influence of that placid existence olga davidoff began at last almost to outlive the lasting effects of that one great horror stamped as it was into the very fabric of her being she felt it now less poignantly than of old and sometimes for an hour or two she even ventured to be careless and happy  yet all the time the awful spectre of that robber and murderer niaz who was nevertheless still her wedded husband rose up before her day and night to prevent her happiness from being ever more than momentary  and frank too was such a nice good fellow frank had heard from madame davidoff all her story for madame had come over to see olga fairly settled and he pitied her for her sad romance in such a kind brotherly fashion  once and once only frank said a word to her that was not exactly brotherly they were walking together down the footpath by the mill and olga had been talking to him about that great terror when frank asked her in a quiet voice olga why dont you try to get a divorce from that horrible niaz  olga looked at him in blank astonishment and asked in return why frank what would be the use of that it would never blot out the memory of the past or make that wretch any the less my wedded husband  but olga you need a protector sorely you need somebody to soothe and remove your lasting terror and i think i know some one olgai know some one who would give his whole life to save you dearest from a single days fear or unhappiness  olga looked up at him like a startled child frank she cried dear dear frank you good cousin never say again another word like that or you will make me afraid to walk with you or talk with you any longer you are the one friend i have whom i can trust and confide in dont drive me away by talking to me of what is so impossible i hate the man i loathe and abhor him with all my heart but i can never forget that he is still my husband i have made my choice and i must abide by it frank frank promise mepromise me that you will never again speak upon the subject  franks face grew saddened in a moment with a terrible sadness but he said in a firm voice i promise and he never broke his word from that day onward   vi  three years passed away quietly in the kentish village and every day olgas unreasoning terror of niaz grew gradually fainter and fainter if she had known that niaz had escaped from the mines after eight months imprisonment and made his way by means of his tartar friends across the passes to tibet and calcutta she would not have allowed the sense of security to grow so strong upon her  meanwhile frank often in london had picked up the acquaintance of a certain m de vouillemont a french gentleman much about at the clubs of whose delightful manners and wide acquaintance with the world and men he was never tired of talking to olga a most charming man indeed de vouillemont and very anxious to come down here and see hazelhurst besides olga he has been even in russia and he knows how to talk admirably about everybody and everything ive asked him down for friday evening now do like a good girl break your rule for once and come and dine with us although theres to be a stranger its only one you know and the girls would be so delighted if youd help entertain him for he speaks hardly any english and their french poor things is horribly insular and boardingschooly  at last with much reluctance olga consented and on the friday she went up to the big house at eight punctually  mrs davids and the girls were not yet in the drawingroom when she arrived but m de vouillemont had dressed early and was standing with his back to the room looking intently at some pictures on the wall as olga entered  as she came in and the servant shut the door behind her the stranger turned slowly in a moment she recognized him his complexion was disguised so as to make him look darker than before his black moustache was shaved off his hair was differently cut and dressed but still as he looked her in the face she knew him at once it was alexander niaz  petrified with fear she could neither fly nor scream she stood still in the middle of the drawingroom and stared at him fixedly in an agony of terror  niaz had evidently tracked her down and come prepared for his horrid revenge without a moments delay his face underwent a hideous change and from the cultivated european gentleman in evening clothes that he looked when she entered he was transformed as if by magic into a grinning gibbering tartar savage with his tongue lolling out once more as of old in siberia in hateful derision of her speechless terror  seizing her roughly by the arm he dragged her after him not so much unresisting as rigid with horror to the open fireplace a marble fender ran around the tiled hearth laying her down upon the rug as if she were dead he placed her small right hand with savage glee upon that readymade block and then proceeded deliberately to take out a small steel hatchet from inside his evening coat olga was too terrified even to withdraw her hand he raised the axe on highit flashed a second in the aira smart throb of paina dreadful crunching of bone and sinewand olgas hand fell white and lifeless upon the tiled hearthplace without stopping to look at her for a second he took it up brutally in his own and flung it with a horrible oath into the blazing fire  at that moment the door opened and frank entered  olga lying faint and bleeding on the hearth rug was just able to look up at him imploringly and utter in a sharp cry of alarm the one word niaz  frank sprang upon him like an angry lion  i told her her hand should pay the penalty the tartar cried with a horrible joy bursting wildly from his livid features and now it burns in the fire over yonder as she herself shall burn next minute for ever and ever in fire and brimstone  as he spoke he drew a pistol from his pocket and pointed it at her with his finger on the trigger  next moment before he could fire frank had seized his hand flung the pistol to the farther end of the drawingroom and forced the tartar down upon the floor in a terrible lifeanddeath struggle  niazs face already livid grew purpler and purpler as they wrestled with one another on the carpet in that deadly effort his wrath and vindictiveness gave a mad energy to his limbs and muscles should he be baulked of his fair revenge at last should the woman who had betrayed him escape scotfree with just the loss of a hand and he himself merely exchange a siberian for an english prison no no never by st nicholas never ha madame i will murder you both the pistol the pistol a thousand devils let me go i will kill you yet i will kill you i will kill you then he gasped and grew blacker and purplerblacker and purplerblackerblackerblackerever blacker presently he gasped again franks hand was now upon his mumbling throat they rolled over and over in their frantic struggles then a long slow inspiration after that his muscles relaxed frank loosed him a little but knelt upon his breast heavily still lest he should rise again in another paroxysm but no he lay quite motionlessquite motionless and never stirred a single finger  frank felt his heartno movement his pulsequite quiet his lipsnot a breath perceptible then he rose faint and staggoring and rang for the servants  when the doctor came hurriedly from the village to bandage up the russian ladys arm he immediately pronounced that m de vouillemont was deadstone deadnot a doubt about it probably apoplexy under stress of violent emotion  the inquest was a good deal hushed up owing to the exceedingly painful circumstances of the case and to this day very few people about torquay where she now lives know how mrs frank davids the quiet lady who dresses herself always in black and has such a beautiful softened halffrightened expression came to lose her right hand but everybody knows that mr davids is tenderness itself to her and that she loves him in return with the most absolute and childlike devotion  it was worth cutting off her right hand after all to be rid of that awful spectre of niaz and to have gained the peaceful love of frank davids     john canns treasure   cecil mitford sat at a desk in the record office with a stained and tattered sheet of dark dirtybrown antique paper spread before him in triumph and with an eager air of anxious inquiry speaking forth from every line in his white face and every convulsive twitch at the irrepressible corners of his firm pallid mouth yes there was no doubt at all about it the piece of torn and greasy paper which he had at last discovered was nothing more or less than john canns missing letter for two years cecil mitford had given up all his spare time day and night to the search for that lost fragment of crabbed seventeenthcentury handwriting and now at length after so many disappointments and so much fruitless anxious hunting the clue to the secret of john canns treasure was lying there positively before him the young mans hand trembled violently as he held the paper fast unopened in his feverish grasp and read upon its back the autograph endorsement of charles the seconds secretary of stateletter in cypher from io cann the noted buccaneer to his brother willm intercepted at port royal by his maties command and despatched by general ed doyley his maties captaingenl and governorinchief of the island of jamaica to me h nicholas that was it beyond the shadow of a doubt and though cecil mitford had still to apply to the cypher john canns own written key and to find out the precise import of the directions it contained he felt at that moment that the secret was now at last virtually discovered and that john canns untold thousands of buried wealth were potentially his very own already  he was only a clerk in the colonial office was cecil mitford on a beggarly income of a hundred and eighty a yearhow small it seemed now when john canns money was actually floating before his minds eye but he had brains and industry and enterprise after a fitful adventurous fashion of his own and he had made up his mind years before that he would find out the secret of john canns buried treasure if he had to spend half a lifetime on the almost hopeless quest as a boy cecil mitford had been brought up at his fathers rectory on the slopes of dartmoor and there he had played from his babyhood upward among the rugged granite boulders of john canns rocks and had heard from the farm labourers and the other children around the romantic but perfectly historical legend of john canns treasure unknown and incredible sums in mexican doubloons and spanish dollars lay guarded by a strong oaken chest in a cavern on the hilltop long since filled up with flints and mould from the neighbouring summits to that secure hidingplace the great buccaneer had committed the hoard gathered in his numberless piratical expeditions burying all together under the shadow of a petty porphyritic tor that overhangs the green valley of bovey tracy beside the bare rocks that mark the site a perfectly distinct pathway is worn by footsteps into the granite platform underfoot and that path little cecil mitford had heard with childish awe and wonder was cut out by the pacing up and down of old john cann himself mounting guard in the darkness and solitude over the countless treasure that he had hidden away in the recesses of the pixies hole beneath  as young mitford grew up to mans estate this story of john canns treasure haunted his quick imagination for many years with wonderful vividness when he first came up to london after his fathers death and took his paltry clerkship in the colonial officehow he hated the place with its monotonous drudgery while john canns wealth was only waiting for him to take it and floating visibly before his prophetic eyesthe story began for a while to fade out under the disillusioning realities of respectable poverty and a petty government post but before he had been many months in the west india department he had a small room on the third floor overlooking downing street a casual discovery made in overhauling the archives of the office suddenly revived the boyish dream with all the added realism and cool intensity of maturer years he came across a letter from john cann himself to the protector oliver detailing the particulars of a fierce irregular engagement with a spanish privateer in which the spaniard had been captured with much booty and his vessel duly sold to the highest bidder in port royal harbour this curious coincidence gave a great shock of surprise to young mitford john cann then was no mythical prehistoric hero no fairyking or pixy or barrowhaunter of the popular fancy but an actual genuine historical figure who corresponded about his daring exploits with no less a personage than oliver himself from that moment forth cecil mitford gave himself up almost entirely to tracing out the forgotten history of the old buccaneer he allowed no peace to the learned person who took care of the state papers of the commonwealth at the record office and he established private relations by letter with two or three clerks in the colonial secretarys office at kingston jamaica whom he induced to help him in reconstructing the lost story of john canns life  bit by bit cecil mitford had slowly pieced together a wonderful mass of information buried under piles of ragged manuscript and weary reams of dusty documents about the days and doings of that ancient terror of the spanish main john cann was a devonshire lad of the rollicking roving seventeenth century born and bred at bovey tracy on the flanks of dartmoor the last survivor of those seadogs of devon who had sallied forth to conquer and explore a new continent under the guidance of drake and raleigh and frobisher and hawkins as a boy he had sailed with his father in a ship that bore the queens letters of marque and reprisal against the spanish galleons in his middle life he had lived a strange roaming existencehalf pirate and half privateer intent upon securing the protestant religion and punishing the kings enemies by robbing wealthy spanish skippers and cutting off the recusant noses of vile papistical cuban slave traders in his latter days the fierce halfsavage old mariner had relapsed into sheer robbery and had been hunted down as a public enemy by the lord protectors servants or later still by the captainsgeneral and governorsinchief of his most sacred majestys dominions in the west indies for what was legitimate warfare in the spacious days of great elizabeth had come to be regarded in the degenerate reign of charles ii as rank piracy  one other thing cecil mitford had discovered with absolute certainty and that was that in the summer of 1660 the year of his maties most happy restoration as john cann himself phrased it the persecuted and much misunderstood old buccaneer had paid a secret visit to england and had brought with him the whole hoard which he had accumulated during sixty years of lawful or unlawful piracy in the west indies and the spanish main concerning this hoard which he had concealed somewhere in devonshire he kept up a brisk vernacular correspondence in cypher with his brother william at tavistock and the key to that cypher marked outside a clew to my bro johns secret writing cecil mitford had been fortunate enough to unearth among the undigested masses of the record office but one letter the last and most important of the whole series containing as he believed the actual statement of the hidingplace had long evaded all his research and that was the letter which now at last after months and months of patient inquiry lay unfolded before his dazzled eyes on the little desk in his accustomed corner it had somehow been folded up by mistake in the papers relating to the charge against cyriack skinner of complicity in the rye house plot how it got there nobody knows and probably nobody but cecil mitford himself could ever have succeeded in solving the mystery  as he gazed trembling at the precious piece of dusty muchcreased paper scribbled over in the unlettered schoolboy hand of the wild old seadog cecil mitford could hardly restrain himself for a moment from uttering a cry untold wealth swam before his eyes he could marry ethel now and let her drive in her own carriage ah what he would give if he might only shout in his triumph he couldnt even read the words he was so excited but after a minute or two he recovered his composure sufficiently to begin deciphering the crabbed writing which constant practice and familiarity with the system enabled him to do immediately without even referring to the key and this was what with a few minutes inspection cecil mitford slowly spelled out of the dirty manuscript    from jamaica this 23rd day of jany   in the yeare of our lord 1663       my deare broi did not think to have written you againe after      the scurvie trick you have played me in disclosing my affairs to      that meddlesome knight that calls himself the kings secretary but      in truth your last letter hath so moved me by your vileness that i      must needs reply thereto with all expedicion these are to assure      you then that let you pray how you may or gloze over your base      treatment with fine cozening words and fair promises you shall      have neither lot nor scot in my threasure which is indeed as you      surmise hidden away in england but the secret whereof i shall      impart neither to you nor to no man i have give commands      therefore that the paper whereunto i have committed the place of      its hiding shall be buried with my own body when god please in      the graveyarde at port royal in this island so that you shall      never be bettered one penny by your most damnable treachery and      doublefacedness for i know you my deare bro in very truth for      a prating coxcomb a scurvie cowardlie knave and a lying thief of      other mens reputations therefore no more herewith from your very      humble servt and loving bro    iohn cann captn  cecil mitford laid the paper down as he finished reading it with a face even whiter and paler than before and with the muscles of his mouth trembling violently with suppressed emotion at the exact second when he felt sure he had discovered the momentous secret it had slipped mysteriously through his very fingers and seemed now to float away into the remote distance almost as far from his eager grasp as ever even there in the musty record office before all the clerks and scholars who were sitting about working carelessly at their desks at mere dilettante historical problemsthe stupid prigs how he hated themhe could hardly restrain the expression of his pentup feelings at that bitter disappointment in the very hour of his fancied triumph jamaica how absolutely distant and unapproachable it sounded how hopeless the attempt to follow up the clue how utterly his daydream had been dashed to the ground in those three minutes of silent deciphering he felt as if the solid earth was reeling beneath him and he would have given the whole world if he could have put his face between his two hands on the desk and cried like a woman before the whole record office  for half an hour by the clock he sat there dazed and motionless gazing in a blank disappointed fashion at the sheet of coffeecoloured paper in front of him it was late and workers were dropping away one after another from the scantily peopled desks but cecil mitford took no notice of them he merely sat with his arms folded and gazed abstractedly at that disappointing disheartening irretrievable piece of crabbed writing at last an assistant came up and gently touched his arm were going to close now sir he said in his unfeeling official tonejust as if it were a mere bit of historical inquiry he was afterand i shall be obliged if youll put back the manuscripts youve been consulting into f 27 cecil mitford rose mechanically and sorted out the cyriack skinner papers into their proper places then he laid them quietly on the shelf and walked out into the streets of london for the moment a brokenhearted man  but as he walked home alone that clear warm summer evening and felt the cool breeze blowing against his forehead he began to reflect to himself that after all all was not lost that in fact things really stood better with him now than they had stood that very morning before he lighted upon john canns last letter he had not discovered the actual hidingplace of the hoard to be sure but he now knew on john canns own indisputable authority first that there really was a hidden treasure second that the hidingplace was really in england and third that full particulars as to the spot where it was buried might be found in john canns own coffin at port royal jamaica it was a risky and difficult thing to open a coffin no doubt but it was not impossible no not impossible on the whole putting one thing with another in spite of his terrible galling disappointment he was really nearer to the recovery of the treasure now than he had ever been in his life before till today the final clue was missing today it had been found it was a difficult and dangerous clue to follow but still it had been found  and yet setting aside the question of desecrating a grave how all but impossible it was for him to get to jamaica his small funds had long ago been exhausted in prosecuting the research and he had nothing on earth to live upon now but his wretched salary even if he could get three or six months leave from the colonial office which was highly improbable how could he ever raise the necessary money for his passage out and home as well as for the delicate and doubtful operation of searching for documents in john canns coffin it was tantalising it was horrible it was unendurable but here with the secret actually luring him on to discover it he was to be foiled and baffled at the last moment by a mere paltry petty foolish consideration of two hundred pounds two hundred pounds how utterly ludicrous why john canns treasure would make him a man of fabulous wealth for a whole lifetime and he was to be prevented from realizing it by a wretched matter of two hundred pounds he would do anything to get itfor a loan a mere loan to be repaid with cent per cent interest but where in the world where in the world was he ever to get it from  and then quick as lightning the true solution of the whole difficulty flashed at once across his excited brain he could borrow all the money if he chose from ethel poor little ethel she hadnt much of her own but she had just enough to live very quietly upon with her aunt emily and thank heaven it wasnt tied up with any of those bothering meddling threepercentloving trustees she had her little all at her own disposal and he could surely get two or three hundred pounds from her to secure for them both the boundless buried wealth of john canns treasure  should he make her a confidante outright and tell her what it was that he wanted the money for no that would be impossible for though she had heard all about john cann over and over again she had not faith enough in the treasurewomen are so unpracticalto hazard her little scrap of money on it of that he felt certain she would go and ask old mr cartwrights opinion and old mr cartwright was one of those pennywise purblind unimaginative old gentlemen who will never believe in anything until theyve seen it yet here was john canns money going abegging so to speak and only waiting for him and ethel to come and enjoy it cecil had no patience with those stupid stickinthemud timid people who can see no further than their own noses for ethels own sake he would borrow two or three hundred pounds from her one way or another and she would easily forgive him the harmless little deception when he paid her back a hundredfold out of john canns boundless treasure   ii  that very evening without a minutes delay cecil determined to go round and have a talk with ethel sunderland strike while the irons hot he said to himself there isnt a minute to be lost for who knows but somebody else may find john canns treasure before i do  ethel opened the door to him herself theirs was an old engagement of long standing after the usual government clerks fashion and aunt emily didnt stand out so stiffly as many old maids do for the regular proprieties very pretty ethel looked with her pale face and the red ribbon in her hair very pretty but cecil feared as he looked into her dark hazel eyes a little wearied and wornout for it was her musiclesson day as he well remembered her musiclesson day ethel sutherland to give musiclessons to some wretched squealing children at the westend when all john canns wealth was lying there uncounted only waiting for him and her to take it and enjoy it the bare thought was a perfect purgatory to him he must get that two hundred pounds tonight or give up the enterprise altogether  well ethel darling he said tenderly taking her pretty little hand in his you look tired dearest those horrid children have been bothering you again how i wish we were married and you were well out of it  ethel smiled a quiet smile of resignation they are rather trying cecil she said gently especially on days when one has got a headache but after all im very glad to have the work to do it helps such a lot to eke out our little income we have so very little you know even for two lonely women to live upon in simple little lodgings like these that im thankful i can do something to help dear aunt emily whos really goodness itself you see after all i get very well paid indeed for the lessons  ethel cecil mitford said suddenly thinking it better to dash at once into the midst of business ive come round this evening to talk with you about a means by which you can add a great deal with perfect safety to your little income not by lessons ethel darling not by lessons i cant bear to see you working away the pretty tips off those dear little fingers of yours with strumming scales on the piano for a lot of stupid gawky schoolgirls its by a much simpler way than that i know of a perfectly safe investment for that three hundred that youve got in new zealand four per cents can you not have heard that new zealand securities are in a very shaky way just at present  very shaky cecil ethel answered in surprise why mr cartwright told me only a week ago they were as safe as the bank of england  mr cartwrights an ignorant old martinet cecil replied vigorously he thinks because the stocks inscribed and the dividends are payable in threadneedle street that the colony of new zealands perfectly solvent now im in the colonial office and i know a great deal better than that new zealand has overborrowed i assure you quite overborrowed and a serious fall is certain to come sooner or later mark my words ethel darling if you dont sell out those new zealand fours youll find your three hundred has sunk to a hundred and fifty in rather less than half no time  ethel hesitated and looked at him in astonishment thats very queer she said for mr cartwright wants me to sell out my little bit of midland and put it all into the same new zealands he says theyre so safe and pay so well  mr cartwright indeed cecil cried contemptuously what means on earth has he of knowing didnt he advise you to buy nothing but three per cents and then let you get some portuguese threes at fifty which are really sixes and exceedingly doubtful securities whats the use of trusting a man like that i should like to know no ethel if youll be guided by meand i have special opportunities of knowing about these things at the colonial officeyoull sell out your new zealands and put them into a much better investment that i can tell you about and if i were you id say nothing about it to mr cartwright  but cecil i never did anything in business before without consulting him i should be afraid of going quite wrong  cecil took her hand in his with real tenderness though he was trying to deceive herfor her own goodhe loved her dearly in his heart of hearts and hated himself for the deception he was remorsefully practising upon her yet for her sake he would go through with it you must get accustomed to trusting me instead of him darling he said softly when you are mine for ever as i hope you will be soon you will take my advice of course in all such matters wont you and you may as well begin by taking it now i have great hopes ethel that before very long my circumstances will be so much improved that i shall be able to marry youi hardly know how quickly perhaps even before next christmas but meanwhile darling i have something to break to you that i dare say will grieve you a little for the moment though its for your ultimate good birdiefor your ultimate good the colonial office people have selected me to go to jamaica on some confidential government business which may keep me there for three months or so its a dreadful thing to be away from you so long ethel but if i manage the business successfullyand i shall i knowi shall get promoted when i come back well promoted perhaps to the chief clerkship in the department and then we could marry comfortably almost at once  to jamaica oh cecil how awfully far and suppose you were to get yellow fever or something  but i wont ethel i promise you i wont and ill guarantee it with a kiss birdie so now thats settled and then consider the promotion only three months probably and when i come back we can be actually married its a wonderful stroke of luck and i only heard of it this morning i couldnt rest till i came and told you  ethel wiped a tear away silently and only answered if youre glad cecil dearest im glad too  well now ethel cecil mitford went on as gaily as he could that brings me up to the second point i want you to sell out these wretched new zealands so as to take the money with me to invest on good mortgages in jamaica my experience in west indian mattersafter three years in the departmentwill enable me to lay it out for you at nine per centnine per cent observe ethelon absolute security of landed property planters want money to improve their estates and cant get it at less than that rate your three hundred would bring you in twentyseven pounds ethel twentyseven pounds is a lot of money  what could poor ethel do in his plausible affectionate mannerand all for her own good toocecil talked her over quickly between love and business experience coaxing kisses and nine per cent interest endearing names and knowledge of west indian affairs till helpless little ethel willingly promised to give up her poor little three hundred and even arranged to meet cecil secretly on thursday at the bank of england about colonial office dinnerhour to effect the transfer on her own account without saying a single word about it to aunt emily or mr cartwright cecils consciencefor he had a conscience though he did his best to stifle itgave him a bitter twinge every now and then as one question after another drove him time after time into a fresh bit of deceit but he tried to smile and smile and be a villain as unconcernedly and lightly as possible once only towards the end of the evening when everything was settled and cecil had talked about his passage and the important business with which he was entrusted at full length a gleam of suspicion seemed to flash for a single second across poor ethels deluded little brains jamaicapromotionthree hundred poundsit was all so sudden and so connected could cecil himself be trying to deceive her and using her money for his wild treasure hunt the doubt was horrible degrading unworthy of her or him and yet somehow for a single moment she could not help halfunconsciously entertaining it  cecil she said hesitating and looking into the very depths of his truthful blue eyes youre not concealing anything from me are you its not some journey connected with john cann  cecil coughed and cleared his throat uneasily but by a great effort he kept his truthful blue eyes still fixed steadily on hers he would have given the world if he might have turned them away but that would have been to throw up the game incontinently my darling ethel he said evasively how on earth could the colonial office have anything to do with john cann  answer me yes or no cecil do please answer me yes or no  cecil kept his eyes still fixed immovably on hers and without a moments hesitation answered quickly no it was an awful wrench and his lips could hardly frame the horrid falsehood but for ethels sake he answered no  then i know i can trust you cecil she said laying her head for forgiveness on his shoulder oh how wrong it was of me to doubt you for a second  cecil sighed uneasily and kissed her white forehead without a single word  after all he thought to himself as he walked back to his lonely lodgings late that evening i need never tell her anything about it i can pretend when ive actually got john canns treasure that i came across the clue accidently while i was in jamaica and i can lay out three hundred of it there in mortgages and she need never know a single word about my innocent little deception but indeed in the pride and delight of so much money all our own shell probably never think at all of her poor little paltry three hundred   iii  it was an awfully long time that eighteen days at sea on the royal mail steamship don bound for kingston jamaica with john canns secret for ever on ones mind and nothing to do all day by way of outlet for ones burning energy but to look hour after hour at the monotonous face of the seething water but at last the journey was over and before cecil mitford had been twentyfour hours at date tree hall the chief hotel in kingston he had already hired a boat and sailed across the baking hot harbour to port royal to look in the dreary sandy cemetery for any sign or token of john canns grave  an old greyhaired negro digging at a fresh grave had charge of the cemetery and to him cecil mitford at once addressed himself to find out whether any tombstone about the place bore the name of john cann the old man turned the name over carefully in his stolid brains and then shook his heavy grey head with a decided negative massa john cann sah he said dubiously massa john cann it dont nobody buried here by de name ob massa john cann i sartin sah becase is sexton in dis here cemetry dese fifty year an i know de grabe ob ebbery buckra gentleman dat ebber buried here since i fuss came  cecil mitford tossed his head angrily since you first came my good man he said with deep contempt since you first came why john cann was buried here ages and ages before you yourself were ever born or thought of  the old negro looked up at him inquiringly there is nothing a negro hates like contempt and he answered back with a disdainful tone den i can find out if him ebber was buried here at all as well as you sah we has register here we dont ignorant heathen i has register in de church ob every pusson dat ebber buried in dis cemetry from de berry beginninfrom de year ob de great earthquake itself what year dis massa john cann him die now what year him die  cecil pricked up his ears at the mention of the register and answered eagerly in the year 1669  the old negro sat down quietly on a flat tomb and answered with a smile of malicious triumph den you is ignorant knownuffin pusson for a buckra gentleman for true sah if you tink you will find him grabe in dis here cemetry dont you nebber read your history book dat all port royal drowned in de great earthquake ob de year 1692 we has register here for ebbery year from de year 1692 downward but de grabes and de cemetry and de register from de year 1692 upward him all swallowed up entirely in de great earthquake bress de lord  cecil mitford felt the earth shivering beneath him at that moment as verily as the port royal folk had felt it shiver in 1692 he clutched at the headstone to keep him from falling and sat down hazily on the flat tomb beside the greyheaded old negro like one unmanned and utterly disheartened it was all only too true with his intimate knowledge of john canns life and of west indian affairs generally how on earth could he ever have overlooked it john canns grave lay buried five fathoms deep no doubt under the blue waters of the caribbean and it was for this that he had madly thrown up his colonial office appointment for this that he had wasted ethels money for this that he had burdened his conscience with a world of lies all to find in the end that john canns secret was hidden under five fathoms of tropical lagoon among the scattered and waterlogged ruins of old port royal his fortitude forsook him for a single moment and burying his face in his two hands there under the sweltering midday heat of that deadly sandbank he broke down utterly and sobbed like a child before the very eyes of the now softened old negro sexton   iv  it was not for long however cecil mitford had at least one strong qualityindomitable energy and perseverance all was not yet lost if need were he would hunt for john canns tomb in the very submerged ruins of old port royal he looked up once more at the puzzled negro and tried to bear this bitter downfall of all his hopes with manful resignation  at that very moment a tall and commandinglooking man of about sixty with white hair but erect figure walked slowly from the cocoanut grove on the sandspit into the dense and tangled precincts of the cemetery he was a brown man a mulatto apparently but his look and bearing showed him at once to be a person of education and distinction in his own fashion the old sexton rose up respectfully as the stranger approached and said to him in a very different tone from that in which he had addressed cecil mitford marnin sah marnin mr barclay dis here buckra gentleman from englan him come quiring in de cemetry after de grabe of pusson dat dead before de great earthquake what for him come here likeadat on fools errand eh sah what for him not larn before him come dat port royal all gone drowned in de year 1692  the newcomer raised his hat slightly to cecil mitford and spoke at once in the grave gentle voice of an educated and cultivated mulatto you wanted some antiquarian information about the island sir some facts about some one who died before the port royal earthquake you have luckily stumbled across the right man to help you for i think if anything can be recovered about anybody in jamaica i can aid you in recovering it whose grave did you want to see  cecil hardly waited to thank the polite stranger but blurted out at once the grave of john cann who died in 1669  the stranger smiled quietly what john cann the famous buccaneer he said with evident delight are you interested in john cann  i am cecil answered hastily do you know anything about him  i know all about him the tall mulatto replied all about him in every way he was not buried at port royal at all he intended to be and gave orders to that effect but his servants had him buried quietly elsewhere on account of some dispute with the governor of the time being about some paper which he desired to have placed in his coffin  where where cecil mitford gasped out eagerly clutching at this fresh straw with all the anxiety of a drowning man  at spanish town the stranger answered calmly i know his grave there well to the present day if you are interested in jamaican antiquities and would like to come over and see it i shall be happy to show you the tomb that is my name and he handed cecil mitford his card with all the courteous dignity of a born gentleman  cecil took the card and read the name on it the hon charles barclay leigh caymanas spanish town how his heart bounded again that minute proof was accumulating on proof and luck on luck after all he had tracked down john canns grave and the paper was really there buried in his coffin he took the handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his damp brow with a feeling of unspeakable relief ethel was saved and they might still enjoy john canns treasure  mr barclay sat down beside him on the stone slab and began talking over all he knew about john canns life and actions cecil affected to be interested in all he said though really he could think of one thing only the treasure the treasure the treasure but he managed also to let mr barclay see how much he too knew about the old buccaneer and mr barclay who was a simpleminded learned enthusiast for all that concerned the antiquities of his native island was so won over by this display of local knowledge on the part of a stranger and an englishman that he ended by inviting cecil over to his house at spanish town to stop as long as he was able cecil gladly accepted the invitation and that very afternoon with a beating heart he took his place in the lumbering train that carried him over to the final goal of his jamaican expedition   v  in a corner of the cathedral graveyard at spanish town overhung by a big spreading mango tree and thickly covered by prickly scrub of agave and cactus the whitehaired old mulatto gentleman led cecil mitford up to a waterworn and weathered stone on which a few crumbling letters alone were still visible cecil kneeled down on the bare ground regardless of the sharp cactus spines that stung and tore his flesh and began clearing the moss and lichen away from the neglected monument yes his host was right right right right indubitably the first two letters were io then a blank where others were obliterated and then came ann that stood clearly for iohn cann and below he could slowly make out the words born at  vey tra  devon with an illegible date died at p  royal may 12 1669 oh great heavens yes john canns grave john canns grave john canns grave beyond any shadow or suspicion of mistake john cann and his precious secret lay buried below that mouldering tombstone  that very evening cecil mitford sought out and found the spanish town gravedigger he was a solemnlooking middleaged black man with a keen smart face not the wrong sort of man cecil mitford felt sure for such a job as the one he contemplated cecil didnt beat about the bush or temporise with him in any way he went straight to the point and asked the man outright whether he would undertake to open john canns grave and find a paper that was hidden in the coffin the gravedigger stared at him and answered slowly i dont like de job sah i dont like de job perhaps massa john canns ghost him come and trouble me for dat i dont going to do it what you gib me sah how much you gib me  cecil opened his purse and took out of it ten gold sovereigns i will give you that he said if you can get me the paper out of john canns coffin  the negros eyes glistened but he answered carelessly i dont tink i can do it i dont want to open grabe by night and if i open him by day de magistrates dem will hab me up for desecration ob interment but i can do dis for you sah if you like to wait till some buckra gentleman diejohn cann grabe among de white man side in de grabeyardi will dig grabe alongside ob john cann one day so let you come yourself in de night and take what you like out ob him coffin i dont go meddle with coffin myself to make de john cann duppy trouble me and magistrate send me off about me business  it was a risky thing to do certainly but cecil mitford closed with it and promised the man ten pounds if ever he could recover john canns paper and then he settled down quietly at leigh caymanas with his friendly host waiting with eager anxious expectationtill some white person should die at spanish town  what an endless aimless time it seemed to wait before anybody could be comfortably buried black people died by the score of course there was a smallpox epidemic on and they went to wakes over one anothers dead bodies in wretched hovels among the back alleys and caught the infection and sickened and died as fast as the wildest imagination could wish them but then they were buried apart by themselves in the pauper part of the cathedral cemetery still no white man caught the smallpox and few mulattoes they had all been vaccinated and nobody got ill except the poorest negroes cecil mitford waited with almost fiendish eagerness to hear that some prominent white man was dead or dying  a month six weeks two months went slowly past and still nobody of consequence in all spanish town fell ill or sickened talk about tropical diseases why the place was abominably atrociously outrageously healthy cecil mitford fretted and fumed and worried by himself wondering whether he would be kept there for ever and ever waiting till some useless nobody chose to die the worst of it all was he could tell nobody his troubles he had to pretend to look unconcerned and interested and listen to all old mr barclays stories about maroons and buccaneers as if he really enjoyed them  at last after cecil had been two full months at spanish town he heard one morning with grim satisfaction that yellow fever had broken out at port antonio now yellow fever as he knew full well attacks only white men or men of white blood and cecil felt sure that before long there would be somebody white dead in spanish town not that he was really wicked or malevolent or even unfeeling at heart but his wild desire to discover john canns treasure had now overridden every better instinct of his nature and had enslaved him body and soul till he could think of nothing in any light save that of its bearing on his one mad imagination so he waited a little longer still more eagerly than before till yellow fever should come to spanish town  sure enough the fever did come in good time and the very first person who sickened with it was cecil mitford that was a contingency he had never dreamt of and for the time being it drove john canns treasure almost out of his fevered memory yet not entirely even so for in his delirium he raved of john cann and his doubloons till good old mr barclay nursing at his bedside like a woman as a tenderhearted mulatto always will nurse any casual young white man shook his head to himself and muttered gloomily that poor mr mitford had overworked his brain sadly in his minute historical investigations  for ten days cecil mitford hovered fitfully between life and death and for ten days good old mr barclay waited on him morning noon and night as devotedly as any mother could wait upon her firstborn at the end of that time he began to mend slowly and as soon as the crisis was over he forgot forthwith all about his illness and thought once more of nothing on earth save only john canns treasure was anybody else ill of the fever in spanish town yes two but not dangerously cecils face fell at that saving clause and in his heart he almost ventured to wish it had been otherwise he was no murderer even in thought but john canns treasure john canns treasure john canns treasure what would not a man venture to do or pray in order that he might become the possessor of john canns treasure  as cecil began to mend a curious thing happened at leigh caymanas contrary to almost all the previous medical experience of the whole island mr barclay though a full mulatto of half black blood suddenly sickened with the yellow fever he had worn himself out with nursing cecil and the virus seemed to have got into his blood in a way that it would never have done under other circumstances and when the doctor came to see him he declared at once that the symptoms were very serious cecil hated and loathed himself for the thought and yet in a horrid indefinite way he gloated over the possibility of his kind and hospitable friends dying mr barclay had tended him so carefully that he almost loved him and yet with john canns treasure before his very eyes in a dim uncertain awful fashion he almost looked forward to his dying but where would he be buried that was the question not surely among the poor black people in the pauper corner a man of his hosts distinction and position would certainly deserve a place among the most exalted white gravesnear the body of governor modyford and not far from the tomb of john cann himself  day after day mr barclay sank slowly but surely and cecil weak and hardly convalescent himself sat watching by his bedside and nursing him as tenderly as the good brown man had nursed cecil himself in his turn a week earlier the young clerk was no hardhearted wretch who could see a kind entertainer die without a single passing pang he felt for the grey old mulatto as deeply as he could have felt for his own brother if he had had one every time there was a sign of suffering or feebleness it went to cecils heart like a knifethe very knowledge that on one side of his nature he wished the man to die made him all the more anxious and careful on the other side to do everything he could to save him if possible or at least to alleviate his sufferings poor old man it was horrible to see him lying there parched with fever and dying by inches but thenjohn canns treasure john canns treasure john canns treasure every shade that passed over the good mulattos face brought cecil mitford a single step nearer to the final enjoyment of john canns treasure   vi  on the evening when the hon charles barclay died cecil mitford went out for the first time after his terrible illness to speak a few words in private with the negro sexton he found the man lounging in the soft dust outside his hut and ready enough to find a place for the corpse which would be buried next morning with the ordinary tropical haste close beside the spot actually occupied by john canns coffin all the rest the sexton said with a horrid grin he would leave to cecil  at twelve oclock of a dark moonless night cecil mitford still weak and ill but trembling only from the remains of his fever set out stealthily from the dead mans low bungalow in the outskirts of spanish town and walked on alone through the unlighted unpaved streets of the sleeping city to the cathedral precinct not a soul met or passed him on the way through the lonely alleys not a solitary candle burned anywhere in a single window he carried only a little dark lantern in his hand and a very small pick that he had borrowed that same afternoon from the negro sexton stumbling along through the unfamiliar lanes he saw at last the great black mass of the gaunt ungainly cathedral standing out dimly against the hardly less black abyss of night that formed the solemn background but cecil mitford was not awed by place or season he could think only of one subject john canns treasure he groped his way easily through scrub and monuments to the far corner of the churchyard and there close by a fresh and open grave he saw the wellremembered halfeffaced letters that marked the mouldering upright slab as john canns gravestone without a moments delay without a touch of hesitation without a single tinge of womanish weakness he jumped down boldly into the open grave and turned the light side of his little lantern in the direction of john canns undesecrated coffin  a few strokes of the pick soon loosened the intervening earth sufficiently to let him get at a wooden plank on the nearer side of the coffin it had mouldered away with damp and age till it was all quite soft and pliable and he broke through it with his hand alone and saw lying within a heap of huddled bones which he knew at once for john canns skeleton under any other circumstances such a sight seen in the dead of night with all the awesome accessories of time and place would have chilled and appalled cecil mitfords nervous blood but he thought nothing of it all now his whole soul was entirely concentrated on a single ideathe search for the missing paper leaning over toward the breach he had made into john canns grave he began groping about with his right hand on the floor of the coffin after a moments search his fingers came across a small rusty metal object clasped apparently in the bony hand of the skeleton he drew it eagerly out it was a steel snuffbox prising open the corroded hinge with his pocketknife he found inside a small scrap of dry paper his fingers trembled as he held it to the dark lantern oh heavens success success it was it wasthe missing document  he knew it in a moment by the handwriting and the cypher he couldnt wait to read it till he went home to the dead mans house so he curled himself up cautiously in charles barclays open grave and proceeded to decipher the crabbed manuscript as well as he was able by the lurid light of the lantern yes yes it was all right it told him with minute and unmistakable detail the exact spot in the valley of the bovey where john canns treasure lay securely hidden not at john canns rocks on the hilltop as the local legend untruly affirmedjohn cann had not been such an unguarded fool as to whisper to the idle gossips of bovey the spot where he had really buried his precious doubloonsbut down in the valley by a bend of the river at a point that cecil mitford had known well from his childhood upward hurrah hurrah the secret was unearthed at last and he had nothing more to do than to go home to england and proceed to dig up john canns treasure  so he cautiously replaced the loose earth on the side of the grave and walked back this time bold and erect with his dark lantern openly displayed for it mattered little now who watched or followed him to dead charles barclays lonely bungalow the black servants were crooning and wailing over their masters body and nobody took much notice of the white visitor if they had cecil mitford would have cared but little so long as he carried john canns last dying directions safely folded in his leather pocketbook  next day cecil mitford stood once more as a chief mourner beside the grave he had sat in that night so strangely by himself and before the week was over he had taken his passage for england in the royal mail steamer tagus and was leaving the cocoanut groves of port royal well behind him on the port side before him lay the open sea and beyond it england ethel and john canns treasure   vii  it had been a long job after all to arrange fully the needful preliminaries for the actual search after john canns buried doubloons first of all there was ethels interest to pay and a horrid story for cecil to concoctall false of course worse luck to itabout how he had managed to invest her poor three hundred to the best advantage then there was another story to make good about three months extra leave from the colonial office next came the question of buying the land where john canns treasure lay hidden and this was really a matter of very exceptional and peculiar difficulty the ownerpigheaded fellowdidnt want to sell no matter how much he was offered because the corner contained a clump of trees that made a specially pretty element in the view from his diningroom windows his diningroom windows forsooth what on earth could it matter when john canns treasure was at stake whether anything at all was visible or otherwise from his miserable diningroom windows cecil was positively appalled at the obstinacy and narrowmindedness of the poor squireen who could think of nothing at all in the whole world but his own ridiculous antiquated windows however in the end by making his bid high enough he was able to induce this obstructive old curmudgeon to part with his triangular little corner of land in the bend of the river even so there was the question of payment absurd as it seemed with all john canns money almost in his hands cecil was obliged to worry and bother and lie and intrigue for weeks together in order to get that paltry little sum in hard cash for the matter of payment still he raised it in the end raised it by inducing ethel to sell out the remainder of her poor small fortune and cajoling aunt emily into putting her name to a bill of sale for her few worthless bits of oldfashioned furniture at last after many delays and vexatious troubles cecil found himself the actual possessor of the corner of land wherein lay buried john canns treasure  the very first day that cecil mitford could call that coveted piece of ground his own he could not restrain his eagerness though he knew it was imprudent in a land where the unjust law of treasuretrove prevails but he must then and there begin covertly digging under the shadow of the three big willow trees in the bend of the river he had eyed and measured the bearings so carefully already that he knew the very spot to a nails breadth where john canns treasure was actually hidden he set to work digging with a little pick as confidently as if he had already seen the doubloons lying there in the strong box that he knew enclosed them four feet deep he dug as john canns instructions told him and then true to the inch his pick struck against a solid oaken box well secured with clamps of iron cecil cleared all the dirt away from the top carefully not hurriedly and tried with all his might to lift the box out but all in vain it was far too heavy of course for one mans arms to raise all that weight of gold and silver must be ever so much more than a single pair of hands could possibly manage he must try to open the lid alone so as to take the gold out a bit at a time and carry it away with him now and again as he was able covering the place up carefully in between for fear of the treasury and the lord of the manor how abominably unjust it seemed to him at that momentthe legal claim of those two indolent hostile powers to think that after he cecil mitford had borne the brunt of the labour in adventurously hunting up the whole trail of john canns secret two idle irresponsible participators should come in at the end if they could to profit entirely by his ingenuity and his exertions  at last by a great effort he forced the rusty lock open and looked eagerly into the strong oak chest how his heart beat with slow deep throbs at that supreme moment not with suspense for he knew he should find the money but with the final realization of a great hope long deferred yes there it lay in very truth all before himgreat shining coins of old spanish goldgold gold gold arranged in long rows one coin after another over the whole surface of the broad oak box he had found it he had found it he had really found it after so much toilsome hunting after so much vain endeavour after so many heartbreaking disappointments john canns treasure in very truth lay open there actually before him  for a few minutes eager and frightened as he was cecil mitford did not dare even to touch the precious pieces in the greatness of his joy in the fierce rush of his overpowering emotions he had no time to think of mere base everyday gold and silver it was the future and the ideal that he beheld not the piledup heaps of filthy lucre ethel was his wealth was his honour was his he would be a rich man and a great man now and henceforth for ever oh how he hugged himself in his heart on the wise successful fraud by which he had induced ethel to advance him the few wretched hundreds he needed for his evermemorable jamaican journey how he praised to himself his own courage and ingenuity and determination and inexhaustible patience how he laughed down that foolish conscience of his that would fain have dissuaded him from his masterstroke of genius he deserved it all he deserved it all other men would have flinched before the risk and expense of the voyage to jamaica would have given up the scent for a fools errand in the cemetery at port royal would have shrunk from ransacking john canns grave at dead of night in the cathedral precincts at spanish town would have feared to buy the highpriced corner of land at bovey tracy on a pure imaginative speculation but he cecil mitford had had the boldness and the cleverness to do it every bit and now wisdom was justified of all her children he sat for five minutes in profound meditation on the edge of the little pit he had dug gloating dreamily over the broad gold pieces and inwardly admiring his own bravery and foresight and indomitable resolution what a magnificent man he really wasa worthy successor of those great freebooting buccaneering filibustering devonians of the grand elizabethan era to think that the workyday modern world should ever have tried to doom him cecil mitford with his splendid enterprise and glorious potentialities to a hundred and eighty a year and a routine clerkship at the colonial office  after a while however mere numerical cupidity began to get the better of this heroic mood and cecil mitford turned somewhat languidly to the vulgar task of counting the rows of doubloons he counted up the foremost row carefully and then for the first time perceived to his intense surprise that the row behind was not gold but mere silver mexican pistoles he rubbed his eyes and looked again but the fact was unmistakable there was only one row of yellow gold in the top layer and all the rest was merely bright and glittering silver strange that john cann should have put coins of such small value near the top of his box the rest of the gold must certainly be in successive layers down further he lifted up the big gold doubloons in the first row and then to his blank horror and amazement came tonot more gold not more silver butbutbutay incredible as it seemed appalling horrifyinga wooden bottom  had john cann in his care and anxiety put a layer of solid oak between each layer of gold and silver hardly that the oak was too thick in a moment cecil mitford had taken out all the coins of the first tier and laid bare the oaken bottom a few blows of the pick loosened the earth around and then oh horror oh ghastly disappointment oh unspeakable heartsickening revelation the whole box came out entire it was only two inches deep altogether including the coverit was in fact a mere shallow tray or saucer something like the sort of thin wooden boxes in which sets of dessertknives or fishknives are usually sold for wedding presents  for the space of three seconds cecil mitford could not believe his eyes and then with a sudden flash of awful vividness the whole terrible truth flashed at once across his staggering brain he had found john canns treasure indeedthe john canns treasure of base actual reality but the john canns treasure of his fervid imagination the john canns treasure he had dreamt of from his boyhood upward the john canns treasure he had risked all to find and to win did not exist could not exist and never had existed at all anywhere it was all a horrible incredible unthinkable delusion the hideous fictions he had told would every one be now discovered ethel would be ruined aunt emily would be ruined and they would both know him not only for a fool a dreamer and a visionary but also for a gambler a thief and a liar  in his black despair he jumped down into the shallow hole once more and began a second time to count slowly over the accursed dollars the whole miserable sumthe untold wealth of john canns treasurewould amount altogether to about two hundred and twenty pounds of modern sterling english money cecil mitford tore his hair as he counted it in impotent self punishment two hundred and twenty pounds and he had expected at least as many thousands he saw it all in a moment his wild fancy had mistaken the poor outcast hunteddown pirate for a sort of ideal criminal millionaire he had erected the ignorant persecuted john cann of real life who fled from the kings justice to a nest of chartered outlaws in jamaica into a great successful naval commander like the drake or hawkins of actual history the whole truth about the wretched solitary old robber burst in upon him now with startling vividness he saw him hugging his paltry two hundred pounds to his miserly old bosom crossing the sea with it stealthily from jamaica burying it secretly in a hole in the ground at bovey quarrelling about it with his peasant relations in england as the poor will often quarrel about mere trifles of money and dying at last with the secret of that wretched sum hidden in the snuffbox that he clutched with fierce energy even in his lifeless skeleton fingers it was all clear horribly irretrievably unmistakably clear to him now and the john cann that he had once followed through so many chances and changes had faded away at once into absolute nothingness now and for ever  if cecil mitford had known a little less about john canns life and exploits he might still perhaps have buoyed himself up with the vain hope that all the treasure was not yet unearthedthat there were more boxes still buried in the ground more doubloons still hidden further down in the unexplored bosom of the little threecornered field but the words of john canns own dying directions were too explicit and clear to admit of any such gloss or false interpretation in a strong oaken chest bound round with iron and buried at four feet of depth in the southwestern angle of the home croft at bovey said the document plainly there was no possibility of making two out of it in any way indeed in that single minute cecil mitfords mind had undergone a total revolution and he saw the john cann myth for the first time in his life now in its true colours the bubble had burst the halo had vanished the phantom had faded away and the miserable squalid miserly reality stood before him with all its vulgar nakedness in their place the whole panorama of john canns life as he knew it intimately in all its details passed before his minds eye like a vivid picture no longer in the brilliant hues of boyish romance but in the dingy sordid tones of sober fact he had given up all that was worth having in this world for the sake of a poor gipsy pirates pennysaving hoard  a weaker man would have swallowed the disappointment or kept the delusion still to his dying day cecil mitford was made of stronger mould the ideal john canns treasure had taken possession of him body and soul and now that john canns treasure had faded into utter nonentitya paltry two hundred poundsthe whole solid earth had failed beneath his feet and nothing was left before him but a mighty blank a mighty blank blank blank blank cecil mitford sat there on the edge of the pit with his legs dangling over into the hollow where john canns treasure had never been gazing blankly out into a blank sky with staring blank eyeballs that looked straight ahead into infinite space and saw utterly nothing  how long he sat there no one knows but late at night when the people at the red lion began to miss their guest and turned out in a body to hunt for him in the corner field they found him sitting still on the edge of the pit he had dug for the grave of his own hopes and gazing still with listless eyes into blank vacancy a box of loose coin lay idly scattered on the ground beside him the poor gentleman had been struck crazy they whispered to one another and so indeed he had not raving mad with acute insanity but blankly hopelessly and helplessly imbecile with the loss of john canns treasure the whole universe had faded out for him into abject nihilism they carried him home to the inn between them on their arms and put him to bed carefully in the old bedroom as one might put a newborn baby  the lord of the manor when he came to hear the whole pitiful story would have nothing to do with the wretched doubloons the curse of blood was upon them he said and worse than that so the treasury which has no sentiments and no conscience came in at the end for what little there was of john canns unholy treasure   viii  in the county pauper lunatic asylum for devon there was one quiet impassive patient who was always pointed out to horrorloving visitors because he had once been a gentleman and had a strange romance hanging to him still even in that dreary refuge of the destitute insane the lady whom he had loved and robbedall for her own goodhad followed him down from london to devonshire and she and her aunt kept a small school after some struggling fashion in the town close by where many kindhearted squires of the neighbourhood sent their little girls while they were still very little for the sake of charity and for pity of the sad sad story one day a week there was a whole holidaywednesday it wasfor that was visiting day at the county asylum and then ethel sutherland dressed in deep mourning walked round with her aunt to the gloomy gateway at ten oclock and sat as long as she was allowed with the faded image of cecil mitford holding his listless hand clasped hard in her pale white fingers and looking with sad eager anxious eyes for any gleam of passing recognition in his alas the gleam never came perhaps it was better so cecil mitford looked always straight before him at the blank whitewashed walls and saw nothing heard nothing thought of nothing from weeks end to weeks end  ethel had forgiven him all what will not a loving woman forgive nay more had found excuses and palliations for him which quite glossed over his crime and his folly he must have been losing his reason long before he ever went to jamaica she said for in his right mind he would never have tried to deceive her or himself in the way he had done did he not fancy he was sent out by the colonial office when he had really gone without leave or mission and did he not persuade her to give up her money to him for investment and after all never invest it what greater proofs of insanity could you have than those and then that dreadful fever at spanish town and the shock of losing his kind entertainer worn out with nursing him had quite completed the downfall of his reason so ethel sutherland in her pure beautiful womans soul went on believing as steadfastly as ever in the faith and the goodness of that cecil mitford that had never been his ideal had faded out before the first touch of disillusioning fact hers persisted still in spite of all the rudest assaults that the plainest facts could make upon it thank heaven for that wonderful idealising power of a good woman which enables her to walk unsullied through this sordid world unknowing and unseeing  at last one night one terrible windy night in december ethel sutherland was wakened from her sleep in the quiet little schoolhouse by a fearful glare falling fiercely upon her bedroom window she jumped up hastily and rushed to the little casement to look out towards the place whence the glare came one thought alone rose instinctively in her white little mindcould it be at cecils asylum oh horror yes the whole building was in flames and if cecil were takeneven poor mad imbecile cecilwhat what on earth would then be left her  huddling on a few things hastily anyhow ethel rushed out wildly into the street and ran with incredible speed where all the crowd of the town was running together towards the blazing asylum the mob knew her at once and recognized her sad claim they made a little lane down the surging mass for her to pass through till she stood beside the very firemen at the base of the gateway it was an awful sightpoor mad wretches raving and imploring at the windows while the firemen plied their hose and brought their escapes to bear as best they were able on one menaced tier after another but ethel saw or heard nothing save in one third floor window of the right wing where cecil mitford stood no longer speechless and imbecile but calling loudly for help and flinging his eager arms wildly about him the shock had brought him back his reason for the moment at least oh thank god thank god he saw her he saw her  with a sudden wild cry ethel burst from the firemen who tried to hold her back leaped into the burning building and tore up the blazing stairs blinded and scorched but by some miracle not quite suffocated till she reached the stone landing on the third story turning along the wellknown corridor now filled with black wreaths of stifling smoke she reached at last cecils ward and flung herself madly wildly into his circling arms for a moment they both forgot the awful death that girt them round on every side and cecil rising one second superior to himself cried only ethel ethel ethel i love you forgive me ethel pressed his hand in hers gently and answered in an agony of joy there is nothing to forgive cecil i can die happy now now that i have once more heard you say you love me you love me  hand in hand they turned back towards the blazing staircase and reached the window at the end where the firemen were now bringing their escapeladder to bear on the third story the men below beckoned them to come near and climb out on to the ladder but just at that moment something behind seemed incomprehensibly to fascinate and delay cecil so that he would not move a step nearer though ethel led him on with all her might she looked back to see what could be the reason and beheld the floor behind them rent by the flames and a great gap spreading downward to the treasurers room on the tiled floor a few dozen pence and shillings and other coins lay white with heat among the glowing rubbish and the whole mass glittering like gold in the fierce glare seemed some fiery cave filled to the brim with fabulous wealth cecils eye was riveted upon the yawning gap and the corners of his mouth twitched horribly as he gazed with intense interest upon the red cinders and white hot coin beneath him instinctively ethel felt at once that all was lost and that the old mania was once more upon him clasping her arm tight round his waist while the firemen below shouted to her to leave him and come down as she valued her life she made one desperate effort to drag him by main force to the head of the ladder but cecil strong man that he was threw her weak little arm impetuously away as he might have thrown a twoyearold babys and cried to her in a voice trembling with excitement see see ethel at last at last there it is there it is in good earnest john canns treasure  ethel seized his arm imploringly once more this way darling she cried in a voice choked by sobs and half stifled with the smoke this way to the ladder  but cecil broke from her fiercely with a wild light in his big blue eyes and shouting aloud the treasure the treasure leaped with awful energy into the very centre of the seething fiery abyss ethel fell fainting with terror and choked by the flames on to the burning floor of the third story the firemen watching from below declared next day that that crazy madman must have died stifled before he touched the heap of white hot ruins in the central shell and the poor lady was insensible or dead with asphyxia full ten minutes before the flames swept past the spot where her lifeless body was lying immovable     isaline and i   i  well mademoiselle isaline i said strolling out into the garden and who is the young cavalier with the black moustache  what monsieur answered isaline you have seen him you have been watching from your window we did not know you had returned from the aiguille  oh yes ive been back for more than an hour i replied the snow was so deep on the col that i gave it up at last and made up my mind not to try it without a guide  i am so glad isaline said demurely i had such fears for monsieur the aiguille is dangerous though it isnt very high and i had been very distractedly anxious till monsieur returned  thanks mademoiselle i answered with a little bow your solicitude for my safety flatters me immensely but you havent told me yet who is the gentleman with the black moustache  isaline smiled his name is m claude she said m claude tirard you know but we dont use surnames much among ourselves in the pays de vaud he is the schoolmaster of the commune  m claude is a very happy man then i put in i envy his good fortune  isaline blushed a pretty blush on the contrary she answered he has just been declaring himself the most miserable of all mankind he says his life is not worth having  they always say that under those peculiar circumstances i said believe me mademoiselle there are a great many men who would be glad to exchange their own indifferently tolerable lot for m claudes unendurable misery  isaline said nothing but she looked at me with a peculiar inquiring look as if she would very much like to know exactly what i meant by it and how much i meant it  and what did i mean by it not very much after all i imagine for when it comes to retrospect which one of us is any good at analyzing his own motives the fact is isaline was a very pretty little girl and i had nothing else to do and i might just as well make myself agreeable to her as gain the reputation of being a bear of an englishman besides if there was the safeguard of m claude a real indigenous suitor in the background there wasnt much danger of my polite attentions being misunderstood  however i havent yet told you how i came to find myself on the farm at les pentes at all this then is how it all came about i was sick of the temple i had spent four or five briefless years in lounging about brick court and dropping in casually at important cases just to let the world see i was the proud possessor of a wellcurled wig but even a wig which suits my complexion admirably palls after five years and i said to myself that i would really cut london altogether and live upon my means somewhere on the continent very small means to be sure but still enough to pull through upon in switzerland or the black forest so just by way of experiment as to how i liked it i packed up my fishingrod and my portmanteau the first the most important took the 718 express from the gare de lyon for geneva and found myself next afternoon comfortably seated on the verandah of my favourite hotel at vevay the lake is delightful that we all know but i wanted to get somewhere where there was a little fishing so i struck back at once into the mountain country round château doex and les avants and came soon upon the exact thing i wanted at les pentes  picture to yourself a great amphitheatre of open alp or mountain pasture in the foreground with peaks covered by vivid green pines in the middle distance and a background of pretty aiguilles naked at their base but clad near the summit with frozen masses of sparkling ice put into the midst of the amphitheatre a clear greenandwhite torrent with a church surrounded by a few wooden farmhouses on its slope and there you have the commune of les pentes but what was most delightful of all was this that there was no hotel no pension not even a regular lodginghouse i was the first stranger to discover the capabilities of the village and i was free to exploit them for my own private advantage by a stroke of luck it so happened that m clairon the richest farmer of the place with a pretty oldfashioned vaudois farmhouse and a pretty dainty little vaudoise daughter was actually willing to take me in for a mere song per week i jumped at the chance and the same day saw me duly installed in a pretty little room under the eaves of the pretty little farmhouse and with the pretty little daughter politely attending to all my wants  do you know those oldfashioned vaudois houses with their big gableends their deepthatched roofs their cobs of maize and smoked hams and other rural wealth hanging out ostentatiously under the protecting ledges if you dont you cant imagine what a delightful time i had of it at les pentes the farm was a large one for the pays de vaud and m clairon actually kept two servants but madame would have been scandalized at the idea of letting that sara or that lisette wait upon the english voyager and the consequence was that mademoiselle isaline herself always came to answer my little tinkling handbell it was a trifle awkward for mademoiselle isaline was too much of a young lady not to be treated with deferential politeness and yet there is a certain difficulty in being deferentially polite to the person who lays your table for dinner however i made the best of it and im bound to say i managed to get along very comfortably  isaline was one of those pretty plump laughingeyed dimplecheeked dark little girls that you hardly ever see anywhere outside the pays de vaud it was almost impossible to look at her without smiling im sure it was quite impossible for her to look at any one else and not smile at them she wore the prettiest little vaudois caps you ever saw in your life and she looked so coquettish in them that you must have been very hardhearted indeed if you did not straightway fall head over ears in love with her at first sight besides she had been to school at lausanne and spoke such pretty delicate musical french now my good mother thought badly of my french accent and when i told her i meant to spend a summer month or two in western switzerland she said to me i do hope charlie dear you will miss no opportunity of conversing with the people and improving yourself in colloquial french a little i am certainly the most dutiful of sons and i solemnly assure you that whenever i was not fishing or climbing i missed no opportunity whatsoever of conversing with pretty little isaline  mademoiselle isaline i said on this particular afternoon i should much like a cup of tea can sara bring me one out here in the garden  perfectly monsieur i will bring you out the little table on to the grass plot said isaline that will arrange things for you much more pleasantly  not for worlds i said running in to get it myself but isaline had darted into the house before me and brought it out with her own white little hands on to the tiny lawn then she went in again and soon reappeared with a japanese traybought at montreux specially in my honourand a set of the funniest little old china teathings ever beheld in a london bricàbrac cabinet  wont you sit and take a cup with me mademoiselle i asked  ma foi monsieur answered isaline blushing again i have never tasted any except as pthisane but you other english drink it so dont you i will try it for the rest one learns always  i poured her out a cup and creamed it with some of that delicious vaudois cream no cream in the world so good as what you get in the pays de vaudyou see i am an enthusiast for my adopted countrybut that is anticipating matters and handed it over to her for her approval she tasted it with a little moue englishwomen dont make the moue so though i like sticking to my mother tongue i confess my inability to translate the word brrrr she said do you english like that stuff well one must accommodate ones self to it i suppose and to do her justice she proceeded to accommodate herself to it with such distinguished success that she asked me soon for another cup and drank it off without even a murmur  and this m claude then i asked he is a friend of yours eh  passably she answered colouring slightly you see we have not much society at les pontes he comes from the normal school at geneva he is instructed a man of education we see few such here what would you have she said it apologetically as though she thought she was bound to excuse herself for having made m claudes acquaintance  but you like him very much  like him well yes i liked him always well enough bat he is too haughty he gives himself airs today he is angry with me he has no right to be angry with me  mademoiselle i said have you ever read our shakespeare  oh yes in english i have read him i can read english well enough though i speak but a little  and have you read the tempest  how ariel ferdinand miranda caliban oh yes it is beautiful  well mademoiselle i said do you remember how miranda first saw ferdinand  she smiled and blushed againshe was such a little blusher i know what you would say she said you english are blunt you talk to young ladies so strangely  well mademoiselle isaline it seems to me that you at les pentes are like miranda on the island you see nobody and there is nobody here to see you you must not go and fall in love like miranda with the very first man you happen to meet with because he comes from the normal school at geneva there are plenty of men in the world believe me beside m claude  ah but miranda and ferdinand both loved one another said isaline archly and they were married and both lived happily ever afterward i saw at once she was trying to pique me  how do you know that i asked it doesnt say so in the play for all i know ferdinand lost the crown of naples through a revolution and went and settled down at a country school in savoy or somewhere and took to drinking and became brutally unsociable and made mirandas life a toil and a burden to her at any rate im sure of one thing he wasnt worthy of her  what made me go on in this stupid way im sure i dont know i certainly didnt mean to marry isaline myself  at least not definitely and yet when you are sitting down at tea on a rustic garden seat with a pretty girl in a charming white crimped cap beside you and you get a chance of insinuating that other fellows dont think quite as much of her as you do it isnt human nature to let slip the opportunity of insinuating it  but you dont know m claude said isaline practically and so you cant tell whether he is worthy of me or not  im perfectly certain i answered that he cant be even though he were a very paragon of virtue learning and manly beauty  if monsieur talks in that way said isaline i shall have to go back at once to mamma  wait a moment i said and i will talk however you wish me you know you agree to give me instruction in conversational french that naturally includes lessons in conversation with ladies of exceptional personal attractions i must practise for every possible circumstance of life so you have read shakespeare then and any other english books  oh many scott and dickens and all except byron my papa says a young lady must not read byron but i have read what he has said of our lake in a book of extracts it is a great pleasure to me to look down among the vines and chestnuts there and to think that our lake which gleams so blue and beautiful below is the most famous in poetry of all lakes you know jean jacques says mon lac est le premier and so it is  then you have read jean jacques too  oh mon dieu no my papa says a young lady must especially not read jean jacques but i know something about himso much as is convenable hold here do you see that clump of trees down there by the lake just above clarens that is julies grovele bosquet de julie we call it there isnt a spot along the lake that is not thus famous that has not its memories and its associations it is for that that i could not choose ever to leave the dear old pays de vaud  you would not like to live in england then i asked what a fool i was to be sure  oh ma foi no that would make one too much shiver with your chills and your fogs and your winters i could not stand it it is cold here but at any rate it is sunny well at least it would not be pleasant but after all that depends you have the sun too sometimes dont you  isaline cried madame from the window i want you to come and help me pick over the gooseberries and to say the truth i thought it quite time she should go   ii  a week later i met m claude again he was a very nice young fellow there was not a doubt of that he was intelligent well educated manly with all the honest sturdy independent swiss nature clearly visible in his frank bright open face i have seldom met a man whom i liked better at first sight than m claude and after he had gone away i felt more than a little ashamed of myself to think i had been half trying to steal away isalines heart from this good fellow without really having any deliberate design upon it myself it began to strike me that i had been doing a very dirty shabby thing  charlie my boy i said to myself as i sat fishing with bottom bait and dangling my legs over the edge of a pool youve been flirting with this pretty little swiss girl and whats worse youve been flirting in a very bad sort of way shes got a lover of her own and youve been trying to make her feel dissatisfied with him for no earthly reason youve taken advantage of your position and your fancied london airs and graces to run down by implication a good fellow who really loves her and would probably make her an excellent husband dont let this occur again sir and having thus virtuously resolved of course i went away and flirted with isaline next morning as vigorously as ever  during the following fortnight m claude came often and i could not disguise from myself the fact that m claude did not quite like me this was odd for i liked him very much i suppose he took me for a potential rival men are so jealous when they are in love besides i observed that isaline tried not to be thrown too much with him alone tried to include me in the party wherever she went with him also i will freely confess that i felt myself every day more fond of isalines society and i half fancied i caught myself trepidating a little inwardly now and then when she happened to come up to me absurd to be so susceptible but such is man  one lovely day about this time i set out once more to try my hand or rather my feet alone upon the aiguille isaline put me up a nice little light lunch in my knapsack and insisted upon seeing that my alpenstock was firmly shod and my pedestrian boots in due climbing order in fact she loudly lamented my perversity in attempting to make the ascent without a guide and she must even needs walk with me as far as the little bridge over the torrent beside the snow line to point me out the road the guides generally took to the platform at the summit for myself i was a practised mountaineer and felt no fear for the result as i left her for the ice she stood a long time looking and waving me the right road with her little pockethandkerchief while as long as i could hear her voice she kept on exhorting me to be very careful ah if monsieur would only have taken a guide you dont know how dangerous that little aiguille really is  the sun was shining brightly on the snow the view across the valley of the rhone towards the snowy alps beyond was exquisite and the giants of the bernese oberland stood out in gloriously brilliant outline on the other side against the clear blue summer sky i went on alone enjoying myself hugely in my own quiet fashion and watching isaline as she made her way slowly along the green path looking round often and again till she disappeared in the shadow of the pinewood that girt round the tiny village on farther still up and up and up over soft snow for the most part with very little ice till at last after three hours hard climbing i stood on the very summit of the pretty aiguille it was not very high but it commanded a magnificent view over either sidethe alps on one hand the counterchain of the oberland on the other and the blue lake gleaming and glowing through all its length in its green valley between them there i sat down on the pure snow in the glittering sunlight and ate the lunch that isaline had provided for me with much gusto unfortunately i also drank the pint of white wine from the head of the lakeyvorne we call it and i grow it now in my own vineyard at pic de la baumebut that is anticipating again as good a light wine as you will get anywhere in europe in these depressing days of blight and phylloxera now a pint of vin du pays is not too much under ordinary circumstances for a strong young man in vigorous health doing a hard days muscular work with legs arms and sinews but mountain air is thin and exhilarating in itself and it lends a point to a halfbottle of yvorne which the wines own body does not by any means usually possess i dont mean to say so much light wine does one any positive harm but it makes one more careless and easygoing gives one a false sense of security and entices one into paying less heed to ones footsteps or to suspiciouslooking bits of doubtful ice  well after lunch i took a good look at the view with my fieldglass and when i turned it towards les pentes i could make out our farmhouse distinctly and even saw isaline standing on the balcony looking towards the aiguille my heart jumped a little when i thought that she was probably looking for me then i wound my way down again not by retracing my steps but by trying a new path which seemed to me a more practicable one it was not the one isaline had pointed out but it appeared to go more directly and to avoid one or two of the very worst roughandtumble pieces  i was making my way back merrily enough when suddenly i happened to step on a little bit of loose ice which slid beneath my feet in a very uncomfortable manner before i knew where i was i felt myself sliding rapidly on with the ice clinging to my heel and while i was vainly trying to dig my alpenstock into a firm snowbank i became conscious for a moment of a sort of dim indefinite blank it was followed by a sensation of empty space and then i knew i was falling over the edge of something  whrrr whrrr whrrr went the air at my ear for a moment and the next thing i knew was a jar of pain and a consciousness of being enveloped in something very soft the jar took away all other feeling for a few seconds i only knew i was stunned and badly hurt after a time i began to be capable of trying to realize the position and when i opened my eyes and looked around me i recognized that i was lying on my back and that there was a pervading sensation of whiteness everywhere about in point of fact i was buried in snow i tried to move and to get on my legs again but two things very effectually prevented me in the first place i could not stir my legs without giving myself the most intense pain in my spine and in the second place when i did stir them i brought them into contact on the one hand with a solid wall of rock and on the other hand with vacant space or at least with very soft snow unsupported by a rocky bottom gradually by feeling about with my arms i began exactly to realize the gravity of the position i had fallen over a precipice and had lighted on a snowcovered ledge halfway down my back was very badly hurt and i dared not struggle up on to my legs for fear of falling off the ledge again on the other side besides i was half smothered in the snow and even if anybody ever came to look for me which they would not probably do till tomorrow they would not be able to see me because of the deepcovering drifts if i was not extricated that night i should probably freeze to death before morning especially after my pint of wine confound that yvorne i said to myself savagely if ever i get out of this scrape ill never touch a drop of the stuff again as long as i live i regret to say that i have since broken that solemn promise twice daily for the past three years  my one hope was that isaline might possibly be surprised at my delay in returning and might send out one of the guides to find me  so there i lay a long time unable even to get out of the snow and with every movement causing me a horrid pain in my injured back still i kept on moving my legs every now and then to make the pain shoot and so prevent myself from feeling drowsy the snow half suffocated me and i could only breathe with difficulty at last slowly i began to lose consciousness and presently i suppose i fell asleep to fall asleep in the snow is the first stage of freezing to death   iii  noises above me i think on the edge of the precipice something coming down oh how slowly something comes and fumbles about a yard or so away then i cry out feebly and the something approaches m claudes hearty voice calls out cheerily enfin le voilà and i am saved  they let down ropes and pulled me up to the top of the little crag clumsily so as to cause me great pain and then three men carried me home to the farmhouse on a stretcher m claude was one of the three the others were labourers from the village  how did you know i was lost m claude i asked feebly as they carried me along on the level  he did not answer for a moment then he said rather gloomily in german the fräulein was watching you with a telescope from les pentes he did not say fräulein isaline and i knew why at once he did not wish the other carriers to know what he was talking about  and she told you i said in german too  she sent me i did not come of my own accord i came under orders he spoke sternly hissing out his gutturals in an angry voice  m claude i said i have done very wrong and i ask your forgiveness you have saved my life and i owe you a debt of gratitude for it i will leave les pentes and the fräulein tomorrow or at least as soon as i can safely be moved  he shook his head bitterly it is no use now he answered with a sigh the fräulein does not wish for me i have asked her and she has refused me and she has been watching you up and down the aiguille the whole day with a telescope when she saw you had fallen she rushed out like one distracted and came to tell me at the school in the village it is no use you have beaten me  m claude i said i will plead for you i have done you wrong and i ask your forgiveness  i owe you no illwill he replied in his honest straightforward swiss manner it is not your fault if you too have fallen in love with her how could any man help it living in the same house with her too allons he went on in french resuming his alternative tongue for he spoke both equally we must get on quick and send for the doctor from glion to see you  by the time we reached the farmhouse i had satisfied myself that there was nothing very serious the matter with me after all the soft snow had broken the force of the concussion i had strained my spine a good deal and hurt the tendons of the thighs and back but had not broken any bones nor injured any vital organ so when they laid me on the oldfashioned sofa in my little sittingroom lighted a fire in the wide hearth and covered me over with a few rugs i felt comparatively happy and comfortable under the circumstances the doctor was sent for in hot haste but on his arrival he confirmed my own view of the case and declared i only needed rest and quiet and a little arnica  i was rather distressed however when madame came up to see me an hour later and assured me that she and monsieur thought i ought to be moved down as soon as possible into more comfortable apartments at lausanne where i could secure better attendance i saw in a moment what that meant they wanted to get me away from isaline there are no more comfortable quarters in all switzerland i am sure madame i said but madame was inflexible there was an english doctor at lausanne and to lausanne accordingly i must go evidently it had just begun to strike those two good simple people that isaline and i could just conceivably manage to fall in love with one another  might i ask for mademoiselle isaline to bring me up a cup of tea yes isaline would bring it in a minute and when she came in those usually laughing black eyes obviously red with crying i felt my heart sink within me when i thought of my promise to m claude while i began to be vaguely conscious that i was really and truly very much in love with pretty little isaline on my own account  she laid the tray on the small table by the sofa and was going to leave the room immediately mademoiselle isaline i said trying to raise myself and falling back again in pain wont you sit with me a little while i want to talk with you  my mamma said i must come away at once isaline replied demurely she is without doubt busy and wants my aid and she turned to go towards the door  oh do come back mademoiselle i cried raising myself again and giving myself oh such a wrench in the spine dont you see how much it hurts me to sit up  she turned back indecisively and sat down in the big chair just beyond the table handing me the cup and helping me to cream and sugar i plunged at once in medias res  you have been crying mademoiselle i said and i think i can guess the reason m claude has told me something about it he has asked you for your hand and you have refused him is it not so this was a little bit of hypocrisy on my part i confess for i knew what she had been crying about perfectly but i wished to be loyal to m claude  isaline blushed and laughed i do not cry for m claude she said i may have other matters of my own to cry about but m claude is very free with his confidences if he tells such things to a stranger  listen to me mademoiselle isaline i said your father and mother have asked me to leave here tomorrow and go down to lausanne i shall probably never see you again but before i go i want to plead with you for m claude he has saved my life and i owe him much gratitude he loves you he is a brave man a good man a true and earnest man why will you not marry him i feel sure he is a noble fellow and he will make you a tender husband will you not think better of your decision i cannot bear to leave les pentes till i know that you have made him happy  truly  truly  and you go away tomorrow  yes tomorrow  oh monsieur  there isnt much in those two words but they may be pronounced with a good deal of difference in the intonation and isalines intonation did not leave one in much doubt as to how she used them her eyes filled again with tears and she half started up to go ingrate and wretch that i was forgetful of my promise to m claude my eyes filled responsively and i jumped to catch her and keep her from going of course at the expense of another dreadful wrench to my poor back isaline i cried unconsciously dropping the mademoiselle and letting her see my brimming eyelids far too obviously isaline do wait awhile i implore you i beseech you i have something to say to you  she seated herself once more in the big chair well mon pauvre monsieur she cried what is it  isaline i began trying it over again why wont you marry m claude  oh that again well answered isaline boldly because i do not love him and i love somebody else you should not ask a young lady about these matters in switzerland we do not think it comme il faut  but i went on why do you not love m claude he has every good quality and  every good quality andhe bores me answered isaline monsieur she went on archly you were asking me the other day what books i had read in english well i have read longfellow do you remember miles standish  i saw what she was driving at and laughed in spite of myself yes i said i know what you mean when john alden is pleading with priscilla on behalf of miles standish priscilla cuts him short by saying  isaline finished the quotation herself in her own pretty clipped english why dont you speak for yourself john  i laughed she laughed we both looked at one another and the next thing i remember was that i had drawn down isalines plump little face close to mine and was kissing it vigorously in spite of an acute darting pain at each kiss all along my spine and into my marrowbones poor m claude was utterly forgotten  in twenty minutes i had explained my whole position to isaline and in twenty minutes more i had monsieur and madame up to explain it all to them in their turn monsieur listened carefully while i told him that i was an english advocate in no practice to speak of that i had a few hundreds a year of my own partly dependent upon my mother that i had thoughts of settling down permanently in switzerland and that isaline was willing with her parents consent to share my modest competence monsieur replied with true swiss caution that he would inquire into my statements and that if they proved to be as represented and if i obtained in turn my mothers consent he would be happy to hand me over isaline toutefois he added quietly it will be perhaps better to rescind your journey to lausanne the glion doctor is after all a sufficiently skilful one so i waited on in peace at les pontes  madame had insisted upon telegraphing the news of my accident to my mother lest it should reach her first in the papers je suis mère moimême monsieur she said in justification of her conduct and next morning we got a telegram in reply from my mother who evidently imagined she must hurry over at once if she wished to see her son alive or at least must nurse him through a long and dangerous illness considering the injuries were a matter of about three days sofa in all probability this haste was a little overdone however she would arrive by the very first rapide from paris and on the whole i was not sorry for i was half afraid she might set her face against my marrying a foreigner but i felt quite sure any one who once saw isaline could never resist her  that afternoon when school was over m claude dropped in to see how i was getting on i felt more like a thief at that moment than i ever felt in my whole life before or since i knew i must tell him the simple truth but i didnt know how to face it however as soon as i began he saved me the trouble by saying you need not mind explaining mademoiselle isaline has told me all yon did your best for me i feel sure but she loves you and she does not love me we cannot help these things they come and go without our being able to govern them i am sorry more than sorry but i thank you for your kind offices mademoiselle isaline tells me you said all you could on my behalf and nothing on your own accept my congratulations on having secured the love of the sweetest girl in all switzerland and he shook my hand with an honest heartiness that cost me several more twinges both in the spine and the halfguilty conscience yet after all it was not my fault  monsieur claude i said you are an honest fellow and a noble fellow and i trust you will still let me be your friend  naturally answered m claude in his frank way i have only done my duty you have been the lucky one but i must not bear you a grudge for that though it has cost my heart a hard struggle and as he spoke the tears came for a moment in his honest blue eyes though he tried to brush them away unseen  monsieur claude i said you are too generous to me i can never forgive myself for this  before many days my mother came to hand duly and though her social prejudices were just a trifle shocked at first by the farmhouse with its hams and maize which i had found so picturesque i judged rightly that isaline would soon make an easy conquest of her my mother readily admitted that my accent had improved audibly to the naked ear that isalines manners were simply perfect that she was a dear pretty captivating little thing and that on the whole she saw no objections save one possible one to my marriage of course charlie she said the clairons are protestants because otherwise i could never think of giving my consent  this was a poser in its way for though i knew the village lay just on the borderland and some of the people were catholics while others were reformed i had not the remotest notion to which of the two churches isaline belonged upon my soul mother dear i said it has never struck me to inquire into isalines private abstract opinion on the subject of the popes infallibility or the geneva confession you see after all it could hardly be regarded as an important or authoritative one however ill go at once and find out  happily as it turned out the clairons were reformed and so my mothers one objection fell to the ground immediately m clairons inquiries were also satisfactory and the final result was that isaline and i were to be quietly married before the end of the summer the good father had a nice little vineyard estate at pic de la baume which he proposed i should undertake to cultivate and my mother waited to see us installed in one of the prettiest little toy châlets to be seen anywhere at the villeneuve end of the lovely lake a happier or sweeter bride than isaline i defy the whole world now or ever to produce  from the day of our wedding almost isaline made it the business of her life to discover a fitting wife for good m claude and in the end she succeeded in discovering i will freely admit since isaline is not jealous the second prettiest and second nicest girl in the whole pays de vaud and what is more she succeeded also in getting m claude to fall head over ears in love with her at first sight to propose to her at the end of a week and to be accepted with effusion by annette herself and with coldness by her papa who thought the question of means a trifle unsatisfactory but isaline and i arranged that claude should come into partnership in our vineyard business on easy terms and give up schoolmastering for ever and the consequence is that he and his wife have now got the companion châlet to ours and between our two local connections in switzerland and england we are doing one of the best trades in the new export wine traffic of any firm along the lake of course we have given up growing yvorne except for our own use confining ourselves entirely to a highpriced vintagewine with very careful culture for our english business and i take this opportunity of recommending our famous phylloxeraproof white pic de la baume london agents  but isaline says that looks too much like an advertisement so i leave off still i cant help saying that a dearer little wife than isaline or a better partner than claude never yet fell to any mans lot they certainly are an excellent people these vaudois and i think you would say so too if only you knew them as well as i do     professor milliters dilemma   the gospel evangelists were naturally very proud of professor milliter a small and despised sect with not many great not many rich not many noble among them they could comfort themselves at least with the reflection that they numbered in their fold one of the most learned and justly famous of modern english scientific thinkers it is true their place of meeting at mortiscombe was but an upper chamber in a small cottage their local congregation consisted of hardly more than three score members and their nickname among their orthodox churchy neighbours was the very opprobrious and very ridiculous one of the shivering ranters still the gospel evangelists felt it was a great privilege to be permitted the ministrations of so learned and eloquent a preacher as professor milliter the rector of the parish was an oxford ma of the usual decorously stereotyped conventional pattern but in point even of earthly knowledge and earthly consideration said the congregation at patmos chapel he is not worthy to unloose the latchet of our pastors shoe for professor milliter was universally allowed to be the greatest living authority in england on comparative anatomy the rising successor of cuvier and owen and milneedwards and carpenter in the general knowledge of animal structure  mortiscombe as everybody knows is the favourite little suburban wateringplace close by the busy streets and noisy wharves of a great english manufacturing centre it is at mortiscombe that the western counties college of science is situated away from the smoke and bustle of the whirring city and it was in the western counties college of science that cyril milliter ably filled the newly founded chair of comparative anatomy when he was first appointed indeed people grumbled a little at the idea of a professor at the college undertaking every sunday to preach in a common conventicle to a low assembly of vulgar fanatics as in their charitable christian fashion they loved to call the gospel evangelists but cyril milliter was a man of character and determination he had fully made up his own mind upon theological questions and having once cast in his lot with the obscure sect of gospel evangelists to which his parents had belonged before him he was not to be turned aside from his purpose by the coarse gibes of the ordinary public or the cynical incredulity of more cultivated but scarcely more tolerant polite society not a gospel evangelist really and truly you must surely be joking mr milliter young ladies said to him at evening parties with undisguised astonishment why theyre just a lot of ignorant millhands you know who meet together in an upper room somewhere down in fords passage to hear sermons from some ignorant lay preacher  quite so cyril milliter would answer quietly and i am the ignorant lay preacher who has been appointed to deliver those sermons to them i was brought up among the gospel evangelists as a child and now that i am a man my mature judgment has made me still continue among them  mortiscombe is well known to be a very advanced and liberalminded place so after a time people ceased to talk about the curious singularity of cyril milliters sunday occupation all through the week the young professor lectured to his class on dry bones and the other cheerful stockintrade of his own department and on sundays he walked down erect bible in hand to his little meetingroom and there fervently expounded the word as it approved itself to his soul and conscience before the handful of earnest artisans who composed his faithful but scanty congregation a fiery and enthusiastic preacher was cyril milliter devoured with zeal for what seemed to him the right doctrine there is only one thing worth living for in this fallen world he used to say to his little group of attentive hearers and that is truth truth as it reveals itself in the book of nature must be our quest during the working week truth as it reveals itself in the written word must be our quest on these happy blessed seventhday sabbaths there was a high eager light in his eye as he spoke mingled with a clear intellectual honesty in his sharply cut features which gave at once the stamp of reality to that plain profession of his simple manly earnest creed  one other subject however beside the pursuit of truth just at that moment deeply interested cyril milliter and that subject assumed bodily form in the pretty little person of netta leaworthy right in front of cyril as he expounded the word every sunday morning sat a modest demure dimpled english girl with a complexion like a blushing appleblossom and a mouth like the sunny side of a whiteheart cherry she was only the daughter of an intelligent millhand a foreman at one of the great factories in the neighbouring city was dainty whitefingered sweetvoiced little netta but there was a puritan freshness and demureness and simplicity about her that fairly won the heart of the enthusiastic young professor society at mortiscombe had made itself most agreeable to cyril milliter in spite of his heterodoxy as society always does to eligible young bachelors of good education and it had thrown its daughters decorously in his way by asking him to all its dinners dances and athomes with most profuse and urgent hospitality but in spite of all the wiles of the most experienced among societys mothers cyril milliter had positively had the bad taste to fix his choice at last upon nobody better than simple unaffected charming little netta  for one sunny sunday morning after worship cyril had turned out into the fields behind the common for a quiet stroll among the birds and flowers when close by the stile in the upper meadow he came unexpectedly upon netta leaworthy alone upon the grass with her own fancies she was pulling an oxeye daisy carelessly to pieces as he passed and he stopped a minute unperceived beside the hedge to watch her deft fingers taking out one ray after another quickly from the blossom to the words of a foolish childish charm netta blushed crimson when she saw she was observed at that silly pastime and cyril thought to himself he had never seen anything in his life more lovely than the blushing girl at that moment learned and educated as he was he had sprung himself from among the ranks of the many and his heart was with them still rather than with the rich the noble and the mighty i will never marry among the daughters of heth he said to himself gently as he paused beside her i will take to myself rather a wife and a helpmate from among the lords own chosen people  ah miss leaworthy he went on aloud smiling sympathetically at her embarrassment you are following up the last relics of a dying superstition are you one for money two for health three for love and four for wealth is that how the old saw goes i thought so and which of the four blessings now has your daisy promised you i wonder  the tone he spoke in was so very different from that which he had just been using in the chapel at worship that netta felt instinctively what it foreboded and her heart fluttered tremulously as she answered in the quietest voice she could command i havent finished it yet mr milliter i have made five rounds already and have a lot of rays left still in the middle of the daisy  cyril took it from her laughingly and went on with the rhymehis conscience upbraiding him in an undertone of feeling meanwhile for such an unworthy paltering with oldworld superstitiontill he had gone twice round the spell and finished abruptly with three for love love it is he cried gaily a good omen miss leaworthy we none of us love superstition but perhaps after all it is something more than that there may be a hand guiding us from above even in these everyday trifles we must never forget you know that every hair of our heads is numbered  nettas heart fluttered still more violently within her as he looked at her so closely could it be that really in spite of everything the great learned good clever young professor was going to ask her to be his wife netta had listened to him with joy sunday after sunday from his simple platform pulpit and had felt in her heart that no man never expounded the gospel of love as beautifully as he did she had fancied sometimesgirls cannot help fancying be they as modest and retiring as they maythat he really did like her just a little and sheshe had admired and wondered at him from a distance but she could hardly believe even now that that little vague daydream which had sometimes floated faintly before her eyes was going to be actually realized in good earnest she could answer nothing her heart beat so but she looked down to the ground with a flushed and frightened look which was more eloquent in its pretty simplicity than all the resources of the most copious language  cyril milliters mind however was pretty well made up already on this important matter and he had been waiting long for just such an opportunity of asking netta whether she could love him and now even without asking her he could feel at once by some subtle inner sense that his eager question was answered beforehand and that modest maidenly little netta leaworthy was quite prepared to love him dearly  for a moment he stood there looking at her intently and neither of them spoke then netta raised her eyes from the ground for a seconds flash and cyrils glance caught hers one instant before she bent them down again in haste to play nervously with the mangled daisy netta he said the name thrilling through his very marrow as he uttered it netta i love you  she stood irresolute for a while listening to the beating of her own heart and then her eye caught his once more timidly but she spoke never a syllable  cyril took her wee white hand in hisa ladys hand if ever you saw oneand raised it with chivalrous tenderness to his lips netta allowed him to raise it and kiss it without resistance then you will let me love you he asked quickly netta still did not answer but throwing herself back on the bank by the hedgerow began to cry like a frightened child  cyril sat down all tremulous beside her took the white hand unresisted in his and said to her gently oh netta what is this for  then netta answered with an effort through her tears mr milliter mr milliter how can you ever tell me of this  why not netta why not my darling may i not ask you to be my wife will you have me netta  netta looked at him timidly with another blush and said slowly no mr milliter i cannot i must not  why not netta oh why not tell me a reason  because it wouldnt be right because it wouldnt be fair to you because it wouldnt be true of me you ought to marry a ladysome one in your own rank of life you know it would be wrong to tie your future down to a poor nameless nobody like me when you might marrymarryalmost any lady you chose in all mortiscombe  netta you pain me you are wronging me you know i care nothing for such gewgaws as birth or wealth or rank or station i would not marry one of those ladies even if she asked me and as to my own position in life why netta my position is yours my parents were poor godfearing people like your parents and if you will not love me then netta netta i say it solemnly i will never never marry anybody  netta answered never a word but as any other good girl would do in her place once more burst into a flood of tears and looked at him earnestly from her swimming eyes in speechless doubt and trepidation  perhaps it was wrong of cyril milliteron a sunday and in the public pathway toobut he simply put his strong arm gently round her waist and kissed her a dozen times over fervidly without let or hindrance  then netta put him away from her not too hastily but with a lingering hesitation and said once more but mr milliter i can never marry you you will repent of this yourself byandby at your leisure just think how could i ever marry you when i should always be too frightened of you to call you anything but mr milliter  why netta cried the young professor with a merry laugh if thats all youll soon learn to call me cyril  to call you cyril mr milliter oh dear no never why ive looked at you so often in meeting and felt so afraid of you because you were so learned and wise and terrible and im sure i should never learn to call you by your christian name whatever happened  and as you cant do that you wont marry me im delighted to hear it nettadelighted to hear it for if thats the best reason you can conjure up against the match i dont think little one i shall find it very hard to talk you over  but mr milliter are you quite sure you wont regret it yourself hereafter are you quite sure you wont repent when you find society doesnt treat you as it did for my sake are you quite sure nothing will rise up hereafter between us no spectre of class difference or class prejudice to divide our lives and make us unhappy  never cyril milliter answered seizing both her hands in his eagerly and looking up with an instinctive glance to the open heaven above them as witness never netta as long as i live and you live shall any shadow of such thought step in for one moment to put us asunder  and netta too proud and pleased to plead against her own heart any longer let him kiss her once again a lovers kiss and pressed his hand in answer timidly and walked back with him blushing towards mortiscombe his affianced bride before the face of high heaven  when society at mortiscombe first learnt that that clever young professor milliter was really going to marry the daughter of some factory foreman society commented frankly upon the matter according to the various idiosyncrasies and temperaments of its component members some of it was incredulous some of it was shocked some of it was cynical some of it was satirical and some of it shame to say was spitefully free with suggested explanations for such very strange and unbecoming conduct but cyril milliter himself was such a transparently honest and straightforward man that whenever the subject was alluded to in his presence he shamed the cynicism and the spitefulness of society by answering simply yes im going to marry a miss leaworthy a very good and sweet girl the daughter of the foreman at the tube works who is a great friend of mine and a member of my little sunday congregation and somehow when once cyril milliter had said that in his quiet natural way to anybody however cynical the somebody never cared to talk any more gossip thenceforward for ever on the subject of the professors forthcoming marriage  indeed so fully did the young professor manage to carry public sentiment with him in the end that when the weddingday actually arrived almost every carriage in all mortiscombe was drawn up at the doors of the small chapel where the ceremony was performed and young mrs milliter had more callers during the first fortnight after her honeymoon than she knew well how to accommodate in their tiny drawingroom in these matters society never takes any middle course either it disapproves of a mixed marriage altogether in which case it crushes the unfortunate offender sternly under its iron heel or else it rapturously adopts the bride into its own magic circle in which case she immediately becomes a distinct somebody in virtue of the very difference of original rank and is invited everywhere with empressement as a perfect acquisition to the local community this last was what happened with poor simple blushing little netta who found herself after a while so completely championed by all mortiscombe that she soon fell into her natural place in the college circle as if to the manner born all nice girls of whatever class are potentially ladies which is more than one can honestly say for all women of the upper ranks and after a very short time netta became one of the most popular young married women in all mortiscombe when once society had got over its first disappointment because cyril milliter had not rather married one of its own number it took to netta with the greatest cordiality after all there is something so very romantic you know in a gentleman marrying a foremans daughter and something so very nice and liberal too in ones own determination to treat her accordingly in every way like a perfect equal  and yet happy as she was netta could never be absolutely free from a pressing fear a doubt that cyril might not repent his choice and feel sorry in the end for not having married a real lady that fear pursued her through all her little triumph and almost succeeded in making her half jealous of cyril whenever she saw him talking at all earnestly and he was very apt to be earnest with other women they know so much more than i do she thought to herself often he must feel so much more at home with them naturally and be able to talk to them about so many things that he can never possibly talk about with poor little me poor girl it never even occurred to her that from the higher standpoint of a really learned man like cyril milliter the petty smattering of french and strumming of the piano wherein alone these grand girls actually differed from her were mere useless surface accomplishments in no way affecting the inner intelligence or culture which were the only things that cyril regarded in any serious light as worthy of respect or admiration as a matter of fact netta had learnt infinitely more from her bible her english books her own heart and surrounding nature than any of these welleducated girls had learnt from their parrottrained governesses and she was infinitely better fitted than any of them to be a life companion for such a man as cyril milliter  for the first seven or eight months of nettas married life all went smoothly enough with the young professor and his pretty wife but at the end of that time an event came about which gave netta a great deal of unhappiness and caused her for the very first time since she had ever known him to have serious doubts about cyrils affection and this was just how it all happened  one sunday morning in the upper chamber at patmos cyril had announced himself to preach a discourse in opposition to sundry wicked scientific theories which were then just beginning seriously to convulse the little world of religious mortiscombe those were the days when darwins doctrine of evolution had lately managed to filter down little by little to the level of unintelligent society and the inquiring workingmen who made up cyril milliters little congregation in the upper chamber were all eagerly reading the origin of species and the descent of man as for cyril himself in his austere fashion he doubted whether any good could come even of considering such heterodox opinions they were plainly opposed to the truth he held both to the truth as expressed in the written word and to the truth as he himself clearly read it in the great open book of nature this evolution they talked about so glibly was a dream a romance a mere baseless figment of the poor fallible human imagination all the plain facts of science and of revelation were utterly irreconcilable with it and in five years time it would be comfortably dead and buried for ever side by side with a great load of such other vague and hypothetical rubbish he could hardly understand for his part how sensible men could bother their heads about such nonsense for a single moment still as many of his little flock had gone to hear a brilliant young lecturer who came down from london last week to expound the new doctrine at the literary and philosophical institute and as they had been much shaken in their faith by the lecturers sophistical arguments and obvious misrepresentations of scientific principles he would just lay before them plainly what science had to say in opposition to these fantastic and immature theorists so on sunday morning next with bible in one hand and roll of carefully executed diagrams in the other for cyril milliter was no conventional formalist afraid of shocking the sense of propriety in his congregation he went down in militant guise to the upper chamber and delivered a fervent discourse intended to smite the darwinians hip and thigh with the arms of the truthboth scriptural and scientificto slay the sophists outright with the sword of the lord and of gideon  cyril took for his text a single clause from the twentyfirst verse of the first chapter of genesisevery winged fowl after his kind that he said impressively was the eternal and immutable truth upon the matter he would confine his attention that morning entirely to this one aspect of the casethe creation of the class of birds in the beginning the word told us every species of bird had been created as we now see it perfect and fully organized after its own kind there was no room here for their boasted development or their hypothetical evolution the darwinians would fain force upon them some old wifes tale about a monstrous lizard which gradually acquired wings and feathers till at last by some quaint ovidian metamorphosis into such childish heathenism had we finally relapsed it grew slowly into the outward semblance of a crow or an ostrich but that was not what the truth told them on the fourth day of creation simultaneously with the fish and every living creature that moveth in the ocean the waters brought forth fowl that might fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven such on this subject was the plain and incontrovertible statement of the inspired writer in the holy scripture  and now how did science confirm this statement and scatter at once to the winds the foolish brainspun cobwebs of our windy vaporous modern evolutionists these diagrams which he held before him would sufficiently answer that important question he would show them that there was no real community of structure in any way between the two classes of birds and reptiles let them observe the tail the wings the feathers the breastbone the entire anatomy and they would see at once that darwins ridiculous illdigested theory was wholly opposed to all the plain and demonstrable facts of nature it was a very learned discourse certainly very crushing very overwhelming very convincing when you heard one side only and not netta alone but the whole congregation of intelligent inquiring artisans as well was utterly carried away by its logic its clearness and its eloquent rhetoric last of all cyril milliter raised his two white hands solemnly before him and uttered thus his final peroration  in conclusion what proof can they offer us of their astounding assertions he asked almost contemptuously have they a single fact a single jot or tittle of evidence to put in on this matter as against the universal voice of authoritative science from the days of aristotle of linnæus or of cuvier to the days of owen of lyell and of carpenter not one whenever they can show me living or fossil an organism which unites in itself in any degree whatsoever the characteristics of birds and reptilesan organism which has at once teeth and feathers or which has a long lizardlike tail and true wings or which combines the anatomical peculiarities i have here assigned to the one class with the anatomical peculiarities i have here assigned to the other then and then only will i willingly accede to their absurd hypothesis but they have not done it they cannot do it they will never do it a great gulf eternally separates the two classes a vast gap intervenes impassably between them that gulf will never be lessened that gap will never be bridged over until truth is finally confounded with falsehood and the plain facts of nature and the word are utterly forgotten in favour of the miserable inconsistent figments of the poor fallible human imagination  as they walked home from worship that morning netta felt she had never before so greatly admired and wondered at her husband how utterly he had crushed the feeble theory of these fanciful systemmongers how clearly he had shown the absolute folly of their presumptuous and arrogant nonsense netta could not avoid telling him so with a flush of honest pride in her beautiful face and cyril flushed back immediately with conscious pleasure at her wifely trust and confidence but he was tired with the effort he said and must go for a little walk alone in the afternoon a walk among the fields and the downs where he could commune by himself with the sights and sounds of truthtelling nature netta was halfpiqued indeed that he should wish even so to go without her but she said nothing and so after their early dinner cyril started away abstractedly by himself and took the lane behind the village that led up by steep inclines on to the heavy moorland with its fresh bracken and its purple heather  as he walked along hastily his mind all fieryfull of bones and fossils he came at last to the oolite quarry on the broken hillside feeling tired he turned in to rest awhile in the shade on one of the great blocks of building stone hewn out by the workmen and by way of occupation he began to grub away with his knife halfunconsciously as he sat at a long flat slab of slaty shale that projected a little from the sheer face of the fresh cutting as he did so he saw marks of something very like a birds feather on its upper surface the sight certainly surprised him a little birds in the oolite he said to himself quickly its quite impossible birds in the oolite this is quite a new departure besides such a soft thing as a feather could never conceivably be preserved in the form of a fossil  still the queer object interested him languidly by its odd and timely connection with the subject of his morning sermon and he looked at it again a little more closely by jove yes it was a feather not a doubt in the world of that now he could see distinctly the central shaft of a tailquill and the little barbed branches given off regularly on either side of it the shale on which it was impressed was a soft lightbrown mudstone in fact a fragment of lithographic slate exactly like that employed by lithographers for making pictures he could easily see how the thing had happened the bird had fallen into the soft mud long ages since before the shale had hardened and the form of its feathers had been distinctly natureprinted while it was still moist upon its plastic surface but a bird in the oolite that was a real discovery and as the gospel evangelists were no sabbatarians cyril did not scruple in the pursuit of truth to dig away at the thin slab with his knife till he egged it out of the rock by dexterous side pressure and laid it triumphantly down at last for further examination on the big stone that stood before him  gazing in the first delight of discovery at his unexpected treasure he saw in a moment that it was a very complete and exquisitely printed fossil so perfect a pictorial representation of an extinct animal he had never seen before in his whole lifetime and for the first moment or two he had no time to do anything else but admire silently the exquisite delicacy and extraordinary detail of this natural etching but after a minute the professional interest again asserted itself and he began to look more carefully into the general nature of its curious and unfamiliar anatomical structure  as he looked cyril milliter felt a horrible misgiving arise suddenly within him the creature at which he was gazing so intently was not a bird it was a lizard and yetnoit was not a lizardit was a bird whythese are surely feathersyes tail feathersquite unmistakable but they are not arranged in a regular fan the quills stand in pairs one on each side of each joint in a long tail for all the world exactly like a lizards still it must be a bird for see these are wings  and that is certainly a birds claw but heres the head great heavens whats this a jaw with teeth in it cyril milliter leaned back distractedly and held his beating forehead between his two pale hands to most scientific men it would have been merely the discovery of an interesting intermediate organismsomething sure to make the reputation of a comparative anatomist to him it was an awful and sudden blow dealt unexpectedly from the most deadly quarter at all his deepest and most sacred principles religion honour truth the very fundamental basis of the universe itselfall that makes life worth living for all that makes the world endurablewas bound up implicitly that moment for cyril milliter in the simple question whether the shadowy creature printed in faint grey outline on the slab of shaly oolite before him was or was not half bird and half lizard  it may have been foolish of him it may have been wrong it may have been madness almost but at that instant he felt dazzled and stunned by the crushing weight of the blow thus unexpectedly dealt at his whole preconceived theory of things and at his entire mental scheme of science and theology the universe seemed to swim aimlessly before him he felt the solid ground knocked at once from beneath his feet and found himself in one moment suspended alone above an awful abyss a seething and tossing abyss of murky chaos he had pinned all his tottering faith absolutely on that single frail support and now the support had given way irretrievably beneath him and blank atheism nihilism utter nothingness stared him desperately in the face in one minute while he held his head tight between his two palms to keep it from bursting and looked with a dull glazed vacant eye at the ghastly thing before himonly a few indistinct fossil bones but to him the horridest sight he had ever behelda whole world of ideas crowded itself on the instant into his teeming swimming brain if we could compress an infinity of thought into a single second said shelley once that second would be eternity and on the brink of such a compressed eternity cyril milliter was then idly sitting it seemed to him as he clasped his forehead tighter and tighter that the truth which he had been seeking and for which he had been working and fighting so long revealed itself to him now and there at last in concrete form as a visible and tangible lie it was no mere petrified lizard that he saw beneath his eyes but a whole ruined and shattered system of philosophic theology his cosmogony was gone his cosmos itself was dispersed and disjointed creation nay the creator himself seemed to fade away slowly into nonentity before him he beheld dimly an awful vision of a great nebulous mist drifting idly before the angry stormcyclones of the masterless universedrifting without a god or a ruler to guide it bringing forth shapeless monstrosities one after another on its wrinkled surface pregnant with ravine and rapine and cruelty vast powerful illimitable awful but without one ray of light one gleam of love one hope of mercy one hint of divine purpose anywhere to redeem it it was the pessimistic nightmare of a lucretian system translated hastily into terms of cyril milliters own tottering and fading theosophy  he took the thing up again into his trembling hands and examined it a second time more closely no there could be no shadow of a doubt about it his professional skill and knowledge told him that much in a single moment nor could he temporize and palter with the discovery as some of his elder brethren would have been tempted to do his brain was too young and fresh and vigorous and logical not to permit of ready modification before the evidence of new facts come what might he must be loyal to the truth this thing this horrid thing that he held visibly before him was a fact a positive fact a set of real bones representing a real animal that had once lived and breathed and flown about veritably upon this planet of ours and that was yet neither a true bird nor a true lizard but a halfway house and intermediate link between those two now widely divergent classes cyril milliters mind was at once too honest and too intelligent to leave room for any doubts or evasions or prevarications with itself upon that fundamental subject he saw quite clearly and instantly that it was the very thing the possibility of whose existence he had so stoutly denied that selfsame morning and he could not go back upon his own words whenever they show me an organism which unites in itself the characteristics of birds and reptiles then and then only will i accede to their absurd hypothesis the organism he had asked for lay now before him and he knew himself in fact a converted evolutionist encumbered with all the other hideous corollaries which his own peculiar logic had been accustomed to tack on mentally to that hated creed he almost felt as if he ought in pure consistency to go off at once and murder somebody as the practical outcome of his own theories for had he not often boldly asserted that evolutionism was inconsistent with theism and that without theism any real morality or any true rightdoing of any kind was absolutely impossible  at last after long sitting and anxious pondering cyril milliter rose to go home carrying a heavy heart along with him and then the question began to press itself practically upon him what could he ever do with this horrible discovery his first impulse was to dash the thing to pieces against the rock and go away stealthily saying naught about the matter to any man but his inborn reverence for the truth made him shrink back in horror a moment later from this suggestion of satan as he thought itthis wicked notion of suppressing a most important and conclusive piece of scientific evidence his next idea was simply to leave it where it was thus shuffling off the responsibility of publishing it or destroying it upon the next comer who chanced by accident to enter the quarry after all he said to himself hypocritically he wasnt absolutely bound to tell anybody else a word about it he could leave it there and it would be in much the same position as far as science was concerned as it would have been if he hadnt happened to catch sight of it accidentally as it lay that morning in the mother stone but again his conscience told him next moment that such casuistry was dishonest and unworthy he had found the thing and come what might he ought to abide by the awful consequences if he left it lying there in the quarry one of the workmen would probably smash it up carelessly with a blow of his pick tomorrow morningthis unique survivor of a forgotten worldand to abandon it to such a fate as that would be at least as wicked as to break it to pieces himself of set purpose besides being a great deal more sneakish and cowardly no whatever else he did it was at any rate his plain duty to preserve the specimen and to prevent it from being carelessly or wilfully destroyed  on the other hand he couldnt bear either to display it openly and thereby become as the matter envisaged itself to his mind a direct preacher of evolutionismthat is to say of irreligion and immorality with what face could he ever rise and exhibit at a scientific meeting this evident proof that the whole universe was a black chaos a gross materialistic blunder a festering mass of blank corruption without purpose soul or informing righteousness his entire moral being rose up within him in bitter revolt at the bare notion of such coldblooded treachery to give a longwinded latin classificatory name forsooth to a thing that would destroy the faith of ages at last after long pondering he determined to carry the slab carefully home inside his coat and hide it away sedulously for the present in the cupboard of his little physiological laboratory he would think the matter over he would take time to consider he would ask humbly for light and guidance but of whom well well at any rate there was no necessity for precipitate action to cyril milliters excited fancy the whole future of human thought and belief seemed bound up inextricably at that moment in the little slab of lithographic slate that lay before him and he felt that he need be in no hurry to let loose the demon of scepticism and sin as it appeared to him into the peaceful midst of a still happily trusting and unsuspecting humanity  he put his hand into his pocket casually to pull out his handkerchief for a covering to the thing and as he did so his fingers happened to touch the familiar clasp of his little pocket bible the touch thrilled him strangely and inspired him at once with a fresh courage after all he had the truth there also and he couldnt surely be doing wrong in consulting its best and most lasting interests it was for the sake of the truth that he meant for the present to conceal his compromising fossil so he wrapped up the slab as far as he was able in his handkerchief and hid it away rather clumsily under the left side of his coat it bulged a little no doubt but by keeping his arm flat to his side he was able to cover it over decently somehow thus he walked back quickly to mortiscombe feeling more like a thief with a stolen purse in his pocket than he had ever before felt in the whole course of his earthly existence  when he reached his own house he would not ring lest netta should run to open the door for him and throw her arms round him and feel the horrid thing how could he show it even to netta after this mornings sermon but he went round to the back door opened it softly and glided as quietly as he could into the laboratory not show it to nettathat was bad he had always hitherto shown her and told her absolutely everything how about the truth he was doing this he believed for the truths sake and yet the very first thing that it imposed upon him was the necessity for an ugly bit of unwonted concealment not without many misgivings but convinced on the whole that he was acting for the best he locked the slab of oolite up hurriedly and furtively in the corner cupboard  he had hardly got it safely locked up out of sight and seated himself as carelessly as he could in his easy chair when netta knocked softly at the door she always knocked before entering by force of habit for when cyril was performing delicate experiments it often disturbed him or spoilt the result to have the door opened suddenly netta had seen him coming and wondered why he had slunk round by the back door now she wondered still more why he did not report himself as he used to call it by running to kiss her and announce his return  come in he said gravely in answer to the knock and netta entered  cyril jumped up and kissed her tenderly but her quick womans eye saw at once that there was something serious the matter you didnt ring cyril darling she said half reproachfully and you didnt come to kiss your wifie  no cyril answered trying to look quite at his ease a thing at which the most innocent man in the world is always the worst possible performer i was in a hurry to get back here as there was something in the way of my work i wanted particularly to see about  why cyril netta answered in surprise your work its sunday  cyril blushed crimson so it is he answered hastily upon my word id quite forgotten it goodness gracious netta shall i have to go down to meeting and preach again to those people this evening  preach again of course you will cyril you always do dear dont you  cyril started back with a sigh i cant go tonight netta darling he said wearily i cant preach tonight im too tired and out of sortsim not at all in the humour for preaching we must send down somehow or other and put off the brethren  netta looked at him in blank dismay she felt in her heart there was something wrong but she wouldnt for worlds ask cyril what it was unless he chose to tell her of his own accord still she couldnt help reading in his eyes that there was something the matter and the more she looked into them the more poor cyril winced and blinked and looked the other way in the vain attempt to seem unconcerned at her searching scrutiny ill send mary down with a little written notice she said at last to fix on the door mr milliter regrets he will be unable through indisposition to attend worship at patmos this evening will that do cyril  yes he answered uneasily thatll do darling i dont feel quite well im afraid somehow after my unusual exertions this morning  netta looked at him hard but said nothing  they went into the drawingroom and for a while they both pretended to be reading then the maid brought up the little teatray and cyril was obliged to lay down the book he had been using as a screen for his crimson face and to look once more straight across the room at netta  cyril the little wife began again as she took over his cup of tea to his easy chair by the bow window and set it down quietly on the tiny round table beside him where did you go this afternoon  on the downs darling  and whom did you meet there  nobody netta  nobody cyril  no nobody  netta knew she could trust his word implicitly and asked him no further still a dreadful cloud was slowly rising up before her she felt too much confidence in cyril to be really jealous of him in any serious way but her fears womanlike took that personal shape in which she fancied somebody or something must be weaning away her husbands love gradually from her had he seen some girl at a distance on the downs some one of the mortiscombe ladies with whom perhaps he had had some little flirtation in the days gone bysome lady whom he thought now would have made him a more suitable companionable wife than poor little netta had he wandered about alone saying to himself that he had thrown himself away and sacrificed his future prospects for a pure romantic boyish fancy had he got tired of her little simple homely ways had he come back to the house heartsick and disappointed and gone by himself into the working laboratory on purpose to avoid her why was he so silent why did he seem so preoccupied why would he not look her straight in the face cyril could have done nothing to be ashamed of that netta felt quite sure about but why did he behave as if he was ashamed of himselfas if there was something or other in his mind he couldnt tell her  meanwhile poor cyril was not less unhappy though in a very different and more masculine fashion he wasnt thinking so much of netta except when she looked at him so hard and curiously but of the broken gods of his poor little scientific and theological pantheon he was passing through a tempest of doubt and hesitation compelled to conceal it under the calm demeanour of everyday life that horrid wicked systemdestroying fossil was never for a moment out of his mind at times he hated and loathed the godless thing with all the concentrated force of his ardent nature ought he to harbour it under the shelter of his hospitable roof ought he to give it the deadly chance of bearing its terrible witness before the eyes of an innocent world ought he not to get up rather in the dead of night and burn it to ashes or grind it to powdera cruel wicked deceiving antiscriptural fossil that it was then again at other times the love of truth came uppermost once more to chill his fiery indignation could the eternal hills lie to him could the evidence of his own senses deceive him was not the creature there palpably and visibly present a veritable record of real existence and ought he not loyally and reverently to accept its evidence at whatever violence to his own most cherished and sacred convictions if the universe was in reality quite other than what he had always hitherto thought it if the doctrines he had first learned and then taught as certain and holy were proved by plain facts to be mere ancient and fading delusions was it not his bounden duty manfully to resign his lifelong daydream and to accept the truth as it now presented itself to him by the infallible evidence of mute nature that cannot possibly or conceivably lie to us  the evening wore away slowly and cyril and netta said little to one another each absorbed in their own thoughts and doubts and perplexities at last bedtime came but not much sleep for either cyril lay awake looking out into the darkness which seemed now to involve the whole physical and spiritual world seeing in fancy a vast chaotic clashing universe battling and colliding for ever against itself without one ray of hope or light or gladness left in it anywhere netta lay awake too wondering what could have come over cyril and seeing nothing but a darkened world in which cyrils love was taken away from her and all was cold and dull and cheerless each in imagination had lost the keystone of their own particular special universe  throughout the next week cyril went on mechanically with his daily work but struggling all the time against the dreadful doubt that was rising now irresistibly within him whenever he came home from college he went straight to his laboratory locked the door and took the skeleton out of the cupboard it was only a very small skeleton indeed and a fossil one at that but if it had been a murdered man and he the murderer it could hardly have weighed more terribly than it actually did upon cyril milliters mind and conscience yet it somehow fascinated him and in all his spare time he was working away at the comparative anatomy of his singular specimen he had no doubts at all about it now he knew it perfectly for what it wasan intermediate form between birds and reptiles meanwhile he could not dare to talk about it even to netta and netta though the feeling that there was something wrong somewhere deepened upon her daily would not say a word upon the subject to cyril but she had discovered one thingthat the secret whatever it was lay closed up in the laboratory cupboard and as her fears exaggerated her doubts she grew afraid at last almost to enter the room which held that terrible unspeakable mystery  thus more than a fortnight passed away and cyril and netta grew daily less and less at home with one another at last one evening when cyril seemed gloomier and more silent than ever netta could bear the suspense no longer rising up hastily from her seat without one word of warning she went over to her husband with a halfdespairing gesture of alarm and flinging her arms around him with desperate force she cried passionately through her blinding tears cyril cyril cyril you must tell me all about it  about what darling cyril asked trembling with halfconscious hypocrisy for he knew in his heart at once what she meant as well as she did  cyril she cried again looking him straight in the face steadily you have a secret that you will not tell me  darling he answered smoothing her hair tenderly with his hand it is no secret it is nothing you would think nothing of it if you knew its the merest trifle possible but i cant tell you i can not tell you  but you must cyril netta cried bitterly you had never any secret from me i know till that dreadful sunday when you went out alone and wouldnt even let me go with you then you came back stealthily by the back door and never told me and you brought something with you of that im certain and youve got the something locked up carefully in the laboratory cupboard i dont know how i found it all out exactly but i have found it out and i cant bear the suspense any longer and so you must tell me all about it oh cyril dear cyril do do tell me all about it  cyril falteredfaltered visibly but even so he dare not tell her his own faith was going too terribly fast already could he let hers go too in one dreadful collapse and confusion it never occurred to him that the fossil would mean little or nothing to poor netta he couldnt help thinking of it as though every human being on earth would regard it with the same serious solemnity and awe as he himself did i cannot tell you netta he said very gently but very firmly no i dare not tell you some day perhaps but not now i must not tell you  the answer roused all nettas worst fears more terribly than ever for a moment she almost began to doubt cyril in her terror and perplexity she was still too proud to ask him further and she went back from her husband feeling stung and repulsed by his cruel answer and made as though she did not care at all for his strange refusal she took up a scientific paper from the heap on the table and pretended to begin reading it cyril rose and tried to kiss her but she pushed him away with an impatient gesture never she said haughtily never cyril until you choose to tell me your private secret  cyril sank back gloomily into his chair folded his hands into one another in a despondent fashion and looked hard at the vacant ceiling without uttering a single word  as netta held the paper aimlessly before her that minute by the merest chance her eye happened to fall upon her husbands name printed in the article that lay open casually at the middle page even at that supreme moment of chagrin and torturing doubt she could not pass by cyrils name in print without stopping to read what was said about him as she did so she saw that the article began by hostile criticism of the position he had taken up on the distinction between birds and reptiles in a recent paper contributed to the transactions of the linnæan society she rose from her place silently put the paper into his hands and pointed to the paragraph with her white forefinger but never uttered a single syllable cyril took it from her mechanically and read on not half thinking what he was reading till he came to a passage which attracted his attention perforce because it ran somewhat after this fashion  professor milliter would have written a little less confidently had he been aware that almost while his words were passing through the press a very singular discovery bearing upon this exact subject was being laid before the academy of sciences at berlin dr hermann von meyer has just exhibited to that body a slab of lithographic slate from the famous oolitic quarry at solenhofen containing the impression of a most remarkable organism which he has named archæopteryx lithographica this extraordinary creature has the feathers of a bird with the tail of a lizard it is entirely destitute of an os coccygis it has apparently two conical teeth in the upper jaw and its foot is that of a characteristic percher and so forth for more than a column full of those minute anatomical points which cyril had himself carefully noticed in the anatomy of his own english specimen  as he read and reread that awful paragraph netta looking on at him half angrily all the time he grew more and more certain every moment that the german professor had simultaneously made the very same discovery as himself he drew a long sigh of relief the worst was over the murder was out then it was not to be he who should bear the responsibility of publishing to the world the existence and peculiarities of that wicked and hateful fossil a coldblooded german geologist had done so already with no more trace of remorse and punctiliousness in the business than if it had been the merest old oystershell or spider or commonplace cockroach he could hardly keep in his excited feelings the strain of personal responsibility at least was lightened and though the universe remained as black as ever he could at any rate wash his own hands of the horrid creature unmanly as it may seem he burst suddenly into tears and stepped across the room to throw his arms round nettas neck to his surprisefor he scarcely remembered that she could not yet realize the situationnetta repelled him with both hands stretched angrily before her palm outwards  netta he said imploringly recognizing immediately what it was she meant come with me now into the laboratory and see what it is that i have got in the cupboard  netta all trembling and wondering followed him in a perfect flutter of doubt and anxiety cyril slowly unlocked the cupboard then unfastened a small drawer and last of all took out a long flat object wrapped up mysteriously in a clean handkerchief he laid it down reluctantly upon the table and netta amazed and puzzled beheld a small smooth slab of soft claystone scored with what seemed like the fossil marks of a few insignificant bones and feathers the little woman drew a long breath  well cyril she said interrogatively looking at it in a dubious mood  why netta cried her husband half angry at her incomprehensible calmness dont you see what it is its terrible terrible  a fossil cyril isnt it a bird i should say  no not a bird netta nor yet a lizard but that halfway thing that intermediate link you read about just now over yonder in the paper  but why do you hide it cyril you havent taken it anywhere from a museum  oh netta dont you understand dont you see the implications its a creature half bird and half reptile and it proves absolutely proves netta beyond the faintest possibility of a doubt that the evolutionists are quite rightquite scientific and if it once comes to be generally recognized i dont know im sure what is ever to become of religion and of science we shall every one of us have to go and turn evolutionists  it is very sad to relate but poor netta her pentup feelings all let loose by the smallness of the evil as it seemed to her actually began to smile and then to laugh merrily in the very face of this awful revelation then you havent really got tired of me cyril she cried eagerly youre not in love with somebody else you dont regret ever having married me  cyril stared at her in mute surprise what possible connection could these questions have with the momentous principles bound up implicitly in the natureprinted skeleton of archæopteryx lithographica it was a moment or so before he could grasp the association of ideas in her womanly little brain and understand the real origin of her natural wifelike fears and hesitations  oh cyril she said again after a minutes pause looking at the telltale fossil with another bright girlish smile is it only that only that wretched little creature oh darling i am so happy and she threw her arms around his neck of her own accord and kissed him fervently twice or thrice over  cyril was pleased indeed that she had recovered her trust in him so readily but amazed beyond measure that she could look at that horrible antiscriptural fossil absolutely without the slightest symptom of flinching what a blessed thing it must be he thought to himself to be born a woman heres the whole universe going to rack and ruin physically and spiritually before her very eyes and she doesnt care a fig as soon as shes quite satisfied in her own mind that her own particular husband hasnt incomprehensibly fallen in love with one or other of the mortiscombe ladies it was gratifying to his personal feelings doubtless but it wasnt at all complimentary one must admit to the general constitution of the universe  what ought i to do with it netta he asked her simply pointing to the fossil glad to have any companionship even if so unsympathetic in his hitherto unspoken doubts and difficulties  do with it why show it to the geological society of course cyril its the truth you know dearest and why on earth should you wish to conceal it the truth shall make you perfect  cyril looked at her with mingled astonishment and admiration oh netta he answered sighing profoundly if only i could take it as quietly as you do if only i had faith as a grain of mustardseed but i have been reduced almost to abject despair by this crushing piece of deadly evidence it seems to me to proclaim aloud that the evolutionists are all completely right at bottom and that everything we have ever loved and cherished and hoped for turns out an utter and absolute delusion  then i should say you were still bound for all that to accept the evidence said netta quietly however for my part i may be very stupid and silly and all that sort of thing you know but it doesnt seem to me as if it really mattered twopence either way  cyril looked at her again with fresh admiration that was a point of view that had not yet even occurred to him as within the bounds of possibility he had gone on repeating over and over again to his congregation and to himself that if evolution were true religion and morality were mere phantoms until at last he had ceased to think any other proposition on the subject could be even thinkable that a man might instantly accept the evidence of his strange fossil and yet be after all an indifferent honest citizen in spite of it was an idea that had really never yet presented itself to him and he blushed now to think that in spite of all his frequent professions of utter fidelity netta had proved herself at last more loyal to the truth in both aspects than he himself had done her simple little womanly faith had never faltered for a moment in either direction  that night was a very happy one for netta it was a somewhat happier one than of late even for cyril he had got rid of the cloud between himself and his wife he had made at least one person a confidante of his horrid secret and above all he had learnt that some bold and ruthless german geologist had taken off his own shoulders the responsibility of announcing the dreadful discovery  still it was some time before cyril quite recovered from the gloomy view of things generally into which his chance unearthing of the strange fossil had temporarily thrown him two things mainly contributed to this result  the first was that a few sundays later he made up his mind he ought in common honesty to exhibit his compromising fossil to the congregation in the upper chamber and make a public recantation of his recent confident but untenable statements he did so with much misgiving impelled by a growing belief that after all he must trust everything implicitly to the truth it cost him a pang too to go back upon his own deliberate words so lately spoken but he faced it out for the truths sake like an honest man as he had always tried to besave for those few days when the wicked little slab of slate lay carefully hidden away in the inmost recesses of the laboratory cupboard to his immense surprise once more the brethren seemed to think little more of it than netta herself had done perhaps they were not so logical or thoroughgoing as the young professor perhaps they had more of unquestioning faith perhaps they had less of solid dogmatic leaven but in any case they seemed singularly little troubled by the new and startling geological discovery however they were all much struck by the professors honesty of purpose in making a straightforward recantation of his admitted blunder he had acted honest and honourable they said like a man and they liked him better for it in the end than if hed preached and hedged and shillyshallied to them about it for a whole year of sundays together now the mere fact that his good congregation didnt mind the fossil much reacted healthily on cyril milliter who began to suspect that perhaps after all he had been exaggerating the religious importance of speculative opinions on the precise nature of the cosmogony  the second thing was that shortly after the great discovery he happened to make the acquaintance of the brilliant young evolutionist from london and found to his surprise that on the whole most of their opinions agreed with remarkable unanimity true the young evolutionist was not a gospel evangelist and did not feel any profound interest in the literal or mystical interpretation of the first chapter of genesis but in all essentials he was as deeply spiritual as cyril milliter himself and the more cyril saw of him and talked with him the more did he begin to suspect that the truth may in reality have many facets and that all men may not happen to see it in exactly the selfsame aspect it dawned upon him slowly that all the illumination in the world might not be entirely confined to the narrow circle of the gospel evangelists even those terrible evolutionists themselves it seemed were not necessarily wholly given over to cutting throats or robbing churches they might have their desires and aspirations their faith and their hope and their charity exactly like other people only perhaps in a slightly different and more definite direction in the end cyril and his former bugbear became bosom friends and both worked together amicably side by side in the selfsame laboratory at the college of science  to this day professor milliter still continues to preach weekly to the gospel evangelists though both he and they have broadened a good deal in a gradual and almost imperceptible fashion with the general broadening of ideas and opinions that has been taking place by slow degrees around us during the last two decades his views are no doubt a good deal less dogmatic and a good deal more wide and liberal now than formerly netta and he live happily and usefully together and over the mantelpiece of his neat little study in the cottage at mortiscombe stands a slab of polished slate containing a very interesting oolitic fossil of which the professor has learnt at last to be extremely proud the first discovered and most perfect existing specimen of archæopteryx lithographica he can hardly resist a quiet smile himself nowadays when he remembers how he once kept that harmless piece of pictured stone wrapt up carefully in a folded handkerchief in his laboratory cupboard for some weeks together as though it had been a highly dangerous and very explosive lump of moral dynamite calculated to effect at one fell swoop the complete religious and ethical disintegration of the entire divine universe

that he could have wished for louiea young barrister with no briefs to speak of even if he ekes out his petty professional income with literary work cant afford to spend very much in the way of

to be sure she was looking her very sweetest and prettiest flushed a little with unwonted excitement in the glow of an innocent girlish flirtation as she stood there talking to hugh ogilvie in the dim

sudden droop of her long eyelashes above her great open hazelgrey eyes  hughs saying something pretty to louie im sure harry thought to himself with a smile of pleasure as he looked across at the sweet little graceful girlish figure i can see it at once in her face and in her hands playing so nervously with the edge of her fan dear child how she lets one read in her eyes and cheeks her every tiny passing feeling her pretty wee mouth is like an open book hughs telling her confidentially now that shes the belle of the evening and so she is theres not a doubt about it not a girl in the place fit to hold a candle to my louie especially when she blushesshes sweet when she blushes now shes colouring up again by jove yes he must be positively making love to her theres nothing i enjoy so much as seeing louie enjoying herself and being made much of too many girls bright young girls when they marry early as louie has done settle down at once into household drudges and never seem to get any happiness worth mentioning out of their lives in any way i wont let it be so with louie dear little soul she shall flit about as much as she likes and enjoy herself as the fancy seizes her like a little butterfly just like a butterfly i love to see it and he hugged one clasped hand upon the other silently  whence the astute reader will readily infer that harry pallant was still more or less in love with his wife louie although they had been married for five years and upwards  presently louie and hugh went back into the ballroom and for the first time harry noticed that the music had struck up some minutes since for the next waltz for which he was engaged to hughs sister mrs wetherby ferrand he started hastily at the accusing sound for in watching his wife he had forgotten his partner returning at once in search of mrs ferrand he found her sitting disconsolate in a corner waiting for him and looking as was natural not altogether pleased at his ungallant treatment  so youve come at last harry mrs ferrand said with evident pique they had been friends from childhood and knew one another well enough to use both their christian names and the critical freedom of old intimacy  yes dora ive come at last harry answered with an apologetic bow as he offered her his arm and im so sorry ive kept you waiting but the fact is i was watching louie shes been dancing with hugh and she looks perfectly charming i think this evening  mrs ferrand bit her lip she does she answered coldly with half a pout and you were so busy watching her it seems you forgot all about me harry  harry laughed it was pardonable under the circumstances you know dora he said lightly if it had been the other way now louie might have had some excuse for being jealous  who said i was jealous mrs ferrand cried colouring up jealous of you indeed what right have i got to be jealous of you harry she may dance with hugh all night long for all i care for it shes danced with him now three times already and i dare say shell dance with him as often again you men are too conceited you always think every woman on earth is just madly in love with you  my dear child harry answered with a faint curl of his lip you quite misunderstand me heaven knows i at least am not conceited what on earth have i got to be conceited of i never thought any woman was in love with me in all my life except louie and what in the name of goodness even she can find to fall in love with in mea fellow like mepositively passes my humble comprehension  shes going to dance the next waltz but one with hugh he tells me mrs ferrand replied drily as if changing the conversation  is she hughs an excellent fellow harry answered carelessly resting for a moment a little aside from the throng and singling out louie at once with his eye among the whirling dancers ah there she is over yonder do you seethere with that captain vandeleur how sweetly she dances dora and how splendidly she carries herself i declare shes the very gracefullest girl in all the room here  mrs ferrand dropped half a mock curtsey a polite partner would have said bar one harry she murmured petulantly how awfully in love with her you are my dear boy it must be nice to have a man so perfectly devoted to one and i dont believe either she half appreciates you some women would give their very eyes do you know to be as much loved by any man as shes loved by you harry and she looked at him significantly  well but ferrand  ah poor wetherby yes yes of course of course i quite agree with you youre always right harry poor wetherby is the worthiest of men and in his own way does his very best no doubt to make me happy but there is devotion and devotion harry il y a fagots et fagots poor dear wetherby is no more capable  dora dora for heavens sake i beg of you no confidences as a legal man i must deprecate all confidences otherwise than strictly in the way of business what got us first into this absurd groove i wonder oh yes i rememberlouies dancing shall we go on again you must have got your breath by this time why whats the matter dora you look quite pale and flurried  nothing harry nothingnothing i assure you not quite so tight please go quietlyim rather tired yes thatll do thank you the rooms so very hot and close this evening i can hardly breathe i feel so stifled tightlacing i suppose poor dear wetherby would say i declare louie isnt dancing any longer how very odd shes gone back again now to sit by hugh there what on earth can be the reason i wonder  captain vandeleurs such an awfully bad waltzer you know harry answered unconcernedly i dare say she was glad enough to make some excuse or other to get away from him the rooms so very hot and stifling  oh you think so and dora ferrand gave a quiet little smile as one who sees clearly below the surface i dare say and shes not sorry either to find some good reason for another ten minutes chat with hugh i fancy  but harry in his innocence never noticed her plain insinuation hes as blind as a bat dora ferrand thought to herself half contemptuously just like poor dear wetherby poor dear wetherby never suspects anything and that girl louie doesnt half appreciate harry either just like me i suppose with that poor dear stupid old stockbroker stockbroker indeed what in the name of all thats sensible could ever have induced me to go and marry a blind old stick of a wealthy stockbroker if harry and i had only our lives to live againbut there whats the use of bothering ones head about it weve only got one life apiece and that we generally begin by making a mull of   ii  three days later harry pallant went down as usual to his rooms in the temple and set to work upon his daily labour the first envelope he opened of the batch upon his table was from the editor of the young peoples monitor it contained the weeks correspondence harry pallant glanced over the contents hastily and singled out a few enclosures from the big budget with languid curiosity  of course everybody knows the young peoples monitor it is one of the most successful among the penny weeklies and in addition to its sensational stories and moral essays it gives advice gratis to all and sundry in its correspondence columns upon every conceivable subject that our common peccant or ignorant humanity can possibly inquire about now harry pallant happened to be the particular person employed by the editor of this omniscient journal to supply the answers to the weekly shoals of anxious interrogators de omni scibili his legal learning came in handy for the purpose and being a practised london journalist as well his knowledge of life stood him in good stead at this strange piece of literary craftsmanship but the whole affair was in strict confidence as the monitor announced it was a point of honour between himself and the editor that the secret of the correspondence column should be jealously guarded from all and several so harry pallant accustomed lawyerlike to keeping secrets had never mentioned his connection with the monitor in this matter even to louie it came as part of his weeks work at his chambers in the temple and it was duly finished and sent off to press without note or comment on the same day in true businesslike barrister fashion  the first letter that harry opened and listlessly glanced through with his experienced eye was one of the staple monitor kindstella or euphemia had quarrelled in a moment of pique with her lover and was now dying of anxiety to regain his affections harry scribbled a few words of kindly chaff and sound advice in reply upon a blank sheet of virgin foolscap and tossed the torn fragments of letter number one into the capacious mouth of his wastepaper basket  the second letter requested the editors candid opinion upon a short set of amateur verses therewith enclosed harrys candid opinion muttered to himself beneath his moustache was too unparliamentary for insertion in full but he toned its verbal expression down a little in his written copy and passed on hastily to the others in order  camilla would like to know in strict confidence thrice underlined what is the editors opinion of her style of handwriting a drapers assistant is desirous to learn how the words heterogeneous and beethoven are usually pronounced in the best society senex having had a slight difference as to the buttered toast with his present landlady in whose house he has lodged for forty years would be glad of any advice as to how at his age he is to do without her h j k has just read with much surprise a worthless pamphlet proving that the inhabitants of the northern divisions of staffordshire and warwickshire are the lost ten tribes of israel and cannot imagine how this reckless assertion can be scripturally reconciled with the plain statements of the prophet habakkuk which show that the descendants of manasseh are really to be looked for in the county of sligo and so forth though every variety of male feebleness and feminine futility in answer to all which harry turned off his hasty rejoinder with the dexterous ease acquired of long practice and familiar experience  at last he came in due course to a small white envelope of better paper and style than the others marked 17 in red pencil on the back in the formal hand of the systematic editor he turned it over with mechanical carelessness to his immense amusement and no little surprise he saw at once by the writing of the address that the note came from his own louie  what could louie have to ask of advice or information from the anonymous editor of the young peoples monitor  he stood for a moment with a quiet smile playing about his lips thinking to himself that he had often wondered whether he should ever get a letter thus incognito from any person among his private acquaintances and now he had got one from louie herself how very funny how truly ridiculous and how odd too that she shouldnt even have told him beforehand she was going to write for counsel or assistance to the young peoples monitor  and then a strange doubt flashed idly for a moment across his minda doubt that he felt immediately ashamed of what possible subject could there be on which louie could want advice and aid from an editor a stranger an unknown and anonymous impersonal entity rather than from him harry her own husband her natural guide assistant and counsellor it was odd very oddnay even disquieting harry hardly knew what to make of the unexpected episode  but next moment he had dismissed his doubts though he stood still toying with the unopened envelope he was half afraid to look inside it louie had only written he felt sure about some feminine trifle or other some foolish point of petty etiquettehow to fold napkins mitrefashion or whether ppo cards should be turned down at the upper right or the lower lefthand cornersome absurd detail about which she would have laughed outright at his personal opinion but would defer at once to the dignity of print and the expressed verdict of the young peoples monitor so great is the power of printers ink that if you say a thing face to face your own wife even will take no notice of it but if you set it up in type anonymously she and the world at large to boot will treat it like an inspired oracle in stone fallen down direct from the seventh heaven  and yet somehow harry pallant couldnt make up his mind at once to break open the tiny envelope of that mysterious incomprehensible letter  at last he broke it and read it hurriedly as he did so a terrible ominous pang came across his heart and the writing familiar as it was swam illegibly in dancing lines before his strained and aching vision       dear mr editor the letter began somewhat shakily you give      your advice and assistance to many people will you give it to me      will you help me will you save me       this is my position i was married young to a man i did not love      but liked and respected i thought love would come afterwards it      never came on the contrary the longer i have lived with him the      less i care for him not that he is unkind to mehe is good enough      and generous enough in all conscience but he inspires me with no      affection and no enthusiasm till lately this was all i felt i did      not love him but i jogged along comfortably somehow       now however i find to my dismay that i am in lovenot with him      but with another man a hundred times more congenial to my tastes      and feelings in every way i have done no wrong but i think of him      and live in him all my time i cannot for a moment dismiss him from      my thoughts oh what am i to do tell me help me       i can never love my husbandof that i am certain i can never      leave off loving the otherof that i am still more confident can      you advise me can you relieve me this torture is too terrible it      is killing mekilling me    yours ever in strict confidence   egeria  harry pallant gazed at that awful accusing letter in blank horror and speechless bewilderment he could not even cry or groan he could not utter a word or shed a tear the shock was so sudden so crushing so unexpected so irretrievable  he had never till that moment in the faintest degree doubted that louie loved him as he loved herdevotedly distractedly  why that very morning before he came away on his journey to the temple louie had kissed him so tenderly and affectionately and called him darling and wished he hadnt always to go to that horrid city how the memory stung him  yes that was the hardest thought of all if louie wrote it louie was a hypocrite not only did she not now love himnot only had she never loved him but lowest depth of misery and shame she had pretended to love him when in her heart of hearts she hated and despised him he couldnt believe it he wouldnt believe it in her own words it was too terrible  if louie wrote it he turned the letter over once more ah yes there was no denying it it was louies handwritinglouies louies his brain reeled but he could not doubt it or palter over it for a moment not even disguisedher very own handwriting it was the seal of doom for him yet he could not even pretend to disbelieve it  he sat there long incapable of realizing the full horror of that crushing destroying annihilating disclosure it was useless trying to realize itthank god for that it so dazed and stunned and staggered and bewildered him that he fell for a time into a sort of hopeless lethargy and felt and saw and thought of nothing  at last he roused himself he must go out he rose from the table by the dingy window took up his hat dreamily in his hand and walked down the stairs out of the gateway and into the full tide of life and bustle in busy fleet street  the cooler air upon his forehead and the sight of so many hurrying active figures sobered and steadied him he walked with rapid strides as far as charing cross station and then back again after that he came into his chambers once more sat down resolutely at his table by himself and began to write in a trembling shaky hand his answer to egeria  how often he had written a different answer to just the same type of tragic little letteran answer of the commonplace conventional morality a small set sermon on the duties of wives and the rights of husbandsas though there was nothing more in that fearful disclosure than the merest fancy and now when at last it touched himself how profoundly awful in their mockery of the truth those baldly respectable answers seemed to him       egeriayour letter shall be treated as you wish in strict      confidence no one but ourselves shall ever know of it you need      not fear that h p will any longer prove a trouble to you by the      time you read this you will have learnt or will shortly learn      that he is not in a position to cause you further discomfort this      is the only intimation you will receive of his intention you will      understand what it all means soon after you read this      communication  he rang the handbell on the table for his boy put the answers into a long blue envelope and said mechanically in a dry voice to the young peoples monitor for press immediately the boy nodded a mute assent and took them off to the office in silent obedience  as soon as he was gone harry pallant locked the door flung himself upon the table with his head buried madly in his arms and sobbed aloud in terrible despondency he had found at least the relief of tears  there was only one comfort he was fully insured and hugh ogilvie was a rich man louie at least would be well provided for he cared for nothing except for louie if louie was happierhappier without him what further need had he got for living  he had never thought before of hugh but now now doras words came back to him at once and he saw it allhe saw it all plainly  heaven be praised they had no children if they had had childrenwell well as things now stood he could do what was best for louies happiness   iii  for the next two days louie could not imagine what sudden change had come so inexplicably over harry pallant he was quite as tender and as gentle as ever but so silent sad and incomprehensible louie coaxed him and petted him in vain the more she made of him the more harry seemed to retreat within himself and the less could she understand what on earth he was thinking of  on the thursday night when harry came back from his work in the city he said to louie in an offhand tone louie i think of running down tomorrow to dear old bilborough  what for darling  well you know ive been fearfully out of sorts latelyworried or somethingand i think three or four days at the seaside would be all the better for meand for you too darling lets go to the red lion louie ive telegraphed down tonight for rooms and i dare sayi shall get rid there of whatevers troubling me  the red lion at bilborough was the hotel at which they had passed their honeymoon and where they had often gone at various times since for their summer holiday louie was delighted at the proposed trip and smoothed her husbands hair softly with her hand  my darling she said im so glad youre going there ive noticed for the last few days you looked fagged and worried but bilboroughs just the right place bilborough always sets you up again  harry smiled a faint unhappy smile ive no doubt he answered evasively i shall leave all my trouble behind at bilborough  they started by the early train next day louie hastily packing their little portmanteau overnight and got down to bilborough before noon as soon as they were fairly settled in at the lion harry kissed his wife tenderly and with a quiet persistence in his voice said on a sudden louie i think i shall go and have a swim before lunchtime  a swim harry so soonalready  yes harry answered with a twitching mouth and looking at her nervously theres nothing like a swim you know louie to wash away the cobwebs of london  well dont be long darling louie said with some undisguised anxiety ive ordered lunch remember for one  for one louie harry cried with a start why for one dearest i dont understand you oh i see how very stupid of me yes yes ill be back by one oclock that is to say if im not back dont you wait lunch for me  he moved uneasily to the door and then he turned back again with a timid glance and drew a newspaper slowly from his pocket ive brought down this mornings young peoples monitor with me louie he said in a tremulous voice after a short pause i know you sometimes like to see it  he watched her narrowly to observe the effect but louie took it from him without a visible tremor oh im so glad harry she said in her natural tone without betraying the least excitement how awfully kind of you to get it for me theres something in it i wanted to see about  something in it she wanted to see about harrys heart stood still for a second within him what duplicity what temerity what a terrible mixture of seeming goodness and perfect composure and yet it was louie and he couldnt help loving her he kissed her once morea long hard kissupon the forehead and went out leaving her there with the paper clasped tightly in her small white fingers though she said nothing he could see that her fingers trembled as she held it yes yes there could be no doubt about it she was eagerly expecting the answerthe fatal answerthe answer to egeria in the correspondence column   iv  louie stood long at the window with the paper still clutched eagerly in her hand afraid to open it and read the answer and yet longing to know what the young peoples monitor had to say in reply to egeria so she watched harry go down to the bathing machines and enter oneit was still early in the season and he had no need to wait and then she watched them turning the windlass and letting it run down upon the shelving beach and then she watched harry swimming out and stemming the waves in his bold manly fashionhe was a splendid swimmer and after that unable any longer to restrain her curiosity she tore the paper open with her finger and glanced down the correspondence column till she reached the expected answer to egeria  she read it over wondering and trembling with a sudden awful sense of the editors omniscience as she saw the letters h pher husbands initialsharry pallant h p what could he mean by it and then a vague dread came across her soul what could egeria and the editor of the young peoples monitor have to do with harry pallant  she read it over again and again how terrifying how mysterious how dimly incomprehensible who on earth could have told the editorthat impersonal entitythat egerias letter had any connection with her own husband harry pallant and yet he must have known itevidently known it and she herself had never suspected the allusion yes yes it was clear to her now the man about whom egeria had written was harryharryharryharry could it have been that that had so troubled him of late she couldnt bear to distrust harry but it must have been that and nothing else harry was in love with dora ferrand or if not dora ferrand was in love with harry and harry knew it and was afraid he might yield to her and had ran away from her accordingly he had come to bilborough on purpose to escape herto drag himself away from herto try to forget her oh harry harryand she loved him so truly to think he should deceive herto think he should keep anything from her it was too terribletoo terrible she couldnt bear to think it and yet the evidence forced it upon her  but how did the editor ever come to know about it and what was this mysterious awful message that he gave dora about harry pallant  you need not fear that h p will any longer prove a trouble to you why did harry mean to leave london altogether was he afraid to trust himself there with dora ferrand did he fear that she would steal his heart in spite of him oh dora dora the shameless creature when louie came to think it all over her effrontery and her wickedness were absolutely appalling  she sat there long turning the paper over helplessly in her hand reading its words every way but the right way pondering over what harry had said to her that morning putting her own interpretation upon everything and forgetting even to unpack her things and make herself ready for lunch in the coffeeroom  presently a crowd upon the beach below languidly attracted her passing attention the coastguard from the lookout was gesticulating frantically and a group of sailors were seizing in haste upon a boat on the foreshore they launched it hurriedly and pulled with all their might outward the people on the beach gathering thicker meanwhile and all looking eagerly towards some invisible object far out to sea in the direction of the race with the dangerous current louies heart sank ominously within her at that very moment the chambermaid of the hotel rushed in with a pale face and cried out in merciless haste oh maam mrs pallant quick quickhes drowning hes drowning mr pallants swum too far out ands got into the race and theyve put the boat off to try and save him  in a second half the truth flashed terribly upon louie pallants distracted intelligence she saw that it was harry himself who wrote the correspondence for the young peoples monitor and that he had swum out to sea of his own accord to the end of his tether on purpose to drown himself as if by accident but she didnt yet perceive obvious as it seemed that harry thought she herself had written egerias letter in her own person she thought still he was in love with dora and had drowned himself because he couldnt tear himself away from her for ever   v  they brought harry pallant ashore cold and lifeless and carried him up in haste to the hotel there the village doctor saw him at once and detected a faint tremor of the heart at the end of an hour the lungs began to act faintly of themselves and the heart beat a little in some feeble fashion  with care harry pallant came round but it took a week or two before he was himself again and louie nursed him meanwhile in fear and trembling with breathless agony she had one consolationharry loved her in the long nights the whole truth dawned upon her clear and certain she saw how harry had opened the letter had jumped at once to the natural conclusion and had tried to drown himself in order to release her oh why had he not trusted her why had he not asked her a woman naturally thinks like that a man knows in his own soul that a man could never possibly do so  she dared not tell him yet for fear of a relapse she could only wait and watch and nurse him tenderly and all the time she knew he distrusted herknew he thought her a hypocrite and a traitor for harrys sake she had to bear it  at last one day when he was getting very much stronger and could sit up in a chair and look bitterly out at the sea she said to him in a gentle voice very tentatively harry dora ferrand and her husband have gone to spend the summer in norway  harry groaned how do you know he asked has hugh written to you what is it to us who told you about it  louie bit her lip hard to keep back the tears dora telegraphed to me herself she answered softly she telegraphed to me as soon as evershe hesitated a momentas soon as ever she saw your answer to her in the monitor  harrys face grew white with horror my answer to her he cried in a ghastly voice not caring to ask at the moment how louie came to know it was he who wrote the answers in the young peoples monitor my answer to you you mean louie it was your letteryours not doras you cant deceive me i read it myself my poor child i saw your handwriting  it was an awful thing that in spite of all he must have it out with her against his will but he would not flinch from ithe would settle it then and there once and for ever she had introduced it herself she had brought it down upon her own head he would not flinch from it it was his duty to tell her  louie laid her hand upon his arm he did not try to cast it off harry she said imploringly persuasively there is a terrible mistake herea terrible misunderstanding it was unavoidable you could not possibly have thought otherwise but oh harry if you knew the suffering you have brought upon me you would not speak so darlingyou would not speak so  harry turned towards her passionately and eagerly then you didnt want me to die louie he cried in a hoarse voice you didnt really want to get rid of me  louie withdrew her hand hastily as if she had been stung harry she gasped as well as she was able you misunderstood that letter altogether it was not mineit was dora ferrands dora wrote it and i only copied it if you will listen a minute i will tell you all all about it  harry flung himself back half incredulously on his chair but with a newborn hope lighting up in part the gloom of his recovered existence  i went over to dora ferrands the day after the ogilvies dance louie began tremulously and i found dora sitting in her boudoir writing a letter i walked up without being announced and when dora saw me she screamed a little and then she grew as red as fire and burst out crying and tried to hide the letter she was writing so i went up to her and began to soothe her and asked her what it was and wanted to read it and dora cried for a long time and wouldnt tell me and was dreadfully penitent and said she was very very miserable so i said dora is there anything wrong between you and mr ferrand and she said nothing louie i give you my word of honour nothing poor wetherbys as kind to me as anybody could be but and then she began crying again as if her heart would burst worse than ever and i took her head on my shoulder and said to her dora is it that you feel you dont love him and dora was in a dreadfully penitent fit and she flung herself away from me and said to me oh louie dont touch me dont kiss me dont come near me im not fit to associate with a girl like you dear oh louie i dont love him andwhats worsei love somebody else darling well then of course i was horribly shocked and i said dora dora this is awfully wicked of you and dora cried worse than before and sobbed away and wouldnt be comforted and there was a copy of the monitor lying on the table and i saw it open at the correspondence and i said were you writing for advice to the monitor dora and she looked up and nodded yes so i coaxed her and begged her to show me the letter and at last she showed it to me but she wouldnt tell me who she was in love with harry and oh harry my darling my darling i never so much as dreamt of its being you dearthe thought never even crossed my mind i ran over everybody i could imagine shed taken a fancy to but i never for a moment thought of you darling i suppose harry i loved you too dearly even to suspect it and then i dare say dora saw i didnt suspect it but anyhow she went on and finished the letterit was nearly done when i came in to herand after that she said she couldnt bear to send it in her own handwriting for fear anybody should know her and recognize it so i said if she liked id copy it out for her for by that time i was crying just as hard as she was and so sorry for her and for poor mr ferrand and it never struck me that anybody could ever possibly think that i wrote it about myself andandand thats all harry  harry listened consciencesmitten to the artless recital which bore its own truth on the very surface of it as it fell from louies trembling lips and then he held her off at arms length when she tried to fall upon his neck and kiss him whispering in a loud undertone oh louie louie dont dont i dont deserve it i have been too wickedtoo mistrustful  louie drew forth a letter from her pocket and handed it to him silently it was in doras handwriting he read it through in breathless anxiety       louiei dare not call you anything else now you know it all by      this time we have heard about harrys accident from your sister      nobody but ourselves knows it was not an accident and i have seen      the answer in the monitor of course harry wrote it i see it all      now you can never forgive me it is i who have brought all this      misery upon you i am a wretched woman do not reproach mei      reproach myself more bitterly than anything you could say would      ever reproach me but dont forgive me and pity me either if you      forgive me i shall have to kill myself its all over now i will      do the only thing that remains for mekeep out of your way and his      for ever poor wetherby is going to take me for the summer to      norway as i telegraphed to you we are just starting when we      return we shall winter in italy i will leave london in future      altogether nobody but our three selves need ever know or suspect      the reason harry will recover and you two will be happy yet but      ii shall be as miserable for ever as i truly deserve to be    your wretched friend   d f  harry crumpled up the letter bitterly in his hand poor soul he said louie i forgive her can i myself ever hope for forgiveness  louie flung herself fiercely upon him my darling she cried we will always trust one another in future you couldnt help it harry it was impossible for you to have judged otherwise but oh my darling what i have suffered let us forgive her harry and let us love one another better now     the search partys find   i can stand it no longer i must put down my confession on paper since there is no living creature left to whom i can confess it  the snow is drifting fiercer than ever today against the cabin the last biscuit is almost finished my fingers are so pinched with cold i can hardly grasp the pen to write with but i will write i must write and i am writing i cannot die with the dreadful story unconfessed upon my conscience  it was only an accident most of you who read this confession perhaps will say but in my own heart i know better than thati know it was a murder a wicked murder  still though my hands are very numb and my head swimming wildly with delirium i will try to be coherent and to tell my story clearly and collectedly                                       i was appointed surgeon of the cotopaxi in june 1880 i had reasons of my ownsad reasonsfor wishing to join an arctic expedition i didnt join it as most of the other men did from pure love of danger and adventure i am not a man to care for that sort of thing on its own account i joined it because of a terrible disappointment  for two years i had been engaged to dorai neednt call her anything but dora my brother to whom i wish this paper sent but whom i darent address as dear arthurhow could i a murdererwill know well enough who i mean and as to other people it isnt needful they should know anything about it but whoever you are whoever finds this paper i beg of you i implore you i adjure you do not tell a word of it to dora i cannot die unconfessed but i cannot let the confession reach her if it does i know the double shock will kill her keep it from her tell her only he is deaddead at his post like a brave man on the cotopaxi exploring expedition for mercys sake dont tell her that he was murdered and that i murdered him  i had been engaged i said two years to dora she lived in arthurs parish and i loved heryes in those days i loved her purely devotedly innocently i was innocent then myself and i really believe good and wellmeaning i should have been genuinely horrified and indignant if anybody had ventured to say that i should end by committing a murder  it was a great grief to me when i had to leave arthurs parish and my fathers parish before him to go up to london and take a post as surgeon to a small hospital i couldnt bear being so far away from dora and at first dora wrote to me almost every day with the greatest affection heaven forgive me if i still venture to call her dora her so good and pure and beautiful and i a murderer but after a while i noticed slowly that doras tone seemed to grow colder and colder and her letters less and less frequent why she should have begun to cease loving me i cannot imagine perhaps she had a premonition of what possibility of wickedness was really in me at any rate her coldness grew at last so marked that i wrote and asked arthur whether he could explain it arthur answered me a little regretfully and with brotherly affection he is a good fellow arthur that he thought he could he fearedit was painful to say sobut he feared dora was beginning to love a newer lover a young man had lately come to the village of whom she had seen a great deal and who was very handsome and brave and fascinating arthur was afraid he could not conceal from me his impression that dora and the stranger were very much taken with one another  at last one morning a letter came to me from dora i can put it in here because i carried it away with me when i went to hammerfest to join the cotopaxi and ever since i have kept it sadly in my private pocketbook       dear ernest she had always called me ernest since we had been      children together and she couldnt leave it off even now when she      was writing to let me know she no longer loved me can you      forgive me for what i am going to tell you i thought i loved you      till lately but then i had never discovered what love really      meant i have discovered it now and i find that after all i only      liked you very sincerely you will have guessed before this that i      love somebody else who loves me in return with all the strength of      his whole nature i have made a grievous mistake which i know will      render you terribly unhappy but it is better so than to marry a      man whom i do not really love with all my heart and soul and      affection better in the end i am sure for both of us i am too      much ashamed of myself to write more to you can you forgive me    yours   dora  i could not forgive her then though i loved her too much to be angry i was only brokenheartedthoroughly stunned and brokenhearted i can forgive her now but she can never forgive me heaven help me  i only wanted to get away anywhere anywhere and forget all about it in a life of danger so i asked for the post of surgeon to sir paxton batemans cotopaxi expedition a few weeks afterwards they wanted a man who knew something about natural history and deepsea dredging and they took me on at once on the recommendation of a wellknown man of science  the very day i joined the ship at hammerfest in august i noticed immediately there was one man on board whose mere face and bearing and manner were at first sight excessively objectionable to me he was a handsome young fellow enoughone harry lemarchant who had been a planter in queensland and who after being burned up with three years of tropical sunshine was anxious to cool himself apparently by a long winter of arctic gloom handsome as he was with his black moustache and big dark eyes rolling restlessly i took an instantaneous dislike to his cruel thin lip and cold proud mouth the moment i looked upon him if i had been wise i would have drawn back from the expedition at once it is a foolish thing to bind ones self down to a voyage of that sort unless you are perfectly sure beforehand that you have at least no instinctive hatred of any one among your messmates in that long forced companionship but i wasnt wise and i went on with him  from the first moment even before i had spoken to him i disliked lemarchant very soon i grew to hate him he seemed to me the most recklessly cruel and devilish creature god forgive me that i should say it i had ever met with in my whole lifetime on an arctic expedition a mans true nature soon comes outmine did certainlyand he lets his companions know more about his inner self in six weeks than they could possibly learn about him in years of intercourse under other circumstances and the second night i was on board the cotopaxi i learnt enough to make my blood run cold about harry lemarchants ideas and feelings  we were all sitting on deck together those of us who were not on duty and listening to yarns from one another as idle men will when the conversation happened accidentally to turn on queensland and lemarchant began to enlighten us about his own doings when he was in the colony he boasted a great deal about his prowess as a disperser of the black fellows which he seemed to consider a very noble sort of occupation there was nobody in the colony he said who had ever dispersed so many blacks as he had and hed like to be back there dispersing again for in the matter of sport it beat kangaroohunting or any other kind of shooting he had ever yet tried his hand at all to pieces  the secondlieutenant hepworth paterson a nice kindhearted young scotchman looked up at him a little curiously and said why what do you mean by dispersing lemarchant driving them off into the bush i suppose isnt that it not much fun in that that i can see scattering a lot of poor helpless black naked savages  lemarchant curled his lip contemptuously he didnt think much of paterson because his father was said to be a glasgow grocer and answered in his rapid daredevil fashion no fun isnt there just thats all you know about it my good fellow now ill give you one example one day the inspector came in and told us there were a lot of blacks camping out on our estate down by the warramidgee river so we jumped on our horses like a shot went down there immediately and began dispersing them we didnt fire at them because the grass and ferns and things were very high and we might have wasted our ammunition but we went at them with native spears just for all the world like pigsticking you should have seen those black fellows run for their lives through the long grassmen women and little ones together we rode after them full pelt and as we came up with them one by one we just rolled them over helterskelter as if theyd been antelopes or bears or something byandby after a good long charge or two wed cleared the place of the big blacks altogether but the gins and the children some of them lay lurking in among the grass you know and wouldnt come out and give us fair sport as they ought to have done out in the open children will pack you see whenever theyre hard driven exactly like grouse after a month or twos steady shooting well to make them start and show game of course we just put a match to the grass and in a minute the whole thing was in a blaze right down the corner to the two rivers so we turned our horses into the stream and rode alongside half a dozen of us on each river and every now and then one of the young ones would break cover and slide out quietly into the stream and try to swim across without being perceived and get clean away into the back country then we just made a dash at them with the pigspears and sometimes theyd diveand precious good divers they are too those queenslanders i can tell you but we waited around till they came up again and then we stuck them as sure as houses thats what we call dispersing the natives over in queensland extending the blessings of civilization to the unsettled parts of the back country  he laughed a pleasant laugh to himself quietly as he finished this atrocious devilish story and showed his white teeth all in a row as if he thought the whole reminiscence exceedingly amusing  of course we were all simply speechless with horror and astonishment such deliberate brutal murderousnessgracious heavens what am i saying i had half forgotten for the moment that i too am a murderer  but what had the black fellows done to you paterson asked with a tone of natural loathing after we had all sat silent and horrorstricken in a circle for a moment i suppose theyd been behaving awfully badly to some white people somewheremassacring women or somethingto get your blood up to such a horrid piece of butchery  lemarchant laughed again a quiet chuckle of conscious superiority and only answered behaving badly massacring white women lord bless your heart id like to see them why the wretched creatures wouldnt ever dare to do it oh no nothing of that sort i can tell you and our blood wasnt up either we went in for it just by way of something to do and to keep our hands in of course you cant allow a lot of lazy hulking blacks to go knocking around in the neighbourhood of an estate stealing your fowls and fruit and so forth without let or hindrance its the custom in queensland to disperse the black fellows ive often been out riding with a friend and ive seen a nigger skulking about somewhere down in a hollow among the treeferns and ive just drawn my sixshooter and said to my friend you see me disperse that confounded nigger and ive dispersed him right offinto little pieces too you may take your oath upon it  but do you mean to tell me mr lemarchant paterson said looking a deal more puzzled and shocked that these poor creatures had been doing absolutely nothing  well now thats the way of all you homesticking sentimentalists lemarchant went on with an ugly simper you want to push on the outskirts of civilization and to see the world colonized but youre too squeamish to listen to anything about the only practicable civilizing and colonizing agencies its the struggle for existence dont you see the plain outcome of all the best modern scientific theories the black man has got to go to the wall the white man with his superior moral and intellectual nature has got to push him there at bottom its nothing more than civilization shoot em off at once i say and get rid of em forthwith and for ever  why i said looking at him with my disgust speaking in my face heaven forgive me i call it nothing less than murder  lemarchant laughed and lit his cigar but after that somehow the other men didnt much care to talk to him in an ordinary way more than was necessary for the carrying out of the ships business  and yet he was a very gentlemanly fellow i must admit and well read and decently educated only there seemed to be a certain natural brutality about him under a thin veneer of culture and good breeding that repelled us all dreadfully from the moment we saw him i dare say we shouldnt have noticed it so much if we hadnt been thrown together so closely as men are on an arctic voyage but then and there it was positively unendurable we none of us held any communications with him whenever we could help it and he soon saw that we all of us thoroughly disliked and distrusted him  that only made him reckless and defiant he knew he was bound to go the journey through with us now and he set to work deliberately to shock and horrify us whether all the stories he told us by the wardroom fire in the evenings were true or not i cant tell youi dont believe they all were but at any rate he made them seem as brutal and disgusting as the most loathsome details could possibly make them he was always apologizingnay gloryingin bloodshed and slaughter which he used to defend with a show of cultivated reasoning that made the naked brutality of his stories seem all the more awful and unpardonable at bottom and yet one couldnt deny all the time that there was a grace of manner and a show of polite feeling about him which gave him a certain external pleasantness in spite of everything he was always boasting that women liked him and i could easily understand how a great many women who saw him only with his company manners might even think him brave and handsome and very chivalrous  i wont go into the details of the expedition they will be found fully and officially narrated in the log which i have hidden in the captains box in the hut beside the captains body i need only mention here the circumstances immediately connected with the main matter of this confession                                       one day a little while before we got jammed into the ice off the liakov islands lemarchant was up on deck with me helping me to remove from the net the creatures that we had dredged up in our shallow soundings as he stooped to pick out a leptocardium boreale i happened to observe that a gold locket had fallen out of the front of his waistcoat and showed a lock of hair on its exposed surface lemarchant noticed it too and with an awkward laugh put it back hurriedly my little girls keepsake he said in a tone that seemed to me disagreeably flippant about such a subject she gave it to me just before i set off on my way to hammerfest  i started in some astonishment he had a little girl thena sweetheart he meant obviously if so heaven help her poor soul heaven help her for any woman to be tied for life to such a creature as that was really quite too horrible i didnt even like to think upon it  i dont know what devil prompted me for i seldom spoke to him even when we were told off on duty together but i said at last after a moments pause if you are engaged to be married as i suppose you are from what you say i wonder you could bear to come away on such a long business as this when you couldnt get a word or a letter from the lady youre engaged to for a whole winter  he went on picking out the shells and weeds as he answered in a careless jaunty tone why to tell you the truth doctor that was just about the very meaning of it were going to be married next summer you see and for reasons of her papasthe deuce knows whatmy little girl couldnt possibly be allowed to marry one week sooner there id been knocking about and spooning with her violently for three months nearly and the more i spooned and the more tired i got of it the more she expected me to go on spooning well im not the sort of man to stand billing and cooing for a whole year together at last the thing grew monotonous i wanted to get an excuse to go off somewhere where there was some sort of fun going on till summer came and we could get spliced properly for shes got some tin too and i didnt want to throw her over but i felt that if id got to keep on spooning and spooning for a whole winter without intermission the thing would really be one too many for me and i should have to give it up from sheer weariness so i heard of this precious expedition which is just the sort of adventure i like i wrote and volunteered for it and then i managed to make my little girl and her dear papa believe that as i was an officer in the naval reserve i was compelled to go when asked willynilly its only for half a year you know darling and all that sort of thingyou understand the line of country and meanwhile im saved the bother of ever writing to her or getting any letters from her either which is almost in its way an equal nuisance  i see said i shortly not to put too fine a point upon it you simply lied to her  upon my soul he answered showing his teeth again but this time by no means pleasantly you fellows on the cotopaxi are really the sternest set of moralists i ever met with outside a book of sermons or a surrey melodrama you ought all to have been parsons every man jack of you thats just about what youre fit for                                       on the fourteenth of september we got jammed in the ice and the cotopaxi went to pieces you will find in the captains log how part of us walked across the pack to the liakov islands and settled ourselves here on point sibiriakoff in winter quarters as to what became of the other party which went southwards to the mouth of the lena i know nothing  it was a hard winter but by the aid of our stores and an occasional walrus shot by one of the bluejackets we managed to get along till march without serious illness then one day after a spell of terrible frost and snow the captain came to me and said doctor i wish youd come and see lemarchant in the other hut here im afraid hes got a bad fever  i went to see him so he had a raging fever  fumbling about among his clothes to lay him down comfortably on the bearskin for of course we had saved no bedding from the wreck i happened to knock out once more the same locket that i had seen when he was emptying the dragnet there was a photograph in it of a young lady the sealoil lamp didnt give very much light in the dark hut it was still the long winter night on the liakov islands but even so i couldnt help seeing and recognizing the young ladys features great heaven support me uphold me i reeled with horror and amazement it was dora  yes his little girl that he spoke of so carelessly that he lied to so easily that he meant to marry so cruelly was my dora  i had pitied the woman who was to be harry lemarchants wife even when i didnt know who she was in any way i pitied her terribly with all my heart when i knew that she was doramy own dora if i have become a murderer after all it was to save dorato save dora from that unutterable abominable ruffian  i clutched the photograph in the locket eagerly and held it up to the mans eyes he opened them dreamily is that the lady you are going to marry i asked him with all the boiling indignation of that terrible discovery seething and burning in my very face  he smiled and took it all in in half a minute it is he answered in spite of the fever with all his old daredevil carelessness and now i recollect they told me the fellow she was engaged to was a doctor in london and a brother of the parson by jove i never thought of it before that your name too was actually robinson thats the worst of having such a deuced common name as yours no one ever dreams of recognizing your relations hang it all if youre the man i suppose now out of revenge youll be wanting next to go and poison me  you judge others by yourself im afraid i answered sternly oh how the words seem to rise up in judgment against me at last now the dreadful thing is all over  i doctored him as well as i was able hoping all the time in my inmost soul for i will confess all now that he would never recover already in wish i had become a murderer it was too horrible to think that such a man as that should marry dora i had loved her once and i loved her still i love her now i shall always love her murderer as i am i say it nevertheless i shall always love her  but at last to my grief and disappointment the man began to mend and get better my doctoring had done him good and the sailors though even they did not love him had shot him once or twice a small bird of which we made fresh soup that seemed to revive him yes yes he was coming round and my cursed medicines had done it all he was getting well and he would still go back to marry dora  the very idea put me into such a fever of terror and excitement that at last i began to exhibit the same symptoms as lemarchant himself had done the captain saw i was sickening and feared the fever might prove an epidemic it wasnt i knew that mine was brain lemarchants was intermittent but the captain insisted upon disbelieving me so he put me and lemarchant into the same hut and made all the others clear out so as to turn it into a sort of temporary hospital  every night i put out from the medicinechest two quinine powders apiece for myself and lemarchant  one night it was the 7th of april i cant forget it i woke feebly from my feverish sleep and noticed in a faint sort of fashion that lemarchant was moving about restlessly in the cabin  lemarchant i cried authoritatively for as surgeon i was of course responsible for the health of the expedition go back and lie down upon your bearskin this minute youre a great deal too weak to go getting anything for yourself as yet go back this minute sir and if you want anything ill pull the string and patersonll come and see what youre after for we had fixed up a string between the two huts tied to a box at the end as a rough means of communication  all right old fellow he answered more cordially than i had ever yet heard him speak to me its all square i assure you i was only seeing whether you were quite warm and comfortable on your rug there  perhaps i thought the care ive taken of him has made him really feel a little grateful to me so i dozed off and thought nothing more at the moment about it  presently i heard a noise again and woke up quietly without starting but just opened my eyes and peered about as well as the dim light of the little oillamp would allow me  to my great surprise i could make out somehow that lemarchant was meddling with the bottles in the medicinechest  perhaps thought i again he wants another dose of quinine anyhow im too tired and sleepy to ask him anything just now about it  i knew he hated me and i knew he was unscrupulous but it didnt occur to me to think he would poison the man who had just helped him through a dangerous fever  at four i woke as i always did and proceeded to take one of my powders curiously enough before i tasted it the grain appeared to me to be rather coarser and more granular than the quinine i had originally put there i took a pinch between my finger and thumb and placed it on my tongue by way of testing it instead of being bitter the powder i found was insipid and almost tasteless  could i possibly in my fever and delirium though i had not consciously been delirious have put some other powder instead of the quinine into the two papers the bare idea made me tremble with horror if so i might have poisoned lemarchant who had taken one of his powders already and was now sleeping quietly upon his bearskin at least i thought so  glancing accidentally to his place that moment i was vaguely conscious that he was not really sleeping but lying with his eyes held half open gazing at me cautiously and furtively through his closed eyelids  then the horrid truth flashed suddenly across me lemarchant was trying to poison me  yes he had always hated me and now that he knew i was doras discarded lover he hated me worse than ever he had got up and taken a bottle from the medicinechest i felt certain and put something else instead of my quinine inside my paper  i knew his eyes were fixed upon me then and for the moment i dissembled i turned round and pretended to swallow the contents of the packet and then lay down upon my rug as if nothing unusual had happened the fever was burning me fiercely but i lay awake kept up by the excitement till i saw that he was really asleep and then i once more undid the paper  looking at it closely by the light of the lamp i saw a finer powder sticking closely to the folded edges i wetted my finger put it down and tasted it yes that was quite bitter that was quinine not a doubt about it  i saw at once what lemarchant had done he had emptied out the quinine and replaced it by some other white powder probably arsenic but a little of the quinine still adhered to the folds in the paper because he had been obliged to substitute it hurriedly and that at once proved that it was no mistake of my own but that lemarchant had really made the deliberate attempt to poison me  this is a confession and a confession only so i shall make no effort in any way to exculpate myself for the horrid crime i committed the next moment true i was wild with fever and delirium i was maddened with the thought that this wretched man would marry dora i was horrified at the idea of sleeping in the same room with him any longer but still i acknowledge it now face to face with a lonely death upon this frozen island it was murderwilful murder i meant to poison him and i did it  he has set this powder for me the villain i said to myself and now i shall make him take it without knowing it how do i know that its arsenic or anything else to do him any harm his blood be upon his own head for aught i know about it what i put there was simply quinine if anybody has changed it he has changed it himself the pit that he dug for another he himself shall fall therein  i wouldnt even test it for fear i should find it was arsenic and be unable to give it to him innocently and harmlessly  i rose up and went over to lemarchants side horror of horrors he was sleeping soundly yes the man had tried to poison me and when he thought he had seen me swallow his poisonous powder so callous and hardened was his nature that he didnt even lie awake to watch the effect of it he had dropped off soundly as if nothing had happened and was sleeping now to all appearance the sleep of innocence being convalescent in fact and therefore in need of rest he slept with unusual soundness  i laid the altered powder quietly by his pillow took away his that i had laid out in readiness for him and crept back to my own place noiselessly there i lay awake hot and feverish wondering to myself hour after hour when he would ever wake and take it  at last he woke and looked over towards me with unusual interest hullo doctor he said quite genially how are you this morning eh getting on well i hope it was the first time during all my illness that he had ever inquired after me  i lied to him deliberately to keep the delusion up i have a terrible grinding pain in my chest i said pretending to writhe i had sunk to his level it seems i was a liar and a murderer  he looked quite gay over it and laughed its nothing he said grinning horribly its a good symptom i felt just like that myself my dear fellow when i was beginning to recover  then i knew he had tried to poison me and i felt no remorse for my terrible action it was a good deed to prevent such a man as that from ever carrying away doramy dorainto a horrid slavery sooner than that he should marry dora i would poison himi would poison him a thousand times over  he sat up took the spoon full of treacle and poured the powder as usual into the very middle of it i watched him take it off at a single gulp without perceiving the difference and then i sank back exhausted upon my roll of sealskins                                       all that day i was very ill and lemarchant lying tossing beside me groaned and moaned in a fearful fashion at last the truth seemed to dawn upon him gradually and he cried aloud to me doctor doctor quick for heavens sake you must get me out an antidote the powders must have got mixed up somehow and youve given me arsenic instead of quinine im certain  not a bit of it lemarchant i said with some devilish malice ive given you one of my own packets that was lying here beside my pillow  he turned as white as a sheet the moment he heard that and gasped out horribly thatthatwhy that was arsenic but he never explained in a single word how he knew it or where it came from i knew i needed no explanation and i wanted no lies so i didnt question him  i treated him as well as i could for arsenic poisoning without saying a word to the captain and the other men about it for if he died i said it would be by his own act and if my skill could still avail he should have the benefit of it but the poison had had full time to work before i gave him the antidote and he died by seven oclock that night in fearful agonies  then i knew that i was really a murderer  my fingers are beginning to get horribly numb and im afraid i shant be able to write much longer i must be quick about it if i want to finish this confession                                       after that came my retribution i have been punished for it and punished terribly  as soon as they all heard lemarchant was deada severe relapse i called itthey set to work to carry him out and lay him somewhere then for the first time the idea flashed across my mind that they couldnt possibly bury him the ice was too deep everywhere and underneath it lay the solid rock of the bare granite islands there was no snow even for the wind swept it away as it fell and we couldnt so much as decently cover him there was nothing for it but to lay him out upon the icy surface  so we carried the stark frozen body with its hideous staring eyes wide open out by the jutting point of rock behind the hut and there we placed it dressed and upright we stood it up against the point exactly as if it were alive and byandby the snow came and froze it to the rock and there it stands to this moment glaring for ever fiercely upon me  whenever i went in or out of the hut for three long months that hideous thing stood there staring me in the face with mute indignation at night when i tried to sleep the murdered man stood there still in the darkness beside me o god i dared not say a word to anybody but i trembled every time i passed it and i knew what it was to be a murderer  in may the sun came back again but still no open water for our one boat in june we had the long day but no open water the captain began to get impatient and despondent as you will read in the log he was afraid now we might never get a chance of making the mouth of the lena  byandby the scurvy came i have no time now for details my hands are so cramped with cold and then we began to run short of provisions soon i had them all down upon my hands and presently we had to place patersons corpse beside lemarchants on the little headland then they sank one after anothersank of cold and hunger as you will read in the logtill i alone who wanted least to live was the last left living  i was left alone with those nine corpses propped up awfully against the naked rock and one of the nine the man i had murdered  may heaven forgive me for that terrible crime and for pitys sake whoever you may be keep it from dorakeep it from dora  my brothers address is in my pocketbook  the fever and remorse alone have given me strength to hold the pen my hands are quite numbed now i can write no longer                                       there the manuscript ended heaven knows what effect it may have upon all of you who read it quietly at home in your own easychairs in england but we of the search party who took those almost illegible sheets of shaky writing from the cold fingers of the one solitary corpse within the frozen cabin on the liakov islandswe read them through with such a mingled thrill of awe and horror and sympathy and pity as no one can fully understand who has not been upon an arctic expedition and when we gathered our sad burdens up to take them off for burial at home the corpse to which we gave the most reverent attention was certainly that of the selfaccused murderer     harrys inheritance   i  colonel sir thomas woolrych kcb retired list was a soldier of the old school much attached to pipeclay and purchase and with a low opinion of competitive examinations the first six books of euclid the local military centres the territorial titles of regiments the latest regulation pattern in halfdress buttons and most other confounded newfangled radical fallal and trumpery in general sir thomas believed as firmly in the wisdom of our ancestors as he distrusted the wisdom of our nearest descendants now just attaining to years of maturity and indiscretion especially had he a marked dislike for this nasty modern shopkeeping habit of leaving all your loose money lying idly at your bankers and paying everybody with a dirty little bit of crumpled paper instead of pulling out a handful of gold magnificently from your trousers pocket and flinging the sovereigns boldly down before you upon the counter like an officer and a gentleman why should you let one of those bloated overfed lazy bankerfellows grow rich out of borrowing your money from you for nothing without so much as a thankyou and lending it out again to some other poor devil of a tradesman probably in difficulties at seven per cent on short discount no no that was not the way sir thomas woolrych had been accustomed to live when he was an ensign sublieutenant they positively call it nowadays at ahmednuggur in the northwest provinces in those days my dear sir a man drew his monthly screw by paywarrant took the rupees in solid cash locked them up carefully in the desk in his bungalow helped himself liberally to them while they lasted and gave ious for any little trifle of cards or horses he might happen to have let himself in for meanwhile with his brotherofficers ious are of course a gentlemanly and recognized form of monetary engagement but for bankers cheques sir thomas positively felt little less than contempt and loathing  nevertheless in his comfortable villa in the park at cheltenham called futteypoor lodge after that famous engagement during the mutiny which gave the colonel his regiment and his kcbship he stood one evening looking curiously at his big devonport and muttered to himself with more than one most military oath hanged if i dont think i shall positively be compelled to patronize these bankerfellows after all somebody must have been helping himself again to some of my sovereigns  sir thomas was not by nature a suspicious manhe was too frank and openhearted himself to think ill easily of othersbut he couldnt avoid feeling certain that somebody had been tampering unjustifiably with the contents of his devonport he counted the rows of sovereigns over once more very carefully then he checked the number taken out by the entry in his pocketbook and then he leaned back in his chair with a puzzled look took a meditative puff or two at the stump of his cigar and blew out the smoke in a long curl that left a sort of pout upon his heavily moustached lip as soon as he had finished not a doubt in the world about itsomebody must have helped himself again to a dozen sovereigns  it was a hateful thing to put a watch upon your servants and dependents but sir thomas felt he must really do it he reckoned up the long rows a third time with military precision entered the particulars once more most accurately in his pocketbook sighed a deep sigh of regret at the distasteful occupation and locked up the devonport at last with the air of a man who resigns himself unwillingly to a most unpleasant duty then he threw away the fagend of the smokedout cigar and went up slowly to dress for dinner  sir thomass household consisted entirely of himself and his nephew harry for he had never been married and he regarded all womankind alike from afar off with a quaint respectful oldworld chivalry but he made a point of dressing scrupulously every day for dinner even when alone as a decorous formality due to himself his servants society the military profession and the convenances in general if he and his nephew dined together they dressed for one another if they dined separately they dressed all the same for the sake of the institution when a man once consents to eat his evening meal in a blue tie and a morning cutaway theres no drawing a line until you finally find him an advanced republican and an accomplice of those dreadful war office people who are bent upon allowing the service to go to the devil if colonel sir thomas woolrych kcb had for a single night been guilty of such abominable laxity the whole fabric of society would have tottered to its base and gods and footmen would have felt instinctively that it was all up with the british constitution  harry sir thomas said as soon they sat down to dinner together are you going out anywhere this evening my boy  harry looked up a little surlily and answered after a moments hesitation why yes uncle i thoughti thought of going round and having a game of billiards with tom whitmarsh  sir thomas cleared his throat and hemmed dubiously in that case he said at last after a short pause i think ill go down to the club myself and have a rubber wilkins the carriage at halfpast nine im sorry harry youre going out this evening  why so uncle its only just round to the whitmarshes you know  sir thomas shut one eye and glanced with the other at the light through his glass of sherry held up between finger and thumb critically and suspiciously a man may disapprove in toto of the present system of competitive examinations for the army he said slowly for my part i certainly do and i make no secret of it admitting a lot of butchers and bakers and candlestick makers plump into the highest ranks of the service no tone no character no position no gentlemanly feeling a great mistakea great mistake i told them so at the time i said to them gentlemen you are simply ruining the service but they took no notice of me and whats the consequence competitive examination has been the ruin of the service exactly as i told them began with that then abolition of purchase then local centres then that abominable strap with the slip bucklethere there harry upon my soul my boy i cant bear to think of it but a man may be opposed as i said to the whole present system of competitive examination and yet while that system still unfortunately continues to exist that is to say until a european war convinces all sensible people of the confounded folly of it he may feel that his own young men who are reading up for a direct commission ought to be trying their hardest to get as much of this nonsensical humbug into their heads as possible during the time just before their own examinations now harry im afraid youre not reading quite as hard as you ought to be doing the crammers all very well in his way of course but depend upon it the crammer by himself wont get you through it whats needed is private study  harry turned his handsome dark eyes upon his unclea very dark almost gipsylooking face altogether harrysand answered deprecatingly well sir and dont i go in for private study didnt i read up samson agonistes all by myself right through yesterday  i dont know what samson somethingorother is the old gentleman replied testily what the dickens has samson somethingorother got to do with the preparation of a military man i should like to know sir  its the english literature book for the exam you know harry answered with a quiet smile weve got to get it up you see with all the allusions and whatyoumaycallits for direct commission its a sort of a play i think i should call it by john milton  oh its the english literature is it the old colonel went on somewhat mollified in my time harry we werent expected to know anything about english literature the articles of war and the officers companion by authority that was the kind of literature we used to be examined in but nowadays they expect a soldier to be read up in samson somethingorother do they really well well let them have their fad let them have their fad poor creatures still harry im very much afraid youre wasting your time and your money also if i thought you only went to the whitmarshes to see miss milly now i shouldnt mind so much about it miss milly is a very charming sweet young creature certainlyextremely pretty too extremely prettyi dont deny it youre young yet to go making yourself agreeable my boy to a pretty girl like that you ought to wait for that sort of thing till youve got your majority or at least your companya young man reading for direct commission has no business to go stuffing his head cram full with love and nonsense no no he should leave it all free for fortification and the general instructions and samson somethingorother if soldiers cant be made nowadays without english literature but still i dont so much object to that i saya sweet girl certainly miss millywhat i do object to is your knocking about so much at billiardrooms and so forth with that young fellow whitmarsh not a very nice young fellow or a good companion for you either harry im afraid im afraid my boy he makes you spend a great deal too much money  ive never yet had to ask you to increase my allowance sir the young man answered haughtily with a curious glance sideways at his uncle  wilkins sir thomas put in with a nod to the butler go down and bring up a bottle of the old madeira harry my boy dont let us discuss questions of this sort before the servants my boy ive never kept you short of money in any way i hope and if i ever do i trust youll tell me of it tell me of it immediately  harrys dark cheeks burned bright for a moment but he answered never a single word and went on eating his dinner silently with a very hangdog look indeed upon his handsome features   ii  at halfpast nine sir thomas drove down to the club and when he reached the door dismissed the coachman i shall walk back morton he said i shant want you again this evening dont let them sit up for me i maynt be home till two in the morning  but as soon as the coachman had had full time to get back again in perfect safety sir thomas walked straight down the club steps once more and up the promenade and all the way to futteypoor lodge when he got there he opened the door silently with his latchkey shut it again without the slightest noise and walked on tiptoe into the library it was an awkward sort of thing to do certainly but sir thomas was convinced in his own mind that he ought to do it he wheeled an easy chair into the recess by the window in front of which the curtains were drawn arranged the folds so that he could see easily into the room by the slit between them and sat down patiently to explore this mystery to the very bottom  sir thomas was extremely loth in his own mind to suspect anybody and yet it was quite clear that some one or other must have taken the missing sovereigns twice over money had been extracted it couldnt have been cook of that he felt certain nor wilkins either very respectable woman cookvery respectable butler wilkins not morton oh dear no quite impossible certainly not morton not the housemaid or the boy obviously neither wellconducted young people every one of them but who the dickens could it be then for certainly somebody had taken the money the good old colonel felt in his heart that for the sake of everybodys peace of mind it was his bounden duty to discover the real culprit before saying a single word to anybody about it  there was something very ridiculous of course not to say undignified and absurd in the idea of an elderly field officer late in her majestys service sitting thus for hour after hour stealthily behind his own curtains in the dark as if he were a thief or a burglar waiting to see whether anybody came to open his devonport sir thomas grew decidedly wearied as he watched and waited and but for his strong sense of the duty imposed upon him of tracking the guilty person he would once or twice in the course of the evening have given up the quest from sheer disgust and annoyance at the absurdity of the position but no he must find out who had done it so there he sat as motionless as a cat watching a mousehole with his eye turned always in the direction of the devonport through the slight slit between the folded curtains  ten oclock struck upon the clock on the mantelpiecehalfpast teneleven sir thomas stretched his legs yawned and muttered audibly confounded slow really halfpast eleven sir thomas went over noiselessly to the side table where the decanters were standing and helped himself to a brandy and seltzer squeezing down the cork of the bottle carefully with his thumb to prevent its popping till all the gas had escaped piecemeal then he crept back still noiselessly feeling more like a convicted thief himself than a knight commander of the most honourable order of the bath and wondering when the deuce this pilfering lockbreaker was going to begin his nightly depredations not till after harry came back most likely the thief whoever he or she was would probably be afraid to venture into the library while there was still a chance of harry returning unexpectedly and disturbing the whole procedure but when once harry had gone to bed they would all have heard from morton that sir thomas was going to be out late and the thief would then doubtless seize so good an opportunity of helping himself unperceived to the counted sovereigns  about half past eleven there was a sound of steps upon the gardenwalk and harrys voice could be heard audibly through the halfopen window the colonel caught the very words against his will harry was talking with tom whitmarsh who had walked round to see him home his voice was a little thick as if with wine and he seemed terribly excited to judge by his accent about something or other that had just happened  good night tom the young man was saying with an outward show of carelessness barely concealing a great deal of underlying irritation ill pay you up what i lost tomorrow or the next day you shall have your money dont be afraid about it  oh its all right tom whitmarshs voice answered in an offhand fashion pay me whenever you like you know woolrych it doesnt matter to me when you pay me this year or next year so long as i get it sooner or later  sir thomas listened with a sinking heart play he thought to himself play play play already it was his fathers curse poor fellow and i hope it wont be harrys its some comfort to think anyhow that its only billiards  well good night tom harry went on ringing the bell as he spoke  good night harry i hope next time the cards wont go so persistently against you  the cards phew that was bad indeed sir thomas started he didnt object to a quiet afterdinner rubber on his own account naturally but this wasnt whist oh no nothing of the sort this was evidently serious playing he drew a long breath and felt he must talk very decidedly about the matter to harry tomorrow morning  is my uncle home yet wilkins  no sir he said he wouldnt be back probably till two oclock and we wasnt to sit up for him  all right then give me a light for a minute in the library ill take a seltzer before i go upstairs just to steady me  sir thomas almost laughed outright this was really too ridiculous suppose after all the waiting harry was to come over and discover him sitting there in the darkness by the window what a pretty figure he would cut before him and besides the whole thing would have to come out then and after all the thief would never be discovered and punished the colonel grew hot and red in the face and began to wish to goodness he hadnt in the first place let himself in in any way for this ridiculous amateur detective business  but harry drank his seltzer standing by the side table with no brandy either that was a good thing no brandy if hed taken brandy too in his present excited condition when hed already certainly had quite as much as was at all good for him sir thomas would have been justly and seriously angry but after all harry was a good boy at bottom and knew how to avoid such ugly habits he took his seltzer and his bedroom candle wilkins turned out the light in the room and harry went upstairs by himself immediately  then wilkins turned the key in the library door and the old gentleman began to reflect that this was really a most uncomfortable position for him to be left in suppose they locked him in there till tomorrow morning ah happy thought if the worst came to the worst he could get out of the library window and let himself in at the front door by means of his latchkey  the servants all filed upstairs one by one in an irregular procession their feet died away gradually upon the upper landings and a solemn silence came at last over the whole household sir thomass heart began to beat faster the excitement of plot interest was growing stronger upon him this was the time the thief would surely choose to open the devonport he should know now within twenty minutes which it was of all his people whom he trusted so implicitly that was really robbing him  and he treated them all so kindly too ha the rascal he should catch it well that he should whoever he was as soon as ever sir thomas discovered him  not if it were wilkins though not if it were wilkins sir thomas hoped it wasnt really that excellent fellow wilkins a good old tried and trusty servant if any unexpected financial difficulties  hush hush quietly now a step upon the landing  coming down noiselessly noiselessly noiselessly not wilkins not heavy enough for him surely no no a womans step so very light so light and noiseless sir thomas really hoped in his heart it wasnt that pretty delicatelooking girl the new housemaid if it was by jove yes hed give her a good lecture then and there that very minute about it offer to pay her passage quietly out to canada andrecommend her to get married decently to some good young fellow on the earliest possible opportunity  the key turned once more in the lock and then the door opened stealthily somebody glided like a ghost into the middle of the room sir thomas gazing intently through the slit in the curtains murmured to himself that now at last he should fairly discover the confounded rascal  ha how absurd he could hardly help laughing once more at the ridiculous collapse to his highwrought expectations and yet he restrained himself it was only harry harry come down candle in hand no doubt to get another glass of seltzer the colonel hoped not with brandy no not with brandy he put the glass up to his dry lipssir thomas could see they were dry and feverish even from that distance horrid thing this gamblingand he drained it off at a gulp like a thirsty man who has tasted no liquor since early morning  then he took up his candle again and turnednot to the door oh no the old gentleman watched him now with singular curiosity for he was walking not to the door but over in the direction of the suspected devonport sir thomas could hardly even then guess at the truth it wasnt no it wasnt it couldnt be harry not harry that  that borrowed the money  the young man took a piece of stout wire from his pocket with a terrible look of despair and agony sir thomass heart melted within him as he beheld it he twisted the wire about in the lock with a dexterous pressure and it opened easily sir thomas looked on and the tears rose into his eyes slowly by instinct but he said never a word and watched intently harry held the lid of the devonport open for a moment with one hand and looked at the rows of counted gold within the fingers of the other hand rose slowly and remorsefully up to the edge of the desk and there hovered in an undecided fashion sir thomas watched still with his heart breaking then for a second harry paused he held back his hand and appeared to deliberate something within seemed to have affected him deeply sir thomas though a plain old soldier could read his face well enough to know what it was he was thinking of the kind words his uncle had said to him that very evening as they sat together down there at dinner  for half a minute the suspense was terrible then with a sudden impulse harry shut the lid of the devonport down hastily flung the wire with a gesture of horror and remorse into the fireplace took up his candle wildly in his hand and rushed from the room and up the stairs leaving the door open behind him  then sir thomas rose slowly from his seat in the window corner lighted the gas in the centre burner unlocked the devonport with tears still trickling slowly down his face counted all the money over carefully to make quite certain found it absolutely untouched and flung himself down upon his knees wildly between shame and fear and relief and misery what he said or what he thought in that terrible moment of conflicting passions is best not here described or written but when he rose again his eyes were glistening more with forgiveness than with horror anger there never had been and being an oldfashioned old gentleman he took down his big bible from the shelf just to reassure himself about a text which he thought he remembered somewhere in luke joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance ah yes he said to himself he repented he repented he didnt take it he felt he couldnt after what i said to him and then with the tears still rolling silently down his bronzed checks he went up stairs to bed but not to sleep for he lay restless on his pillow all night through with that one terrible discovery weighing like lead upon his tender old bosom   iii  next morning after breakfast sir thomas said in a quiet tone of command to harry my boy i want to speak to you for a few minutes in the library  harrys cheek grew deadly pale and he caught his breath with difficulty but he followed his uncle into the library without a word and took his seat at the table opposite him  harry the old soldier began as quietly as he was able after an awkward pause i want to tell you a littlea little about your father and mother  harrys face suddenly changed from white to crimson for he felt sure now that what sir thomas was going to talk about was not the loss of the money from the devonport a week earlier and on the other hand though he knew absolutely nothing about his own birth and parentage he knew at least that there must have been some sort of mystery in the matter or else his uncle would surely long since have spoken to him quite freely of his father and mother  my dear boy the colonel went on again in a tremulous voice i think the time has now come when i ought to tell you that you and i are no relations by blood you areyou are my nephew by adoption only  harry gave a sudden start of surprise but said nothing  the way it all came about sir thomas went on playing nervously with his watchchain was just this i was in india during the mutiny as you know and while i was stationed at boolundshahr in the northwest provinces just before those confounded niggersi mean to say before the sepoys revolted your father was adjutant of my regiment at the same station he and your motherwell harry your mother lived in a small bungalow near the cantonments and there you were born why exactly eight months before the affair at meerut you knowthe beginning of the mutiny your father im sorry to say was a man very much given to high playin short if youll excuse my putting it so my boy a regular gambler he owed money to almost every man in the regiment and amongst others if i must tell you the whole truth to me in those days i sometimes played rather high myself harry not so high as your poor father my boy for i was always prudent but a great deal higher than a young man in a marching regiment has any right to doa great deal higher i left off playing immediately after what im just going to tell you and from that day to this harry ive never touched a card except for whist or cribbage and never will do my boy if i live to be as old as methuselah  the old man paused and wiped his brow for a second with his capacious handkerchief while harrys eyes cast down upon the ground began to fill rapidly with something or other that he couldnt for the life of him manage to keep out of them  on the night before the news from meerut arrived the old soldier went on once more with his eye turned half away from the trembling lad we played together in the majors rooms your father and i with a few others and before the end of the evening your father had lost a large sum to one of his brotherofficers when wed finished playing he came to me to my quarters and he said woolrych this is a bad job i havent got anything to pay mcgregor with  all right walpole i answered himyour fathers name was captain walpole harryill lend you whatevers necessary  no no my dear fellow he said i wont borrow and only get myself into worse trouble ill take a shorter and easier way out of it all you may depend upon it  at the moment i hadnt the slightest idea what he meant and so i said no more to him just then about it but three minutes after he left my quarters i heard a loud cry and saw your father in the moonlight out in the compound he had a pistol in his hand next moment the report of a shot sounded loudly down below in the compound and i rushed out at once to see what on earth could be matter  your father was lying in a pool of blood just underneath a big mangotree beside the door with his left jaw shattered to pieces and his brain pierced through and through from one side to the other by a bullet from the pistol  he was deadstone dead there was no good doctoring him we took him up and carried him into the surgeons room and none of us had the courage all that night to tell your mother  next day news came of the rising at meerut  that same night while we were all keeping watch and mounting guard expecting our men would follow the example of their companions at headquarters there was a sudden din and tumult in the lines about nine in the evening when the word was given to turn in and mcgregor coming past me shouted at the top of his voice its all up woolrych these black devils have broken loose at last and theyre going to fire the officers quarters  well harry my boy i neednt tell you all about it at full length today but in the end as you know we fought the men for our own lives and held our ground until the detachment came from etawah to relieve us however before we could get to the bibis bungalowthe sepoys used to call your mother the bibi harrythose black devils had broken in there and when next morning early i burst into the ruined place with three men of the 47th and a faithful havildar we found your poor motherwell there harry i cant bear to think of it even now my boy but she was dead too quite dead with a hundred sabrecuts all over her poor bloodstained hackedabout body and in the corner under the cradle the eightmonthold baby was lying and cryingcrying bitterly that was you harry  the young man listened intently with a face now once more ashy white but still he answered absolutely nothing  i took you in my arms my boy the old colonel continued in a softer tone and as you were left all alone in the bungalow there with no living soul to love or care for you i carried you away in my arms myself to my own quarters all through the rest of that terrible campaign i kept you with me and while i was fighting at futteypoor a native ayah was in charge of you for me your poor father had owed me a trifling debt and i took you as payment in full and have kept you with me as my nephew ever since that is all your history harry  the young man drew a deep breath and looked across curiously to the bronzed face of the simple old officer then he asked a little huskily and why didnt my fathers or mothers relations reclaim me sir do they know that i am still living  sir thomas coughed and twirled his watchchain more nervously and uneasily than ever well you see my boy he answered at last after a long pause your motheri must tell you the whole truth now harryyour mother was a eurasian a halfcaste ladyvery light almost white but still a halfcaste you know andandwell your fathers familydidnt exactly acknowledge the relationship harry  harrys face burnt crimson once more and the hot blood rushed madly to his cheeks for he felt in a moment the full force of the meaning that the colonel wrapped up so awkwardly in that one short embarrassed sentence  there was another long pause during which harry kept his burning eyes fixed fast upon sir thomas and sir thomas looked down uncomfortably at his boots and said nothing then the young man found voice again feebly to ask almost in a whisper one final question  had you  had you any particular reason for telling me this story about my birth and my parents at this exact time  just now uncle  i had harry ii have rather suspected of late  that  that you are falling somehow into  into your poor fathers unhappy vice of gambling my boy my boy if you inherit his failings in that direction i hope his end will be some warning to you to desist immediately  and had you  any reason to suspect me of  of any other fault  of  of any graver fault  of anything really very serious uncle  the colonel held his head between his hands and answered very slowly as if the words were wrung from him by torture if you hadnt yourself asked me the question pointblank harry i would never have told you anything about it yes my boy my dear boy my poor boy i know it all  all  all  absolutely  harry lifted up his voice in one loud cry and wail of horror and darted out of the room without another syllable  i know that cry the colonel said in his own heart trembling i have heard it before its the very cry poor walpole gave that night at boolundshahr just before he went out and shot himself   iv  harry had rushed out into the garden of that sir thomas felt certain he followed him hastily and saw him by the seat under the limetrees in the far corner he had something heavy in his right hand sir thomas came closer and saw to his alarm and horror that it was indeed the small revolver from the old pistolstand on the wall of the vestibule  even as the poor old soldier gazed half petrified the lad pushed a cartridge home feverishly into one of the chambers and raised the weapon with a stern resolution up to his temple sir thomas recognized in that very moment of awe and terror that it was the exact attitude and action of harrys dead father the entire character and tragedy seemed to have handed itself down directly from father to son without a single change of detail or circumstance  the old man darted forward with surprising haste and caught harrys hand just as the finger rested upon the trigger  my boy my boy he cried wrenching the revolver easily from his trembling grasp and flinging it with a great curve to the other end of the garden not that way not that way i havent reproached you with one word harry but this is a bad return indeed for a life devoted to you oh harry harry not by shuffling off your responsibilities and running away from them like a coward not by that can you ever mend matters in the state you have got them into but by living on and fighting against your evil impulses and conquering them like a manthats the way the right way to get the better of them promise me harry promise me my boy that whatever comes you wont make away with yourself as your father did for my sake live on and do better im an old man an old man harry and i have but you in the world to care for or think about dont let me be shamed in my old age by seeing the boy i have brought up and loved as a son dying in disgrace a poltroon and a coward stand by your guns my boy stand by your guns and fight it out to the last minute  harrys arm fell powerless to his side and he broke down utterly in his shame and selfabasement flinging himself wildly upon the seat beneath the limetrees and covering his face with his hands to hide the hot tears that were bursting forth in a feverish torrent  i will go he said at last in a choking voice i will go uncle and talk to milly  do the colonel said soothing his arm tenderly do my boy shes a good girl and shell advise you rightly go and speak to her but before you go promise me promise me  harry rose and tried to shake off sir thomass heavy hand laid with a fatherly pressure upon his struggling shoulder but he couldnt the old soldier was still too strong for him promise me he said once more caressingly promise me promise me  harry hesitated for a second in his troubled mind then with an effort he answered slowly i promise uncle  sir thomas released him and he rushed wildly away remember the colonel cried aloud as he went in at the open folding windows remember harry you are on your honour if you break parole i shall think very badly very badly indeed of you  but as the old man turned back sadly into his lonely library he thought to himself i wonder whether i oughtnt to have dealt more harshly with him i wonder whether i was right in letting him off so easily for two such extremelysuch extremely grave breaches of military discipline   v  then you think milly thats what i ought to do you think id better go and never come back again till i feel quite sure of myself  i think so harry i think so i think so and yet  its very hard not to see you for so long harry  but i shall write to you every day milly however long it may be and if i conquer myself why then milly i shall feel i can come back fit to marry you im not fit now and unless i feel that ive put myself straight with you and my uncle ill never come back againnever never never  millys lip trembled but she only answered bravely thats well harry for then youll make all the more effort and for my sake im sure youll conquer but harry i wish before you go youd tell me plainly what else it is that youve been doing besides playing and losing your uncles money  oh milly milly i canti mustnt if i were to tell you that you could never again respect meyou could never love me  milly was a wise girl and pressed him no further after all there are some things it is better for none of us to know about one another and this thing was just one of them  so harry walpole went away from cheltenham nobody knew whither except milly not daring to confide the secret of his whereabouts even to his uncle nor seeing that sole friend once more before he went but going away that very night on his own resources to seek his own fortune as best he might in the great world of london tell my uncle why i have gone he said to milly that it is in order to conquer myself and tell him that ill write to you constantly and that you will let him know from time to time whether i am well and making progress  it was a hard time for poor old sir thomas no doubt those four years that harry was away from him he knew not where and he was left alone by himself in his dreary home but he felt it was best so he knew harry was trying to conquer himself how harry lived or what he was doing he never heard but once or twice milly hinted to him that harry seemed sorely in want of money and sir thomas gave her some to send him and every time it was at once returned with a very firm but gentle message from harry to say that he was able happily to do without it and would not further trouble his uncle it was only from milly that sir thomas could learn anything about his dear boy and he saw her and asked her about him so often that he learned at last to love her like a daughter  four years rolled slowly away and at the end of them sir thomas was one day sitting in his little library somewhat disconsolate and reflecting to himself that he ought to have somebody living with him at his time of life when suddenly there came a ring and a knock that made him start with surprise and pleasure for he recognized them at once as being harrys next moment the servant brought him a card on which was engraved in small letters dr h walpole and down in the lefthand corner surrey hospital  sir thomas turned the card over and over with a momentary feeling of disappointment for he had somehow fancied to himself that harry had gone off covering himself with glory among zulus or afghans and he couldnt help feeling that beside that romantic dream of soldierly rehabilitation a plain doctors life was absurdly prosaic next moment harry himself was grasping his hand warmly and prose and poetry were alike forgotten in that one vivid allabsorbing delight of his boy recovered  as soon as the first flush of excitement was fairly over and harry had cried regretfully why uncle how much older youre looking and sir thomas had exclaimed in his fatherly joy why harry my boy what a fine fellow youve turned out god bless me harry took a little bank bag of sovereigns from his coat pocket and laid it down very red upon the corner of the table these are yours uncle he said simply  sir thomass first impulse was to say no no my boy keep them keep them and let us forget all about it but he checked himself just in time for he saw that the best thing all round was to take them quietly and trouble poor harry no more with the recollection thank you my boy the old soldier answered taking them up and pocketing them as though it were merely the repayment of an ordinary debt the school for the orphan children of officers in the army will be all the richer for it he thought to himself and now tell me harry how have you been living and what have you been doing ever since i last saw you  uncle harry criedhe hadnt unlearnt to think of him and call him by that fond old name thenuncle ive been conquering myself from the day i left you ive never touched a card oncenot once uncle  except i suppose for a quiet rubber the old colonel put in softly  not even for a rubber uncle harry answered half smiling nor a cue nor a dicebox either nor anything like them ive determined to steer clear of all the dangers that surround me by inheritance and im not going to begin again as long as i live uncle  thats well harry thats well and you didnt go in for a direct commission then i was in hopes my boy that you would still in spite of everything go into the queens service  harrys face fell a little uncle he said im sorry to have disappointed you sorry to have been compelled to run counter to any little ambitions you might have had for me in that respect but i felt after all you told me that day that the army would be a very dangerous profession for me and though i didnt want to be a coward and run away from danger i didnt want to be foolhardy and heedlessly expose myself to it so i thought on the whole it would be wiser for me to give up the direct commission business altogether and go in at once for being a doctor it was safer and therefore better in the end both for me and for you uncle  sir thomas took the young mans hand once more and pressed it gently with a fatherly pressure my boy he said you are right quite righta great deal more right indeed than i was but how on earth have you found money to keep yourself alive and pay for your education all these yearstell me harry  harrys face flushed up again this time with honest pride as he answered bravely ive earned enough by teaching and drawing to pay my way the whole time till i got qualified ive been qualified now for nine months and got a post as housesurgeon at our hospital but ive waited to come and tell you till id saved up that money you know out of my salary and now im coming back to settle down in practice here uncle  sir thomas said nothing but he rose from his chair and took both harrys hands in his with tears for a few minutes he looked at him tenderly and admiringly then he said in his simple way god bless you god bless you i couldnt have done it myself my boy i couldnt have done it myself harry  there was a minutes pause and then sir thomas began again what a secretive little girl that dear little miss milly must be never to have told me a word of all this harry she kept as quiet about all details as if she was sworn to the utmost secrecy  harry rose and opened the library door milly he called out and a light little figure glided in from the drawingroom opposite  we expect to be married in three weeks uncleas soon as the banns can be published harry went on presenting his future wife as it were to the colonel millys money will just be enough for us to live upon until i can scrape together a practice and she has confidence enough in me to believe that in the end i shall manage to get one  sir thomas drew her down to his chair and kissed her forehead milly he said softly you have chosen well harry you have done wisely i shall have two children now instead of one if you are to live near me i shall be very happy but harry you have proved yourself well now you must let me buy you a practice   the end     illustration
