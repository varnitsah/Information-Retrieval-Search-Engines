chatto  windus       feeding the mind     by lewis carroll     with a prefatory note by   william h draper     london   chatto  windus   1907    all rights reserved     note   the history of this little sparkle from the pen of lewis carroll may soon be told it was in october of the year 1884 that he came on a visit to a certain vicarage in derbyshire where he had promised on the score of friendship to do what was for him a most unusual favourto give a lecture before a public audience  the writer well remembers his nervous highlystrung manner as he stood before the little room full of simple people few of whom had any idea of the worldwide reputation of that shy slight figure before them  when the lecture was over he handed the manuscript to me saying do what you like with it  the one for whose sake he did this kindness was not long after called    into the silent land  so the beautifullywritten ms in his customary violet ink has been treasured for more than twenty years only now and then being read over at christmastime to a friend or two by the study fire always to meet with the same welcome and glad acknowledgment that here was a genuine though little flame that could not have belonged to any other source but that which all the world knew in alice in wonderland and through the lookingglass  there may be perhaps many others who gathering round a winter fire will be glad to read words however few from that bright source and whose memories will respond to the fresh touch of that cherished name  it remains to add but one or two more associations that cling to it and make the remembrance more vivid still while lewis carroll was staying in the house there came to call a certain genial and by no means shy dean who without realizing what he was doing proceeded in the presence of other callers to make some remark identifying mr dodgson as the author of his books  there followed an immense explosion immediately on the visitors departure with a pathetic and serious request that if there were any risk of a repetition of the call due warning might be given and the retreat secured  probably not many readers of the immortal alice have ever seen the curious little whimsical paper called    eight or nine wise words about letterwriting  which their author had printed and used to send to his acquaintance accompanied by a small case for postagestamps  it consists of forty pages and is published by emberlin and son oxford and these are the contents                                      page   on stampcases                      5   how to begin a letter               8   how to go on with a letter         11   how to end a letter                20   on registering correspondence      22  in this little script also there are the same sparkles of wit which betoken that nimble pen as for example under how to begin a letter  and never never dear madam nbthis remark is addressed to ladies only no man would ever do such a thing put wednesday simply as the date that way madness lies  from section 3 how to go on with a lettera great deal of the bad writing in the world comes simply from writing too quickly of course you reply i do it to save time a very good object no doubt but what right have you to do it at your friends expense isnt his time as valuable as yours years ago i used to receive letters from a friendand very interesting letters toowritten in one of the most atrocious hands ever invented it generally took me about a week to read one of his letters i used to carry it about in my pocket and take it out at leisure times to puzzle over the riddles which composed itholding it in different positions and at different distances till at last the meaning of some hopeless scrawl would flash upon me when i at once wrote down the english under it and when several had been thus guessed the context would help one with the others till at last the whole series of hieroglyphics was deciphered if all ones friends wrote like that life would be entirely spent in reading their letters  rule for correspondence that has unfortunately become controversial  dont repeat yourselfwhen once you have had your say fully and clearly on a certain point and have failed to convince your friend drop that subject to repeat your arguments all over again will simply lead to his doing the same and so you will go on like a circulating decimal did you ever know a circulating decimal come to an end                                       rule 5if your friend makes a severe remark either leave it unnoticed or make your reply distinctly less severe and if he makes a friendly remark tending towards making up the little difference that has arisen between you let your reply be distinctly more friendly                                       if in picking a quarrel each party declined to go more than threeeighths of the way and if in making friends each was ready to go fiveeighths of the waywhy there would be more reconciliations than quarrels which is like the irishmans remonstrance to his gadabout daughter shure youre always goin out you go out three times for wanst that you come in                                       rule 6dont try to get the last word nbif you are a gentleman and your friend a lady this rule is superfluous you wont get the last word                                       let the last word today be part of another rule which gives a glimpse into that gentle heart  when you have written a letter that you feel may possibly irritate your friend however necessary you may have felt it to so express yourself put it aside till the next day then read it over again and fancy it addressed to yourself this will often lead to your writing it all over again taking out a lot of the vinegar and pepper and putting in honey instead and thus making a much more palatable dish of it    quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus   tam cari capitis  w h d  november 1907     feeding the mind   breakfast dinner tea in extreme cases breakfast luncheon dinner tea supper and a glass of something hot at bedtime what care we take about feeding the lucky body which of us does as much for his mind and what causes the difference is the body so much the more important of the two  by no means but life depends on the body being fed whereas we can continue to exist as animals scarcely as men though the mind be utterly starved and neglected therefore nature provides that in case of serious neglect of the body such terrible consequences of discomfort and pain shall ensue as will soon bring us back to a sense of our duty and some of the functions necessary to life she does for us altogether leaving us no choice in the matter it would fare but ill with many of us if we were left to superintend our own digestion and circulation bless me one would cry i forgot to wind up my heart this morning to think that it has been standing still for the last three hours i cant walk with you this afternoon a friend would say as i have no less than eleven dinners to digest i had to let them stand over from last week being so busy and my doctor says he will not answer for the consequences if i wait any longer  well it is i say for us that the consequences of neglecting the body can be clearly seen and felt and it might be well for some if the mind were equally visible and tangibleif we could take it say to the doctor and have its pulse felt  why what have you been doing with this mind lately how have you fed it it looks pale and the pulse is very slow  well doctor it has not had much regular food lately i gave it a lot of sugarplums yesterday  sugarplums what kind  well they were a parcel of conundrums sir  ah i thought so now just mind this if you go on playing tricks like that youll spoil all its teeth and get laid up with mental indigestion you must have nothing but the plainest reading for the next few days take care now no novels on any account                                       considering the amount of painful experience many of us have had in feeding and dosing the body it would i think be quite worth our while to try and translate some of the rules into corresponding ones for the mind  first then we should set ourselves to provide for our mind its proper kind of food we very soon learn what will and what will not agree with the body and find little difficulty in refusing a piece of the tempting pudding or pie which is associated in our memory with that terrible attack of indigestion and whose very name irresistibly recalls rhubarb and magnesia but it takes a great many lessons to convince us how indigestible some of our favourite lines of reading are and again and again we make a meal of the unwholesome novel sure to be followed by its usual train of low spirits unwillingness to work weariness of existencein fact by mental nightmare  then we should be careful to provide this wholesome food in proper amount mental gluttony or overreading is a dangerous propensity tending to weakness of digestive power and in some cases to loss of appetite we know that bread is a good and wholesome food but who would like to try the experiment of eating two or three loaves at a sitting  i have heard a physician telling his patientwhose complaint was merely gluttony and want of exercisethat the earliest symptom of hypernutrition is a deposition of adipose tissue and no doubt the fine long words greatly consoled the poor man under his increasing load of fat  i wonder if there is such a thing in nature as a fat mind i really think i have met with one or two minds which could not keep up with the slowest trot in conversation could not jump over a logical fence to save their lives always got stuck fast in a narrow argument and in short were fit for nothing but to waddle helplessly through the world                                       then again though the food be wholesome and in proper amount we know that we must not consume too many kinds at once take the thirsty a quart of beer or a quart of cider or even a quart of cold tea and he will probably thank you though not so heartily in the last case but what think you his feelings would be if you offered him a tray containing a little mug of beer a little mug of cider another of cold tea one of hot tea one of coffee one of cocoa and corresponding vessels of milk water brandyandwater and buttermilk the sum total might be a quart but would it be the same thing to the haymaker                                       having settled the proper kind amount and variety of our mental food it remains that we should be careful to allow proper intervals between meal and meal and not swallow the food hastily without mastication so that it may be thoroughly digested both which rules for the body are also applicable at once to the mind  first as to the intervals these are as really necessary as they are for the body with this difference only that while the body requires three or four hours rest before it is ready for another meal the mind will in many cases do with three or four minutes i believe that the interval required is much shorter than is generally supposed and from personal experience i would recommend anyone who has to devote several hours together to one subject of thought to try the effect of such a break say once an hour leaving off for five minutes only each time but taking care to throw the mind absolutely out of gear for those five minutes and to turn it entirely to other subjects it is astonishing what an amount of impetus and elasticity the mind recovers during those short periods of rest  and then as to the mastication of the food the mental process answering to this is simply thinking over what we read this is a very much greater exertion of mind than the mere passive taking in the contents of our author so much greater an exertion is it that as coleridge says the mind often angrily refuses to put itself to such troubleso much greater that we are far too apt to neglect it altogether and go on pouring in fresh food on the top of the undigested masses already lying there till the unfortunate mind is fairly swamped under the flood but the greater the exertion the more valuable we may be sure is the effect one hour of steady thinking over a subject a solitary walk is as good an opportunity for the process as any other is worth two or three of reading only and just consider another effect of this thorough digestion of the books we read i mean the arranging and ticketing so to speak of the subjects in our minds so that we can readily refer to them when we want them sam slick tells us that he has learnt several languages in his life but somehow couldnt keep the parcels sorted in his mind and many a mind that hurries through book after book without waiting to digest or arrange anything gets into that sort of condition and the unfortunate owner finds himself far from fit really to support the character all his friends give him  a thoroughly wellread man just you try him in any subject now you cant puzzle him  you turn to the thoroughly wellread man you ask him a question say in english history he is understood to have just finished reading macaulay he smiles goodnaturedly tries to look as if he knew all about it and proceeds to dive into his mind for the answer up comes a handful of very promising facts but on examination they turn out to belong to the wrong century and are pitched in again a second haul brings up a fact much more like the real thing but unfortunately along with it comes a tangle of other thingsa fact in political economy a rule in arithmetic the ages of his brothers children and a stanza of grays elegy and among all these the fact he wants has got hopelessly twisted up and entangled meanwhile every one is waiting for his reply and as the silence is getting more and more awkward our wellread friend has to stammer out some halfanswer at last not nearly so clear or so satisfactory as an ordinary schoolboy would have given and all this for want of making up his knowledge into proper bundles and ticketing them  do you know the unfortunate victim of illjudged mental feeding when you see him can you doubt him look at him drearily wandering round a readingroom tasting dish after dishwe beg his pardon book after bookkeeping to none first a mouthful of novel but no faugh he has had nothing but that to eat for the last week and is quite tired of the taste then a slice of science but you know at once what the result of that will beah of course much too tough for his teeth and so on through the whole weary round which he tried and failed in yesterday and will probably try and fail in tomorrow  mr oliver wendell holmes in his very amusing book the professor at the breakfast table gives the following rule for knowing whether a human being is young or old the crucial experiment is thisoffer a bulky bun to the suspected individual just ten minutes before dinner if this is easily accepted and devoured the fact of youth is established he tells us that a human being if young will eat anything at any hour of the day or night  to ascertain the healthiness of the mental appetite of a human animal place in its hands a short wellwritten but not exciting treatise on some popular subjecta mental bun in fact if it is read with eager interest and perfect attention and if the reader can answer questions on the subject afterwards the mind is in firstrate working order if it be politely laid down again or perhaps lounged over for a few minutes and then i cant read this stupid book would you hand me the second volume of the mysterious murder you may be equally sure that there is something wrong in the mental digestion  if this paper has given you any useful hints on the important subject of reading and made you see that it is ones duty no less than ones interest to read mark learn and inwardly digest the good books that fall in your way its purpose will be fulfilled   billing and sons ltd printers guildford
