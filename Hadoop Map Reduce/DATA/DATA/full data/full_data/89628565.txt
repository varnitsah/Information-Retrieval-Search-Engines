89628565	twice told tales                          the sister years                       by nathaniel hawthorne    last night between eleven and twelve oclock when the old year was leaving her final foot prints on the borders of times empire she found herself in possession of a few spare moments and sat downof all places in the worldon the steps of our new city hall  the wintry moonlight showed that she looked weary of body and sad of heart like many another wayfarer of earth  her garments having been exposed to much foul weather and rough usage were in very ill condition and as the hurry of her journey had never before allowed her to take an instants rest her shoes were so worn as to be scarcely worth the mending  but after trudging only a little distance farther this poor old year was destined to enjoy a long long sleep  i forgot to mention that when she seated herself on the steps she deposited by her side a very capacious bandbox in which as is the custom among travellers of her sex she carried a great deal of valuable property  besides this luggage there was a folio book under her arm very much resembling the annual volume of a newspaper placing this volume across her knees and resting her elbows upon it with her forehead in her hands the weary bedraggled worldworn old year heaved a heavy sigh and appeared to be taking no very pleasant retrospect of her past existence  while she thus awaited the midnight knell that was to summon her to the innumerable sisterhood of departed years there came a young maiden treading lightsomely on tiptoe along the street from the direction of the railroad depot  she was evidently a stranger and perhaps had come to town by the evening train of cars  there was a smiling cheerfulness in this fair maidens face which bespoke her fully confident of a kind reception from the multitude of people with whom she was soon to form acquaintance  her dress was rather too airy for the season and was bedizened with fluttering ribbons and other vanities which were likely soon to be rent away by the fierce storms or to fade in the hot sunshine amid which she was to pursue her changeful course  but still she was a wonderfully pleasant looking figure and had so much promise and such an indescribable hopefulness in her aspect that hardly anybody could meet her without anticipating some very desirable thingthe consummation of some longsought goodfrom her kind offices  a few dismal characters there may be here and there about the world who have so often been trifled with by young maidens as promising as she that they have now ceased to pin any faith upon the skirts of the new year but for my own part i have great faith in her and should i live to see fifty more such still from each of those successive sisters i shall reckon upon receiving something that will be worth living for  the new yearfor this young maiden was no less a personagecarried all her goods and chattels in a basket of no great size or weight which hung upon her arm  she greeted the disconsolate old year with great affection and sat down beside her on the steps of the city hall waiting for the signal to begin her rambles through the world the two were own sisters being both granddaughters of time and though one looked so much older than the other it was rather owing to hardships and trouble than to age since there was but a twelvemonths difference between them  well my dear sister said the new year after the first salutations you look almost tired to death  what have you been about during your sojourn in this part of infinite space  o i have it all recorded here in my book of chronicles answered the old year in a heavy tone  there is nothing that would amuse you and you will soon get sufficient knowledge of such matters from your own personal experience  it is but tiresome reading  nevertheless she turned over the leaves of the folio and glanced at them by the light of the moon feeling an irresistible spell of interest in her own biography although its incidents were remembered without pleasure  the volume though she termed it her book of chronicles seemed to be neither more nor less than the salem gazette for 1838 in the accuracy of which journal this sagacious old year had so much confidence that she deemed it needless to record her history with her own pen  what have you been doing in the political way asked the new year  why my course here in the united states said the old yearthough perhaps i ought to blush at the confessionmy political course i must acknowledge has been rather vacillatory sometimes inclining towards the whigsthen causing the administration party to shout for triumphand now again uplifting what seemed the almost prostrate banner of the opposition so that historians will hardly know what to make of me in this respect  but the loco focos  i do not like these party nicknames interrupted her sister who seemed remarkably touchy about some points  perhaps we shall part in better humor if we avoid any political discussion  with all my heart replied the old year who had already been tormented half to death with squabbles of this kind  i care not if the navies of whig or tory with their interminable brawls about banks and the subtreasury abolition texas the florida war and a million of other topicswhich you will learn soon enough for your own comforti care not i say if no whisper of these matters ever reaches my ears again  yet they have occupied so large a share of my attention that i scarcely know what else to tell you  there has indeed been a curious sort of war on the canada border where blood has streamed in the names of liberty and patriotism but it must remain for some future perhaps far distant year to tell whether or no those holy names have been rightfully invoked  nothing so much depresses me in my view of mortal affairs as to see high energies wasted and human life and happiness thrown away for ends that appear oftentimes unwise and still oftener remain unaccomplished  but the wisest people and the best keep a steadfast faith that the progress of mankind is onward and upward and that the toil and anguish of the path serve to wear away the imperfections of the immortal pilgrim and will be felt no more when they have done their office  perhaps cried the hopeful new yearperhaps i shall see that happy day  i doubt whether it be so close at hand answered the old year gravely smiling  you will soon grow weary of looking for that blessed consummation and will turn for amusement as has frequently been my own practice to the affairs of some sober little city like this of salem  here we sit on the steps of the new city hall which has been completed under my administration and it would make you laugh to see how the game of politics of which the capitol at washington is the great chessboard is here played in miniature burning ambition finds its fuel here here patriotism speaks boldly in the peoples behalf and virtuous economy demands retrenchment in the emoluments of a lamplighter here the aldermen range their senatorial dignity around the mayors chair of state and the common council feel that they have liberty in charge  in short human weakness and strength passion and policy mans tendencies his aims and modes of pursuing them his individual character and his character in the mass may be studied almost as well here as on the theatre of nations and with this great advantage that be the lesson ever so disastrous its liliputian scope still makes the beholder smile  have you done much for the improvement of the city asked the new year  judging from what little i have seen it appears to be ancient and timeworn  i have opened the railroad said the elder year and half a dozen times a day you will hear the bell which once summoned the monks of a spanish convent to their devotions announcing the arrival or departure of the cars  old salem now wears a much livelier expression than when i first beheld her  strangers rumble down from boston by hundreds at a time  new faces throng in essex street  railroadhacks and omnibuses rattle over the pavements  there is a perceptible increase of oystershops and other establishments for the accommodation of a transitory diurnal multitude  but a more important change awaits the venerable town  an immense accumulation of musty prejudices will be carried off by the free circulation of society  a peculiarity of character of which the inhabitants themselves are hardly sensible will be rubbed down and worn away by the attrition of foreign substances  much of the result will be good there will likewise be a few things not so good  whether for better or worse there will be a probable diminution of the moral influence of wealth and the sway of an aristocratic class which from an era far beyond my memory has held firmer dominion here than in any other new england town  the old year having talked away nearly all of her little remaining breath now closed her book of chronicles and was about to take her departure  but her sister detained her awhile longer by inquiring the contents of the huge bandbox which she was so painfully lugging along with her  these are merely a few trifles replied the old year which i have picked up in my rambles and am going to deposit in the receptacle of things past and forgotten  we sisterhood of years never carry anything really valuable out of the world with us here are patterns of most of the fashions which i brought into vogue and which have already lived out their allotted term  you will supply their place with others equally ephemeral  here put up in little china pots like rouge is a considerable lot of beautiful womens bloom which the disconsolate fair ones owe me a bitter grudge for stealing  i have likewise a quantity of mens dark hair instead of which i have left gray locks or none at all  the tears of widows and other afflicted mortals who have received comfort during the last twelve months are preserved in some dozens of essencebottles well corked and sealed  i have several bundles of loveletters eloquently breathing an eternity of burning passion which grew cold and perished almost before the ink was dry  moreover here is an assortment of many thousand broken promises and other broken ware all very light and packed into little space  the heaviest articles in my possession are a large parcel of disappointed hopes which a little while ago were buoyant enough to have inflated mr lauriats balloon  i have a fine lot of hopes here in my basket remarked the new year they are a sweetsmelling flowera species of rose  they soon lose their perfume replied the sombre old year what else have you brought to insure a welcome from the discontented race of mortals  why to say the truth little or nothing else said her sister with a smilesave a few new annuals and almanacs and some new years gifts for the children  but i heartily wish well to poor mortals and mean to do all i can for their improvement and happiness  it is a good resolution rejoined the old year and by the way i have a plentiful assortment of good resolutions which have now grown so stale and musty that i am ashamed to carry them any farther  only for fear that the city authorities would send constable mansfield with a warrant after me i should toss them into the street at once many other matters go to make up the contents of my bandbox but the whole lot would not fetch a single bid even at an auction of wornout furniture and as they are worth nothing either to you or anybody else i need not trouble you with a longer catalogue  and must i also pickup such worthless luggage in my travels asked the new year  most certainly and well if you have no heavier load to bear replied the other  and now my dear sister i must bid you farewell earnestly advising and exhorting you to expect no gratitude nor goodwill from this peevish unreasonable inconsiderate illintending and worsebehaving world  however warmly its inhabitants may seen to welcome you yet do what you may and lavish on them what means of happiness you please they will still be complaining still craving what it is not in your power to give still looking forward to some other year for the accomplishment of projects which ought never to have been formed and which if successful would only provide new occasions of discontent  if these ridiculous people ever see anything tolerable in you it will be after you are gone forever  but i cried the freshhearted new yeari shall try to leave men wiser than i find them  i will offer them freely whatever good gifts providence permits me to distribute and will tell them to be thankful for what they have and humbly hopeful for more and surely if they are not absolute fools they will condescend to be happy and will allow me to be a happy year for my happiness must depend on them  alas for you then my poor sister said the old fear sighing as she uplifted her burden  we grandchildren of time are born to trouble  happiness they say dwells in the mansions of eternity but we can only lead mortals thither step by step with reluctant murmurings and ourselves must perish on the threshold  but hark my task is done  the clock in the tall steeple of dr emersons church struck twelve there was a response from dr flints in the opposite quarter of the city and while the strokes were yet dropping into the air the old year either flitted or faded away and not the wisdom and might of angels to say nothing of the remorseful yearnings of the millions who had used her ill could have prevailed with that departed year to return one step  but she in the company of time and all her kindred must hereafter hold a reckoning with mankind  so shall it be likewise with the maidenly new year who as the clock ceased to strike arose from the steps of the city hall and set out rather timorously on her earthly course  a happy new year cried a watchman eying her figure very questionably but without the least suspicion that he was addressing the new year in person  thank you kindly  said the new year and she gave the watchman one of the roses of hope from her basket  may this flower keep a sweet smell long after i have bidden you good by  then she stepped on more briskly through the silent streets and such as were awake at the moment heard her footfall and said the new year is come  wherever there was a knot of midnight roisterers they quaffed her health  she sighed however to perceive that the air was taintedas the atmosphere of this world must continually bewith the dying breaths of mortals who had lingered just long enough for her to bury them  but there were millions left alive to rejoice at her coming and so she pursued her way with confidence strewing emblematic flowers on the doorstep of almost every dwelling which some persons will gather up and wear in their bosoms and others will trample under foot  the carrier boy can only say further that early this morning she filled his basket with new years addresses assuring him that the whole city with our new mayor and the aldermen and common council at its head would make a general rush to secure copies  kind patrons will not you redeem the pledge of the new year
