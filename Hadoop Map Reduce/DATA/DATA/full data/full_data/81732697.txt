          from the buffalo express september 11 1889      the curious republic of gondour  as soon as i had learned to speak the language a little i became greatly interested in the people and the system of government  i found that the nation had at first tried universal suffrage pure and simple but had thrown that form aside because the result was not satisfactory it had seemed to deliver all power into the hands of the ignorant and nontaxpaying classes and of a necessity the responsible offices were filled from these classes also  a remedy was sought the people believed they had found it not in the destruction of universal suffrage but in the enlargement of it it was an odd idea and ingenious you must understand the constitution gave every man a vote therefore that vote was a vested right and could not be taken away but the constitution did not say that certain individuals might not be given two votes or ten so an amendatory clause was inserted in a quiet way a clause which authorised the enlargement of the suffrage in certain cases to be specified by statute to offer to limit the suffrage might have made instant trouble the offer to enlarge it had a pleasant aspect but of course the newspapers soon began to suspect and then out they came it was found however that for onceand for the first time in the history of the republicproperty character and intellect were able to wield a political influence for once money virtue and intelligence took a vital and a united interest in a political question for once these powers went to the primaries in strong force for once the best men in the nation were put forward as candidates for that parliament whose business it should be to enlarge the suffrage the weightiest half of the press quickly joined forces with the new movement and left the other half to rail about the proposed destruction of the liberties of the bottom layer of society the hitherto governing class of the community  the victory was complete the new law was framed and passed under it every citizen howsoever poor or ignorant possessed one vote so universal suffrage still reigned but if a man possessed a good commonschool education and no money he had two votes a highschool education gave him four if he had property likewise to the value of three thousand sacos he wielded one more vote for every fifty thousand sacos a man added to his property he was entitled to another vote a university education entitled a man to nine votes even though he owned no property therefore learning being more prevalent and more easily acquired than riches educated men became a wholesome check upon wealthy men since they could outvote them learning goes usually with uprightness broad views and humanity so the learned voters possessing the balance of power became the vigilant and efficient protectors of the great lower rank of society  and now a curious thing developed itselfa sort of emulation whose object was voting power whereas formerly a man was honored only according to the amount of money he possessed his grandeur was measured now by the number of votes he wielded a man with only one vote was conspicuously respectful to his neighbor who possessed three and if he was a man above the commonplace he was as conspicuously energetic in his determination to acquire three for himself this spirit of emulation invaded all ranks votes based upon capital were commonly called mortal votes because they could be lost those based upon learning were called immortal because they were permanent and because of their customarily imperishable character they were naturally more valued than the other sort i say customarily for the reason that these votes were not absolutely imperishable since insanity could suspend them  under this system gambling and speculation almost ceased in the republic a man honoured as the possessor of great voting power could not afford to risk the loss of it upon a doubtful chance  it was curious to observe the manners and customs which the enlargement plan produced walking the street with a friend one day he delivered a careless bow to a passerby and then remarked that that person possessed only one vote and would probably never earn another he was more respectful to the next acquaintance he met he explained that this salute was a fourvote bow i tried to average the importance of the people he accosted after that by the nature of his bows but my success was only partial because of the somewhat greater homage paid to the immortals than to the mortals my friend explained he said there was no law to regulate this thing except that most powerful of all laws custom custom had created these varying bows and in time they had become easy and natural at this moment he delivered himself of a very profound salute and then said now theres a man who began life as a shoemakers apprentice and without education now he swings twentytwo mortal votes and two immortal ones he expects to pass a highschool examination this year and climb a couple of votes higher among the immortals mighty valuable citizen  by and by my friend met a venerable personage and not only made him a most elaborate bow but also took off his hat i took off mine too with a mysterious awe i was beginning to be infected  what grandee is that  that is our most illustrious astronomer he hasnt any money but is fearfully learned nine immortals is his political weight he would swing a hundred and fifty votes if our system were perfect  is there any altitude of mere moneyed grandeur that you take off your hat to  no nine immortal votes is the only power we uncover forthat is in civil life very great officials receive that mark of homage of course  it was common to hear people admiringly mention men who had begun life on the lower levels and in time achieved great votingpower it was also common to hear youths planning a future of ever so many votes for themselves i heard shrewd mammas speak of certain young men as good catches because they possessed suchandsuch a number of votes i knew of more than one case where an heiress was married to a youngster who had but one vote the argument being that he was gifted with such excellent parts that in time he would acquire a good voting strength and perhaps in the long run be able to outvote his wife if he had luck  competitive examinations were the rule and in all official grades i remarked that the questions asked the candidates were wild intricate and often required a sort of knowledge not needed in the office sought  can a fool or an ignoramus answer them asked the person i was talking with  certainly not  well you will not find any fools or ignoramuses among our officials  i felt rather cornered but made shift to say  but these questions cover a good deal more ground than is necessary  no matter if candidates can answer these it is tolerably fair evidence that they can answer nearly any other question you choose to ask them  there were some things in gondour which one could not shut his eyes to one was that ignorance and incompetence had no place in the government brains and property managed the state a candidate for office must have marked ability education and high character or he stood no sort of chance of election if a hodcarrier possessed these he could succeed but the mere fact that he was a hodcarrier could not elect him as in previous times  it was now a very great honour to be in the parliament or in office under the old system such distinction had only brought suspicion upon a man and made him a helpless mark for newspaper contempt and scurrility officials did not need to steal now their salaries being vast in comparison with the pittances paid in the days when parliaments were created by hodcarriers who viewed official salaries from a hodcarrying point of view and compelled that view to be respected by their obsequious servants justice was wisely and rigidly administered for a judge after once reaching his place through the specified line of promotions was a permanency during good behaviour he was not obliged to modify his judgments according to the effect they might have upon the temper of a reigning political party  the country was mainly governed by a ministry which went out with the administration that created it this was also the case with the chiefs of the great departments minor officials ascended to their several positions through wellearned promotions and not by a jump from ginmills or the needy families and friends of members of parliament good behaviour measured their terms of office  the head of the government the grand caliph was elected for a term of twenty years i questioned the wisdom of this i was answered that he could do no harm since the ministry and the parliament governed the land and he was liable to impeachment for misconduct this great office had twice been ably filled by women women as aptly fitted for it as some of the sceptred queens of history members of the cabinet under many administrations had been women  i found that the pardoning power was lodged in a court of pardons consisting of several great judges under the old regime this important power was vested in a single official and he usually took care to have a general jail delivery in time for the next election  i inquired about public schools there were plenty of them and of free colleges too i inquired about compulsory education this was received with a smile and the remark  when a mans child is able to make himself powerful and honoured according to the amount of education he acquires dont you suppose that that parent will apply the compulsion himself our free schools and free colleges require no law to fill them  there was a loving pride of country about this persons way of speaking which annoyed me i had long been unused to the sound of it in my own the gondour national airs were forever dinning in my ears therefore i was glad to leave that country and come back to my dear native land where one never hears that sort of music      a memory  when i say that i never knew my austere father to be enamoured of but one poem in all the long half century that he lived persons who knew him will easily believe me when i say that i have never composed but one poem in all the long third of a century that i have lived persons who know me will be sincerely grateful and finally when i say that the poem which i composed was not the one which my father was enamoured of persons who may have known us both will not need to have this truth shot into them with a mountain howitzer before they can receive it my father and i were always on the most distant terms when i was a boya sort of armed neutrality so to speak at irregular intervals this neutrality was broken and suffering ensued but i will be candid enough to say that the breaking and the suffering were always divided up with strict impartiality between uswhich is to say my father did the breaking and i did the suffering as a general thing i was a backward cautious unadventurous boy but i once jumped off a twostory table another time i gave an elephant a plug of tobacco and retired without waiting for an answer and still another time i pretended to be talking in my sleep and got off a portion of a very wretched original conundrum in the hearing of my father let us not pry into the result it was of no consequence to any one but me  but the poem i have referred to as attracting my fathers attention and achieving his favour was hiawatha some man who courted a sudden and awful death presented him an early copy and i never lost faith in my own senses until i saw him sit down and go to reading it in cold bloodsaw him open the book and heard him read these following lines with the same inflectionless judicial frigidity with which he always read his charge to the jury or administered an oath to a witness                      take your bow                     o hiawatha                     take your arrows jasperheaded                     take your warclub puggawaugun                     and your mittens minjekahwan                     and your birch canoe for sailing                     and the oil of mishenama  presently my father took out of his breast pocket an imposing warranty deed and fixed his eyes upon it and dropped into meditation i knew what it was a texan lady and gentleman had given my halfbrother orrin johnson a handsome property in a town in the north in gratitude to him for having saved their lives by an act of brilliant heroism  by and by my father looked towards me and sighed then he said  if i had such a son as this poet here were a subject worthier than the traditions of these indians  if you please sir where  in this deed  yesin this very deed said my father throwing it on the table there is more poetry more romance more sublimity more splendid imagery hidden away in that homely document than could be found in all the traditions of all the savages that live  indeed sir could icould i get it out sir could i compose the poem sir do you think  you  i wilted  presently my fathers face softened somewhat and he said  go and try but mind curb folly no poetry at the expense of truth keep strictly to the facts  i said i would and bowed myself out and went upstairs  hiawatha kept droning in my headand so did my fathers remarks about the sublimity and romance hidden in my subject and also his injunction to beware of wasteful and exuberant fancy i noticed just here that i had heedlessly brought the deed away with me now at this moment came to me one of those rare moods of daring recklessness such as i referred to a while ago without another thought and in plain defiance of the fact that i knew my father meant me to write the romantic story of my halfbrothers adventure and subsequent good fortune i ventured to heed merely the letter of his remarks and ignore their spirit i took the stupid warranty deed itself and chopped it up into hiawathian blank verse without altering or leaving out three words and without transposing six it required loads of courage to go downstairs and face my father with my performance i started three or four times before i finally got my pluck to where it would stick but at last i said i would go down and read it to him if he threw me over the church for it i stood up to begin and he told me to come closer i edged up a little but still left as much neutral ground between us as i thought he would stand then i began it would be useless for me to try to tell what conflicting emotions expressed themselves upon his face nor how they grew more and more intense as i proceeded nor how a fell darkness descended upon his countenance and he began to gag and swallow and his hands began to work and twitch as i reeled off line after line with the strength ebbing out of me and my legs trembling under me                       the story of a gallant deed                      this indenture made the tenth                     day of november in the year                     of our lord one thousand eight                     hundred sixandfifty                      between joanna s e gray                     and philip gray her husband                     of salem city in the state                     of texas of the first part                      and o b johnson of the town

situate in city of                     dunkirk county of chautauqua                     and likewise furthermore in york state                      bounded and described towit                     as follows herein namely                     beginning at the distance of                     a hundred twoandforty feet                      northhalfeast northeastby north

northwestbywest                     about  i kind of dodged and the bootjack broke the lookingglass i could have waited to see what became of the other missiles if i had wanted to but i took no interest in such things      introductory to memoranda  in taking upon myself the burden of editing a department in the galaxy magazine i have been actuated by a conviction that i was needed almost imperatively in this particular field of literature i have long felt that while the magazine literature of the day had much to recommend it it yet lacked stability solidity weight it seemed plain to me that too much space was given to poetry and romance and not enough to statistics and agriculture this defect it shall be my earnest endeavour to remedy if i succeed the simple consciousness that i have done a good deed will be a sufficient rewardtogether with salary  in this department of mine the public may always rely upon finding exhaustive statistical tables concerning the finances of the country the ratio of births and deaths the percentage of increase of population etc etcin a word everything in the realm of statistics that can make existence bright and beautiful  also in my department will always be found elaborate condensations of the patent office reports wherein a faithful endeavour will at all times be made to strip the nutritious facts bare of that effulgence of imagination and sublimity of diction which too often mar the excellence of those great works         n bno other magazine in the country makes a      specialty of the patent office reports  in my department will always be found ample excerpts from those able dissertations upon political economy which i have for a long time been contributing to a great metropolitan journal and which for reasons utterly incomprehensible to me another party has chosen to usurp the credit of composing  and finally i call attention with pride to the fact that in my department of the magazine the farmer will always find full market reports and also complete instructions about farming even from the grafting of the seed to the harrowing of the matured crop i shall throw a pathos into the subject of agriculture that will surprise and delight the world  such is my programme and i am persuaded that by adhering to it with fidelity i shall succeed in materially changing the character of this magazine therefore i am emboldened to ask the assistance and encouragement of all whose sympathies are with progress and reform  in the other departments of the magazine will be found poetry tales and other frothy trifles and to these the reader can turn for relaxation from time to time and thus guard against overstraining the powers of his mind m t  p s1 i have not sold out of the buffalo express and shall not neither shall i stop writing for it this remark seems necessary in a business point of view  2 these memoranda are not a humorous department i would not conduct an exclusively and professedly humorous department for any one i would always prefer to have the privilege of printing a serious and sensible remark in case one occurred to me without the readers feeling obliged to consider himself outraged we cannot keep the same mood day after day i am liable some day to want to print my opinion on jurisprudence or homeric poetry or international law and i shall do it it will be of small consequence to me whether the reader survive or not i shall never go straining after jokes when in a cheerless mood so long as the unhackneyed subject of international law is open to me i will leave all that straining to people who edit professedly and inexorably humorous departments and publications  3 i have chosen the general title of memoranda for this department because it is plain and simple and makes no fraudulent promises i can print under it statistics hotel arrivals or anything that comes handy without violating faith with the reader  4 puns cannot be allowed a place in this department inoffensive ignorance benignant stupidity and unostentatious imbecility will always be welcomed and cheerfully accorded a corner and even the feeblest humour will be admitted when we can do no better but no circumstances however dismal will ever be considered a sufficient excuse for the admission of that lastand saddest evidence of intellectual poverty the pun      about smells  in a recent issue of the independent the rev t de witt talmage of brooklyn has the following utterance on the subject of smells        i have a good christian friend who if he sat in the front pew in      church and a working man should enter the door at the other end      would smell him instantly  my friend is not to blame for the      sensitiveness of his nose any more than you would flog a pointer      for being keener on the scent than a stupid watch dog  the fact is      if you had all the churches free by reason of the mixing up of the      common people with the uncommon you would keep onehalf of      christendom sick at their stomach  if you are going to kill the      church thus with bad smells i will have nothing to do with this      work of evangelization  we have reason to believe that there will be labouring men in heaven and also a number of negroes and esquimaux and terra del fuegans and arabs and a few indians and possibly even some spaniards and portuguese all things are possible with god we shall have all these sorts of people in heaven but alas in getting them we shall lose the society of dr talmage which is to say we shall lose the company of one who could give more real tone to celestial society than any other contribution brooklyn could furnish and what would eternal happiness be without the doctor blissful unquestionablywe know that well enoughbut would it be distingue would it be recherche without him st matthew without stockings or sandals st jerome bare headed and with a coarse brown blanket robe dragging the ground st sebastian with scarcely any raiment at allthese we should see and should enjoy seeing them but would we not miss a spiketailed coat and kids and turn away regretfully and say to parties from the orient these are well enough but you ought to see talmage of brooklyn i fear me that in the better world we shall not even have dr talmages good christian friend  for if he were sitting under the glory of the throne and the keeper of the keys admitted a benjamin franklin or other labouring man that friend with his fine natural powers infinitely augmented by emancipation from hampering flesh would detect him with a single sniff and immediately take his hat and ask to be excused  to all outward seeming the rev t de witt talmage is of the same material as that used in the construction of his early predecessors in the ministry and yet one feels that there must be a difference somewhere between him and the saviours first disciples it may be because here in the nineteenth century dr t has had advantages which paul and peter and the others could not and did not have there was a lack of polish about them and a looseness of etiquette and a want of exclusiveness which one cannot help noticing they healed the very beggars and held intercourse with people of a villainous odour every day if the subject of these remarks had been chosen among the original twelve apostles he would not have associated with the rest because he could not have stood the fishy smell of some of his comrades who came from around the sea of galilee he would have resigned his commission with some such remark as he makes in the extract quoted above master if thou art going to kill the church thus with bad smells i will have nothing to do with this work of evangelization he is a disciple and makes that remark to the master the only difference is that he makes it in the nineteenth instead of the first century  is there a choir in mr ts church and does it ever occur that they have no better manners than to sing that hymn which is so suggestive of labourers and mechanics             son of the carpenter receive           this humble work of mine  now can it be possible that in a handful of centuries the christian character has fallen away from an imposing heroism that scorned even the stake the cross and the axe to a poor little effeminacy that withers and wilts under an unsavoury smell we are not prepared to believe so the reverend doctor and his friend to the contrary notwithstanding      a couple of sad experiences  when i published a squib recently in which i said i was going to edit an agricultural department in this magazine i certainly did not desire to deceive anybody i had not the remotest desire to play upon any ones confidence with a practical joke for he is a pitiful creature indeed who will degrade the dignity of his humanity to the contriving of the witless inventions that go by that name i purposely wrote the thing as absurdly and as extravagantly as it could be written in order to be sure and not mislead hurried or heedless readers for i spoke of launching a triumphal barge upon a desert and planting a tree of prosperity in a minea tree whose fragrance should slake the thirst of the naked and whose branches should spread abroad till they washed the chorea of etc etc i thought that manifest lunacy like that would protect the reader but to make assurance absolute and show that i did not and could not seriously mean to attempt an agricultural department i stated distinctly in my postscript that i did not know anything about agriculture but alas right there is where i made my worst mistakefor that remark seems to have recommended my proposed agriculture more than anything else it lets a little light in on me and i fancy i perceive that the farmers feel a little bored sometimes by the oracular profundity of agricultural editors who know it all in fact one of my correspondents suggests this for that unhappy squib has deluged me with letters about potatoes and cabbages and hominy and vermicelli and maccaroni and all the other fruits cereals and vegetables that ever grew on earth and if i get done answering questions about the best way of raising these things before i go raving crazy i shall be thankful and shall never write obscurely for fun any more  shall i tell the real reason why i have unintentionally succeeded in fooling so many people it is because some of them only read a little of the squib i wrote and jumped to the conclusion that it was serious and the rest did not read it at all but heard of my agricultural venture at secondhand those cases i could not guard against of course to write a burlesque so wild that its pretended facts will not be accepted in perfect good faith by somebody is very nearly an impossible thing to do it is because in some instances the reader is a person who never tries to deceive anybody himself and therefore is not expecting any one to wantonly practise a deception upon him and in this case the only person dishonoured is the man who wrote the burlesque in other instances the nub or moral of the burlesqueif its object be to enforce a truthescapes notice in the superior glare of something in the body of the burlesque itself and very often this moral is tagged on at the bottom and the reader not knowing that it is the key of the whole thing and the only important paragraph in the article tranquilly turns up his nose at it and leaves it unread one can deliver a satire with telling force through the insidious medium of a travesty if he is careful not to overwhelm the satire with the extraneous interest of the travesty and so bury it from the readers sight and leave him a joked and defrauded victim when the honest intent was to add to either his knowledge or his wisdom i have had a deal of experience in burlesques and their unfortunate aptness to deceive the public and this is why i tried hard to make that agricultural one so broad and so perfectly palpable that even a oneeyed potato could see it and yet as i speak the solemn truth it fooled one of the ablest agricultural editors in america      dan murphy  one of the saddest things that ever came under my notice said the bankers clerk was there in corning during the war dan murphy enlisted as a private and fought very bravely the boys all liked him and when a wound by and by weakened him down till carrying a musket was too heavy work for him they clubbed together and fixed him up as a sutler he made money then and sent it always to his wife to bank for him she was a washer and ironer and knew enough by hard experience to keep money when she got it she didnt waste a penny on the contrary she began to get miserly as her bank account grew she grieved to part with a cent poor creature for twice in her hardworking life she had known what it was to be hungry cold friendless sick and without a dollar in the world and she had a haunting dread of suffering so again well at last dan died and the boys in testimony of their esteem and respect for him telegraphed to mrs murphy to know if she would like to have him embalmed and sent home when you know the usual custom was to dump a poor devil like him into a shallow hole and then inform his friends what had become of him mrs murphy jumped to the conclusion that it would only cost two or three dollars to embalm her dead husband and so she telegraphed yes it was at the wake that the bill for embalming arrived and was presented to the widow she uttered a wild sad wail that pierced every heart and said sivintyfoive dollars for stoofhn dan blister their sowls did thim divils suppose i was goin to stairt a museim that id be dalin in such expinsive curiassities  the bankers clerk said there was not a dry eye in the house      the tournament in a d 1870  lately there appeared an item to this effect and the same went the customary universal round of the press        a telegraph station has just been established upon the traditional      site of the garden of eden   as a companion to that nothing fits so aptly and so perfectly as this        brooklyn has revived the knightly tournament of the middle ages  it is hard to tell which is the most startling the idea of that highest achievement of human genius and intelligence the telegraph prating away about the practical concerns of the worlds daily life in the heart and home of ancient indolence ignorance and savagery or the idea of that happiest expression of the brag vanity and mockheroics of our ancestors the tournament coming out of its grave to flaunt its tinsel trumpery and perform its chivalrous absurdities in the high noon of the nineteenth century and under the patronage of a great broadawake city and an advanced civilisation  a tournament in lynchburg is a thing easily within the comprehension of the average mind but no commonly gifted person can conceive of such a spectacle in brooklyn without straining his powers brooklyn is part and parcel of the city of new york and there is hardly romance enough in the entire metropolis to resupply a virginia knight with chivalry in case he happened to run out of it let the reader calmly and dispassionately picture to himself listsin brooklyn heralds pursuivants pages garter kingatarmsin brooklyn the marshalling of the fantastic hosts of chivalry in slashed doublets velvet trunks ruffles and plumesin brooklyn mounted on omnibus and liverystable patriarchs promoted and referred to in cold blood as steeds destriers and chargers and divested of their friendly humble namesthese meek old

knight of the secret sorrowin brooklyn and at the toot of the horn charging fiercely upon a helpless ring hung on a post and prodding at it intrepidly with their wooden sticks and by and by skewering

playing three bars of an old circus tuneall in brooklyn in broad daylight and let the reader remember and also add to his picture as follows to wit when the show was all over the party who had shed the most blood and overturned and hacked to pieces the most knights or at least had prodded the most muffinrings was accorded the ancient privilege of naming and crowning the queen of love and beautywhich naming had in reality been done for him by the cutanddried process and long in advance by a committee of ladies but the crowning he did in person though suffering from loss of blood and then was taken to the county hospital on a shutter to have his wounds dressedthese curious things all occurring in brooklyn and no longer ago than one or two yesterdays it seems impossible and yet it is true  this was doubtless the first appearance of the tournament up here among the rollingmills and factories and will probably be the last it will be well to let it retire permanently to the rural districts of virginia where it is said the fine mailed and plumed noblenatured maidenrescuing wrongredressing adventureseeking knight of romance is accepted and believed in by the peasantry with pleasing simplicity while they reject with scorn the plain unpolished verdict whereby history exposes him as a braggart a ruffian a fantastic vagabond and an ignoramus  all romance aside what shape would our admiration of the heroes of ashby de la zouch be likely to take in this practical age if those worthies were to rise up and come here and perform again the chivalrous deeds of that famous passage of arms nothing but a new york jury and the insanity plea could save them from hanging from the amiable boisguilbert and the pleasant frontdeboeuf clear down to the nameless ruffians that entered the riot with unpictured shields and did their first murder and acquired their first claim to respect that day the doings of the socalled chivalry of the middle ages were absurd enough even when they were brutally and bloodily in earnest and when their surroundings of castles and donjons savage landscapes and halfsavage peoples were in keeping but those doings gravely reproduced with tinsel decorations and mock pageantry by bucolic gentlemen with broomstick lances and with muffinrings to represent the foe and all in the midst of the refinement and dignity of a carefullydeveloped modern civilisation is absurdity gone crazy  now for next exhibition let us have a fine representation of one of those chivalrous wholesale butcheries and burnings of jewish women and children which the crusading heroes of romance used to indulge in in their european homes just before starting to the holy land to seize and take to their protection the sepulchre and defend it from pollution      curious relic for sale        for sale for the benefit of the fund for the relief of the widows      and orphans of deceased firemen a curious ancient bedouin pipe      procured at the city of endor in palestine and believed to have      once belonged to the justlyrenowned witch of endor  parties      desiring to examine this singular relic with a view to purchasing      can do so by calling upon daniel s 119 and 121 william street new      york  as per advertisement in the herald a curious old relic indeed as i had a good personal right to know in a single instant of time a long drawn panorama of sights and scenes in the holy land flashed through my memorytown and grove desert camp and caravan clattering after each other and disappearing leaving me with a little of the surprised and dizzy feeling which i have experienced at sundry times when a long express train has overtaken me at some quiet curve and gone whizzing car by car around the corner and out of sight in that prolific instant i saw again all the country from the sea of galilee and nazareth clear to jerusalem and thence over the hills of judea and through the vale of sharon to joppa down by the ocean leaving out unimportant stretches of country and details of incident i saw and experienced the following described matters and things immediately three years fell away from my age and a vanished time was restored to meseptember 1867 it was a flaming oriental daythis one that had come up out of the past and brought along its actors its stageproperties and scenic effectsand our party had just ridden through the squalid hive of human vermin which still holds the ancient biblical name of endor i was bringing up the rear on my grave fourdollar steed who was about beginning to compose himself for his usual noon nap my only fifteen minutes before how the black mangy ninetenths naked tentenths filthy ignorant bigoted besotted hungry lazy malignant screeching crowding struggling wailing begging cursing hateful spawn of the original witch had swarmed out of the caves in the rocks and the holes and crevices in the earth and blocked our horses way besieged us threw themselves in the animals path clung to their manes saddlefurniture and tails asking beseeching demanding bucksheesh bucksheesh bucksheesh we had rained small copper turkish coins among them as fugitives fling coats and hats to pursuing wolves and then had spurred our way through as they stopped to scramble for the largess i was fervently thankful when we had gotten well up on the desolate hillside and outstripped them and left them jawing and gesticulating in the rear what a tempest had seemingly gone roaring and crashing by me and left its dull thunders pulsing in my ears  i was in the rear as i was saying our packmules and arabs were far ahead and dan jack moult davis denny church and birch these names will do as well as any to represent the boys were following close after them as my horse nodded to rest i heard a sort of panting behind me and turned and saw that a tawny youth from the village had overtaken mea true remnant and representative of his ancestress the witcha galvanised scurvy wrought into the human shape and garnished with ophthalmia and leprous scarsan airy creature with an invisible shirtfront that reached below the pit of his stomach and no other clothing to speak of except a tobaccopouch an ammunitionpocket and a venerable gun which was long enough to club any game with that came within shooting distance but far from efficient as an article of dress  i thought to myself now this disease with a human heart in it is going to shoot me i smiled in derision at the idea of a bedouin daring to touch off his greatgrandfathers rusty gun and getting his head blown off for his pains but then it occurred to me in simple schoolboy language suppose he should take deliberate aim and haul off and fetch me with the buttend of it there was wisdom in that view of it and i stopped to parley i found he was only a friendly villain who wanted a trifle of bucksheesh and after begging what he could get in that way was perfectly willing to trade off everything he had for more i believe he would have parted with his last shirt for bucksheesh if he had had one he was smoking the humbliest pipe i ever sawa dingy funnelshaped redclay thing streaked and grimed with oil and tears of tobacco and with all the different kinds of dirt there are and thirty per cent of them peculiar and indigenous to endor and perdition and rank i never smelt anything like it it withered a cactus that stood lifting its prickly hands aloft beside the trail it even woke up my horse i said i would take that it cost me a franc a russian kopek a brass button and a slate pencil and my spendthrift lavishness so won upon the son of the desert that he passed over his pouch of most unspeakably villainous tobacco to me as a free gift what a pipe it was to be sure it had a rude brasswire cover to it and a little coarse iron chain suspended from the bowl with an iron splinter attached to loosen up the tobacco and pick your teeth with the stem looked like the half of a slender walkingstick with the bark on  i felt that this pipe had belonged to the original witch of endor as soon as i saw it and as soon as i smelt it i knew it moreover i asked the arab cub in good english if it was not so and he answered in good arabic that it was i woke up my horse and went my way smoking and presently i said to myself reflectively if there is anything that could make a man deliberately assault a dying cripple i reckon may be an unexpected whiff from this pipe would do it i smoked along till i found i was beginning to lie and project murder and steal my own things out of one pocket and hide them in another and then i put up my treasure took off my spurs and put them under my horses tail and shortly came tearing through our caravan like a hurricane  from that time forward going to jerusalem the dead sea and the jordan bethany bethlehem and everywhere i loafed contentedly in the rear and enjoyed my infamous pipe and revelled in imaginary villany but at the end of two weeks we turned our faces toward the sea and journeyed over the judean hills and through rocky defiles and among the scenes that samson knew in his youth and by and by we touched level ground just at night and trotted off cheerily over the plain of sharon it was perfectly jolly for three hours and we whites crowded along together close after the chief arab muleteer all the packanimals and the other arabs were miles in the rear and we laughed and chatted and argued hotly about samson and whether suicide was a sin or not since paul speaks of samson distinctly as being saved and in heaven but by and by the night air and the duskiness and the weariness of eight hours in the saddle began to tell and conversation flagged and finally died out utterly the squeaksqueaking of the saddles grew very distinct occasionally somebody sighed or started to hum a tune and gave it up now and then a horse sneezed these things only emphasised the solemnity and the stillness everybody got so listless that for once i and my dreamer found ourselves in the lead it was a glad new sensation and i longed to keep the place forevermore every little stir in the dingy cavalcade behind made me nervous davis and i were riding side by side right after the arab about 11 oclock it had become really chilly and the dozing boys roused up and began to inquire how far it was to ramlah yet and to demand that the arab hurry along faster i gave it up then and my heart sank within me because of course they would come up to scold the arab i knew i had to take the rear again in my sorrow i unconsciously took to my pipe my only comfort as i touched the match to it the whole company came lumbering up and crowding my horses rump and flanks a whiff of smoke drifted back over my shoulder and  the suffering moses  whew  by george who opened that graveyard  boys that arabs been swallowing something dead  right away there was a gap behind us whiff after whiff sailed airily back and each one widened the breach within fifteen seconds the barking and gasping and sneezing and coughing of the boys and their angry abuse of the arab guide had dwindled to a murmur and davis and i were alone with the leader davis did not know what the matter was and dont to this day occasionally he caught a faint film of the smoke and fell to scolding at the arab and wondering how long he had been decaying in that way our boys kept on dropping back further and further till at last they were only in hearing not in sight and every time they started gingerly forward to reconnoitreor shoot the arab as they proposed to doi let them get within good fair range of my relic she would carry seventy yards with wonderful precision and then wafted a whiff among them that sent them gasping and strangling to the rear again i kept my gun well charged and ready and twice within the hour i decoyed the boys right up to my horses tail and then with one malarious blast emptied the saddles almost i never heard an arab abused so in my life he really owed his preservation to me because for one entire hour i stood between him and certain death the boys would have killed him if they could have got by me  by and by when the company were far in the rear i put away my pipei was getting fearfully dry and crisp about the gills and rather blown with good diligent workand spurred my animated trance up alongside the arab and stopped him and asked for water he unslung his little gourdshaped earthenware jug and i put it under my moustache and took a long glorious satisfying draught i was going to scour the mouth of the jug a little but i saw that i had brought the whole train together once more by my delay and that they were all anxious to drink tooand would have been long ago if the arab had not pretended that he was out of water so i hastened to pass the vessel to davis he took a mouthful and never said a word but climbed off his horse and lay down calmly in the road i felt sorry for davis it was too late now though and dan was drinking dan got down too and hunted for a soft place i thought i heard dan say that arabs friends ought to keep him in alcohol or else take him out and bury him somewhere all the boys took a drink and climbed down it is not well to go into further particulars let us draw the curtain upon this act                 well now to think that after three changing years i should hear from that curious old relic again and see dan advertising it for sale for the benefit of a benevolent object dan is not treating that present right i gave that pipe to him for a keepsake however he probably finds that it keeps away custom and interferes with business it is the most convincing inanimate object in all this part of the world perhaps dan and i were roommates in all that long quaker city voyage and whenever i desired to have a little season of privacy i used to fire up on that pipe and persuade dan to go out and he seldom waited to change his clothes either in about a quarter or from that to threequarters of a minute he would be propping up the smokestack on the upper deck and cursing i wonder how the faithful old relic is going to sell      a reminiscence of the back settlements  now that corpse said the undertaker patting the folded hands of the deceased approvingly was a brickevery way you took him he was a brick he was so real accommodating and so modestlike and simple in his last moments friends wanted metallic burial casenothing else would do i couldnt get it there warnt going to be timeanybody could see that corpse said never mind shake him up some kind of a box he could stretch out in comfortable he warnt particular bout the general style of it said he went more on room than style any way in the last final container friends wanted a silver doorplate on the coffin signifying who he was and wher he was from now you know a fellow couldnt roust out such a gaily thing as that in a little country town like this what did corpse say corpse said whitewash his old canoe and dob his address and general destination onto it with a blacking brush and a stencil plate long with a verse from some likely hymn or other and pint him for the tomb and mark him c o d and just let him skip along he warnt distressed any more than you beon the contrary just as carm and collected as a hearsehorse said he judged that wher he was going to a body would find it considerable better to attract attention by a picturesque moral character than a natty burial case with a swell doorplate on it splendid man he was id druther do for a corpse like that n any ive tackled in seven year theres some satisfaction in buryin a man like that you feel that what youre doing is appreciated lord bless you sos he got planted before he spiled he was perfectly satisfied said his relations meant well perfectly well but all them preparations was bound to delay the thing more or less and he didnt wish to be kept layin round you never see such a clear head as what he hadand so carm and so cool just a hunk of brains that is what he was perfectly awful it was a ripping distance from one end of that mans head to tother often and over again hes had brain fever araging in one place and the rest of the pile didnt know anything about itdidnt affect it any more than an injun insurrection in arizona affects the atlantic states well the relations they wanted a big funeral but corpse said he was down on flummerydidnt want any processionfill the hearse full of mourners and get out a stern line and tow him behind he was the most down on style of any remains i ever struck a beautiful simpleminded creatureit was what he was you can depend on that he was just set on having things the way he wanted them and he took a solid comfort in laying his little plans he had me measure him and take a whole raft of directions then he had a minister stand up behind a long box with a tablecloth over it and read his funeral sermon saying angcore angcore at the good places and making him scratch out every bit of brag about him and all the hifalutin and then he made them trot out the choir sos he could help them pick out the tunes for the occasion and he got them to sing pop goes the weasel because hed always liked that tune when he was downhearted and solemn music made him sad and when they sung that with tears in their eyes because they all loved him and his relations grieving around he just laid there as happy as a bug and trying to beat time and showing all over how much he enjoyed it and presently he got worked up and excited and tried to join in for mind you he was pretty proud of his abilities in the singing line but the first time he opened his mouth and was just going to spread himself his breath took a walk i never see a man snuffed out so sudden ah it was a great lossit was a powerful loss to this poor little onehorse town well well well i haint got time to be palavering along heregot to nail on the lid and mosey along with him and if youll just give me a lift well skeet him into the hearse and meander along relations bound to have it sodont pay no attention to dying injunctions minute a corpses gone but if i had my way if i didnt respect his last wishes and tow him behind the hearse ill be cussd i consider that whatever a corpse wants done for his comfort is a little enough matter and a man haint got no right to deceive him or take advantage of himand whatever a corpse trusts me to do im agoing to do you know even if its to stuff him and paint him yaller and keep him for a keepsakeyou hear me  he cracked his whip and went lumbering away with his ancient ruin of a hearse and i continued my walk with a valuable lesson learnedthat a healthy and wholesome cheerfulness is not necessarily impossible to any occupation the lesson is likely to be lasting for it will take many months to obliterate the memory of the remarks and circumstances that impressed it      a royal compliment        the latest report about the spanish crown is that it will now be      offered to prince alfonso the second son of the king of portugal      who is but five years of age  the spaniards have hunted through all      the nations of europe for a king  they tried to get a portuguese in      the person of domluis who is an old exmonarch they tried to get      an italian in the person of victor emanuels young son the duke of      genoa they tried to get a spaniard in the person of espartero who      is an octogenarian  some of them desired a french bourbon      montpensier some of them a spanish bourbon the prince of asturias      some of them an english prince one of the sons of queen victoria      they have just tried to get the german prince leopold but they have      thought it better to give him up than take a war along with him      it is a long time since we first suggested to them to try an      american ruler  we can offer them a large number of able and      experienced sovereigns to pick frommen skilled in statesmanship      versed in the science of government and adepts in all the arts of      administrationmen who could wear the crown with dignity and rule      the kingdom at a reasonable expense       there is not the least danger of napoleon threatening them if they      take an american sovereign in fact we have no doubt he would be      pleased to support such a candidature  we are unwilling to mention      namesthough we have a man in our eye whom we wish they had in      theirsnew york tribune  it would be but an ostentation of modesty to permit such a pointed reference to myself to pass unnoticed this is the second time that the tribune no doubt sincerely looking to the best interests of spain and the world at large has done me the great and unusual honour to propose me as a fit person to fill the spanish throne why the tribune should single me out in this way from the midst of a dozen americans of higher political prominence is a problem which i cannot solve beyond a somewhat intimate knowledge of spanish history and a profound veneration for its great names and illustrious deeds i feel that i possess no merit that should peculiarly recommend me to this royal distinction i cannot deny that spanish history has always been mothers milk to me i am proud of every spanish achievement from hernando cortess victory at thermopylae down to vasco nunez de balboas discovery of the atlantic ocean and of every splendid spanish name from don quixote and the duke of wellington down to don caesar de bazan however these little graces of erudition are of small consequence being more showy than serviceable  in case the spanish sceptre is pressed upon meand the indications unquestionably are that it will bei shall feel it necessary to have certain things set down and distinctly understood beforehand for instance my salary must be paid quarterly in advance in these unsettled times it will not do to trust if isabella had adopted this plan she would be roosting on her ancestral throne today for the simple reason that her subjects never could have raised three months of a royal salary in advance and of course they could not have discharged her until they had squared up with her my salary must be paid in gold when greenbacks are fresh in a country they are too fluctuating my salary has got to be put at the ruling market rate i am not going to cut under on the trade and they are not going to trail me a long way from home and then practise on my ignorance and play me for a royal north adams chinaman by any means as i understand it imported kings generally get five millions a year and houserent free young george of greece gets that as the revenues only yield two millions he has to take the national note for considerable but even with things in that sort of shape he is better fixed than he was in denmark where he had to eternally stand up because he had no throne to sit on and had to give bail for his board because a royal apprentice gets no salary there while he is learning his trade england is the place for that fifty thousand dollars a year great britain pays on each royal child that is born and this is increased from year to year as the child becomes more and more indispensable to his country look at prince arthur at first he only got the usual birthbounty but now that he has got so that he can dance there is simply no telling what wages he gets  i should have to stipulate that the spanish people wash more and endeavour to get along with less quarantine do you know spain keeps her ports fast locked against foreign traffic threefourths of each year because one day she is scared about the cholera and the next about the plague and next the measles next the hooping cough the hives and the rash but she does not mind leonine leprosy and elephantiasis any more than a great and enlightened civilisation minds freckles soap would soon remove her anxious distress about foreign distempers the reason arable land is so scarce in spain is because the people squander so much of it on their persons and then when they die it is improvidently buried with them  i should feel obliged to stipulate that marshal serrano be reduced to the rank of constable or even roundsman he is no longer fit to be city marshal a man who refused to be king because he was too old and feeble is ill qualified to help sick people to the stationhouse when they are armed and their form of delirium tremens is of the exuberant and demonstrative kind  i should also require that a force be sent to chase the late queen isabella out of france her presence there can work no advantage to spain and she ought to be made to move at once though poor thing she has been chaste enough heretoforefor a spanish woman  i should also require that  i am at this moment authoritatively informed that the tribune did not mean me after all very well i do not care two cents      the approaching epidemic  one calamity to which the death of mr dickens dooms this country has not awakened the concern to which its gravity entitles it we refer to the fact that the nation is to be lectured to death and read to death all next winter by tom dick and harry with poor lamented dickens for a pretext all the vagabonds who can spell will afflict the people with readings from pickwick and copperfield and all the insignificants who have been ennobled by the notice of the great novelist or transfigured by his smile will make a marketable commodity of it now and turn the sacred reminiscence to the practical use of procuring bread and butter the lecture rostrums will fairly swarm with these fortunates already the signs of it are perceptible behold how the unclean creatures are wending toward the dead lion and gathering to the feast  reminiscences of dickens a lecture by john smith who heard him read eight times  remembrances of charles dickens a lecture by john jones who saw him once in a street car and twice in a barber shop  recollections of mr dickens a lecture by john brown who gained a wide fame by writing deliriously appreciative critiques and rhapsodies upon the great authors public readings and who shook hands with the great author upon various occasions and held converse with him several times  readings from dickens by john white who has the great delineators style and manner perfectly having attended all his readings in this country and made these things a study always practising each reading before retiring and while it was hot from the great delineators lips upon this occasion mr w will exhibit the remains of a cigar which he saw mr dickens smoke this relic is kept in a solid silver box made purposely for it  sights and sounds of the great novelist a popular lecture by john gray who waited on his table all the time he was at the grand hotel new york and still has in his possession and will exhibit to the audience a fragment of the last piece of bread which the lamented author tasted in this country  heart treasures of precious moments with literatures departed monarch a lecture by miss serena amelia tryphenia mcspadden who still wears and will always wear a glove upon the hand made sacred by the clasp of dickens only death shall remove it  readings from dickens by mrs j ohooligan murphy who washed for him  familiar talks with the great author a narrative lecture by john thomas for two weeks his valet in america  and so forth and so on this isnt half the list the man who has a toothpick once used by charles dickens will have to have a hearing and the man who once rode in an omnibus with charles dickens and the lady to whom charles dickens granted the hospitalities of his umbrella during a storm and the person who possesses a hole which once belonged in a handkerchief owned by charles dickens be patient and longsuffering good people for even this does not fill up the measure of what you must endure next winter there is no creature in all this land who has had any personal relations with the late mr dickens however slight or trivial but will shoulder his way to the rostrum and inflict his testimony upon his helpless countrymen to some people it is fatal to be noticed by greatness      the toneimparting committee  when i get old and ponderously respectable only one thing will be able to make me truly happy and that will be to be put on the venerable toneimparting committee of the city of new york and have nothing to do but sit on the platform solemn and imposing along with peter cooper horace greeley etc etc and shed momentary fame at second hand on obscure lecturers draw public attention to lectures which would otherwise clack eloquently to sounding emptiness and subdue audiences into respectful hearing of all sorts of unpopular and outlandish dogmas and isms that is what i desire for the cheer and gratification of my gray hairs let me but sit up there with those fine relics of the old red sandstone period and give tone to an intellectual entertainment twice a week and be so reported and my happiness will be complete those men have been my envy for a long long time and no memories of my life are so pleasant as my reminiscence of their long and honorable career in the toneimparting service i can recollect that first time i ever saw them on the platforms just as well as i can remember the events of yesterday horace greeley sat on the right peter cooper on the left and thomas jefferson red jacket benjamin franklin and john hancock sat between them this was on the 22d of december 1799 on the occasion of the state funeral of george washington in new york it was a great day thata great day and a very very sad one i remember that broadway was one mass of black crape from castle garden nearly up to where the city hall now stands the next time i saw these gentlemen officiate was at a ball given for the purpose of procuring money and medicines for the sick and wounded soldiers and sailors horace greeley occupied one side of the platform on which the musicians were exalted and peter cooper the other there were other toneimparters attendant upon the two chiefs but i have forgotten their names now horace greeley grayhaired and beaming was in sailor costumewhite duck pants blue shirt open at the breast large neckerchief loose as an oxbow and tied with a jaunty sailor knot broad turnover collar with star in the corner shiny black little tarpaulin hat roosting daintily far back on head and flying two gallant long ribbons slippers on ample feet round spectacles on benignant nose and pitchfork in hand completed mr greeley and made him in my boyish admiration every inch a sailor and worthy to be the honored greatgrandfather of the neptune he was so ingeniously representing i shall never forget him mr cooper was dressed as a general of militia and was dismally and oppressively warlike i neglected to remark in the proper place that the soldiers and sailors in whose aid the ball was given had just been sent in from bostonthis was during the war of 1812 at the grand national reception of lafayette in 1824 horace greeley sat on the right and peter cooper to the left the other toneimparters of the day are sleeping the sleep of the just now i was in the audience when horace greeley peter cooper and other chief citizens imparted tone to the great meetings in favor of french liberty in 1848 then i never saw them any more until here lately but now that i am living tolerably near the city i run down every time i see it announced that horace greeley peter cooper and several other distinguished citizens will occupy seats on the platform and next morning when i read in the first paragraph of the phonographic report that horace greeley peter cooper and several other distinguished citizens occupied seats on the platform i say to myself thank god i was present thus i have been enabled to see these substantial old friends of mine sit on the platform and give tone to lectures on anatomy and lectures on agriculture and lectures on stirpiculture and lectures on astronomy on chemistry on miscegenation on is man descended from the kangaroo on veterinary matters on all kinds of religion and several kinds of politics and have seen them give tone and grandeur to the fourlegged girl the siamese twins the great egyptian sword swallower and the old original jacobs whenever somebody is to lecture on a subject not of general interest i know that my venerated remains of the old red sandstone period will be on the platform whenever a lecturer is to appear whom nobody has heard of before nor will be likely to seek to see i know that the real benevolence of my old friends will be taken advantage of and that they will be on the platform and in the bills as an advertisement and whenever any new and obnoxious deviltry in philosophy morals or politics is to be sprung upon the people i know perfectly well that these intrepid old heroes will be on the platform too in the interest of full and free discussion and to crush down all narrower and less generous souls with the solid dead weight of their awful respectability and let us all remember that while these inveterate and imperishable presiders if you please appear on the platform every night in the year as regularly as the volunteered piano from steinways or chickerings and have bolstered up and given tone to a deal of questionable merit and obscure emptiness in their time they have also diversified this inconsequential service by occasional powerful uplifting and upholding of great progressive ideas which smaller men feared to meddle with or countenance      our precious lunatic   from the buffalo express saturday may 14 1870                                                new york may 10  the richardsonmcfarland jury had been out one hour and fifty minutes a breathless silence brooded over court and auditorya silence and a stillness so absolute notwithstanding the vast multitude of human beings packed together there that when some one far away among the throng under the northeast balcony cleared his throat with a smothered little cough it startled everybody uncomfortably so distinctly did it grate upon the pulseless air at that imposing moment the bang of a door was heard then the shuffle of approaching feet and then a sort of surging and swaying disorder among the heads at the entrance from the juryroom told them that the twelve were coming presently all was silent again and the foreman of the jury rose and said  your honor and gentleman we the jury charged with the duty of determining whether the prisoner at the bar daniel mcfarland has been guilty of murder in taking by surprise an unarmed man and shooting him to death or whether the prisoner is afflicted with a sad but irresponsible insanity which at times can be cheered only by violent entertainment with firearms do find as follows namely  that the prisoner daniel mcfarland is insane as above described because  1 his great grandfathers stepfather was tainted with insanity and frequently killed people who were distasteful to him hence insanity is hereditary in the family  2 for nine years the prisoner at the bar did not adequately support his family strong circumstantial evidence of insanity  3 for nine years he made of his home as a general thing a poorhouse sometimes but very rarely a cheery happy habitation frequently the den of a beery drivelling stupefied animal but never as far as ascertained the abiding place of a gentleman these be evidences of insanity  4 he once took his young unmarried sisterinlaw to the museum while there his hereditary insanity came upon him to such a degree that he hiccupped and staggered and afterward on the way home even made love to the young girl he was protecting these are the acts of a person not in his right mind  5 for a good while his sufferings were so great that he had to submit to the inconvenience of having his wife give public readings for the family support and at times when he handed these shameful earnings to the barkeeper his haughty soul was so torn with anguish that he could hardly stand without leaning against something at such times he has been known to shed tears into his sustenance till it diluted to utter inefficiency inattention of this nature is not the act of a democrat unafflicted in mind  6 he never spared expense in making his wife comfortable during her occasional confinements her father is able to testify to this there was always an element of unsoundness about the prisoners generosities that is very suggestive at this time and before this court  7 two years ago the prisoner came fearlessly up behind richardson in the dark and shot him in the leg the prisoners brave and protracted defiance of an adversity that for years had left him little to depend upon for support but a wife who sometimes earned scarcely anything for weeks at a time is evidence that he would have appeared in front of richardson and shot him in the stomach if he had not been insane at the time of the shooting  8 fourteen months ago the prisoner told archibald smith that he was going to kill richardson this is insanity  9 twelve months ago he told marshall p jones that he was going to kill richardson insanity  10 nine months ago he was lurking about richardsons home in new jersey and said he was going to kill richardson insanity  11 seven months ago he showed a pistol to seth brown and said that that was for richardson he said brown testified that at that time it seemed plain that something was the matter with mcfarland for he crossed the street diagonally nine times in fifty yards apparently without any settled reason for doing so and finally fell in the gutter and went to sleep he remarked at the time that mcfarland acted strangebelieved he was insane upon hearing browns evidence john w galen md affirmed at once that mcfarland was insane  12 five months ago mcfarland showed his customary pistol in his customary way to his bedfellow charles a dana and told him he was going to kill richardson the first time an opportunity offered evidence of insanity  13 five months and two weeks ago mcfarland asked john morgan the time of day and turned and walked rapidly away without waiting for an answer almost indubitable evidence of insanity and  14 it is remarkable that exactly one week after this circumstance the prisoner daniel mcfarland confronted albert d richardson suddenly and without warning and shot him dead this is manifest insanity everything we know of the prisoner goes to show that if he had been sane at the time he would have shot his victim from behind  15 there is an absolutely overwhelming mass of testimony to show that an hour before the shooting mcfarland was anxious and uneasy and that five minutes after it he was excited thus the accumulating conjectures and evidences of insanity culminate in this sublime and unimpeachable proof of it therefore  your honor and gentlemenwe the jury pronounce the said daniel mcfarland innocent of murder but calamitously insane  the scene that ensued almost defies description hats handkerchiefs and bonnets were frantically waved above the massed heads in the courtroom and three tremendous cheers and a tiger told where the sympathies of the court and people were then a hundred pursed lips were advanced to kiss the liberated prisoner and many a hand thrust out to give him a congratulatory shakebut presto with a maniacs own quickness and a maniacs own fury the lunatic assassin of richardson fell upon his friends with teeth and nails boots and office furniture and the amazing rapidity with which he broke heads and limbs and rent and sundered bodies till nearly a hundred citizens were reduced to mere quivering heaps of fleshy odds and ends and crimson rags was like nothing in this world but the exultant frenzy of a plunging tearing roaring devil of a steam machine when it snatches a human being and spins him and whirls him till he shreds away to nothingness like a four oclock before the breath of a child  the destruction was awful it is said that within the space of eight minutes mcfarland killed and crippled some six score persons and tore down a large portion of the city hall building carrying away and casting into broadway six or seven marble columns fiftyfour feet long and weighing nearly two tons each but he was finally captured and sent in chains to the lunatic asylum for life  by late telegrams it appears that this is a mistakeeditor express  but the really curious part of this whole matter is yet to be told and that is that mcfarlands most intimate friends believe that the very next time that it ever occurred to him that the insanity plea was not a mere politic pretense was when the verdict came in they think that the startling thought burst upon him then that if twelve good and true men able to comprehend all the baseness of perjury proclaimed under oath that he was a lunatic there was no gainsaying such evidence and that he unquestionably was insane  possibly that was really the way of it it is dreadful to think that maybe the most awful calamity that can befall a man namely loss of reason was precipitated upon this poor prisoners head by a jury that could have hanged him instead and so done him a mercy and his country a service                                postscriptlater  may 11i do not expect anybody to believe so astounding a thing and yet it is the solemn truth that instead of instantly sending the dangerous lunatic to the insane asylum which i naturally supposed they would do and so i prematurely said they had the court has actually set him at liberty comment is unnecessary m t      the european warsfrom the buffalo express july 25 1870                                  first day

thursday evening  i rushed over too soon i shall return home on tuesdays steamer and wait until the war begins m t      the wild man interviewed from the buffalo express september 18 1869  there has been so much talk about the mysterious wild man out there in the west for some time that i finally felt it was my duty to go out and interview him there was something peculiarly and touchingly romantic about the creature and his strange actions according to the newspaper reports he was represented as being hairy longarmed and of great strength and stature ugly and cumbrous avoiding men but appearing suddenly and unexpectedly to women and children going armed with a club but never molesting any creature except sheep or other prey fond of eating and drinking and not particular about the quality quantity or character of the beverages and edibles living in the woods like a wild beast but never angry moaning and sometimes howling but never uttering articulate sounds  such was old shep as the papers painted him i felt that the story of his life must be a sad onea story of suffering disappointment and exilea story of mans inhumanity to man in some shape or otherand i longed to persuade the secret from him                           since you say you are a member of the press said the wild man i am willing to tell you all you wish to know bye and bye you will comprehend why it is that i wish to unbosom myself to a newspaper man when i have so studiously avoided conversation with other people i will now unfold my strange story i was born with the world we live upon almost i am the son of cain  what  i was present when the flood was announced  which  i am the father of the wandering jew  sir  i moved out of range of his club and went on taking notes but keeping a wary eye on him all the while he smiled a melancholy smile and resumed  when i glance back over the dreary waste of ages i see many a glimmering and mark that is familiar to my memory and oh the leagues i have travelled the things i have seen the events i have helped to emphasise i was at the assassination of caesar i marched upon mecca with mahomet i was in the crusades and stood with godfrey when he planted the banner of the cross on the battlements of jerusalem i  one moment please have you given these items to any other journal can i  silence i was in the pintas shrouds with columbus when america burst upon his vision i saw charles i beheaded i was in london when the gunpowder plot was discovered i was present at the trial of warren hastings i was on american soil when the battle of lexington was fought when the declaration was promulgatedwhen cornwallis surrenderedwhen washington died i entered paris with napoleon after elba i was present when you mounted your guns and manned your fleets for the war of 1812when the south fired upon sumterwhen richmond fellwhen the presidents life was taken in all the ages i have helped to celebrate the triumphs of genius the achievements of arms the havoc of storm fire pestilence famine  your career has been a stirring one might i ask how you came to locate in these dull kansas woods when you have been so accustomed to excitement during what i might term so protracted a period not to put too fine a point on it  listen once i was the honoured servitor of the noble and illustrious here he heaved a sigh and passed his hairy hand across his eyes but in these degenerate days i am become the slave of quack doctors and newspapers i am driven from pillar to post and hurried up and down sometimes with stencilplate and pastebrush to defile the fences with cabalistic legends and sometimes in grotesque and extravagant character at the behest of some driving journal i attended to that ocean bank robbery some weeks ago when i was hardly rested from finishing up the powwow about the completion of the pacific railroad immediately i was spirited off to do an atrocious murder for the benefit of the new york papers next to attend the wedding of a patriarchal millionaire next to raise a hurrah about the great boat race and then just when i had begun to hope that my old bones would have a rest i am bundled off to this howling wilderness to strip and jibber and be ugly and hairy and pull down fences and waylay sheep and waltz around with a club and play wild man generallyand all to gratify the whim of a bedlam of crazy newspaper scribblers from one end of the continent to the other i am described as a gorilla with a sort of human seeming about meand all to gratify this quilldriving scum of the earth  poor old carpet bagger  i have been served infamously often in modern and semimodern times i have been compelled by base men to create fraudulent history and to perpetrate all sorts of humbugs i wrote those crazy junius letters i moped in a french dungeon for fifteen years and wore a ridiculous iron mask i poked around your northern forests among your vagabond indians a solemn french idiot personating the ghost of a dead dauphin that the gaping world might wonder if we had a bourbon among us i have played seaserpent off nahant and woollyhorse and whatisit for the museums i have interviewed politicians for the sun worked up all manner of miracles for the herald ciphered up election returns for the world and thundered political economy through the tribune i have done all the extravagant things that the wildest invention could contrive and done them well and this is my rewardplaying wild man in kansas without a shirt  mysterious being a light dawns vaguely upon meit grows apacewhatwhat is your name  sensation  hence horrible shape  it spoke again  oh pitiless fate my destiny hounds me once more i am called i go alas is there no rest for me  in a moment the wild mans features seemed to soften and refine and his form to assume a more human grace and symmetry his club changed to a spade and he shouldered it and started away sighing profoundly and shedding tears  whither poor shade  to dig up the byron family  such was the response that floated back upon the wind as the sad spirit shook its ringlets to the breeze flourished its shovel aloft and disappeared beyond the brow of the hill  all of which is in strict accordance with the facts                                                               m t     last words of great menfrom the buffalo express september 11 1889        marshal neils last words were larmee francaise the french      armyexchange  what a sad thing it is to see a man close a grand career with a plagiarism in his mouth napoleons last words were tete darmee head of the army neither of those remarks amounts to anything as last words and reflect little credit upon the utterers  a distinguished man should be as particular about his last words as he is about his last breath he should write them out on a slip of paper and take the judgment of his friends on them he should never leave such a thing to the last hour of his life and trust to an intellectual spirit at the last moment to enable him to say something smart with his latest gasp and launch into eternity with grandeur noa man is apt to be too much fagged and exhausted both in body and mind at such a time to be reliable and maybe the very thing he wants to say he cannot think of to save him and besides there are his weeping friends bothering around and worse than all as likely as not he may have to deliver his last gasp before he is expecting to a man cannot always expect to think of a natty thing to say under such circumstances and so it is pure egotistic ostentation to put it off there is hardly a case on record where a man came to his last moment unprepared and said a good thinghardly a case where a man trusted to that last moment and did not make a solemn botch of it and go out of the world feeling absurd  now there was daniel webster nobody could tell him anything he was not afraid he could do something neat when the time came and how did it turn out why his will had to be fixed over and then all the relations came and first one thing and then another interfered till at last he only had a chance to say i still live and up he went  of course he didnt still live because he diedand so he might as well have kept his last words to himself as to have gone and made such a failure of it as that a week before that fifteen minutes of calm reflection would have enabled that man to contrive some last words that would have been a credit to himself and a comfort to his family for generations to come  and there was john quincy adams relying on his splendid abilities and his coolness in emergencies he trusted to a happy hit at the last moment to carry him through and what was the result death smote him in the house of representatives and he observed casually this is the last of earth the last of earth why the last of earth when there was so much more left if he had said it was the last rose of summer or the last run of shad it would have had as much point in it what he meant to say was adam was the first and adams is the last of earth but he put it off a trifle too long and so he had to go with that unmeaning observation on his lips  and there we have napoleons tete darmee that dont mean anything taken by itself head of the army is no more important than head of the police and yet that was a man who could have said a good thing if he had barred out the doctor and studied over it a while marshal neil with half a century at his disposal could not dash off anything better in his last moments than a poor plagiarism of another mans words which were not worth plagiarizing in the first place the french army perfectly irrelevantperfectly flatutterly pointless but if he had closed one eye significantly and said the subscriber has made it lively for the french army and then thrown a little of the comic into his last gasp it would have been a thing to remember with satisfaction all the rest of his life i do wish our great men would quit saying these flat things just at the moment they die let us have their nexttothelast words for a while and see if we cannot patch up from them something that will be more satisfactory  the public does not wish to be outraged in this way all the time  but when we come to call to mind the last words of parties who took the trouble to make the proper preparation for the occasion we immediately notice a happy difference in the result  there was chesterfield lord chesterfield had laboured all his life to build up the most shining reputation for affability and elegance of speech and manners the world has ever seen and could you suppose he failed to appreciate the efficiency of characteristic last words in the matter of seizing the successfully driven nail of such a reputation and clinching on the other side for ever not he he prepared himself he kept his eye on the clock and his finger on his pulse he awaited his chance and at last when he knew his time was come he pretended to think a new visitor had entered and so with the rattle in his throat emphasised for dramatic effect he said to the servant shin around john and get the gentleman a chair and so he died amid thunders of applause  next we have benjamin franklin franklin the author of poor richards quaint sayings franklin the immortal axiombuilder who used to sit up at nights reducing the rankest old threadbare platitudes to crisp and snappy maxims that had a nice varnished original look in their regimentals who said virtue is its own reward who said procrastination is the thief of time who said time and tide wait for no man and necessity is the mother of invention good old franklin the josh billings of the eighteenth centurythough sooth to say the latter transcends him in proverbial originality as much as he falls short of him in correctness of orthography what sort of tactics did franklin pursue he pondered over his last words for as much as two weeks and then when the time came he said none but the brave deserve the fair and died happy he could not have said a sweeter thing if he had lived till he was an idiot  byron made a poor business of it and could not think of anything to say at the last moment but augustasisterlady byrontell harriet beecher stoweetc etcbut shakespeare was ready and said england expects every man to do his duty and went off with splendid eclat  and there are other instances of sagacious preparation for a felicitous closing remark for instance  joan of arc said tramp tramp tramp the boys are marching  alexander the great said another of those santa cruz punches if you please  the empress josephine said not for jo and could get no further  cleopatra said the old guard dies but never surrenders  sir walter raleigh said executioner can i take your whetstone a moment please though what for is not clear  john smith said alas i am the last of my race  queen elizabeth said oh i would give my kingdom for one moment morei have forgotten my last words  and red jacket the noblest indian brave that ever wielded a tomahawk in defence of a friendless and persecuted race expired with these touching words upon his lips  wawkawampanoosucwinnebayowallazvsagamoresaskatchewan  there was not a dry eye in the wigwam  let not this lesson be lost upon our public men let them take a healthy moment for preparation and contrive some last words that shall be neat and to the point let louis napoleon say  i am content to follow my unclestill i do not wish to improve upon his last word put me down for tete darmee  and garret davis let me recite the unabridged dictionary  and h g i desire now to say a few words on political economy  and mr bergh only take part of me at a time if the load will be fatiguing to the hearse horses  and andrew johnson i have been an alderman member of congress governor senator presadieu you know the rest  and seward alaska  and grant o  all of which is respectfully submitted with the most honorable intentions m t  p si am obliged to leave out the illustrations the artist finds it impossible to make a picture of peoples last words
