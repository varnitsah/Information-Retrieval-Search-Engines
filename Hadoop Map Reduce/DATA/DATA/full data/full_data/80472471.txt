80472471	clarence   by bret harte     part i     chapter i    as clarence brant president of the robles land company and husband of the rich widow of john peyton of the robles ranche mingled with the outgoing audience of the cosmopolitan theatre at san francisco he elicited the usual smiling nods and recognition due to his good looks and good fortune but as he hurriedly slipped through the still lingering winters rain into the smart coupe that was awaiting him and gave the order home the word struck him with a peculiarly ironical significance his home was a handsome one and lacked nothing in appointment and comfort but he had gone to the theatre to evade its hollow loneliness nor was it because his wife was not there for he had a miserable consciousness that her temporary absence had nothing to do with his homelessness the distraction of the theatre over that dull vague but aching sense of loneliness which was daily growing upon him returned with greater vigor  he leaned back in the coupe and gloomily reflected  he had been married scarcely a year yet even in the illusions of the honeymoon the woman older than himself and the widow of his old patron had half unconsciously reasserted herself and slipped back into the domination of her old position it was at first pleasant enoughthis halfmaternal protectorate which is apt to mingle even with the affections of younger womenand clarence in his easy halffeminine intuition of the sex yielded as the strong are apt to yield through the very consciousness of their own superiority but this is a quality the weaker are not apt to recognize and the woman who has once tasted equal power with her husband not only does not easily relegate it but even makes its continuance a test of the affections the usual triumphant feminine conclusion then you no longer love me had in clarences brief experience gone even further and reached its inscrutable climax then i no longer love you although shown only in a momentary hardening of the eye and voice and added to this was his sudden but confused remembrance that he had seen that eye and heard that voice in marital altercation during judge peytons life and that he himself her boy partisan had sympathized with her yet strange to say this had given him more pain than her occasional other reversions to the pastto her old suspicious of him when he was a youthful protege of her husband and a presumed suitor of her adopted daughter susy high natures are more apt to forgive wrong done to themselves than any abstract injustice and her capricious tyranny over her dependents and servants or an unreasoning enmity to a neighbor or friend outraged his finer sense more than her own misconception of himself nor did he dream that this was a thing most women seldom understand or understanding ever forgive  the coupe rattled over the stones or swirled through the muddy pools of the main thoroughfares newspaper and telegraphic offices were still brilliantly lit and crowds were gathered among the bulletin boards he knew that news had arrived from washington that evening of the first active outbreaks of secession and that the city was breathless with excitement had he not just come from the theatre where certain insignificant allusions in the play had been suddenly caught up and cheered or hissed by hitherto unknown partisans to the dumb astonishment of a majority of the audience comfortably settled to moneygetting and their own affairs alone had he not applauded albeit halfscornfully the pretty actresshis old playmate susywho had audaciously and all incongruously waved the american flag in their faces yes he had known it had lived for the last few weeks in an atmosphere electrically surcharged with itand yet it had chiefly affected him in his personal homelessness for his wife was a southerner a born slaveholder and a secessionist whose noted prejudices to the north had even outrun her late husbands politics at first the piquancy and recklessness of her opinionative speech amused him as part of her characteristic flavor or as a lingering youthfulness which the maturer intellect always pardons he had never taken her politics seriouslywhy should he with her head on his shoulder he had listened to her extravagant diatribes against the north he had forgiven her outrageous indictment of his caste and his associates for the sake of the imperious but handsome lips that uttered it but when he was compelled to listen to her words echoed and repeated by her friends and family when he found that with the clannishness of her race she had drawn closer to them in this controversythat she depended upon them for her intelligence and information rather than upon himhe had awakened to the reality of his situation he had borne the allusions of her brother whose old scorn for his dependent childhood had been embittered by his sisters marriage and was now scarcely concealed yet while he had never altered his own political faith and social creed in this antagonistic atmosphere he had often wondered with his old conscientiousness and characteristic selfabnegation whether his own political convictions were not merely a revulsion from his domestic tyranny and alien surroundings  in the midst of this gloomy retrospect the coupe stopped with a jerk before his own house the door was quickly opened by a servant who appeared to be awaiting him  some one to see you in the library sir said the man andhe hesitated and looked towards the coupe  well said clarence impatiently  he said sir as how you were not to send away the carriage  indeed and who is it demanded clarence sharply  mr hooker he said i was to say jim hooker  the momentary annoyance in clarences face changed to a look of reflective curiosity  he said he knew you were at the theatre and he would wait until you came home continued the man dubiously watching his masters face he dont know youve come in sir andand i can easily get rid of him  no matter now ill see him and added clarence with a faint smile let the carriage wait  yet as he turned towards the library he was by no means certain that an interview with the old associate of his boyhood under judge peytons guardianship would divert his mind yet he let no trace of his doubts nor of his past gloom show in his face as he entered the room  mr hooker was apparently examining the elegant furniture and luxurious accommodation with his usual resentful enviousness clarence had got a soft thing that it was more or less the result of his artfulness and that he was unduly puffed up by it was in hookers characteristic reasoning equally clear as his host smilingly advanced with outstretched hand mr hookers efforts to assume a proper abstraction of manner and contemptuous indifference to clarences surroundings which should wound his vanity ended in his lolling back at full length in the chair with his eyes on the ceiling but remembering suddenly that he was really the bearer of a message to clarence it struck him that his supine position was from a theatrical viewpoint infelicitous in his experiences of the stage he had never delivered a message in that way he rose awkwardly to his feet  it was so good of you to wait said clarence courteously  saw you in the theatre said hooker brusquely third row in parquet susy said it was you and had suthin to say to you suthin you ought to know he continued with a slight return of his old mystery of manner which clarence so well remembered you saw hershe fetched the house with that flag business eh she knows which way the cat is going to jump you bet i tell you for all the blowing of these secessionists the unions goin to pay yes sir he stopped glanced round the handsome room and added darkly mebbee better than this  with the memory of hookers characteristic fondness for mystery still in his mind clarence overlooked the innuendo and said smilingly  why didnt you bring mrs hooker here i should have been honored with her company  mr hooker frowned slightly at this seeming levity  never goes out after a performance nervous exhaustion left her at our rooms in market street we can drive there in ten minutes thats why i asked to have the carriage wait  clarence hesitated without caring in the least to renew the acquaintance of his old playmate and sweetheart a meeting that night in some vague way suggested to him a providential diversion nor was he deceived by any gravity in the message with his remembrance of susys theatrical tendencies he was quite prepared for any capricious futile extravagance  you are sure we will not disturb her he said politely  no  clarence led the way to the carriage if mr hooker expected him during the journey to try to divine the purport of susys message he was disappointed his companion did not allude to it possibly looking upon it as a combined theatrical performance clarence preferred to wait for susy as the better actor the carriage rolled rapidly through the now deserted streets and at last under the directions of mr hooker who was leaning half out of the window it drew up at a middleclass restaurant above whose still lit and steaming windows were some ostentatiously public apartments accessible from a side entrance as they ascended the staircase together it became evident that mr hooker was scarcely more at his ease in the character of host than he had been as guest he stared gloomily at a descending visitor grunted audibly at a waiter in the passage and stopped before a door where a recently deposited tray displayed the halfeaten carcase of a fowl an empty champagne bottle two halffilled glasses and a faded bouquet the whole passage was redolent with a singular blending of damp cooking stale cigarette smoke and patchouli  putting the tray aside with his foot mr hooker opened the door hesitatingly and peered into the room muttered a few indistinct words which were followed by a rapid rustling of skirts and then with his hand still on the doorknob turning to clarence who had discreetly halted on the threshold flung the door open theatrically and bade him enter  she is somewhere in the suite he added with a large wave of the hand towards a door that was still oscillating be here in a minit  clarence took in the apartment with a quiet glance its furniture had the frayed and discolored splendors of a public parlor which had been privately used and maltreated there were stains in the large medallioned carpet the gilded veneer had been chipped from a heavy centre table showing the rough white deal beneath which gave it the appearance of a stage property the walls paneled with giltframed mirrors reflected every domestic detail or private relaxation with shameless publicity a damp waterproof shawl and open newspaper were lying across the once brilliant sofa a powderpuff a plate of fruit and a playbook were on the centre table and on the marbletopped sideboard was mr hookers secondbest hat with a soiled collar evidently but lately exchanged for the one he had on peeping over its brim the whole apartment seemed to mingle the furtive disclosures of the dressingroom with the open ostentations of the stage with even a slight suggestion of the auditorium in a few scattered programmes on the floor and chairs  the inner door opened again with a slight theatrical start and susy in an elaborate dressinggown moved languidly into the room she apparently had not had time to change her underskirt for there was the dust of the stage on its delicate lace edging as she threw herself into an armchair and crossed her pretty slippered feet before her her face was pale its pallor incautiously increased by powder and as clarence looked at its still youthful charming outline he was not perhaps sorry that the exquisite pink and white skin beneath which he had once kissed was hidden from that awakened recollection yet there was little trace of the girlish susy in the pretty but prematurely jaded actress before him and he felt momentarily relieved it was her youth and freshness appealing to his own youth and imagination that he had lovednot her yet as she greeted him with a slight exaggeration of glance voice and manner he remembered that even as a girl she was an actress  nothing of this however was in his voice and manner as he gently thanked her for the opportunity of meeting her again and he was frank for the diversion he had expected he had found he even was conscious of thinking more kindly of his wife who had supplanted her  i told jim he must fetch you if he had to carry you she said striking the palm of her hand with her fan and glancing at her husband i reckon he guessed why though i didnt tell himi dont tell jim everything  here jim rose and looking at his watch guessed hed run over to the lick house and get some cigars if he was acting upon some hint from his wife his simulation was so badly done that clarence felt his first sense of uneasiness but as hooker closed the door awkwardly and unostentatiously behind him clarence smilingly said he had waited to hear the message from her own lips  jim only knows what hes heard outside the talk of men you knowand he hears a good deal of thatmore perhaps than you do it was that which put me up to finding out the truth and i didnt rest till i did im not to be fooled clarenceyou dont mind my calling you clarence now were both married and done forand im not the kind to be fooled by anybody from the cow countiesand thats the robles ranche im a southern woman myself from missouri but im for the union first last and all the time and i call myself a match for any lazy dawdling lashswinging slaveholder and slaveholderesswhether theyre mixed blood heaven only knows or whator their friends or relations or the dirty halfspanish grandees and their mixed halfnigger peons who truckle to them you bet  his blood had stirred quickly at the mention of the robles ranche but the rest of susys speech was too much in the vein of her old extravagance to touch him seriously he found himself only considering how strange it was that the old petulance and impulsiveness of her girlhood were actually bringing back with them her pink cheeks and brilliant eyes  you surely didnt ask jim to bring me here he said smilingly to tell me that mrs peytonhe corrected himself hastily as a malicious sparkle came into susys blue eyesthat my wife was a southern woman and probably sympathized with her class well i dont know that i should blame her for that any more than she should blame me for being a northern man and a unionist  and she doesnt blame you asked susy sneeringly  the color came slightly to clarences cheek but before he could reply the actress added  no she prefers to use you  i dont think i understand you said clarence rising coldly  no you dont understand her retorted susy sharply look here clarence brant youre right i didnt ask you here to tell youwhat you and everybody knowsthat your wife is a southerner i didnt ask you here to tell you what everybody suspectsthat she turns you round her little finger but i did ask you here to tell you what nobody not even you suspectsbut what i knowand that is that shes a traitorand more a spyand that ive only got to say the word or send that man jim to say the word to have her dragged out of her copperhead den at robles ranche and shut up in fort alcatraz this very night  still with the pink glowing in her rounding cheek and eyes snapping like splintered sapphires she rose to her feet with her pretty shoulders lifted her small hands and white teeth both tightly clenched and took a step towards him even in her attitude there was a reminiscence of her willful childhood although still blended with the provincial actress whom he had seen on the stage only an hour ago thoroughly alarmed at her threat in his efforts to conceal his feelings he was not above a weak retaliation stepping back he affected to regard her with a critical admiration that was only half simulated and said with a smile  very well donebut you have forgotten the flag  she did not flinch rather accepting the sarcasm as a tribute to her art she went on with increasing exaggeration no it is you who have forgotten the flagforgotten your country your people your manhoodeverything for that hightoned doubledyed old spy and traitress for while you are standing here your wife is gathering under her roof at robles a gang of spies and traitors like herselfsecession leaders and their bloated drunken chivalry yes you may smile your superior smile but i tell you clarence brant that with all your smartness and book learning you know no more of what goes on around you than a child but others do this conspiracy is known to the government the federal officers have been warned general sumner has been sent out hereand his first act was to change the command at fort alcatraz and send your wifes southern friendcaptain pinckneyto the right about yeseverything is known but one thing and that is where and how this precious crew meet that i alone know and that ive told you  and i suppose said clarence with an unchanged smile that this valuable information came from your husbandmy old friend jim hooker  no she answered sharply it comes from cenchoone of your own peonswho is more true to you and the old rancho than you have ever been he saw what was going on and came to me to warn you  but why not to me directly asked clarence with affected incredulity  ask him she said viciously perhaps he didnt want to warn the master against the mistress perhaps he thought we are still friends perhapsshe hesitated with a lower voice and a forced smileperhaps he used to see us together in the old times  very likely said clarence quietly and for the sake of those old times susy he went on with a singular gentleness that was quite distinct from his paling face and set eyes i am going to forget all that you have just said of me and mine in all the old willfulness and impatience that i see you still keepwith all your old prettiness he took his hat from the table and gravely held out his hand  she was frightened for a moment with his impassive abstraction in the old days she had known ithad believed it was his dogged obstinacybut she knew the hopelessness of opposing it yet with feminine persistency she again threw herself against it as against a wall  you dont believe me well go and see for yourself they are at robles now if you catch the early morning stage at santa clara you will come upon them before they disperse dare you try it  whatever i do he returned smilingly i shall always be grateful to you for giving me this opportunity of seeing you again as you were make my excuses to your husband goodnight  clarence  but he had already closed the door behind him his face did not relax its expression nor change as he looked again at the tray with its broken viands before the door the worn stained hall carpet or the waiter who shuffled past him he was apparently as critically conscious of them and of the close odors of the hall and the atmosphere of listless decay and faded extravagance around him as before the interview but if the woman he had just parted from had watched him she would have supposed he still utterly disbelieved her story yet he was conscious that all that he saw was a part of his degradation for he had believed every word she had uttered through all her extravagance envy and revengefulness he saw the central truththat he had been deceivednot by his wife but by himself he had suspected all this before this was what had been really troubling himthis was what he had put aside rather than his faith not in her but in his ideal he remembered letters that had passed between her and captain pinckneyletters that she had openly sent to notorious southern leaders her nervous anxiety to remain at the rancho the innuendoes and significant glances of friends which he had put asideas he had this womans message susy had told him nothing new of his wifebut the truth of himself and the revelation came from people who he was conscious were the inferiors of himself and his wife to an independent proud and selfmade man it was the culminating stroke  in the same abstracted voice he told the coachman to drive home the return seemed interminablethough he never shifted his position yet when he drew up at his own door and looked at his watch he found he had been absent only half an hour only half an hour as he entered the house he turned with the same abstraction towards a mirror in the hall as if he expected to see some outward and visible change in himself in that time dismissing his servants to bed he went into his dressingroom completely changed his attire put on a pair of long ridingboots and throwing a serape over his shoulders paused a moment took a pair of small derringer pistols from a box put them in his pockets and then slipped cautiously down the staircase a lack of confidence in his own domestics had invaded him for the first time the lights were out he silently opened the door and was in the street  he walked hastily a few squares to a livery stable whose proprietor he knew his first inquiry was for one redskin a particular horse the second for its proprietor happily both were in the proprietor asked no question of a customer of clarences condition the horse half spanish powerful and irascible was quickly saddled as clarence mounted the man in an impulse of sociability said  saw you at the theatre tonight sir  ah returned clarence quietly gathering up the reins  rather a smart trick of that woman with the flag he went on tentatively then with a possible doubt of his customers politics he added with a forced smile i reckon its all party fuss though there aint any real danger  but fast as clarence might ride the words lingered in his ears he saw through the mans hesitation he too had probably heard that clarence brant weakly sympathized with his wifes sentiments and dared not speak fully and he understood the cowardly suggestion that there was no real danger it had been clarences one fallacy he had believed the public excitement was only a temporary outbreak of partisan feeling soon to subside even now he was conscious that he was less doubtful of the integrity of the union than of his own household it was not the devotion of the patriot but the indignation of an outraged husband that was spurring him on  he knew that if he reached woodville by five oclock he could get ferried across the bay at the embarcadero and catch the down coach to fair plains whence he could ride to the rancho as the coach did not connect directly with san francisco the chance of his surprising them was greater once clear of the city outskirts he bullied redskin into irascible speed and plunged into the rainy darkness of the highroad the way was familiar for a while he was content to feel the buffeting caused by his rapid pace of wind and rain against his depressed head and shoulders in a sheer brutal sense of opposition and power or to relieve his pentup excitement by dashing through overflowed gullies in the road or across the quaggy sodden edges of meadowland until he had controlled redskins rebellious extravagance into a long steady stride then he raised his head and straightened himself on the saddle to think but to no purpose he had no plan everything would depend upon the situation the thought of forestalling any action of the conspirators by warning or calling in the aid of the authorities for an instant crossed his mind but was as instantly dismissed he had but an instinctto see with his own eyes what his reason told him was true day was breaking through drifting scud and pewtercolored clouds as he reached woodville ferry checkered with splashes of the soil and the spume of his horse from whose neck and flanks the sweat rolled like lather yet he was not conscious how intent had been his purpose until he felt a sudden instinctive shock on seeing that the ferryboat was gone for an instant his wonderful selfpossession abandoned him he could only gaze vacantly at the leadencolored bay without a thought or expedient but in another moment he saw that the boat was returning from the distance had he lost his only chance he glanced hurriedly at his watch he had come more quickly than he imagined there would still be time he beckoned impatiently to the ferryman the boata ships pinnace with two men in itcrept in with exasperating slowness at last the two rowers suddenly leaped ashore  ye might have come before with the other passenger we dont reckon to run lightnin trips on this ferry  but clarence was himself again twenty dollars for two more oars in that boat he said quietly and fifty if you get me over in time to catch the down stage  the man glanced at clarences eyes run up and rouse out jake and sam he said to the other boatman then more leisurely gazing at his customers travelstained equipment he said there must have been a heap o passengers got left by last nights boat youre the second man that took this route in a hurry  at any other time the coincidence might have struck clarence but he only answered curtly unless we are under way in ten minutes you will find i am not the second man and that our bargains off  but here two men emerged from the shanty beside the ferryhouse and tumbled sleepily into the boat clarence seized an extra pair of sculls that were standing against the shed and threw them into the stern i dont mind taking a hand myself for exercise he said quietly  the ferryman glanced again at clarences travelworn figure and determined eyes with mingled approval and surprise he lingered a moment with his oars lifted looking at his passenger it aint no business o mine young man he said deliberately but i reckon you understand me when i say that ive just taken another man over there  i do said clarence impatiently  and you still want to go  certainly replied clarence with a cold stare taking up his oars  the man shrugged his shoulders bent himself for the stroke and the boat sprung forward the others rowed strongly and rapidly the tough ashen blades springing like steel from the water the heavy boat seeming to leap in successive bounds until they were fairly beyond the curving inshore current and clearing the placid misty surface of the bay clarence did not speak but bent abstractedly over his oar the ferryman and his crew rowed in equal panting silence a few startled ducks whirred before them but dropped again to rest in half an hour they were at the embarcadero the time was fairly up clarences eyes were eagerly bent for the first appearance of the stagecoach around the little promontory the ferryman was as eagerly scanning the bare empty street of the still sleeping settlement  i dont see him anywhere said the ferryman with a glance half of astonishment and half of curiosity at his solitary passenger  see whom asked clarence carelessly as he handed the man his promised fee  the other man i ferried over to catch the stage he must have gone on without waiting youre in luck young fellow  i dont understand you said clarence impatiently what has your previous passenger to do with me  well i reckon you know best hes the kind of man ginrally speaking that other men in a powful hurry dont care to meetand az a rule dont foller arter its ginrally the other way  what do you mean inquired clarence sternly of whom are you speaking  the chief of police of san francisco      chapter ii   the laugh that instinctively broke from clarences lips was so sincere and unaffected that the man was disconcerted and at last joined in it a little shamefacedly the grotesque blunder of being taken as a fugitive from justice relieved clarences mind from its acute tensionhe was momentarily divertedand it was not until the boatman had departed and he was again alone that it seemed to have any collateral significance then an uneasy recollection of susys threat that she had the power to put his wife in fort alcatraz came across him could she have already warned the municipal authorities and this man but he quickly remembered that any action from such a warning could only have been taken by the united states marshal and not by a civic official and dismissed the idea  nevertheless when the stage with its halfspent lamps still burning dimly against the morning light swept round the curve and rolled heavily up to the rude shanty which served as coachoffice he became watchful a single yawning individual in its doorway received a few letters and parcels but clarence was evidently the only waiting passenger any hope that he might have entertained that his mysterious predecessor would emerge from some seclusion at that moment was disappointed as he entered the coach he made a rapid survey of his fellowtravelers but satisfied himself that the stranger was not among them they were mainly small traders or farmers a miner or two and apparently a spanishamerican of better degree and personality possibly the circumstance that men of this class usually preferred to travel on horseback and were rarely seen in public conveyances attracted his attention and their eyes met more than once in mutual curiosity presently clarence addressed a remark to the stranger in spanish he replied fluently and courteously but at the next stoppingplace he asked a question of the expressman in an unmistakable missouri accent clarences curiosity was satisfied he was evidently one of those early american settlers who had been so long domiciled in southern california as to adopt the speech as well as the habiliments of the spaniard  the conversation fell upon the political news of the previous night or rather seemed to be lazily continued from some previous more excited discussion in which one of the contestantsa redbearded minerhad subsided into an occasional growl of surly dissent it struck clarence that the missourian had been an amused auditor and even judging from a twinkle in his eye a mischievous instigator of the controversy he was not surprised therefore when the man turned to him with a certain courtesy and said  and what sir is the political feeling in your district  but clarence was in no mood to be drawn out and replied almost curtly that as he had come only from san francisco they were probably as well informed on that subject as himself a quick and searching glance from the strangers eye made him regret his answer but in the silence that ensued the redbearded miner evidently still rankling at heart saw his opportunity slapping his huge hands on his knees and leaning far forward until he seemed to plunge his flaming beard like a firebrand into the controversy he said grimly  well i kin tell you genlmen this it aint goin to be no matter wots the political feeling here or tharit aint goin to be no matter wots the states rights and wots fedral rightsit aint goin to be no question whether the govments got the right to relieve its own soldiers that those secesh is besieging in fort sumter or whether they haventbut the first gun thats fired at the flag blows the chains off every dn nigger south of mason and dixons line you hear me im shoutin and whether you call yourselves secesh or union or copperhead or peace men youve got to face it  there was an angry start in one or two of the seats one man caught at the swinging sidestrap and half rose a husky voice began its a ddand then all as suddenly subsided every eye was turned to an insignificant figure in the back seat it was a woman holding a child on her lap and gazing out of the window with her sexs profound unconcern in politics clarence understood the rude chivalry of the road well enough to comprehend that this unconscious but omnipotent figure had more than once that day controlled the passions of the disputants they dropped back weakly to their seats and their mutterings rolled off in the rattle of the wheels clarence glanced at the missourian he was regarding the redbearded miner with a singular curiosity  the rain had ceased but the afternoon shadows were deepening when they at last reached fair plains where clarence expected to take horse to the rancho he was astonished however to learn that all the horses in the stable were engaged but remembering that some of his own stock were in pasturage with a tenant at fair plains and that he should probably have a better selection he turned his steps thither passing out of the stableyard he recognized the missourians voice in whispered conversation with the proprietor but the two men withdrew into the shadow as he approached an illdefined uneasiness came over him he knew the proprietor who also seemed to know the missourian and this evident avoidance of him was significant perhaps his reputation as a doubtful unionist had preceded him but this would not account for their conduct in a district so strongly southern in sympathy as fair plains more impressed by the occurrence than he cared to admit when at last after some delay he had secured his horse and was once more in the saddle he kept a sharp lookout for his quondam companion but here another circumstance added to his suspicions there was a main road leading to santa inez the next town and the rancho and this clarence had purposely taken in order to watch the missourian but there was also a cutoff directly to the rancho known only to the habitues of the rancho after a few moments rapid riding on a mustang much superior to any in the hotel stables he was satisfied that the stranger must have taken the cutoff putting spurs to his horse he trusted still to precede him to the ranchoif that were his destination  as he dashed along the familiar road by a strange perversity of fancy instead of thinking of his purpose he found himself recalling the first time he had ridden that way in the flush of his youth and hopefulness the girlsweetheart he was then going to rejoin was now the wife of another the woman who had been her guardian was now his own wife he had accepted without a pang the young girls dereliction but it was through her revelation that he was now about to confront the dereliction of his own wife and this was the reward of his youthful trust and loyalty a bitter laugh broke from his lips it was part of his still youthful selfdelusion that he believed himself wiser and stronger for it  it was quite dark when he reached the upper field or first terrace of the rancho he could see the white walls of the casa rising dimly out of the green sea of early wild grasses like a phantom island it was here that the cutoff joined the main roadnow the only one that led to the casa he was satisfied that no one could have preceded him from fair plains but it was true that he must take precautions against his own discovery dismounting near a clump of willows he unsaddled and unbridled his horse and with a cut of the riata over its haunches sent it flying across the field in the direction of a band of feeding mustangs which it presently joined then keeping well in the shadow of a belt of shruboaks he skirted the long lesser terraces of the casa intending to approach the house by way of the old garden and corral a drizzling rain occasionally driven by the wind into long misty curtainlike waves obscured the prospect and favored his design he reached the low adobe wall of the corral in safety looking over he could detect in spite of the darkness that a number of the horses were of alien brands and even recognized one or two from the santa inez district the vague outline of buggies and carryalls filled the long shed beside the stables there was company at the casaso far susy was right  nevertheless lingering still by the wall of the old garden for the deepening of night his nervous feverishness was again invaded and benumbed by sullen memories there was the opening left by the old grille in the wall behind which mrs peyton stood on the morning when he thought he was leaving the ranch forever where he had first clasped her in his arms and stayed a turn of the head a moments indecision a single glance of a languorous eye had brought this culmination and now he stood again before that ruined grille his house and lands even his name misused by a mad scheming enthusiast and himself a creeping spy of his own dishonor he turned with a bitter smile again to the garden a few dark red castilian roses still leaned forward and swayed in the wind with dripping leaves it was here that the first morning of his arrival he had kissed susy the perfume and color of her pink skin came back to him with a sudden shock as he stood there he caught at a flower drew it towards him inhaled its odor in a long breath that left him faint and leaning against the wall then again he smiled but this time more wickedlyin what he believed his cynicism had sprung up the first instinct of revenge  it was now dark enough for him to venture across the carriage road and make his way to the rear of the house his first characteristic instinct had been to enter openly at his own front gate but the terrible temptation to overhear and watch the conspiracy unobservedthat fascination common to deceived humanity to witness its own shamehad now grown upon him he knew that a word or gesture of explanation apology appeal or even terror from his wife would check his rage and weaken his purpose his perfect knowledge of the house and the security of its inmates would enable him from some obscure landing or gallery to participate in any secret conclave they might hold in the patiothe only place suitable for so numerous a rendezvous the absence of light in the few external windows pointed to this central gathering and he had already conceived his plan of entrance  gaining the rear wall of the casa he began cautiously to skirt its brambly base until he had reached a long ovenlike window half obliterated by a monstrous passion vine it was the window of what had once been mrs peytons boudoir the window by which he had once forced an entrance to the house when it was in the hands of squatters the window from which susy had signaled her spanish lover the window whose grating had broken the neck of judge peytons presumed assassin but these recollections no longer delayed him the moment for action had arrived he knew that since the tragedy the boudoir had been dismantled and shunned the servants believed it to be haunted by the assassins ghost with the aid of the passion vine the ingress was easy the interior window was open the rustle of dead leaves on the bare floor as he entered and the whir of a frightened bird by his ear told the story of its desolation and the source of the strange noises that had been heard there the door leading to the corridor was lightly bolted merely to keep it from rattling in the wind slipping the bolt with the blade of his pocketknife he peered into the dark passage the light streaming under a door to the left and the sound of voices convinced him that his conjecture was right and the meeting was gathered on the broad balconies around the patio he knew that a narrow gallery faced with venetian blinds to exclude the sun looked down upon them he managed to gain it without discovery luckily the blinds were still down between their slats himself invisible he could hear and see everything that occurred  yet even at this supreme moment the first thing that struck him was the almost ludicrous contrast between the appearance of the meeting and its tremendous object whether he was influenced by any previous boyish conception of a clouded and gloomy conspiracy he did not know but he was for an instant almost disconcerted by the apparent levity and festivity of the conclave decanters and glasses stood on small tables before them nearly all were drinking and smoking they comprised fifteen or twenty men some of whose faces were familiar to him elsewhere as southern politicians a few he was shocked to see were wellknown northern democrats occupying a characteristically central position was the famous colonel starbottle of virginia jaunty and youthfullooking in his masklike beardless face expansive and dignified in his middleaged port and carriage he alone retained some of the importancealbeit slightly theatrical and affectedof the occasion clarence in his first hurried glance had not observed his wife and for a moment had felt relieved but as colonel starbottle arose at that moment and with a studiously chivalrous and courtly manner turned to his right he saw that she was sitting at the further end of the balcony and that a man whom he recognized as captain pinckney was standing beside her the blood quickly tightened around his heart but left him cold and observant  it was seldom indeed remarked colonel starbottle placing his fat fingers in the frill of his shirt front that a movement like this was graced with the actual presence of a lofty inspiring yet delicate spirita boadiceaindeed he might say a joan of arcin the person of their charming hostess mrs brant not only were they favored by her social and hospitable ministration but by her active and enthusiastic cooperation in the glorious work they had in hand it was through her correspondence and earnest advocacy that they were to be favored tonight with the aid and counsel of one of the most distinguished and powerful men in the southern district of california judge beeswinger of los angeles he had not the honor of that gentlemans personal acquaintance he believed he was not far wrong in saying that this was also the misfortune of every gentleman present but the name itself was a tower of strength he would go further and say that mrs brant herself was personally unacquainted with him but it was through the fervor poetry grace and genius of her correspondence with that gentleman that they were to have the honor of his presence that very evening it was understood that advices had been received of his departure and that he might be expected at robles at any moment  but what proof have we of judge beeswingers soundness said a lazy southern voice at the conclusion of colonel starbottles periods nobody here seems to know him by sight is it not risky to admit a man to our meeting whom we are unable to identify  i reckon nobody but a fool or some prying mudsill of a yankee would trust his skin here returned another and if he did wed know what to do with him  but clarences attention was riveted on his wife and the significant speech passed him as unheeded as had the colonels rhetoric she was looking very handsome and slightly flushed with a proud light in her eyes that he had never seen before absorbed in the discussion she seemed to be paying little attention to captain pinckney as she rose suddenly to her feet  judge beeswinger will be attended here by mr macniel of the fair plains hotel who will vouch for him and introduce him she said in a clear voice which rang with an imperiousness that clarence well remembered the judge was to arrive by the coach from martinez to fair plains and is due now  is there no gentleman to introduce him must we take him on the word of a common traderby jove a whiskeyseller continued the previous voice sneeringly  on the word of a lady mr brooks said captain pinckney with a slight gesture towards mrs brantwho answers for both  clarence had started slightly at his wifes voice and the information it conveyed his fellowpassenger and the confidant of macniel was the man they were expecting if they had recognized him clarence would they not warn the company of his proximity he held his breath as the sound of voices came from the outer gate of the courtyard mrs brant rose at the same moment the gate swung open and a man entered it was the missourian  he turned with oldfashioned courtesy to the single woman standing on the balcony  my fair correspondent i believe i am judge beeswinger your agent macniel passed me through your guards at the gate but i did not deem it advisable to bring him into this assembly of gentlemen without your further consideration i trust i was right  the quiet dignity and selfpossession the quaint oldfashioned colonial precision of speech modified by a soft virginian intonation and above all some singular individuality of the man himself produced a profound sensation and seemed to suddenly give the gathering an impressiveness it had lacked before for an instant clarence forgot himself and his personal wrongs in the shock of indignation he felt at this potent addition to the ranks of his enemies he saw his wifes eyes sparkle with pride over her acquisition and noticed that pinckney cast a disturbed glance at the newcomer  the stranger ascended the few steps to the balcony and took mrs brants hand with profound courtesy introduce me to my colleaguesdistinctly and separately it behooves a man at such a moment to know to whom he entrusts his life and honor and the life and honor of his cause  it was evidently no mere formal courtesy to the stranger as he stepped forward along the balcony and under mrs brants graceful guidance was introduced to each of the members he not only listened with scrupulous care and attention to the name and profession of each man but bent upon him a clear searching glance that seemed to photograph him in his memory with two exceptions he passed colonel starbottles expanding shirt frill with a bow of elaborate precision and said colonel starbottles fame requires neither introduction nor explanation he stopped before captain pinckney and paused  an officer of the united states army i believe sir  yes  educated at west point i think by the government to whom you have taken the oath of allegiance  yes  very good sir said the stranger turning away  you have forgotten one other fact sir said pinckney with a slightly supercilious air  indeed what is it  i am first of all a native of the state of south carolina  a murmur of applause and approval ran round the balcony captain pinckney smiled and exchanged glances with mrs brant but the stranger quietly returned to the central table beside colonel starbottle i am not only an unexpected delegate to this august assembly gentlemen he began gravely but i am the bearer of perhaps equally unexpected news by my position in the southern district i am in possession of dispatches received only this morning by pony express fort sumter has been besieged the united states flag carrying relief to the beleaguered garrison has been fired upon by the state of south carolina  a burst of almost hysteric applause and enthusiasm broke from the assembly and made the dim vaultlike passages and corridors of the casa ring cheer after cheer went up to the veiled gallery and the misty sky beyond men mounted on the tables and waved their hands frantically and in the midst of this bewildering turbulence of sound and motion clarence saw his wife mounted on a chair with burning cheeks and flashing eyes waving her handkerchief like an inspired priestess only the stranger still standing beside colonel starbottle remained unmoved and impassive then with an imperative gesture he demanded a sudden silence  convincing and unanimous as this demonstration is gentlemen he began quietly it is my duty nevertheless to ask you if you have seriously considered the meaning of the news i have brought it is my duty to tell you that it means civil war it means the clash of arms between two sections of a mighty country it means the disruption of friends the breaking of family ties the separation of fathers and sons of brothers and sisterseven perhaps to the disseverment of husband and wife  it means the sovereignty of the southand the breaking of a covenant with lowborn traders and abolitionists said captain pinckney  if there are any gentlemen present continued the stranger without heeding the interruption who have pledged this state to the support of the south in this emergency or to the establishment of a pacific republic in aid and sympathy with it whose names are on this paperhe lifted a sheet of paper lying before colonel starbottlebut who now feel that the gravity of the news demands a more serious consideration of the purpose they are at liberty to withdraw from the meeting giving their honor as southern gentlemen to keep the secret intact  not if i know it interrupted a stalwart kentuckian as he rose to his feet and strode down the steps to the patio for he added placing his back against the gateway ill shoot the first coward that backs out now  a roar of laughter and approval followed but was silenced again by the quiet unimpassioned voice of the stranger if on the other hand he went on calmly you all feel that this news is the fitting culmination and consecration of the hopes wishes and plans of this meeting you will assert it again over your own signatures to colonel starbottle at this table  when the kentuckian had risen clarence had started from his concealment when he now saw the eager figures pressing forward to the table he hesitated no longer slipping along the passage he reached the staircase which led to the corridor in the rear of the balcony descending this rapidly he not only came upon the backs of the excited crowd around the table but even elbowed one of the conspirators aside without being noticed his wife who had risen from her chair at the end of the balcony was already moving towards the table with a quick movement he seized her wrist and threw her back in the chair again a cry broke from her lips as she recognized him but still holding her wrist he stepped quickly between her and the astonished crowd there was a moment of silence then the cry of spy and seize him rose quickly but above all the voice and figure of the missourian was heard commanding them to stand back turning to clarence he said quietly  i should know your face sir who are you  the husband of this woman and the master of this house said clarence as quietly but in a voice he hardly recognized as his own  stand aside from her thenunless you are hoping that her danger may protect you said the kentuckian significantly drawing his revolver  but mrs brant sprang suddenly to her feet beside clarence  we are neither of us cowards mr brooksthough he speaks the truthandmore shame to meshe added with a look of savage scorn at clarenceis my husband  what is your purpose in coming here continued judge beeswinger with his eyes fixed on clarence  i have given you all the information said clarence quietly that is necessary to make you as a gentleman leave this house at onceand that is my purpose it is all the information you will get from me as long as you and your friends insult my roof with your uninvited presence what i may have to say to you and each of you hereafterwhat i may choose to demand of you according to your own code of honorhe fixed his eyes on captain pinckneysis another question and one not usually discussed before a lady  pardon me a momenta single moment  it was the voice of colonel starbottle it was the frilled shirt front the lightly buttoned blue coat with its expanding lapels like bursting petals and the smiling mask of that gentleman rising above the table and bowing to clarence brant and his wife with infinite courtesy theerhumiliating situation in which we find ourselves gentlementhe reluctant witnesses oferwhat we trust is only a temporary disagreement between our charming hostess and theergentleman whom she recognized under the highest title to our considerationis distressing to us all and would seem to amply justify that gentlemans claims to a personal satisfaction which i know we would all delight to give but that situation rests upon the supposition that our gathering here was of a purely social or festive nature it may be continued the colonel with a blandly reflective air that the spectacle of these decanters and glasses and the nectar furnished us by our hebelike hostess he lifted a glass of whiskey and water to his lips while he bowed to mrs brant gracefully has led the gentleman to such a deduction but when i suggest to him that our meeting was of a business or private nature it strikes me that the question of intrusion may be fairly divided between him and ourselves we may be even justified in view of that privacy in asking him if hiserentrance to this house wasercoincident with his appearance among us  with my front door in possession of strangers said clarence more in reply to a sudden contemptuous glance from his wife than starbottles insinuation i entered the house through the window  of my boudoir where another intruder once broke his neck interrupted his wife with a mocking laugh  where i once helped this lady to regain possession of her house when it was held by another party of illegal trespassers who however were content to call themselves jumpers and did not claim the privacy of gentlemen  do you mean to imply sir began colonel starbottle haughtily that  i mean to imply sir said clarence with quiet scorn that i have neither the wish to know nor the slightest concern in any purpose that brought you here and that when you quit the house you take your secrets and your privacy with you intact without let or hindrance from me  do you mean to say mr brant said judge beeswinger suppressing the angry interruption of his fellows with a dominant wave of his hand as he fixed his eyes on clarence keenly that you have no sympathy with your wifes political sentiments  i have already given you the information necessary to make you quit this house and that is all you have a right to know returned clarence with folded arms  but i can answer for him said mrs brant rising with a quivering voice and curling lip there is no sympathy between us we are as far apart as the poles we have nothing in common but this house and his name  but you are husband and wife bound together by a sacred compact  a compact echoed mrs brant with a bitter laugh yes the compact that binds south carolina to the niggerworshipping massachusetts the compact that links together white and black the gentleman and the trader the planter and the poor whitethe compact of those united states bah that has been broken and so can this  clarences face paled but before he could speak there was a rapid clattering at the gate and a dismounted vaquero entered excitedly turning to mrs brant he said hurriedly mother of god the casa is surrounded by a rabble of mounted men and there is one among them even now who demands admittance in the name of the law  this is your work said brooks facing clarence furiously you have brought them with you but by god they shall not save you he would have clutched clarence but the powerful arm of judge beeswinger intervened nevertheless he still struggled to reach clarence appealing to the others are you fools to stand there and let him triumph dont you see the cowardly yankee trick hes played upon us  he has not said mrs brant haughtily i have no reason to love him or his friends but i know he does not lie  gentlemengentlemen implored colonel starbottle with beaming and unctuous persuasion may ierremarkthat all this is far from the question are we to be alarmed because an unknown rabble no matter whence they come demand entrance here in the name of the law i am not aware of any law of the state of california that we are infringing by all means admit them  the gate was thrown open a single thickset man apparently unarmed and dressed like an ordinary traveler followed by half a dozen other equally unpretentiouslooking men entered the leader turned to the balcony  i am the chief of police of san francisco i have warrants for the arrest of colonel culpepper starbottle joshua brooks captain pinckney clarence brant and alice his wife and others charged with inciting to riot and unlawful practice calculated to disturb the peace of the state of california and its relations with the federal government said the leader in a dry official voice  clarence started in spite of its monotonous utterance it was the voice of the redbearded controversialist of the stagecoach but where were his characteristic beard and hair involuntarily clarence glanced at judge beeswinger that gentleman was quietly regarding the stranger with an impassive face that betrayed no recognition whatever  but the city of san francisco has no jurisdiction here said colonel starbottle turning a bland smile towards his fellowmembers i amersorry to inform you that you are simply trespassing sir  i am here also as deputy sheriff returned the stranger coolly we were unable to locate the precise place of this meeting although we knew of its existence i was sworn in this morning at santa inez by the judge of this district and these gentlemen with me are my posse  there was a quick movement of resistance by the members which was however again waived blandly aside by colonel starbottle leaning forward in a slightly forensic attitude with his fingers on the table and a shirt frill that seemed to have become of itself erectile he said with pained but polite precision i grieve to have to state sir that even that position is utterly untenable here i am a lawyer myself as my friend here judge beeswingereh i beg your pardon  the officer of the law had momentarily started with his eyes fixed on judge beeswinger who however seemed to be quietly writing at the table  as judge beeswinger continued colonel starbottle will probably tell you and as a jurist himself he will also probably agree with me when i also inform you that as the united states government is an aggrieved party it is a matter for the federal courts to prosecute and that the only officer we can recognize is the united states marshal for the district when i add that the marshal colonel crackenthorpe is one of my oldest friends and an active sympathizer with the south in the present struggle you will understand that any action from him in this matter is exceedingly improbable  the general murmur of laughter relief and approval was broken by the quiet voice of judge beeswinger  let me see your warrant mr deputy sheriff  the officer approached him with a slightly perplexed and constrained air and exhibited the paper judge beeswinger handed it back to him colonel starbottle is quite right in his contention he said quietly the only officer that this assembly can recognize is the united states marshal or his legal deputy but colonel starbottle is wrong in his supposition that colonel crackenthorpe still retains the functions of that office he was removed by the president of the united states and his successor was appointed and sworn in by the federal judge early this morning he paused and folding up the paper on which he had been writing placed it in the hands of the deputy and this he continued in the same even voice constitutes you his deputy and will enable you to carry out your duty in coming here  what the devil does this mean sir who are you gasped colonel starbottle recoiling suddenly from the man at his side  i am the new united states marshal for the southern district of california      chapter iii   unsuspected and astounding as the revelation was to clarence its strange reception by the conspirators seemed to him as astounding he had started forward half expecting that the complacent and selfconfessed spy would be immolated by his infuriated dupes but to his surprise the shock seemed to have changed their natures and given them the dignity they had lacked the excitability irritation and recklessness which had previously characterized them had disappeared the deputy and his posse who had advanced to the assistance of their revealed chief met with no resistance they had evidently as if with one accord drawn away from judge beeswinger leaving a cleared space around him and regarded their captors with sullen contemptuous silence it was only broken by colonel starbottle  your duty commands you sir to use all possible diligence in bringing us before the federal judge of this districtunless your master in washington has violated the constitution so far as to remove him too  i understand you perfectly returned judge beeswinger with unchanged composure and as you know that judge wilson unfortunately cannot be removed except through a regular course of impeachment i suppose you may still count upon his southern sympathies to befriend you with that i have nothing to do my duty is complete when my deputy has brought you before him and i have stated the circumstances of the arrest  i congratulate you sir said captain pinckney with an ironical salute on your prompt reward for your treachery to the south and your equally prompt adoption of the peculiar tactics of your friends in the way in which you have entered this house  i am sorry i cannot congratulate you sir returned judge beeswinger gravely on breaking your oath to the government which has educated and supported you and given you the epaulettes you disgrace nor shall i discuss treachery with the man who has not only violated the trust of his country but even the integrity of his friends household it is for that reason that i withhold the action of this warrant in so far as it affects the persons of the master and mistress of this home i am satisfied that mr brant has been as ignorant of what has been done here as i am that his wife has been only the foolish dupe of a double traitor  silence  the words broke simultaneously from the lips of clarence and captain pinckney they stood staring at each otherthe one pale the other crimsonas mrs brant apparently oblivious of the significance of their united adjuration turned to judge beeswinger in the fury of her still stifled rage and mortification  keep your mercy for your fellowspy she said with a contemptuous gesture towards her husband i go with these gentlemen  you will not said clarence quietly until i have said a word to you alone he laid his hand firmly upon her wrist  the deputy and his prisoners filed slowly out of the courtyard together the latter courteously saluting mrs brant as they passed but turning from judge beeswinger in contemptuous silence the judge followed them to the gate but there he paused turning to mrs brant who was still half struggling in the strong grip of her husband he said  any compunction i may have had in misleading you by accepting your invitation here i dismissed after i had entered this house and i trust he added turning to clarence sternly i leave you the master of it  as the gate closed behind him clarence locked it when his wife turned upon him angrily he said quietly  i have no intention of restraining your liberty a moment after our interview is over but until then i do not intend to be disturbed  she threw herself disdainfully back in her chair her hands clasped in her lap in halfcontemptuous resignation with her eyes upon her long slim arched feet crossed before her even in her attitude there was something of her old fascination which however now seemed to sting clarence to the quick  i have nothing to say to you in regard to what has just passed in this house except that as long as i remain even nominally its master it shall not be repeated although i shall no longer attempt to influence or control your political sympathies i shall not allow you to indulge them where in any way they seem to imply my sanction but so little do i oppose your liberty that you are free to rejoin your political companions whenever you choose to do so on your own responsibility but i must first know from your own lips whether your sympathies are purely politicalor a name for something else  she had alternately flushed and paled although still keeping her scornful attitude as he went on but there was no mistaking the genuineness of her vague wonderment at his concluding words  i dont understand you she said lifting her eyes to his in a moment of cold curiosity what do you mean  what do i mean what did judge beeswinger mean when he called captain pinckney a double traitor he said roughly  she sprang to her feet with flashing eyes and youyou dare to repeat the cowardly lie of a confessed spy this then is what you wished to tell methis the insult for which you have kept me here because you are incapable of understanding unselfish patriotism or devotioneven to your own causeyou dare to judge me by your own base yankeetrading standards yes it is worthy of you she walked rapidly up and down and then suddenly faced him i understand it all i appreciate your magnanimity now you are willing i should join the company of these chivalrous gentlemen in order to give color to your calumnies say at once that it was you who put up this spy to correspond with meto come herein order to entrap me yes entrap meiwho a moment ago stood up for you before these gentlemen and said you could not lie bah  struck only by the wild extravagance of her speech and temper clarence did not know that when women are most illogical they are apt to be most sincere and from a mans standpoint her unreasoning deductions appeared to him only as an affectation to gain time for thought or a theatrical display like susys and he was turning half contemptuously away when she again faced him with flashing eyes  well hear me i accept i leave here at once to join my own people my own friendsthose who understand meput what construction on it that you choose do your worst you cannot do more to separate us than you have done just now  she left him and ran up the steps with a singular return of her old occasional nymphlike nimblenessthe movement of a woman who had never borne childrenand a swish of her long skirts that he remembered for many a day after as she disappeared in the corridor he remained looking after herindignant outraged and unconvinced there was a rattling at the gate  he remembered he had locked it he opened it to the flushed pink cheeks and dancing eyes of susy the rain was still dripping from her wet cloak as she swung it from her shoulders  i know it allall thats happened she burst out with halfgirlish exuberance and half the actresss declamation we met them all in the roadposse and prisoners chief thompson knew me and told me all and so youve done itand youre master in your old house again clarence old boy jim said you wouldnt do itsaid youd weaken on account of her but i said no i knew you better old clarence and i saw it in your face for all your stiffness ha but for all that i was mighty nervous and uneasy and i just made jim send an excuse to the theatre and we rushed it down here lordy but it looks natural to see the old house again and sheyou packed her off with the othersdidnt you tell me clarence in her old appealing voice you shook her too  dazed and astounded and yet experiencing a vague sense of relief with something like his old tenderness towards the willful woman before him he had silently regarded her until her allusion to his wife recalled him to himself  hush he said quickly with a glance towards the corridor  ah said susy with a malicious smile then thats why captain pinckney was lingering in the rear with the deputy  silence repeated clarence sternly go in there pointing to the garden room below the balcony and wait there with your husband  he half led half pushed her into the room which had been his business office and returned to the patio a hesitating voice from the balcony said clarence  it was his wifes voice but modified and gentlermore like her voice as he had first heard it or as if it had been chastened by some reminiscence of those days it was his wifes face too that looked down on hispaler than he had seen it since he entered the house she was shawled and hooded carrying a travelingbag in her hand  i am going clarence she said pausing before him with gentle gravity but not in anger i even ask you to forgive me for the foolish words that i think your still more foolish accusationshe smiled faintlydragged from me i am going because i know that i have broughtand that while i am here i shall always be bringingupon you the imputation and even the responsibility of my own faith while i am proud to own itand if needs be suffer for iti have no right to ruin your prospects or even make you the victim of the slurs that others may cast upon me let us part as friendsseparated only by our different political faiths but keeping all other faiths togetheruntil god shall settle the right of this struggle perhaps it may be sooni sometimes think it may be years of agony for all but until then goodby  she had slowly descended the steps to the patio looking handsomer than he had ever seen her and as if sustained and upheld by the enthusiasm of her cause her hand was outstretched towards hishis heart beat violentlyin another moment he might have forgotten all and clasped her to his breast suddenly she stopped her outstretched arm stiffened her finger pointed to the chair on which susys cloak was hanging  whats that she said in a sharp high metallic voice who is here speak  susy said clarence  she cast a scathing glance round the patio and then settled her piercing eyes on clarence with a bitter smile  already  clarence felt the blood rush to his face as he stammered she knew what was happening here and came to give you warning  liar  stop said clarence with a white face she came to tell me that captain pinckney was still lingering for you in the road  he threw open the gate to let her pass as she swept out she lifted her hand as he closed the gate there were the white marks of her four fingers on his cheek      chapter iv   for once susy had not exaggerated captain pinckney was lingering with the deputy who had charge of him on the trail near the casa it had already been pretty well understood by both captives and captors that the arrest was simply a legal demonstration that the sympathizing federal judge would undoubtedly order the discharge of the prisoners on their own recognizances and it was probable that the deputy saw no harm in granting pinckneys requestwhich was virtually only a delay in his liberation it was also possible that pinckney had worked upon the chivalrous sympathies of the man by professing his disinclination to leave their devoted colleague mrs brant at the mercy of her antagonistic and coldblooded husband at such a crisis and it is to be feared also that clarence as a reputed lukewarm partisan excited no personal sympathy even from his own party howbeit the deputy agreed to delay pinckneys journey for a parting interview with his fair hostess  how far this expressed the real sentiments of captain pinckney was never known whether his political association with mrs brant had developed into a warmer solicitude understood or ignored by herwhat were his hopes and aspirations regarding her futurewere by the course of fate never disclosed a man of easy ethics but rigid artificialities of honor flattered and pampered by class prejudice a socalled man of the world with no experience beyond his own limited circle yet brave and devoted to that it were well perhaps to leave this last act of his inefficient life as it was accepted by the deputy  dismounting he approached the house from the garden he was already familiar with the low arched doorway which led to the business room and from which he could gain admittance to the patio but it so chanced that he entered the dark passage at the moment that clarence had thrust susy into the business room and heard its door shut sharply for an instant he believed that mrs brant had taken refuge there but as he cautiously moved forward he heard her voice in the patio beyond its accents struck him as pleading an intense curiosity drew him further along the passage suddenly her voice seemed to change to angry denunciation and the word liar rang upon his ears it was followed by his own name uttered sardonically by clarence the swift rustle of a skirt the clash of the gate and thenforgetting everything he burst into the patio  clarence was just turning from the gate with the marks of his wifes hand still red on his white cheek he saw captain pinckneys eyes upon it and the faint halfmalicious halfhysteric smile upon his lips but without a start or gesture of surprise he locked the gate and turning to him said with frigid significance  i thank you for returning so promptly and for recognizing the only thing i now require at your hand  but captain pinckney had recovered his supercilious ease with the significant demand  you seem to have had something already from anothers hand sir but i am at your service he said lightly  you will consider that i have accepted it from you said clarence drawing closer to him with a rigid face i suppose it will not be necessary for me to return itto make you understand me  go on said pinckney flushing slightly make your terms i am ready  but im not said the unexpected voice of the deputy at the grille of the gateway excuse my interfering gentlemen but this sort o thing aint down in my schedule ive let this gentleman pointing to captain pinckney off for a minit to say goodby to a lady who i reckon has just ridden off in her buggy with her servant without saying by your leave but i didnt calkelate to let him inter another business which like as not may prevent me from delivering his body safe and sound into court you hear me as clarence opened the gate he added i dont want ter spoil sport between gents but its got to come in after ive done my duty  ill meet you sir anywhere and with what weapons you choose said pinckney turning angrily upon clarence as soon as this farcefor which you and your friends are responsibleis over he was furious at the intimation that mrs brant had escaped him  a different thought was in the husbands mind but what assurance have i that you are going on with the deputy he said with purposely insulting deliberation  my word sir said captain pinckney sharply  and if that aint enuff theres mine said the deputy for if this gentleman swerves to the right or left betwixt this and santa inez ill blow a hole through him myself and that he added deprecatingly is saying a good deal for a man who doesnt want to spoil sport and for the matter of that is willing to stand by and see fair play done at santa inez any time tomorrow before breakfast  then i can count on you said clarence with a sudden impulse extending his hand  the man hesitated a moment and then grasped it  well i wasnt expecting that he said slowly but you look as if you meant business and if you aint got anybody else to see you through im thar i suppose this gentleman will have his friends  i shall be there at six with my seconds said pinckney curtly lead on  the gate closed behind them clarence stood looking around the empty patio and the silent house from which it was now plain that the servants had been withdrawn to insure the secrecy of the conspiracy cool and collected as he knew he was he remained for a moment in hesitation then the sound of voices came to his ear from the garden room the light frivolity of susys laugh and hookers huskier accents he had forgotten they were therehe had forgotten their existence  trusting still to his calmness he called to hooker in his usual voice that gentleman appeared with a face which his attempts to make unconcerned and impassive had however only deepened into funereal gravity  i have something to attend to said clarence with a faint smile and i must ask you and susy to excuse me for a little while she knows the house perfectly and will call the servants from the annex to provide you both with refreshment until i join you a little later satisfied from hookers manner that they knew nothing of his later interview with pinckney he turned away and ascended to his own room  there he threw himself into an armchair by the dim light of a single candle as if to reflect but he was conscious even then of his own calmness and want of excitement and that no reflection was necessary what he had done and what he intended to do was quite clear there was no alternative suggested or to be even sought after he had that sense of relief which comes with the climax of all great struggles even of defeat  he had never known before how hopeless and continuous had been that struggle until now it was over he had no fear of tomorrow he would meet it as he had today with the same singular consciousness of being equal to the occasion there was even no necessity of preparation for it his will leaving his fortune to his wifewhich seemed a slight thing now in this greater separationwas already in his safe in san francisco his pistols were in the next room he was even slightly disturbed by his own insensibility and passed into his wifes bedroom partly in the hope of disturbing his serenity by some memento of their past there was no disorder of flighteverything was in its place except the drawer of her desk which was still open as if she had taken something from it as an afterthought there were letters and papers there some of his own and some in captain pinckneys handwriting it did not occur to him to look at themeven to justify himself or excuse her he knew that his hatred of captain pinckney was not so much that he believed him her lover as his sudden conviction that she was like him he was the male of her speciesa being antagonistic to himself whom he could fight and crush and revenge himself upon but most of all he loathed his past not on account of her but of his own weakness that had made him her dupe and a misunderstood man to his friends he had been derelict of duty in his unselfish devotion to her he had stifled his ambition and underrated his own possibilities no wonder that others had accepted him at his own valuation clarence brant was a modest man but the egotism of modesty is more fatal than that of pretension for it has the haunting consciousness of superior virtue  he reentered his own room and again threw himself into his chair his calm was being succeeded by a physical weariness he remembered he had not slept the night before and he ought to take some rest to be fresh in the early morning yet he must also show himself before his selfinvited guestssusy and her husbandor their suspicions would be aroused he would try to sleep for a little while in the chair before he went downstairs again he closed his eyes oddly enough on a dim dreamy recollection of susy in the old days in the little madrono hollow where she had once given him a rendezvous he forgot the maturer and critical uneasiness with which he had then received her coquettish and willful advances which he now knew was the effect of the growing dominance of mrs peyton over him and remembered only her bright youthful eyes and the kisses he had pressed upon her soft fragrant cheek the faintness he had felt when waiting in the old rose garden a few hours ago seemed to steal on him once more and to lapse into a pleasant drowsiness he even seemed again to inhale the perfume of the roses  clarence  he started he had been sleeping but the voice sounded strangely real  a light girlish laugh followed he sprang to his feet it was susy standing beside himand susy even as she looked in the old days  for with a flash of her old audacity aided by her familiar knowledge of the house and the bunch of household keys she had found which dangled from her girdle as in the old fashion she had disinterred one of her old frocks from a closet slipped it on and unloosening her brown hair had let it fall in rippling waves down her back it was susy in her old girlishness with the instinct of the grown actress in the arrangement of her short skirt over her pretty ankles and the halfconscious pose she had taken  poor dear old clarence she said with dancing eyes i might have won a dozen pairs of gloves from you while you slept there but youre tired dear old boy and youve had a hard time of it no matter youve shown yourself a man at last and im proud of you  half ashamed of the pleasure he felt even in his embarrassment clarence stammered but this changethis dress  susy clapped her hands like a child i knew it would surprise you its an old frock i wore the year i went away with auntie i knew where it was hidden and fished it out again with these keys clarence it seemed so like old times lord when i was with the old servants again and you didnt come down i just felt as if id never been away and i just rampaged free it seemed to me dont you know not as if id just come but as if id always been right here and it was you whod just come dont you understand just as you came when me and mary rogers were here dont you remember her clarence and how she used to do gooseberry for us well just like that so i said to jim i dont know you any moreget and i just slipped on this frock and ordered manuela around as i used to doand she in fits of laughter i reckon clarence she hasnt laughed as much since i left and then i thought of youperhaps worried and flustered as yet over things and the change and i just slipped into the kitchen and i told old fat conchita to make some of these tortillas you knowwith sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on topand i tied on an apron and brought em up to you on a tray with a glass of that old catalan wine you used to like then i sorter felt frightened when i got here and i didnt hear any noise and i put the tray down in the hall and peeped in and found you asleep sit still ill fetch em  she tripped out into the passage returning with the tray which she put on the table beside clarence and then standing back a little and with her hands tucked soubrette fashion in the tiny pockets of her apron gazed at him with a mischievous smile  it was impossible not to smile back as he nibbled the crisp mexican cake and drank the old mission wine and susys tongue trilled an accompaniment to his thanks  lord it seems so nice to be herejust you and me clarencelike in the old dayswith nobody naggin and swoopin round after you dont be greedy clarence but give me a cake she took one and finished the dregs of his glass  then sitting on the arm of his chair she darted a violet ray of half reproach and half mischievousness into his amused and retrospective eyes there used to be room for two in that chair klarns  the use of the old childish diminutive for his name seemed to him natural as her familiarity and he moved a little sideways to make room for her with an instinct of pleasure but the same sense of irresponsibility that had characterized his reflections nevertheless he looked critically into the mischievous eyes and said quietly  where is your husband  there was no trace of embarrassment apology or even of consciousness in her pretty face as she replied passing her hand lightly through his hair  oh jim ive packed him off  packed him off echoed clarence slightly astonished  yes to fair plains full tilt after your wifes buggy you see clarence after the old catthats your wife pleaseleft i wanted to make sure she had gone and wasnt hangin round to lead you off again with your leg tied to her apron string like a chickens no i said to jim just you ride after her until you see shes safe and sound in the down coach from fair plains without her knowin it and if shes inclined to hang back or wobble any you post back here and let me know i told him i would stay and look after you to see you didnt bolt too she laughed and then added but i didnt think i should fall into the old ways so soon and have such a nice time did you clarence  she looked so irresponsible sitting there with her face near his and so childishly or perhaps thoughtlessly happy that he could only admire her levity and even the slight shock that her flippant allusion to his wife had given him seemed to him only a weakness of his own after all was not hers the true philosophy why should not these bright eyes see things more clearly than his own nevertheless with his eyes still fixed upon them he continued  and jim was willing to go  she stopped with her fingers still lifting a lock of his hair why yes you sillywhy shouldnt he id like to see him refuse why lord jim will do anything i ask him she put down the lock of hair and suddenly looking full into his eyes said thats just the difference between him and me and you andthat woman  then you love him  about as much as you love her she said with an unaffected laugh only he dont wind me around his finger  no doubt she was right for all her thoughtlessness and yet he was going to fight about that woman tomorrow nohe forgot he was going to fight captain pinckney because he was like her  susy had put her finger on the crease between his brows which this supposition had made and tried to rub it out  you know it as well as i do clarence she said with a pretty wrinkling of her own brows which was her nearest approach to thoughtfulness you know you never really liked her only you thought her ways were grander and more proper than mine and you know you were always a little bit of a snob and a prig toodear boy and mrs peyton wasbless my soula benham and a planters daughter and ii was only a pickedup orphan thats where jim is better than younow sit still gooseyeven if i dont like him as much oh i know what youre always thinking youre thinking were both exaggerated and theatrical aint you but dont you think its a heap better to be exaggerated and theatrical about things that are just sentimental and romantic than to be so awfully possessed and overcome about things that are only real there you neednt stare at me so its true youve had your fill of grandeur and propriety andhere you are and she added with a little chuckle as she tucked up her feet and leaned a little closer to him heres me  he did not speak but his arm quite unconsciously passed round her small waist  you see clarence she went on with equal unconsciousness of the act you ought never to have let me gonever you ought to have kept me hereor run away with me and you oughtnt to have tried to make me proper and you oughtnt to have driven me to flirt with that horrid spaniard and you oughtnt to have been so horribly cold and severe when i did and you oughtnt to have made me take up with jim who was the only one who thought me his equal i might have been very silly and capricious i might have been very vain but my vanity isnt a bit worse than your pride my love of praise and applause in the theatre isnt a bit more horrid than your fears of what people might think of you or me thats gospel truth isnt it clarence tell me dont look that way and thislook at me i aint poisonous clarence why one of your cheeks is redder than the other clarence thats the one thats turned from me come she went on taking the lapels of his coat between her hands and half shaking him half drawing him nearer her bright face tell meisnt it true  i was thinking of you just now when i fell asleep susy he said he did not know why he said it he had not intended to tell her he had only meant to avoid a direct answer to her question yet even now he went on and i thought of you when i was out there in the rose garden waiting to come in here  you did she said drawing in her breath a wave of delicate pink color came up to her very eyes it seemed to him as quickly and as innocently as when she was a girl and what did you think klarns she half whisperedtell me  he did not speak but answered her blue eyes and then her lips as her arms slipped quite naturally around his neck    the dawn was breaking as clarence and jim hooker emerged together from the gate of the casa mr hooker looked sleepy he had found after his return from fair plains that his host had an early engagement at santa inez and he had insisted upon rising to see him off it was with difficulty indeed that clarence could prevent his accompanying him clarence had not revealed to susy the night before the real object of his journey nor did hooker evidently suspect it yet when the former had mounted his horse he hesitated for an instant extending his hand  if i should happen to be detained he began with a half smile  but jim was struggling with a yawn thats all rightdont mind us he said stretching his arms clarences hesitating hand dropped to his side and with a light reckless laugh and a half sense of providential relief he galloped away  what happened immediately thereafter during his solitary ride to santa inez looking back upon it in after years seemed but a confused recollection more like a dream the long stretches of vague distance gradually opening clearer with the rising sun in an unclouded sky the meeting with a few early or belated travelers and his unconscious avoidance of them as if they might know of his object the black shadows of foreshortened cattle rising before him on the plain and arousing the same uneasy sensation of their being waylaying men the wondering recognition of houses and landmarks he had long been familiar with his purposeless attempts to recall the circumstances in which he had known themall these were like a dream so too were the recollections of the night before the episode with susy already mingled and blended with the memory of their previous past his futile attempts to look forward to the future always however abandoned with relief at the thought that the next few hours might make them unnecessary so also was the sudden realization that santa inez was before him when he had thought he was not yet halfway there and as he dismounted before the court house his singular feelingfollowed however by no fear or distresswas that he had come so early to the rendezvous that he was not yet quite prepared for it  this same sense of unreality pervaded his meeting with the deputy sheriff at the news that the federal judge had as was expected dismissed the prisoners on their own recognizances and that captain pinckney was at the hotel at breakfast in the like abstracted manner he replied to the one or two questions of the deputy exhibited the pistols he had brought with him and finally accompanied him to a little meadow hidden by trees below the hotel where the other principal and his seconds were awaiting them and here he awokecleareyed keen forceful and intense  so stimulated were his faculties that his sense of hearing in its acuteness took in every word of the conversation between the seconds a few paces distant he heard his adversarys seconds say carelessly to the deputy sheriff i presume this is a case where there will be no apology or mediation and the deputys reply i reckon my man means business but he seems a little queer he heard the other second laugh and say lightly theyre apt to be so when its their first time out followed by the more anxious aside of the other second as the deputy turned awayyes but by gd i dont like his looks his sense of sight was also so acute that having lost the choice of position when the coin was tossed and being turned with his face to the sun even through the glare he saw with unerring distinctness of outline the blackcoated figure of his opponent moved into rangesaw the perfect outline of his features and how the easy supercilious smile as he threw away his cigar appeared to drop out of his face with a kind of vacant awe as he faced him he felt his nerves become as steel as the counting began and at the word three knew he had fired by the recoil of the pistol in his leveled hand simultaneously with its utterance and at the same moment still standing like a rock he saw his adversary miserably collapse his legs grotesquely curving inwards under himwithout even the dignity of death in his falland so sink helplessly like a felled bull to the ground still erect and lowering only the muzzle of his pistol as a thin feather of smoke curled up its shining side he saw the doctor and seconds run quickly to the heap try to lift its limp impotence into shape and let it drop again with the words right through the forehead by gd  youve done for him said the deputy turning to clarence with a singular look of curiosity and i reckon you had better get out of this mighty quick they didnt expect it theyre just ragin they may round on youandhe added more slowly they seem to have just found out who you are  even while he was speaking clarence with his quickened ear heard the words one of hamilton brants pups just like his father from the group around the dead man he did not hesitate but walked coolly towards them yet a certain fierce pridewhich he had never known beforestirred in his veins as their voices hushed and they half recoiled before him  am i to understand from my second gentlemen he said looking round the group that you are not satisfied  the fight was square enough said pinckneys second in some embarrassment but i reckon that he pointing to the dead man did not know who you were  do you mean that he did not know that i was the son of a man proficient in the use of arms  i reckon thats about it returned the second glancing at the others  i am glad to say sir that i have a better opinion of his courage said clarence lifting his hat to the dead body as he turned away  yet he was conscious of no remorse concern or even pity in his act perhaps this was visible in his face for the group appeared awed by this perfection of the duelists coolness and even returned his formal parting salutation with a vague and timid respect he thanked the deputy regained the hotel saddled his horse and galloped away  but not towards the rancho now that he could think of his future that had no place in his reflections even the episode of susy was forgotten in the new and strange conception of himself and his irresponsibility which had come upon him with the killing of pinckney and the words of his second it was his dead father who had stiffened his arm and directed the fatal shot it was hereditary influenceswhich others had been so quick to recognizethat had brought about this completing climax of his trouble how else could he account for it that hea conscientious peaceful sensitive man tender and forgiving as he had believed himself to becould now feel so little sorrow or compunction for his culminating act he had read of successful duelists who were haunted by remorse for their first victim who retained a terrible consciousness of the appearance of the dead man he had no such feeling he had only a grim contentment in the wipedout inefficient life and contempt for the limp and helpless body he suddenly recalled his callousness as a boy when face to face with the victims of the indian massacre his sense of fastidious superciliousness in the discovery of the body of susys mothersurely it was the cold blood of his father influencing him ever thus what had he to do with affection with domestic happiness with the ordinary ambitions of mans lifewhose blood was frozen at its source yet even with this very thought came once more the old inconsistent tenderness he had as a boy lavished upon the almost unknown and fugitive father who had forsaken his childish companionship and remembered him only by secret gifts he remembered how he had worshiped him even while the pious padres at san jose were endeavoring to eliminate this terrible poison from his blood and combat his hereditary instinct in his conflicts with his schoolfellows and it was a part of this inconsistency that riding away from the scene of his first bloodshed his eyes were dimmed with moisture not for his victim but for the one being who he believed had impelled him to the act  this and more was in his mind during his long ride to fair plains his journey by coach to the embarcadero his midnight passage across the dark waters of the bay and his reentrance to san francisco but what should be his future was still unsettled  as he wound round the crest of russian hill and looked down again upon the awakened city he was startled to see that it was fluttering and streaming with bunting from every public building and hotel from the roofs of private houses and even the windows of lonely dwellings flapped and waved the striped and starry banner the steady breath of the sea carried it out from masts and yards of ships at their wharves from the battlements of the forts alcatraz and yerba bueno he remembered that the ferryman had told him that the news from fort sumter had swept the city with a revulsion of patriotic sentiment and that there was no doubt that the state was saved to the union he looked down upon it with haggard bewildered eyes and then a strange gasp and fullness of the throat for afar a solitary bugle had blown the reveille at fort alcatraz    part ii    chapter i   night at last and the stir and tumult of a great fight over even the excitement that had swept this portion of the battlefieldonly a small section of a vaster area of struggleinto which a brigade had marched held its own been beaten back recovered its ground and pursuing had passed out of it forever leaving only its dead behind and knowing nothing more of that struggle than its own impact and momentumeven this wild excitement had long since evaporated with the stinging smoke of gunpowder the acrid smell of burning rags from the clothing of a dead soldier fired by a bursting shell or the heated reek of sweat and leather a cool breath that seemed to bring back once more the odor of the upturned earthworks along the now dumb line of battle began to move from the suggestive darkness beyond  but into that awful penetralia of death and silence there was no invasionthere had been no retreat a few of the wounded had been brought out under fire but the others had been left with the dead for the morning light and succor for it was known that in that horrible obscurity riderless horses frantic with the smell of blood galloped wildly here and there or maddened by wounds plunged furiously at the intruder that the wounded soldier still armed could not always distinguish friend from foe or from the ghouls of camp followers who stripped the dead in the darkness and struggled with the dying a shot or two heard somewhere in that obscurity counted as nothing with the long fusillade that had swept it in the daytime the passing of a single life more or less amounted to little in the long rollcall of the days slaughter  but with the first beams of the morning sunand the slowly moving relief detail from the campcame a weird halfresurrection of that ghastly field then it was that the long rays of sunlight streaming away a mile beyond the battle line pointed out the first harvest of the dead where the reserves had been posted there they lay in heaps and piles killed by solid shot or bursting shells that had leaped the battle line to plunge into the waiting ranks beyond as the sun lifted higher its beams fell within the range of musketry fire where the dead lay thickereven as they had fallen when killed outrightwith arms extended and feet at all angles to the field as it touched these dead upturned faces strangely enough it brought out no expression of pain or anguishbut rather as if death had arrested them only in surprise and awe it revealed on the lips of those who had been mortally wounded and had turned upon their side the relief which death had brought their suffering sometimes shown in a faint smile mounting higher it glanced upon the actual battle line curiously curving for the shelter of walls fences and breastworks and here the dead lay even as when they lay and fired their faces prone in the grass but their muskets still resting across the breastworks exposed to grape and canister from the battery on the ridge death had come to them mercifully alsothrough the head and throat and now the whole field lay bare in the sunlight broken with grotesque shadows cast from sitting crouching halfrecumbent but always rigid figures which might have been effigies on their own monuments one halfkneeling soldier with head bowed between his stiffened hands might have stood for a carven figure of grief at the feet of his dead comrade a captain shot through the brain in the act of mounting a wall lay sideways half across it his lips parted with a word of command his sword still pointing over the barrier the way that they should go  but it was not until the sun had mounted higher that it struck the central horror of the field and seemed to linger there in dazzling persistence now and then returning to it in startling flashes that it might be seen of men and those who brought succor a tiny brook had run obliquely near the battle line it was here that the night before the battle friend and foe had filled their canteens side by side with soldierly recklessnessor perhaps a higher instinctpurposely ignoring each others presence it was here that the wounded had afterwards crept crawled and dragged themselves here they had pushed wrangled striven and fought for a draught of that precious fluid which assuaged the thirst of their woundsor happily put them out of their misery forever here overborne crushed suffocated by numbers pouring their own blood into the flood and tumbling after it with their helpless bodies they dammed the stream until recoiling red and angry it had burst its banks and overflowed the cottonfield in a broad pool that now sparkled in the sunlight but below this human dama mile awaywhere the brook still crept sluggishly the ambulance horses sniffed and started from it  the detail moved on slowly doing their work expeditiously and apparently callously but really only with that mechanical movement that saves emotion only once they were moved to an outbreak of indignationthe discovery of the body of an officer whose pockets were turned inside out but whose hand was still tightly grasped on his buttoned waistcoat as if resisting the outrage that had been done while still in life as the men disengaged the stiffened hand something slipped from the waistcoat to the ground the corporal picked it up and handed it to his officer it was a sealed packet the officer received it with the carelessness which long experience of these pathetic missives from the dying to their living relations had induced and dropped it in the pocket of his tunic with the halfdozen others that he had picked up that morning and moved on with the detail a little further on they halted in the attitude of attention as a mounted officer appeared riding slowly down the line  there was something more than the habitual respect of their superior in their faces as he came forward for it was the general who had commanded the brigade the day beforethe man who had leaped with one bound into the foremost rank of military leaders it was his invincible spirit that had led the advance held back defeat against overwhelming numbers sustained the rally impressed his subordinate officers with his own undeviating purpose and even infused them with an almost superstitious belief in his destiny of success it was this man who had done what it was deemed impossible to dowhat even at the time it was thought unwise and unstrategic to dowho had held a weak position of apparently no importance under the mandate of an incomprehensible order from his superior which at best asked only for a sacrifice and was rewarded with a victory he had decimated his brigade but the wounded and dying had cheered him as he passed and the survivors had pursued the enemy until the bugle called them back for such a record he looked still too young and scholarly albeit his handsome face was dark and energetic and his manner taciturn  his quick eye had already caught sight of the rifled body of the officer and contracted as the captain of the detail saluted him he said curtly  i thought the orders were to fire upon any one desecrating the dead  they are general but the hyenas dont give us a chance thats all yonder poor fellow saved from their claws replied the officer as he held up the sealed packet it has no address  the general took it examined the envelope thrust it into his belt and said  i will take charge of it  the sound of horses hoofs came from the rocky roadside beyond the brook both men turned a number of field officers were approaching  the division staff said the captain in a lower voice falling back  they came slowly forward a central figure on a gray horse leading hereas in history a short thickset man with a grizzled beard closely cropped around an inscrutable mouth and the serious formality of a respectable country deacon in his aspect which even the majorgenerals blazon on the shoulderstrap of his loose tunic on his soldierly seat in the saddle could not entirely obliterate he had evidently perceived the general of brigade and quickened his horse as the latter drew up the staff followed more leisurely but still with some curiosity to witness the meeting of the first general of the army with the youngest the division general saluted but almost instantly withdrew his leathern gauntlet and offered his bared hand to the brigadier the words of heroes are scant the drawnup detail the waiting staff listened this was all they heard  halleck tells me youre from california  yes general  ah i lived there too in the early days  wonderful country developed greatly since my time i suppose  yes general  great resources finest wheatgrowing country in the world sir you dont happen to know what the actual crop was this year  hardly general but something enormous  yes i have always said it would be have a cigar  he handed his cigarcase to the brigadier then he took one himself lighted it at the smouldering end of the one he had taken from his mouth was about to throw the stump carelessly down but suddenly recollecting himself leaned over his horse and dropped it carefully a few inches away from the face of a dead soldier then straightening himself in the saddle he shoved his horse against the brigadier moving him a little further on while a slight movement of his hand kept the staff from following  a heavy loss here  im afraid so general  it couldnt be helped we had to rush in your brigade to gain time and occupy the enemy until we could change front  the young general looked at the shrewd cold eyes of his chief  change front he echoed  yes before a gun was fired we discovered that the enemy was in complete possession of all our plans and knew every detail of our forward movement all had to be changed  the younger man now instantly understood the incomprehensible order of the day before  the general of division continued with his first touch of official formality  you understand therefore general brant that in the face of this extraordinary treachery the utmost vigilance is required and a complete surveillance of your camp followers and civilians to detect the actual spy within our lines or the traitor we are harboring who has become possessed of this information you will overhaul your brigade and weed out all suspects and in the position which you are to take tomorrow and the plantation you will occupy you will see that your private quarters as well as your lines are cleared of all but those you can vouch for  he reined in his horse again extended his hand saluted and rejoined his staff  brigadiergeneral clarence brant remained for a moment with his head bent in thoughtful contemplation of the coolness of his veteran chief under this exciting disclosure and the strategy with which he had frustrated the traitors success then his eye caught the sealed packet in his belt he mechanically drew it out and broke the seal the envelope was filled with papers and memorandums but as he looked at them his face darkened and his brow knit he glanced quickly around him the staff had trotted away the captain and his detail were continuing their work at a little distance he took a long breath for he was holding in his hand a tracing of their camp even of the position he was to occupy tomorrow and a detailed account of the movements plans and force of the whole division as had been arranged in council of war the day before the battle but there was no indication of the writer or his intentions  he thrust the papers hurriedly back into the envelope but placed it this time in his breast he galloped towards the captain  let me see again the officer from whom you took that packet  the captain led him to where the body lay with others extended more decently on the grass awaiting removal general brant with difficulty repressed an ejaculation  why its one of our own men he said quickly  yes general they say its lieutenant wainwright a regular of the paymaster generals department  then what was he doing here asked general brant sternly  i cant make out sir unless he went into the last advance as a volunteer wanted to see the fight i suppose he was a dashing fellow a west pointerand a southerner tooa virginian  a southerner echoed brant quickly  yes sir  search him again said brant quietly he had recovered his usual coolness and as the captain again examined the body he took out his tablets and wrote a few lines it was an order to search the quarters of lieutenant wainwright and bring all papers letters and documents to him he then beckoned one of the detail towards him take that to the provost marshal at once well captain he added calmly as the officer again approached him what do you find  only this sir returned the captain with a half smile producing a small photograph i suppose it was overlooked too  he handed it to brant  there was a sudden fixing of his commanding officers eyes but his face did not otherwise change  its the usual find general always a photograph but this time a handsome woman  very said clarence brant quietly it was the portrait of his own wife     chapter ii   nevertheless so complete was his control of voice and manner that as he rode on to his quarters no one would have dreamed that general brant had just looked upon the likeness of the wife from whom he had parted in anger four years ago still less would they have suspected the strange fear that came upon him that in some way she was connected with the treachery he had just discovered he had heard from her only once and then through her late husbands lawyer in regard to her californian property and believed that she had gone to her relations in alabama where she had identified herself with the southern cause even to the sacrifice of her private fortune he had heard her name mentioned in the southern press as a fascinating society leader and even coadjutrix of southern politiciansbut he had no reason to believe that she had taken so active or so desperate a part in the struggle he tried to think that his uneasiness sprang from his recollection of the previous treachery of captain pinckney and the part that she had played in the californian conspiracy although he had long since acquitted her of the betrayal of any nearer trust but there was a fateful similarity in the two cases there was no doubt that this lieutenant wainwright was a traitor in the campthat he had succumbed to the usual sophistry of his class in regard to his superior allegiance to his native state but was there the inducement of another emotion or was the photograph only the souvenir of a fascinating priestess of rebellion whom the dead man had met there was perhaps less of feeling than scorn in the first suggestion but he was nevertheless relieved when the provost marshal found no other incriminating papers in wainwrights effects nor did he reveal to the division general the finding of the photograph it was sufficient to disclose the work of the traitor without adding what might be a clue to his wifes participation in it near or remote there was risk enough in the former coursewhich his duty made imperative he hardly dared to think of the past days slaughter whichthere was no doubt nowhad been due to the previous work of the spy and how his brigade had been selectedby the irony of fateto suffer for and yet retrieve it if she had had a hand in this wicked plot ought he to spare her or was his destiny and hers to be thus monstrously linked together  luckily however the expiation of the chief offender and the timely discovery of his papers enabled the division commander to keep the affair discreetly silent and to enjoin equal secrecy on the part of brant the latter however did not relax his vigilance and after the advance the next day he made a minute inspection of the ground he was to occupy its approaches and connections with the outlying country and the rebel lines increased the stringency of picket and sentry regulations and exercised a rigid surveillance of noncombatants and civilians within the lines even to the lowest canteener or camp follower then he turned his attention to the house he was to occupy as his headquarters  it was a fine specimen of the old colonial planters house with its broad veranda its great detached offices and negro quarters and had thus far escaped the ravages and billeting of the war it had been occupied by its owner up to a few days before the engagement and so great had been the confidence of the enemy in their success that it had been used as the confederate headquarters on the morning of the decisive battle jasmine and rose unstained by the sulphur of gunpowder twined around its ruined columns and half hid the recessed windows the careless flower garden was still in its unkempt and unplucked luxuriance the courtyard before the stables alone showed marks of the late military occupancy and was pulverized by the uneasy horsehoofs of the waiting staff but the mingled impress of barbaric prodigality with patriarchal simplicity was still there in the domestic arrangements of a race who lived on half equal familiarity with strangers and their own servants  the negro servants still remained with a certain catlike fidelity to the place and adapted themselves to the northern invaders with a childlike enjoyment of the novelty of change brant nevertheless looked them over with an experienced eye and satisfied himself of their trustworthiness there was the usual number of boys grayhaired and grizzled in body service and the mammys and aunties of the kitchen there were two or three rooms in the wing which still contained private articles pictures and souvenirs of the family and a young ladys boudoir which brant with characteristic delicacy kept carefully isolated and intact from his military household and accessible only to the family servants the room he had selected for himself was nearest ita small plainly furnished apartment with an almost conventual simplicity in its cold white walls and draperies and the narrow nunlike bed it struck him that it might have belonged to some prim elder daughter or maiden aunt who had acted as housekeeper as it commanded the wing and servants offices with easy access to the central hall  there followed a week of inactivity in which brant felt a singular resemblance in this southern mansion to the old casa at robles the afternoon shadows of the deep verandas recalled the old monastic gloom of the spanish house which even the presence of a lounging officer or waiting orderly could not entirely dissipate and the scent of the rose and jasmine from his windows overcame him with sad memories he began to chafe under this inaction and long again for the excitement of the march and bivouac in which for the past four years he had buried his past  he was sitting one afternoon alone before his reports and dispatches when this influence seemed so strong that he half impulsively laid them aside to indulge in along reverie he was recalling his last day at robles the early morning duel with pinckney the return to san francisco and the sudden resolution which sent him that day across the continent to offer his services to the government he remembered his delay in the western town where a volunteer regiment was being recruited his entrance into it as a private his rapid selection through the force of his sheer devotion and intelligent concentration to the captaincy of his company his swift promotion on hardfought fields to the head of the regiment and the singular success that had followed his resistless energy which left him no time to think of anything but his duty the sudden intrusion of his wife upon his career now even in this accidental and perhaps innocent way had seriously unsettled him  the shadows were growing heavier and deeper it lacked only a few moments of the sunset bugle when he was recalled to himself by that singular instinctive consciousness common to humanity of being intently looked at he turned quicklythe door behind him closed softly he rose and slipped into the hall the tall figure of a woman was going down the passage she was erect and graceful but as she turned towards the door leading to the offices he distinctly saw the gaudily turbaned head and black silhouette of a negress nevertheless he halted a moment at the door of the next room  see who that woman is who has just passed mr martin she doesnt seem to belong to the house  the young officer rose put on his cap and departed in a few moments he returned  was she tall sir of a good figure and very straight  yes  she is a servant of our neighbors the manlys who occasionally visits the servants here a mulatto i think  brant reflected many of the mulattoes and negresses were of good figure and the habit of carrying burdens on their heads gave them a singularly erect carriage  the lieutenant looked at his chief  have you any orders to give concerning her general  no said brant after a moments pause and turned away  the officer smiled it seemed a good story to tell at mess of this human weakness of his handsome reserved and asceticlooking leader  a few mornings afterwards brant was interrupted over his reports by the almost abrupt entrance of the officer of the day his face was flushed and it was evident that only the presence of his superior restrained his excitement he held a paper in his hand  a lady presents this order and pass from washington countersigned by the division general  a lady  yes sir she is dressed as such but she has not only declined the most ordinary civilities and courtesies we have offered her but she has insulted mr martin and myself grossly and demands to be shown to youalone  brant took the paper it was a special order from the president passing miss matilda faulkner through the federal lines to visit her uncles home known as gray oaks now held and occupied as the headquarters of brants brigade in order to arrange for the preservation and disposal of certain family effects and private property that still remained there or to take and carry away such property and invoking all necessary aid and assistance from the united states forces in such occupancy it was countersigned by the division commander it was perfectly regular and of undoubted authenticity he had heard of passes of this kindthe terror of the armyissued in washington under some strange controlling influence and against military protest but he did not let his subordinate see the uneasiness with which it filled him  show her in he said quietly  but she had already entered brushing scornfully past the officer and drawing her skirt aside as if contaminated a very pretty southern girl scornful and redlipped clad in a gray ridinghabit and still carrying her ridingwhip clenched ominously in her slim gauntleted hand  you have my permit in your hand she said brusquely hardly raising her eyes to brant i suppose its all straight enoughand even if it isnt i dont reckon to be kept waiting with those hirelings  your permit is straight enough miss faulkner said brant slowly reading her name from the document before him but as it does not seem to include permission to insult my officers you will perhaps allow them first to retire  he made a sign to the officer who passed out of the door  as it closed he went on in a gentle but coldly unimpassioned voice  i perceive you are a southern lady and therefore i need not remind you that it is not considered good form to treat even the slaves of those one does not like uncivilly and i must therefore ask you to keep your active animosity for myself  the young girl lifted her eyes she had evidently not expected to meet a man so young so handsome so refined and so coldly invincible in manner still less was she prepared for that kind of antagonism in keeping up her preconcerted attitude towards the northern hireling she had been met with official brusqueness contemptuous silence or aggrieved indignationbut nothing so exasperating as this she even fancied that this elegant but sardoniclooking soldier was mocking her she bit her red lip but with a scornful gesture of her ridingwhip said  i reckon that your knowledge of southern ladies is for certain reasons not very extensive  pardon me i have had the honor of marrying one  apparently more exasperated than before she turned upon him abruptly  you say my pass is all right then i presume i may attend to the business that brought me here  certainly but you will forgive me if i imagined that an expression of contempt for your hosts was a part of it  he rang a bell on the table it was responded to by an orderly  send all the household servants here  the room was presently filled with the dusky faces of the negro retainers here and there was the gleaming of white teeth but a majority of the assembly wore the true negro serious acceptance of the importance of an occasion one or two even affected an official and soldierly bearing and as he fully expected there were several glances of significant recognition of the stranger  you will give said brant sternly every aid and attention to the wants of this young lady who is here to represent the interests of your old master as she will be entirely dependent upon you in all things connected with her visit here see to it that she does not have to complain to me of any inattentionor be obliged to ask for other assistance  as miss faulkner albeit a trifle paler in the cheek but as scornful as ever was about to follow the servants from the room brant stopped her with a coldly courteous gesture  you will understand therefore miss faulkner that you have your wish and that you will not be exposed to any contact with the members of my military family nor they with you  am i then to be a prisoner in this houseand under a free pass of yourpresident she said indignantly  by no means you are free to come and go and see whom you please i have no power to control your actions but i have the power to control theirs  she swept furiously from the room  that is quite enough to fill her with a desire to flirt with every man here said brant to himself with a faint smile but i fancy they have had a taste enough of her quality  nevertheless he sat down and wrote a few lines to the division commander pointing out that he had already placed the owners private property under strict surveillance that it was cared for and perfectly preserved by the household servants and that the pass was evidently obtained as a subterfuge  to this he received a formal reply regretting that the authorities at washington still found it necessary to put this kind of risk and burden on the army in the field but that the order emanated from the highest authority and must be strictly obeyed at the bottom of the page was a characteristic line in pencil in the generals own handnot the kind that is dangerous  a flush mounted brants cheeks as if it contained not only a hidden but a personal significance he had thought of his own wife  singularly enough a day or two later at dinner the conversation turned upon the intense sectional feeling of southern women probably induced by their late experiences brant at the head of the table in his habitual abstraction was scarcely following the somewhat excited diction of colonel strangeways one of his staff  no sir reiterated that indignant warrior take my word for it a southern woman isnt to be trusted on this point whether as a sister sweetheart or wife and when she is trusted shes bound to get the better of the man in any of those relations  the dead silence that followed the ominous joggle of a glass at the speakers elbow the quick sympathetic glance that brant instinctively felt was directed at his own face and the abrupt change of subject could not but arrest his attention even if he had overlooked the speech his face however betrayed nothing it had never however occurred to him before that his family affairs might be knownneither had he ever thought of keeping them a secret it seemed so purely a personal and private misfortune that he had never dreamed of its having any public interest and even now he was a little ashamed of what he believed was his sensitiveness to mere conventional criticism which with the instinct of a proud man he had despised  he was not far wrong in his sardonic intuition of the effect of his prohibition upon miss faulkners feelings certainly that young lady when not engaged in her mysterious occupation of arranging her uncles effects occasionally was seen in the garden and in the woods beyond although her presence was the signal for the oblique of any lounging shoulder strap or the vacant front of a posted sentry she seemed to regard their occasional proximity with less active disfavor once when she had mounted the wall to gather a magnolia blossom the chair by which she had ascended rolled over leaving her on the wall at a signal from the guardroom two sappers and miners appeared carrying a scalingladder which they placed silently against the wall and as silently withdrew on another occasion the same spirited young lady whom brant was satisfied would have probably imperiled her life under fire in devotion to her cause was brought ignominiously to bay in the field by that most appalling of domestic animals the wandering and untrammeled cow brant could not help smiling as he heard the quick harsh call to turn out guard saw the men march stolidly with fixed bayonets to the vicinity of the affrighted animal who fled leaving the fair stranger to walk shamefacedly to the house he was surprised however that she should have halted before his door and with tremulous indignation said  i thank you sir for your chivalrousness in turning a defenseless woman into ridicule  i regret miss faulkner began brant gravely that you should believe that i am able to control the advances of farmyard cattle as easily asbut he stopped as he saw that the angry flash of her blue eyes as she darted past him was set in tears a little remorseful on the following day he added a word to his ordinary caplifting when she went by but she retained a reproachful silence later in the day he received from her servant a respectful request for an interview and was relieved to find that she entered his presence with no trace of her former aggression but rather with the resignation of a deeply injured yet not entirely unforgiving woman  i thought she began coldly that i ought to inform you that i would probably be able to conclude my business here by the day after tomorrow and that you would then be relieved of my presence i am awareindeed she added bitterly i could scarcely help perceiving that it has been an exceedingly irksome one  i trust began brant coldly that no gentleman of my command has  no  she interrupted him quickly with a return of her former manner and a passionate sweep of the hand  do you suppose for a moment that i am speakingthat i am even thinkingof them what are they to me  thank you i am glad to know that they are nothing and that i may now trust that you have consulted my wishes and have reserved your animosity solely for me returned brant quietly that being so i see no reason for your hurrying your departure in the least  she rose instantly  i have she said slowly controlling herself with a slight effort found some one who will take my duty off my hands she is a servant of one of your neighborswho is an old friend of my uncles the woman is familiar with the house and our private property i will give her full instructions to act for me and even an authorization in writing if you prefer it she is already in the habit of coming here but her visits will give you very little trouble and as she is a slave or as you call it i believe a chattel she will be already quite accustomed to the treatment which her class are in the habit of receiving from northern hands  without waiting to perceive the effect of her parthian shot she swept proudly out of the room  i wonder what she means mused brant as her quick step died away in the passage one thing is certaina woman like that is altogether too impulsive for a spy  later in the twilight he saw her walking in the garden there was a figure at her side a little curious he examined it more closely from his window it was already familiar to himthe erect shapely form of his neighbors servant a thoughtful look passed over his face as he mutteredso this is to be her deputy     chapter iii   called to a general council of officers at divisional headquarters the next day brant had little time for further speculation regarding his strange guest but a remark from the division commander that he preferred to commit the general plan of a movement then under discussion to their memories rather than to written orders in the ordinary routine seemed to show that his chief still suspected the existence of a spy he therefore told him of his late interview with miss faulkner and her probable withdrawal in favor of a mulatto neighbor the division commander received the information with indifference  theyre much too clever to employ a hussy like that who shows her hand at every turn either as a spy or a messenger of spiesand the mulattoes are too stupid to say nothing of their probable fidelity to us no general if we are watched it is by an eagle and not a mockingbird miss faulkner has nothing worse about her than her tongue and there isnt the nigger blood in the whole south that would risk a noose for her or for any of their masters or mistresses  it was therefore perhaps with some mitigation of his usual critical severity that he saw her walking before him alone in the lane as he rode home to quarters she was apparently lost in a halfimpatient halfmoody reverie which even the trotting hoofbeats of his own and his orderlys horse had not disturbed from time to time she struck the myrtle hedge beside her with the head of a large flower which hung by its stalk from her listless hands or held it to her face as if to inhale its perfume dismissing his orderly by a side path he rode gently forward but to his surprise without turning or seeming to be aware of his presence she quickened her pace and even appeared to look from side to side for some avenue of escape if only to mend matters he was obliged to ride quickly forward to her side where he threw himself from his horse flung the reins on his arm and began to walk beside her she at first turned a slightly flushed cheek away from him and then looked up with a purely simulated start of surprise  i am afraid he said gently that i am the first to break my own orders in regard to any intrusion on your privacy but i wanted to ask you if i could give you any aid whatever in the change you think of making  he was quite sincerehad been touched by her manifest disturbance and despite his masculine relentlessness of criticism he had an intuition of feminine suffering that was in itself feminine  meaning that you are in a hurry to get rid of me she said curtly without raising her eyes  meaning that i only wish to expedite a business which i think is unpleasant to you but which i believe you have undertaken from unselfish devotion  the scant expression of a reserved nature is sometimes more attractive to women than the most fluent vivacity possibly there was also a melancholy grace in this sardonic soldiers manner that affected her for she looked up and said impulsively  you think so  but he met her eager eyes with some surprise  i certainly do he replied more coldly i can imagine your feelings on finding your uncles home in the possession of your enemies and your presence under the family roof only a sufferance i can hardly believe it a pleasure to you or a task you would have accepted for yourself alone  but she said turning towards him wickedly what if i did it only to excite my revenge what if i knew it would give me courage to incite my people to carry war into your own homes to make you of the north feel as i feel and taste our bitterness  i could easily understand that too he returned with listless coldness although i dont admit that revenge is an unmixed pleasure even to a woman  a woman she repeated indignantly there is no sex in a war like this  you are spoiling your flower he said quietly it is very pretty and a native one too not an invader or even transplanted may i look at it  she hesitated half recoiling for an instant and her hand trembled then suddenly and abruptly she said with a hysteric little laugh take it then and almost thrust it in his hand  it certainly was a pretty flower not unlike a lily in appearance with a belllike cup and long anthers covered with a fine pollen like red dust as he lifted it to his face to inhale its perfume she uttered a slight cry and snatched it from his hand  there she said with the same nervous laugh i knew you would i ought to have warned you the pollen comes off so easily and leaves a stain and youve got some on your cheek look she continued taking her handkerchief from her pocket and wiping his cheek see there the delicate cambric showed a bloodred streak  it grows in a swamp she continued in the same excited strain we call it dragons teethlike the kind that was sown in the story you know we children used to find it and then paint our faces and lips with it we called it our rouge i was almost tempted to try it again when i found it just now it took me back so to the old times  following her odd manner rather than her words as she turned her face towards him suddenly brant was inclined to think that she had tried it already so scarlet was her cheek but it presently paled again under his cold scrutiny  you must miss the old times he said calmly i am afraid you found very little of them left except in these flowers  and hardly these she said bitterly your troops had found a way through the marsh and had trampled down the bushes  brants brow clouded he remembered that the brook which had run red during the fight had lost itself in this marsh it did not increase his liking for this beautiful but blindly vicious animal at his side and even his momentary pity for her was fading fast she was incorrigible they walked on for a few moments in silence  you said she began at last in a gentler and even hesitating voice that your wife was a southern woman  he checked an irritated start with difficulty  i believe i did he said coldly as if he regretted it  and of course you taught her your gospelthe gospel according to st lincoln oh i know she went on hurriedly as if conscious of his irritation and seeking to allay it she was a woman and loved you and thought with your thoughts and saw only with your eyes yes thats the way with usi suppose we all do it she added bitterly  she had her own opinions said brant briefly as he recovered himself  nevertheless his manner so decidedly closed all further discussion that there was nothing left for the young girl but silence but it was broken by her in a few moments in her old contemptuous voice and manner  pray dont trouble yourself to accompany me any further general brant unless of course you are afraid i may come across some of youryour soldiers i promise you i wont eat them  i am afraid you must suffer my company a little longer miss faulkner on account of those same soldiers returned brant gravely you may not know that this road in which i find you takes you through a cordon of pickets if you were alone you would be stopped questioned and failing to give the password you would be detained sent to the guardhouse andhe stopped and fixed his eyes on her keenly as he added and searched  you would not dare to search a woman she said indignantly although her flush gave way to a slight pallor  you said just now that there should be no sex in a war like this returned brant carelessly but without abating his scrutinizing gaze  then it is war she said quickly with a white significant face  his look of scrutiny turned to one of puzzled wonder but at the same moment there was the flash of a bayonet in the hedge a voice called halt and a soldier stepped into the road  general brant advanced met the salute of the picket with a few formal words and then turned towards his fair companion as another soldier and a sergeant joined the group  miss faulkner is new to the camp took the wrong turning and was unwittingly leaving the lines when i joined her he fixed his eyes intently on her now colorless face but she did not return his look you will show her the shortest way to quarters he continued to the sergeant and should she at any time again lose her way you will again conduct her homebut without detaining or reporting her  he lifted his cap remounted his horse and rode away as the young girl with a proud indifferent step moved down the road with the sergeant a mounted officer passed him and salutedit was one of his own staff from some strange instinct he knew that he had witnessed the scene and from some equally strange intuition he was annoyed by it but he continued his way visiting one or two outposts and returned by a long detour to his quarters as he stepped upon the veranda he saw miss faulkner at the bottom of the garden talking with some one across the hedge by the aid of his glass he could recognize the shapely figure of the mulatto woman which he had seen before but by its aid he also discovered that she was carrying a flower exactly like the one which miss faulkner still held in her hand had she been with miss faulkner in the lane and if so why had she disappeared when he came up impelled by something stronger than mere curiosity he walked quickly down the garden but she evidently had noticed him for she as quickly disappeared not caring to meet miss faulkner again he retraced his steps resolving that he would on the first opportunity personally examine and interrogate this new visitor for if she were to take miss faulkners place in a subordinate capacity this precaution was clearly within his rights  he reentered his room and seated himself at his desk before the dispatches orders and reports awaiting him he found himself however working half mechanically and recurring to his late interview with miss faulkner in the lane if she had any inclination to act the spy or to use her position here as a means of communicating with the enemys lines he thought he had thoroughly frightened her nevertheless now for the first time he was inclined to accept his chiefs opinion of her she was not only too clumsy and inexperienced but she totally lacked the selfrestraint of a spy her nervous agitation in the lane was due to something more disturbing than his mere possible intrusion upon her confidences with the mulatto the significance of her question then it is war was at best a threat and that implied hesitation he recalled her strange allusion to his wife was it merely the outcome of his own foolish confession on their first interview or was it a concealed ironical taunt being satisfied however that she was not likely to imperil his public duty in any way he was angry with himself for speculating further but although he still felt towards her the same antagonism she had at first provoked he was conscious that she was beginning to exercise a strange fascination over him  dismissing her at last with an effort he finished his work and then rose and unlocking a closet took out a small dispatchbox to which he intended to intrust a few more important orders and memoranda as he opened it with a key on his watchchain he was struck with a faint perfume that seemed to come from ita perfume that he remembered was it the smell of the flower that miss faulkner carried or the scent of the handkerchief with which she had wiped his cheek or a mingling of both or was he under some spell to think of that wretched girl and her witchlike flower he leaned over the box and suddenly started upon the outer covering of a dispatch was a singular bloodred streak he examined it closelyit was the powdery stain of the lily pollenexactly as he had seen it on her handkerchief  there could be no mistake he passed his finger over the stain he could still feel the slippery infinitesimal powder of the pollen it was not there when he had closed the box that morning it was impossible that it should be there unless the box had been opened in his absence he reexamined the contents of the box the papers were all there more than that they were papers of no importance except to him personally contained no plans nor key to any military secret he had been far too wise to intrust any to the accidents of this alien house the prying intruder whoever it was had gained nothing but there was unmistakably the attempt and the existence of a wouldbe spy within the purlieus of the house was equally clear  he called an officer from the next room  has any one been here since my absence  no general  has any one passed through the hall  he had fully anticipated the answer as the subaltern replied only the women servants  he reentered the room closing the door he again carefully examined the box his table the papers upon it the chair before it and even the chinese matting on the floor for any further indication of the pollen it hardly seemed possible that any one could have entered the room with the flower in their hand without scattering some of the telltale dust elsewhere it was too large a flower to be worn on the breast or in the hair again no one would have dared to linger there long enough to have made an examination of the box with an officer in the next room and the sergeant passing the box had been removed and the examination made elsewhere  an idea seized him miss faulkner was still absent the mulatto had apparently gone home he quickly mounted the staircase but instead of entering his room turned suddenly aside into the wing which had been reserved the first door yielded as he turned its knob gently and entered a room which he at once recognized as the young ladys boudoir but the dusty and draped furniture had been rearranged and uncovered and the apartment bore every sign of present use yet although there was unmistakable evidence of its being used by a person of taste and refinement he was surprised to see that the garments hanging in an open press were such as were used by negro servants and that a gaudy handkerchief such as housemaids used for turbans was lying on the pretty silk coverlet he did not linger over these details but cast a rapid glance round the room then his eyes became fixed on a fanciful writingdesk which stood by the window for in a handsome vase placed on its level top and drooping on a portfolio below hung a cluster of the very flowers that miss faulkner had carried      chapter iv   it seemed plain to brant that the dispatchbox had been conveyed here and opened for security on this desk and in the hurry of examining the papers the flower had been jostled and the fallen grains of pollen overlooked by the spy there were one or two freckles of red on the desk which made this accident appear the more probable but he was equally struck by another circumstance the desk stood immediately before the window as he glanced mechanically from it he was surprised to see that it commanded an extensive view of the slope below the eminence on which the house stood even beyond his furthest line of pickets the vase of flowers each of which was nearly as large as a magnolia blossom and striking in color occupied a central position before it and no doubt could be quite distinctly seen from a distance from this circumstance he could not resist the strong impression that this fateful and extraordinary blossom carried by miss faulkner and the mulatto and so strikingly in evidence at the window was in some way a signal obeying an impulse which he was conscious had a half superstitious foundation he carefully lifted the vase from its position before the window and placed it on a side table then he cautiously slipped from the room  but he could not easily shake off the perplexity which the occurrence had caused although he was satisfied that it was fraught with no military or strategic danger to his command and that the unknown spy had obtained no information whatever yet he was forced to admit to himself that he was more concerned in his attempts to justify the conduct of miss faulkner with this later revelation it was quite possible that the dispatchbox had been purloined by some one else during her absence from the house as the presence of the mulatto servant in his room would have been less suspicious than hers there was really little evidence to connect miss faulkner with the actual outragerather might not the real spy have taken advantage of her visit here to throw suspicion upon her he remembered her singular mannerthe strange inconsistency with which she had forced this flower upon him she would hardly have done so had she been conscious of its having so serious an import yet what was the secret of her manifest agitation a sudden inspiration flashed across his mind a smile came upon his lips she was in love the enemys line contained some sighing strephon of a young subaltern with whom she was in communication and for whom she had undertaken this quest the flower was their language of correspondence no doubt it explained also the young girls animosity against the younger officershis adversaries against himselftheir commander he had previously wondered why if she were indeed a spy she had not chosen upon some equally specious order from washington the headquarters of the division commander whose secrets were more valuable this was explained by the fact that she was nearer the lines and her lover in her present abode he had no idea that he was making excuses for herhe believed himself only just the recollection of what she had said of the power of love albeit it had hurt him cruelly at the time was now clearer to him and even seemed to mitigate her offense she would be here but a day or two longer he could afford to wait without interrogating her  but as to the real intruder spy or thiefthat was another affair and quickly settled he gave an order to the officer of the day peremptorily forbidding the entrance of alien servants or slaves within the precincts of the headquarters any one thus trespassing was to be brought before him the officer looked surprised he even fancied disappointed the graces of the mulatto womans figure had evidently not been thrown away upon his subalterns  an hour or two later when he was mounting his horse for a round of inspection he was surprised to see miss faulkner accompanied by the mulatto woman running hurriedly to the house he had forgotten his late order until he saw the latter halted by the sentries but the young girl came flying on regardless of her companion her skirt was held in one hand her straw hat had fallen back in her flight and was caught only by a ribbon around her swelling throat and her loosened hair lay in a black rippled loop on one shoulder for an instant brant thought that she was seeking him in indignation at his order but a second look at her set face eager eyes and parted scarlet lips showed him that she had not even noticed him in the concentration of her purpose she swept by him into the hall he heard the swish of her skirt and rapid feet on the stairsshe was gone what had happened or was this another of her moods  but he was called to himself by the apparition of a corporal standing before him with the mulatto womanthe first capture under his order she was tall wellformed but unmistakably showing the negro type even in her small features her black eyes were excited but unintelligent her manner dogged but with the obstinacy of halfconscious stupidity brant felt not only disappointed but had a singular impression that she was not the same woman that he had first seen yet there was the tall graceful figure the dark profile and the turbaned head that he had once followed down the passage by his room  her story was as stupidly simple she had known missy from a chile she had just traipsed over to see her that afternoon they were walking together when the sojers stopped her she had never been stopped before even by the patter rollers her old massa manly had gib leaf to go see miss tilly and hadnt said nuffin about no orders        i e patrolsa civic homeguard in the south that kept      surveillance of slaves  more annoyed than he cared to confess brant briefly dismissed her with a warning as he cantered down the slope the view of the distant pickets recalled the window in the wing and he turned in his saddle to look at it there it wasthe largest and most dominant window in that part of the buildingand within it a distinct and vivid object almost filling the opening was the vase of flowers which he had a few hours ago removed restored to its original position he smiled the hurried entrance and consternation of miss faulkner were now fully explained he had interrupted some impassioned message perhaps even countermanded some affectionate rendezvous beyond the lines and it seemed to settle the fact that it was she who had done the signaling but would not this also make her cognizant of the taking of the dispatchbox he reflected however that the room was apparently occupied by the mulatto womanhe remembered the calico dresses and turban on the bedand it was possible that miss faulkner had only visited it for the purpose of signaling to her lover although this circumstance did not tend to make his mind easier it was however presently diverted by a new arrival and a strange recognition  as he rode through the camp a group of officers congregated before a large mess tent appeared to be highly amused by the conversationhalf monologue and half harangue of a singularlooking individual who stood in the centre he wore a slouch hat to the band of which he had imparted a military air by the addition of a gold cord but the brim was caught up at the side in a peculiarly theatrical and highly artificial fashion a heavy cavalry sabre depended from a broadbuckled belt under his black frock coat with the addition of two revolversminus their holstersstuck on either side of the buckle after the style of a stage smuggler a pair of long enameled leather riding boots with the tops turned deeply over as if they had once done duty for the representative of a cavalier completed his extraordinary equipment the group were so absorbed in him that they did not perceive the approach of their chief and his orderly and brant with a sign to the latter halted only a few paces from this central figure his speech was a singular mingling of highflown and exalted epithets with inexact pronunciation and occasional lapses of western slang  well i aint purtendin to any stratutegical smartness and i didnt gradooate at west point as one of those apocryphal engineers i dont do much talking about flank movements or recognizances in force or ekellon skirmishing but when it comes down to square ingin fightin i reckon i kin have my say there are men who dont know the army contractor he added darkly who mebbe have heard of red jim i dont mention names gentlemen but only the other day a man that you all know says to me if i only knew what you do about scoutin i wouldnt be wanting for information as i do i aint goin to say who it was or break any confidences between gentlemen by saying how many stars he had on his shoulder strap but he was a man who knew what he was saying and i say agin gentlemen that the curse of the northern army is the want of proper scoutin what was it caused bulls runwant o scoutin what was it rolled up popewant o scoutin what caused the slaughter at the wildernesswant o scoutiningin scoutin why only the other day gentlemen i was approached to know what id take to organize a scoutin force and what did i sayno general it aint because i represent one of the largest army beef contracts in this country says i it aint because i belong so to speak to the sinews of war but because id want about ten thousand trained ingins from the reservations and the regular west point hightoned scientific inkybus that weighs so heavily on our army dont see itand wont have it then sherman he sez to me  but here a roar of laughter interrupted him and in the cross fire of sarcastic interrogations that began brant saw with relief a chance of escape for in the voice manner and above all the characteristic temperament of the stranger he had recognized his old playmate and the husband of susythe redoubtable jim hooker there was no mistaking that gloomy audacity that mysterious significance that magnificent lying but even at that moment clarence brants heart had gone out with all his old loyalty of feeling towards his old companion he knew that a public recognition of him then and there would plunge hooker into confusion he felt keenly the ironical plaudits and laughter of his officers over the manifest weakness and vanity of the exteamster exrancher exactor and husband of his old girl sweetheart and would have spared him the knowledge that he had overheard it turning hastily to the orderly he bade him bring the stranger to his headquarters and rode away unperceived  he had heard enough however to account for his presence there and the singular chance that had brought them again together he was evidently one of those large civil contractors of supplies whom the government was obliged to employ who visited the camp half officially and whom the army alternately depended upon and abused brant had dealt with his underlings in the commissariat and even now remembered that he had heard he was coming but had overlooked the significance of his name but how he came to leave his theatrical profession how he had attained a position which implied a command of considerable capitalfor many of the contractors had already amassed large fortunesand what had become of susy and her ambitions in this radical change of circumstances were things still to be learned in his own changed conditions he had seldom thought of her it was with a strange feeling of irritation and half responsibility that he now recalled their last interview and the emotion to which he had yielded  he had not long to wait he had scarcely regained the quarters at his own private office before he heard the step of the orderly upon the veranda and the trailing clank of hookers sabre he did not know however that hooker without recognizing his name had received the message as a personal tribute and had left his sarcastic companions triumphantly with the air of going to a confidential interview to which his wellknown military criticism had entitled him it was with a bearing of gloomy importance and his characteristic sullen sidelong glance that he entered the apartment and did not look up until brant had signaled the orderly to withdraw and closed the door behind him and then he recognized his old boyish companionthe preferred favorite of fortune  for a moment he gasped with astonishment for a moment gloomy incredulity suspicion delight pride admiration even affection struggled for mastery in his sullen staring eyes and open twitching mouth for here was clarence brant handsomer than ever more superior than ever in the majesty of uniform and authority which fitted himthe younger manby reason of his four years of active service with the careless ease and bearing of the veteran here was the hero whose name was already so famous that the mere coincidence of it with that of the modest civilian he had known would have struck him as preposterous yet here he wassupreme and dazzlingsurrounded by the pomp and circumstance of warinto whose reserved presence he jim hooker had been ushered with the formality of challenge saluting and presented bayonets  luckily brant had taken advantage of his first gratified ejaculation to shake him warmly by the hand and then with both hands laid familiarly on his shoulder force him down into a chair luckily for by that time jim hooker had with characteristic gloominess found time to taste the pangs of envyan envy the more keen since in spite of his success as a peaceful contractor he had always secretly longed for military display and distinction he looked at the man who had achieved it as he firmly believed by sheer luck and accident and his eyes darkened then with characteristic weakness and vanity he began to resist his first impressions of clarences superiority and to air his own importance he leaned heavily back in the chair in which he had been thus genially forced drew off his gauntlet and attempted to thrust it through his belt as he had seen brant do but failed on account of his pistols already occupying that position dropped it got his sword between his legs in attempting to pick it up and then leaned back again with halfclosed eyes serenely indifferent of his old companions smiling face  i reckon he began slowly with a slightly patronizing air that wed have met sooner or later at washington or at grants headquarters for hooker meacham  co go everywhere and are about as well known as majorgenerals to say nothin he went on with a sidelong glance at brants shoulderstraps of brigadiers and its rather strangeonly of course youre kind of fresh in the servicethat you aint heard of me afore  but im very glad to hear of you now jim said brant smiling and from your own lipswhich i am also delighted to find he added mischievously are still as frankly communicative on that topic as of old but i congratulate you old fellow on your good fortune when did you leave the stage  mr hooker frowned slightly  i never was really on the stage you know he said waving his hand with assumed negligence only went on to please my wife mrs hooker wouldnt act with vulgar professionals dont you see i was really manager most of the time and lessee of the theatre went east when the war broke out to offer my sword and knowledge of ingin fightin to uncle sam drifted into a big pork contract at st louis with fremont been at it ever since offered a commission in the reglar service lots o times refused  why asked brant demurely  too much west point starch around to suit me returned hooker darkly and too many spies  spies echoed brant abstractedly with a momentary reminiscence of miss faulkner  yes spies continued hooker with dogged mystery one half of washington is watching tother half and from the presidents wife down most of the women are secesh  brant suddenly fixed his keen eyes on his guest but the next moment he reflected that this was only jim hookers usual speech and possessed no ulterior significance he smiled again and said more gently  and how is mrs hooker  mr hooker fixed his eyes on the ceiling rose and pretended to look out of the window then taking his seat again by the table as if fronting an imaginary audience and pulling slowly at his gauntlets after the usual theatrical indication of perfect sangfroid said  there aint any  good heavens said brant with genuine emotion i beg your pardon really i  mrs hooker and me are divorced continued hooker slightly changing his attitude and leaning heavily on his sabre with his eyes still on his fanciful audience there was you understandlightly tossing his gauntlet asideincompatibility of temperandweparted ha  he uttered a low bitter scornful laugh which however produced the distinct impression in brants mind that up to that moment he had never had the slightest feeling in the matter whatever  you seemed to be on such good terms with each other murmured brant vaguely  seemed said hooker bitterly glancing sardonically at an ideal second row in the pit before him yesseemed there were other differences social and political you understand that you have suffered too he reached out his hand and pressed brants in heavy effusiveness but he continued haughtily lightly tossing his glove again we are also men of the world we let that pass  and it was possible that he found the strain of his present attitude too great for he changed to an easier position  but said brant curiously i always thought that mrs hooker was intensely union and northern  put on said hooker in his natural voice  but you remember the incident of the flag persisted brant  mrs hooker was always an actress said hooker significantly but he added cheerfully mrs hooker is now the wife of senator boompointer one of the wealthiest and most powerful republicans in washingtoncarries the patronage of the whole west in his vest pocket  yet if she is not a republican why did shebegan brant  for a purpose replied hooker darkly but he added again with greater cheerfulness she belongs to the very elite of washington society goes to all the foreign ambassadors balls and is a power at the white house her picture is in all the firstclass illustrated papers  the singular but unmistakable pride of the man in the importance of the wife from whom he was divorced and for whom he did not care would have offended brants delicacy or at least have excited his ridicule but for the reason that he was more deeply stung by hookers allusion to his own wife and his degrading similitude of their two conditions but he dismissed the former as part of hookers invincible and still boyish extravagance and the latter as part of his equally characteristic assumption perhaps he was conscious too notwithstanding the lapse of years and the condonation of separation and forgetfulness that he deserved little delicacy from the hands of susys husband nevertheless he dreaded to hear him speak again of her and the fear was realized in a question  does she know you are here  who said brant curtly  your wife that isi reckon shes your wife still eh  yes but i do not know what she knows returned brant quietly he had regained his selfcomposure  susymrs senator boompointer that issaid hooker with an apparent dignity in his late wifes new title allowed that shed gone abroad on a secret mission from the southern confederacy to them crowned heads over there she was good at ropin men in you know anyhow susy afore she was mrs boompointer was dead set on findin out where she was but never could she seemed to drop out of sight a year ago some said one thing and some said another but you can bet your bottom dollar that mrs senator boompointer who knows how to pull all the wires in washington will know if any one does  but is mrs boompointer really disaffected and a southern sympathizer said brant or is it only caprice or fashion  while speaking he had risen with a halfabstracted face and had gone to the window where he stood in a listening attitude presently he opened the window and stepped outside hooker wonderingly followed him one or two officers had already stepped out of their rooms and were standing upon the veranda another had halted in the path then one quickly reentered the house reappeared with his cap and sword in his hand and ran lightly toward the guardhouse a slight crackling noise seemed to come from beyond the garden wall  whats up said hooker with staring eyes  picket firing  the crackling suddenly became a long rattle brant reentered the room and picked up his hat  youll excuse me for a few moments  a faint sound soft yet full and not unlike a bursting bubble made the house appear to leap elastically like the rebound of a rubber ball  whats that gasped hooker  cannon out of range      chapter v   in another instant bugles were ringing through the camp with the hurrying hoofs of mounted officers and the trampling of forming men the house itself was almost deserted although the single cannonshot had been enough to show that it was no mere skirmishing of pickets brant still did not believe in any serious attack of the enemy his position as in the previous engagement had no strategic importance to them they were no doubt only making a feint against it to conceal some advance upon the centre of the army two miles away satisfied that he was in easy supporting distance of his division commander he extended his line along the ridge ready to fall back in that direction while retarding their advance and masking the position of his own chief he gave a few orders necessary to the probable abandonment of the house and then returned to it shot and shell were already dropping in the field below a thin ridge of blue haze showed the line of skirmish fire a small conical white cloud like a bursting cottonpod revealed an open battery in the willowfringed meadow yet the pastoral peacefulness of the house was unchanged the afternoon sun lay softly on its deep verandas the pot pourri incense of fallen roseleaves haunted it still  he entered his room through the french window on the veranda when the door leading from the passage was suddenly flung open and miss faulkner swept quickly inside closed the door behind her and leaned back against it panting and breathless  clarence was startled and for a moment ashamed he had suddenly realized that in the excitement he had entirely forgotten her and the dangers to which she might be exposed she had probably heard the firing her womanly fears had been awakened she had come to him for protection but as he turned towards her with a reassuring smile he was shocked to see that her agitation and pallor were far beyond any physical cause she motioned him desperately to shut the window by which he had entered and said with white lips  i must speak with you alone  certainly but there is no immediate danger to you even hereand i can soon put you beyond the reach of any possible harm  harmto me god if it were only that  he stared at her uneasily  listen she said gaspingly listen to me then hate despise mekill me if you will for you are betrayed and ruinedcut off and surrounded it has been helped on by me but i swear to you the blow did not come from my hand i would have saved you god only knows how it happenedit was fate  in an instant brant saw the whole truth instinctively and clearly but with the revelation came the usual calmness and perfect selfpossession which never yet had failed him in any emergency with the sound of the increasing cannonade and its shifting position made clearer to his ears the view of his whole threatened position spread out like a map before his eyes the swift calculation of the time his men could hold the ridge in his mindeven a hurried estimate of the precious moments he could give to the wretched woman before himhe even then gravely and gently led her to a chair and said in a calm voice  that is not enough speak slowly plainly i must know everything how and in what way have you betrayed me  she looked at him imploringlyreassured yet awed by his gentleness  you wont believe me you cannot believe me for i do not even know i have taken and exchanged letterswhose contents i never sawbetween the confederates and a spy who comes to this house but who is far away by this time i did it because i thought you hated and despised me because i thought it was my duty to help my causebecause you said it was war between usbut i never spied on you i swear it  then how do you know of this attack he said calmly  she brightened half timidly half hopefully  there is a window in the wing of this house that overlooks the slope near the confederate lines there was a signal placed in itnot by mebut i know it meant that as long as it was there the plot whatever it was was not ripe and that no attack would be made on you as long as it was visible that much i knowthat much the spy had to tell me for we both had to guard that room in turns i wanted to keep this dreadful thing offuntilher voice trembled until she added hurriedly seeing his calm eyes were reading her very soul until i went awayand for that purpose i withheld some of the letters that were given me but this morning while i was away from the house i looked back and saw that the signal was no longer there some one had changed it i ran back but i was too lategod help meas you see  the truth flashed upon brant it was his own hand that had precipitated the attack but a larger truth came to him now like a dazzling inspiration if he had thus precipitated the attack before they were ready there was a chance that it was imperfect and there was still hope but there was no trace of this visible in his face as he fixed his eyes calmly on hers although his pulses were halting in expectancy as he said  then the spy had suspected you and changed it  oh no she said eagerly for the spy was with me and was frightened too we both ran back togetheryou remembershe was stopped by the patrol  she checked herself suddenly but too late her cheeks blazed her head sank with the foolish identification of the spy into which her eagerness had betrayed her  but brant appeared not to notice it he was in fact puzzling his brain to conceive what information the stupid mulatto woman could have obtained here his strength his position was no secret to the enemythere was nothing to gain from him she must have been like the trembling eager woman before him a mere tool of others  did this woman live here he said  no she said she lived with the manlys but had friends whom she visited at your generals headquarters  with difficulty brant suppressed a start it was clear to him now the information had been obtained at the division headquarters and passed through his camp as being nearest the confederate lines but what was the informationand what movement had he precipitated it was clear that this woman did not know he looked at her keenly a sudden explosion shook the housea drift of smoke passed the windowa shell had burst in the garden  she had been gazing at him despairingly wistfullybut did not blanch or start  an idea took possession of him he approached her and took her cold hand a halfsmile parted her pale lips  you have courageyou have devotion he said gravely i believe you regret the step you have taken if you could undo what you have done even at peril to yourself dare you do it  yes she said breathlessly  you are known to the enemy if i am surrounded you could pass through their lines unquestioned  yes she said eagerly  a note from me would pass you again through the pickets of our headquarters but you would bear a note to the general that no eyes but his must see it would not implicate you or yours would only be a word of warning  and you she said quickly would be saved they would come to your assistance you would not then be taken  he smiled gently  perhapswho knows  he sat down and wrote hurriedly  this he said handing her a slip of paper is a pass you will use it beyond your own lines this note he continued handing her a sealed envelope is for the general no one else must see it or know of itnot even your lover should you meet him  my lover she said indignantly with a flash of her old savagery what do you mean i have no lover  brant glanced at her flushed face  i thought he said quietly that there was some one you cared for in yonder linessome one you wrote to it would have been an excuse  he stopped as her face paled again and her hands dropped heavily at her side  good godyou thought that too you thought that i would sacrifice you for another man  pardon me said brant quickly i was foolish but whether your lover is a man or a cause you have shown a womans devotion and in repairing your fault you are showing more than a womans courage now  to his surprise the color had again mounted her pretty cheeks and even a flash of mischief shone in her blue eyes  it would have been an excuse she murmured yesto save a man surely then she said quickly i will go at once i am ready  one moment he said gravely although this pass and an escort insure your probable safe conduct this is war and danger you are still a spy are you ready to go  i am she said proudly tossing back a braid of her fallen hair yet a moment after she hesitated then she said in a lower voice are you ready to forgive  in either case he said touched by her manner and god speed you  he extended his hand and left a slight pressure on her cold fingers but they slipped quickly from his grasp and she turned away with a heightened color  he stepped to the door one or two aidesdecamp withheld by his order against intrusion were waiting eagerly with reports the horse of a mounted field officer was pawing the garden turf the officers stared at the young girl  take miss faulkner with a flag to some safe point of the enemys line she is a noncombatant of their own and will receive their protection  he had scarcely exchanged a dozen words with the aidesdecamp before the field officer hurriedly entered taking brant aside he said quickly  pardon me general but there is a strong feeling among the men that this attack is the result of some information obtained by the enemy you must know that the woman you have just given a safeguard to is suspected and the men are indignant  the more reason why she should be conveyed beyond any consequences of their folly major said brant frigidly and i look to you for her safe convoy there is nothing in this attack to show that the enemy has received any information regarding us but i would suggest that it would be better to see that my orders are carried out regarding the slaves and noncombatants who are passing our lines from divisional headquarters where valuable information may be obtained than in the surveillance of a testy and outspoken girl  an angry flush crossed the majors cheek as he saluted and fell back and brant turned to the aidedecamp the news was grave the column of the enemy was moving against the ridgeit was no longer possible to hold itand the brigade was cut off from its communication with the divisional headquarters although as yet no combined movement was made against it brants secret fears that it was an intended impact against the centre were confirmed would his communication to the divisional commander pass through the attacking column in time  yet one thing puzzled him the enemy after forcing his flank had shown no disposition even with their overwhelming force to turn aside and crush him he could easily have fallen back when it was possible to hold the ridge no longer without pursuit his other flank and rear were not threatened as they might have been by the division of so large an attacking column which was moving steadily on towards the ridge it was this fact that seemed to show a failure or imperfection in the enemys plan it was possible that his precipitation of the attack by the changed signal had been the cause of it doubtless some provision had been made to attack him in flank and rear but in the unexpected hurry of the onset it had to be abandoned he could still save himself as his officers knew but his conviction that he might yet be able to support his divisional commander by holding his position doggedly but coolly awaiting his opportunity was strong more than that it was his temperament and instinct  harrying them in flank and rear contesting the ground inch by inch and holding his own against the artillery sent to dislodge him or the outriding cavalry that circling round swept through his open ranks he saw his files melt away beside this steady current without flinching      chapter vi   yet all along the fateful ridgenow obscured and confused with thin crossing smokedrifts from filefiring like partly rubbedout slatepencil marks or else when cleared of those drifts presenting only an indistinguishable map of zigzag lines of straggling wagons and horses unintelligible to any eye but histhe singular magnetism of the chief was felt everywhere whether it was shown in the quick closing in of resistance to some sharper onset of the enemy or the more dogged stand of inaction under fire his power was always dominant a word or two of comprehensive direction sent through an aidedecamp or the sudden relief of his dark watchful composed face uplifted above a line of bayonets never failed in their magic like all born leaders he seemed in these emergencies to hold a charmed lifeinfecting his followers with a like disbelief in death men dropped to right and left of him with serene assurance in their ghastly faces or a cry of life and confidence in their last gasp stragglers fell in and closed up under his passing glance a hopeless inextricable wrangle around an overturned caisson at a turn of the road resolved itself into an orderly quiet deliberate clearing away of the impediment before the significant waiting of that dark silent horseman  yet under this imperturbable mask he was keenly conscious of everything in that apparent concentration there was a sharpening of all his senses and his impressibility he saw the first trace of doubt or alarm in the face of a subaltern to whom he was giving an order the first touch of sluggishness in a reforming line the more significant clumsiness of a living evolution that he knew was clogged by the dead bodies of comrades the ominous silence of a breastwork the awful inertia of some rigidly kneeling files beyond which still kept their form but never would move again the melting away of skirmish points the sudden gaps here and there the sickening incurving of what a moment before had been a straight lineall these he saw in all their fatal significance but even at this moment coming upon a hasty barricade of overset commissary wagons he stopped to glance at a familiar figure he had seen but an hour ago who now seemed to be commanding a group of collected stragglers and camp followers mounted on a wheel with a revolver in each hand and a bowie knife between his teeththeatrical even in his paroxysm of undoubted courageglared jim hooker and clarence brant with the whole responsibility of the field on his shoulders even at that desperate moment found himself recalling a vivid picture of the actor hooker personating the character of red dick in rosalie the prairie flower as he had seen him in a california theatre five years before  it wanted still an hour of the darkness that would probably close the fight of that day could he hold out keeping his offensive position so long a hasty council with his officers showed him that the weakness of their position had already infected them they reminded him that his line of retreat was still openthat in the course of the night the enemy although still pressing towards the division centre might yet turn and outflank himor that their strangely delayed supports might come up before morning brants glass however remained fixed on the main column still pursuing its way along the ridge it struck him suddenly however that the steady current had stopped spread out along the crest on both sides and was now at right angles with its previous course there had been a check the next moment the thunder of guns along the whole horizon and the rising cloud of smoke revealed a line of battle the division centre was engaged the opportunity he had longed for had comethe desperate chance to throw himself on their rear and cut his way through to the divisionbut it had come too late he looked at his shattered ranksscarce a regiment remained even as a demonstration the attack would fail against the enemys superior numbers nothing clearly was left to him now but to remain where he waswithin supporting distance and await the issue of the fight beyond he was putting up his glass when the dull boom of cannon in the extreme western limit of the horizon attracted his attention by the still gleaming sky he could see a long gray line stealing up from the valley from the distant rear of the headquarters to join the main column they were the missing supports his heart leaped he held the key of the mystery now the one imperfect detail of the enemys plan was before him the supports coming later from the west had only seen the second signal from the windowwhen miss faulkner had replaced the vaseand had avoided his position it was impossible to limit the effect of this blunder if the young girl who had thus saved him had reached the division commander with his message in time he might be forewarned and even profit by it his own position would be less precarious as the enemy already engaged in front would be unable to recover their position in the rear and correct the blunder the bulk of their column had already streamed past him if defeated there was always the danger that it might be rolled back upon himbut he conjectured that the division commander would attempt to prevent the junction of the supports with the main column by breaking between them crowding them from the ridge and joining him as the last stragglers of the rear guard swept by brants bugles were already recalling the skirmishers he redoubled his pickets and resolved to wait and watch  and there was the more painful duty of looking after the wounded and the dead the larger rooms of the headquarters had already been used as a hospital passing from cot to cot recognizing in the faces now drawn with agony or staring in vacant unconsciousness the features that he had seen only a few hours before flushed with enthusiasm and excitement something of his old doubting questioning nature returned was there no way but this how far was hemoving among them unscathed and uninjuredresponsible  and if not hewho then his mind went back bitterly to the old days of the conspiracyto the inception of that struggle which was bearing such ghastly fruit he thought of his traitorous wife until he felt his cheeks tingle and he was fain to avert his eyes from those of his prostrate comrades in a strange fear that with the clairvoyance of dying men they should read his secret  it was past midnight when without undressing he threw himself upon his bed in the little conventlike cell to snatch a few moments of sleep its spotless peaceful walls and draperies affected him strangely as if he had brought into its immaculate serenity the sanguine stain of war he was awakened suddenly from a deep slumber by an indefinite sense of alarm his first thought was that he had been summoned to repel an attack he sat up and listened everything was silent except the measured tread of the sentry on the gravel walk below but the door was open he sprang to his feet and slipped into the gallery in time to see the tall figure of a woman glide before the last moonlit window at its farthest end he could not see her facebut the characteristic turbaned head of the negro race was plainly visible  he did not care to follow her or even to alarm the guard if it were the spy or one of her emissaries she was powerless now to do any harm and under his late orders and the rigorous vigilance of his sentinels she could not leave the linesor indeed the house she probably knew this as well as he did it was therefore no doubt only an accidental intrusion of one of the servants he reentered the room and stood for a few moments by the window looking over the moonlit ridge the sounds of distant cannon had long since ceased wide awake and refreshed by the keen morning air which alone of all created things seemed to have shaken the burden of the dreadful yesterday from its dewy wings he turned away and lit a candle on the table as he was rebuckling his sword belt he saw a piece of paper lying on the foot of the bed from which he had just risen taking it to the candle he read in a roughly scrawled hand  you are asleep when you should be on the march you have no time to lose before daybreak the supports of the column you have been foolishly resisting will be upon youfrom one who would save you but hates your cause  a smile of scorn passed his lips the handwriting was unknown and evidently disguised the purport of the message had not alarmed him but suddenly a suspicion flashed upon himthat it came from miss faulkner she had failed in her attempt to pass through the enemys linesor she had never tried to she had deceived himor had thought better of her chivalrous impulse and now sought to mitigate her second treachery by this second warning and he had let her messenger escape him  he hurriedly descended the stairs the sound of voices was approaching him he halted and recognized the faces of the brigade surgeon and one of his aidesdecamp  we were hesitating whether to disturb you general but it may be an affair of some importance under your orders a negro woman was just now challenged stealing out of the lines attempting to escape she was chased there was a struggle and scramble over the wall and she fell striking her head she was brought into the guardhouse unconscious  very good i will see her said brant with a feeling of relief  one moment general we thought you would perhaps prefer to see her alone said the surgeon for when i endeavored to bring her to and was sponging her face and head to discover her injuries her color came off she was a white womanstained and disguised as a mulatto  for an instant brants heart sank it was miss faulkner  did you recognize her he said glancing from the one to the other have you seen her here before  no sir replied the aidedecamp but she seemed to be quite a superior womana lady i should say  brant breathed more freely  where is she now he asked  in the guardhouse we thought it better not to bring her into hospital among the men until we had your orders  you have done well returned brant gravely and you will keep this to yourselves for the present but see that she is brought here quietly and with as little publicity as possible put her in my room above which i give up to her and any necessary attendant but you will look carefully after her doctorhe turned to the surgeonand when she recovers consciousness let me know  he moved away although attaching little importance to the mysterious message whether sent by miss faulkner or emanating from the stranger herself which he reasoned was based only upon a knowledge of the original plan of attack he nevertheless quickly dispatched a small scouting party in the direction from which the attack might come with orders to fall back and report at once with a certain half irony of recollection he had selected jim hooker to accompany the party as a volunteer this done he returned to the gallery the surgeon met him at the door  the indications of concussion are passing away he said but she seems to be suffering from the exhaustion following some great nervous excitement you may go inshe may rally from it at any moment  with the artificial step and mysterious hush of the ordinary visitor to a sick bed brant entered the room but some instinct greater than this common expression of humanity held him suddenly in awe the room seemed no longer hisit had slipped back into that austere conventual privacy which had first impressed him yet he hesitated another strange suggestionit seemed almost a vague recollectionovercame him like some lingering perfume far off and pathetic in its dying familiarity he turned his eyes almost timidly towards the bed the coverlet was drawn up near the throat of the figure to replace the striped cotton gown stained with blood and dust which had been hurriedly torn off and thrown on a chair the pale face cleansed of blood and disguising color the long hair still damp from the surgeons sponge lay rigidly back on the pillow suddenly this man of steady nerve uttered a faint cry and with a face as white as the upturned one before him fell on his knees beside the bed for the face that lay there was his wifes  yes hers but the beautiful hair that she had gloried inthe hair that in his youth he had thought had once fallen like a benediction on his shoulderwas streaked with gray along the blueveined hollows of the temples the orbits of those clear eyes beneath their delicately arched brows were ringed with days of suffering only the clearcut profile even to the delicate imperiousness of lips and nostril was still there in all its beauty the coverlet had slipped from her shoulder its familiar cold contour startled him he remembered how in their early married days he had felt the sanctity of that dianalike revelation and the still nymphlike austerity which clung to this strange childless woman he even fancied that he breathed again the subtle characteristic perfume of the laces embroideries and delicate enwrappings in her chamber at robles perhaps it was the intensity of his gazeperhaps it was the magnetism of his presencebut her lips parted with a half sigh half moan her head although her eyes were still closed turned on the pillow instinctively towards him he rose from his knees her eyes opened slowly as the first glare of wonderment cleared from them they met himin the old antagonism of spirit yet her first gesture was a pathetic feminine movement with both hands to arrange her straggling hair it brought her white fingers cleaned of their disguising stains as a sudden revelation to her of what had happened she instantly slipped them back under the coverlet again brant did not speak but with folded arms stood gazing upon her and it was her voice that first broke the silence  you have recognized me well i suppose you know all she said with a weak halfdefiance  he bowed his head he felt as yet he could not trust his voice and envied her her own  i may sit up maynt i she managed by sheer force of will to struggle to a sitting posture then as the coverlet slipped from the bare shoulder she said as she drew it with a shiver of disgust around her again  i forgot that you strip women you northern soldiers but i forgot too she added with a sarcastic smile that you are also my husband and i am in your room  the contemptuous significance of her speech dispelled the last lingering remnant of brants dream in a voice as dry as her own he said  i am afraid you will now have to remember only that i am a northern general and you a southern spy  so be it she said gravely then impulsively but i have not spied on you  yet the next moment she bit her lips as if the expression had unwittingly escaped her and with a reckless shrug of her shoulders she lay back on her pillow  it matters not said brant coldly you have used this house and those within it to forward your designs it is not your fault that you found nothing in the dispatchbox you opened  she stared at him quickly then shrugged her shoulders again  i might have known she was false to me she said bitterly and that you would wheedle her soul away as you have others well she betrayed me for what  a flush passed over brants face but with an effort he contained himself  it was the flower that betrayed you the flower whose red dust fell in the box when you opened it on the desk by the window in yonder roomthe flower that stood in the window as a signalthe flower i myself removed and so spoiled the miserable plot that your friends concocted  a look of mingled terror and awe came into her face  you changed the signal she repeated dazedly then in a lower voice that accounts for it all but the next moment she turned again fiercely upon him and you mean to tell me that she didnt help youthat she didnt sell meyour wifeto you forfor what was it a looka kiss  i mean to say that she did not know the signal was changed and that she herself restored it to its place it is no fault of hers nor yours that i am not here a prisoner  she passed her thin hand dazedly across her forehead  i see she muttered then again bursting out passionately she saidfool you never would have been touched do you think that lee would have gone for you with higher game in your division commander no those supports were a feint to draw him to your assistance while our main column broke his centre yes you may stare at me clarence brant you are a good lawyerthey say a dashing fighter too i never thought you a coward even in your irresolution but you are fighting with men drilled in the art of war and strategy when you were a boy outcast on the plains she stopped closed her eyes and then added wearilybut that was yesterdaytoday who knows all may be changed the supports may still attack you that was why i stopped to write you that note an hour ago when i believed i should be leaving here for ever yes i did it she went on with halfwearied halfdogged determination you may as well know all i had arranged to fly your pickets were to be drawn by friends of mine who were waiting for me beyond your lines well i lingered here when i saw you arrivelingered to write you that note andi was too late  but brant had been watching her varying expression her kindling eye her strange masculine grasp of military knowledge her soldierly phraseology all so new to her that he scarcely heeded the feminine ending of her speech it seemed to him no longer the diana of his youthful fancy but some pallas athene who now looked up at him from the pillow he had never before fully believed in her unselfish devotion to the cause until now when it seemed to have almost unsexed her in his wildest comprehension of her he had never dreamed her a joan of arc and yet hers was the face which might have confronted him exalted and inspired on the battlefield itself he recalled himself with an effort  i thank you for your wouldbe warning he said more gently if not so tenderly and god knows i wish your flight had been successful but even your warning is unnecessary for the supports had already come up they had followed the second signal and diverged to engage our division on the left leaving me alone and their ruse of drawing our commander to assist me would not have been successful as i had suspected it and sent a message to him that i wanted no help  it was the truth it was the sole purport of the note he had sent through miss faulkner he would not have disclosed his sacrifice but so great was the strange domination of this woman still over him that he felt compelled to assert his superiority she fixed her eyes upon him  and miss faulkner took your message she said slowly dont deny it no one else could have passed through our lines and you gave her a safe conduct through yours yes i might have known it and this was the creature they sent me for an ally and confidant  for an instant brant felt the sting of this enforced contrast between the two women but he only said  you forget that i did not know you were the spy nor do i believe that she suspected you were my wife  why should she she said almost fiercely i am known among these people only by the name of benhammy maiden name yesyou can take me out and shoot me under that name without disgracing yours nobody will know that the southern spy was the wife of the northern general you see i have thought even of that  and thinking of that said brant slowly you have put yourselfi will not say in my power for you are in the power of any man in this camp who may know you or even hear you speak well let us understand each other plainly i do not know how great a sacrifice your devotion to your cause demands of you i do know what it seems to demand of me hear me then i will do my best to protect you and get you safely away from here but failing that i tell you plainly that i shall blow out your brains and my own together  she knew that he would do it yet her eyes suddenly beamed with a new and awakening light she put back her hair again and half raised herself upon the pillow to gaze at his dark set face  and as i shall let no other life but ours be periled in this affair he went on quietly and will accompany you myself in some disguise beyond the lines we will together take the risksor the bullets of the sentries that may save us both all further trouble an hour or two more will settle that until then your weak condition will excuse you from any disturbance or intrusion here the mulatto woman you have sometimes personated may be still in this house i will appoint her to attend you i suppose you can trust her for you must personate her again and escape in her clothes while she takes your place in this room as my prisoner  clarence  her voice had changed suddenly it was no longer bitter and stridulous but low and thrilling as he had heard her call to him that night in the patio of robles he turned quickly she was leaning from the bedher thin white hands stretched appealingly towards him  let us go together clarence she said eagerly let us leave this horrible placethese wicked cruel peopleforever come with me come with me to my peopleto my own faithto my own housewhich shall be yours come with me to defend it with your good sword clarence against those vile invaders with whom you have nothing in common and who are the dirt

turned his blazing eyes upon her  if you were a manhe began passionately then stopped  no i am only a woman and must fight in a womans way she interrupted bitterly yes i intreat i implore i wheedle i flatter i fawn i lie i creep where you stand upright and pass through doors to which you would not bow you wear your blazon of honor on your shoulder i hide mine in a slaves gown and yet i have worked

pass i am weary i have done my share of this work you have done yours let us both fly let us leave the fight to those who shall come after us and let us go together to some distant land where the sounds of these guns or the blood of our brothers no longer cry out to us for vengeance there are those living herei have met them clarence she went on hurriedly who think it wrong to lift up fratricidal hands in the struggle yet who cannot live under the northern yoke they are her voice hesitated good men and womenthey are respectedthey are  recreants and slaves before whom you spy as you arestand a queen broke in brant passionately he stopped and turned towards the window after a pause he came back again towards the bedpaused again and then said in a lower voicefour years ago alice in the patio of our house at robles i might have listened to this proposal andi tremble to thinki might have accepted it i loved you i was as weak as selfish as unreflecting my life was as purposelessbut for youas the creatures you speak of but give me now at least the credit of a devotion to my cause equal to your owna credit which i have never denied you for the night that you left me i awoke to a sense of my own worthlessness and degradationperhaps i have even to thank you for that awakeningand i realized the bitter truth but that night i found my true vocationmy purpose my manhood  a bitter laugh came from the pillow on which she had languidly thrown herself  i believe i left you with mrs hookerspare me the details  the blood rushed to brants face and then receded as suddenly  you left me with captain pinckney who had tempted you and whom i killed he said furiously  they were both staring savagely at each other suddenly he said hush and sprang towards the door as the sound of hurried footsteps echoed along the passage but he was too late it was thrown open to the officer of the guard who appeared standing on the threshold  two confederate officers arrested hovering around our pickets they demand to see you  before brant could interpose two men in riding cloaks of confederate gray stepped into the room with a jaunty and selfconfident air  not demand general said the foremost a tall distinguishedlooking man lifting his hand with a graceful deprecating air in fact too sorry to bother you with an affair of no importance except to ourselves a bit of afterdinner bravado brought us in contact with your pickets and of course we had to take the consequences served us right and we were lucky not to have got a bullet through us gad im afraid my men would have been less discreet i am colonel lagrange of the 5th tennessee my young friend here is captain faulkner of the 1st kentucky some excuse for a youngster like himnone for me i  he stopped for his eyes suddenly fell upon the bed and its occupant both he and his companion started but to the natural unaffected dismay of a gentleman who had unwittingly intruded upon a ladys bedchamber brants quick eye saw a more disastrous concern superadded colonel lagrange was quick to recover himself as they both removed their caps  a thousand pardons he said hurriedly stepping backwards to the door but i hardly need say to a fellowofficer general that we had no idea of making so gross an intrusion we heard some cockandbull story of your being occupiedcrossquestioning an escaped or escaping niggeror we should never have forced ourselves upon you  brant glanced quickly at his wife her face had apparently become rigid on the entrance of the two men her eyes were coldly fixed upon the ceiling he bowed formally and with a wave of his hand towards the door said  i will hear your story below gentleman  he followed them from the room stopped to quietly turn the key in the lock and then motioned them to precede him down the staircase      chapter vii   not a word was exchanged till they had reached the lower landing and brants private room dismissing his subaltern and orderly with a sign brant turned towards his prisoners the jaunty ease but not the selfpossession had gone from lagranges face the eyes of captain faulkner were fixed on his older companion with a halfhumorous look of perplexity  i am afraid i can only repeat general that our foolhardy freak has put us in collision with your sentries said lagrange with a slight hauteur that replaced his former jauntiness and we were very properly made prisoners if you will accept my parole i have no doubt our commander will proceed to exchange a couple of gallant fellows of yours whom i have had the honor of meeting within our own lines and whom you must miss probably more than i fear our superiors miss us  whatever brought you here gentlemen said brant drily i am glad for your sakes that you are in uniform although it does not unfortunately relieve me of an unpleasant duty  i dont think i understand you returned lagrange coldly  if you had not been in uniform you would probably have been shot down as spies without the trouble of capture said brant quietly  do you mean to imply sirbegan lagrange sternly  i mean to say that the existence of a confederate spy between this camp and the division headquarters is sufficiently well known to us to justify the strongest action  and pray how can that affect us said lagrange haughtily  i need not inform so old a soldier as colonel lagrange that the aiding abetting and even receiving information from a spy or traitor within ones lines is an equally dangerous service  perhaps you would like to satisfy yourself general said colonel lagrange with an ironical laugh pray do not hesitate on account of our uniform search us if you like  not on entering my lines colonel replied brant with quiet significance  lagranges cheek flushed but he recovered himself quickly and with a formal bow said  you will then perhaps let us know your pleasure  my duty colonel is to keep you both close prisoners here until i have an opportunity to forward you to the division commander with a report of the circumstances of your arrest that i propose to do how soon i may have that opportunity or if i am ever to have it continued brant fixing his clear eyes significantly on lagrange depends upon the chances of war which you probably understand as well as i do  we should never think of making any calculation on the action of an officer of such infinite resources as general brant said lagrange ironically  you will no doubt have an opportunity of stating your own case to the division commander continued brant with an unmoved face and he continued turning for the first time to captain faulkner when you tell the commander what i believe to be the factfrom your name and resemblancethat you are a relation of the young lady who for the last three weeks has been an inmate of this house under a pass from washington you will i have no doubt favorably explain your own propinquity to my lines  my sister tilly said the young officer impulsively but she is no longer here she passed through the lines back to washington yesterday no he added with a light laugh im afraid that excuse wont count for today  a sudden frown upon the face of the elder officer added to the perfect ingenuousness of faulkners speech satisfied brant that he had not only elicited the truth but that miss faulkner had been successful but he was sincere in his suggestion that her relationship to the young officer would incline the division commander to look leniently upon his fault for he was conscious of a singular satisfaction in thus being able to serve her of the real object of the two men before him he had no doubt they were the friends of his wife who were waiting for her outside the lines chance alone had saved her from being arrested with them with the consequent exposure of her treachery before his own men who as yet had no proof of her guilt nor any suspicion of her actual identity meanwhile his own chance of conveying her with safety beyond his lines was not affected by the incident the prisoners dare not reveal what they knew of her and it was with a grim triumph that he thought of compassing her escape without their aid nothing of this however was visible in his face which the younger man watched with a kind of boyish curiosity while colonel lagrange regarded the ceiling with a politely repressed yawn i regret concluded brant as he summoned the officer of the guard that i shall have to deprive you of each others company during the time you are here but i shall see that you separately want for nothing in your confinement  if this is with a view to separate interrogatory general i can retire now said lagrange rising with ironical politeness  i believe i have all the information i require returned brant with undisturbed composure giving the necessary orders to his subaltern he acknowledged with equal calm the formal salutes of the two prisoners as they were led away and returned quickly to his bedroom above he paused instinctively for a moment before the closed door and listened there was no sound from within he unlocked the door and opened it  so quiet was the interior that for an instant without glancing at the bed he cast a quick look at the window which till then he had forgotten and which he remembered gave upon the veranda roof but it was still closed and as he approached the bed he saw his wife still lying there in the attitude in which he had left her but her eyes were ringed and slightly filmed as if with recent tears  it was perhaps this circumstance that softened his voice still harsh with command as he said  i suppose you knew those two men  yes  and that i have put it out of their power to help you  i do  there was something so strangely submissive in her voice that he again looked suspiciously at her but he was shocked to see that she was quite pale now and that the fire had gone out of her dark eyes  then i may tell you what is my plan to save you but first you must find this mulatto woman who has acted as your double  she is here  here  yes  how do you know it he asked in quick suspicion  she was not to leave this place until she knew i was safe within our lines i have some friends who are faithful to me after a pause she added she has been here already  he looked at her startled impossiblei  you locked the door yes but she has a second key and even if she had not there is another entrance from that closet you do not know this house you have been here two weeks i spent two years of my life as a girl in this room  an indescribable sensation came over him he remembered how he had felt when he first occupied it this was followed by a keen sense of shame on reflecting that he had been ever since but a helpless puppet in the power of his enemies and that she could have escaped if she would even now  perhaps he said grimly you have already arranged your plans  she looked at him with a singular reproachfulness even in her submission  i have only told her to be ready to change clothes with me and help me color my face and hands at the time appointed i have left the rest to you  then this is my plan i have changed only a detail you and she must both leave this house at the same time by different exits but one of them must be privateand unknown to my men do you know of such a one  yes she said in the rear of the negro quarters  good he replied that will be your way out she will leave here publicly through the parade armed with a pass from me she will be overhauled and challenged by the first sentry near the guardhouse below the wall she will be subjected to some delay and scrutiny which she will however be able to pass better than you would this will create the momentary diversion that we require in the mean time you will have left the house by the rear and you will then keep in the shadow of the hedge until you can drop down along the run where it empties into the swamp that he continued fixing his keen eyes upon her is the one weak point in the position of this place that is neither overlooked nor defended but perhaps he added again grimly you already know it  it is the marsh where the flowers grow near the path where you met miss faulkner i had crossed the marsh to give her a letter she said slowly  a bitter smile came over brants face but passed as quickly  enough he said quietly i will meet you beside the run and cross the marsh with you until you are within hailing distance of your lines i will be in plain clothes alice he went on slowly for it will not be the commander of this force who accompanies you but your husband and without disgracing his uniform he will drop to your level for the instant he passes his own lines in disguise he will become like you a spy and amenable to its penalties  her eyes seemed suddenly to leap up to his with that strange look of awakening and enthusiasm which he had noted before and in its complete prepossession of all her instincts she rose from the bed unheeding her bared arms and shoulders and loosened hair and stood upright before him for an instant husband and wife regarded each other as unreservedly as in their own chamber at robles  when shall i go  he glanced through the window already growing lighter with the coming dawn the relief would pass in a few moments the time seemed propitious  at once he said i will send rose to you  but his wife had already passed into the closet and was tapping upon some inner door he heard the sound of hinges turning and the rustling of garments she reappeared holding the curtains of the closet together with her hand and said  go when she comes to your office for the pass you will know that i have gone  he turned away  stop she said faintly  he turned back her expression had again changed her face was deadly pale a strange tremor seemed to have taken possession of her her hands dropped from the curtain her beautiful arms moved slightly forward it seemed to him that she would in the next moment have extended them towards him but even then she said hurriedly go go and slipped again behind the curtains  he quickly descended the stairs as the sound of trampling feet on the road and the hurried word of command announced the return of the scouting party the officer had little report to make beyond the fact that a morning mist creeping along the valley prevented any further observation and bade fair to interrupt their own communications with the camp everything was quiet in the west although the enemys lines along the ridge seemed to have receded  brant had listened impatiently for a new idea had seized him hooker was of the party and was the one man in whom he could partly confide and obtain a disguise he at once made his way to the commissary wagonsone of which he knew hooker used as a tent hastily telling him that he wished to visit the pickets without recognition he induced him to lend him his slouched hat and frock coat leaving with him his own distinguishing tunic hat and sword he resisted the belt and pistols which hooker would have forced upon him as he left the wagon he was amusedly conscious that his old companion was characteristically examining the garments he had left behind with mingled admiration and envy but he did not know as he slipped out of the camp that mr hooker was quietly trying them on before a broken mirror in the wagonhead  the gray light of that summer morning was already so strong that to avoid detection he quickly dropped into the shadow of the gully that sloped towards the run the hot mist which the scouts had seen was now lying like a tranquil sea between him and the pickets of the enemys rearguard which it seemed to submerge and was clinging in moist tenuous swatheslike drawnout cotton woolalong the ridge half obliterating its face from the valley in the rear it was already stealing in a thin white line up the slope like the advance of a ghostly column with a stealthiness that in spite of himself touched him with superstitious significance a warm perfume languid and treacherousas from the swamp magnoliaseemed to rise from the halfhidden marsh an ominous silence that appeared to be a part of this veiling of all things under the clear opaltinted sky above was so little like the hush of rest and peace that he halfyearned for the outburst of musketry and tumult of attack that might dispel it all that he had ever heard or dreamed of the insidious south with its languid subtleties of climate and of race seemed to encompass him here  but the next moment he saw the figure he was waiting for stealing towards him from the shadow of the gulley beneath the negro quarters  even in that uncertain light there was no mistaking the tall figure the gaudily striped clinging gown and turbaned head and then a strange revulsion of feeling quite characteristic of the emotional side of his singular temperament overcame him he was taking leave of his wifethe dream of his youthperhaps forever it should be no parting in anger as at robles it should be with a tenderness that would blot out their past in their separate memoriesgod knows it might even be that a parting at that moment was a joining of them in eternity in his momentary exaltation it even struck him that it was a duty no less sacred no less unselfish than the one to which he had devoted his life the light was growing stronger he could hear voices in the nearest picket line and the sound of a cough in the invading mist he made a hurried sign to the oncoming figure to follow him ran ahead and halted at last in the cover of a hackmatack bush still gazing forward over the marsh he stealthily held out his hand behind him as the rustling skirt came nearer at last his hand was touchedbut even at that touch he started and turned quickly  it was not his wife but roseher mulatto double her face was rigid with fright her beady eyes staring in their china sockets her white teeth chattering yet she would have spoken  hush he said clutching her hand in a fierce whisper not a word  she was holding something white in her fingers he snatched it quickly it was a note from his wifenot in the disguised hand of her first warning but in one that he remembered as if it were a voice from their past  forgive me for disobeying you to save you from capture disgrace or deathwhich would have come to you where you were going i have taken roses pass you need not fear that your honor will suffer by it for if i am stopped i shall confess that i took it from her think no more of me clarence but only of yourself you are in danger  he crushed the letter in his hand  tell me he said in a fierce whisper seizing her arm and speak low when did you leave her  sholy just now gasped the frightened woman  he flung her aside there might be still time to overtake and save her before she reached the picket lines he ran up the gully and out on to the slope towards the first guardpost but a familiar challenge reached his ear and his heart stopped beating  who goes there  there was a pause a rattle of arms voicesanother pauseand brant stood breathlessly listening then the voice rose again slowly and clearly pass the mulatto woman  thank god she was saved but the thought had scarcely crossed his mind before it seemed to him that a blinding crackle of sparks burst out along the whole slope below the wall a characteristic yell which he knew too well rang in his ears and an undulating line of dusty figures came leaping like gray wolves out of the mist upon his pickets he heard the shouts of his men falling back as they fired the harsh commands of a few officers hurrying to their posts and knew that he had been hopelessly surprised and surrounded  he ran forward among his disorganized men to his consternation no one seemed to heed him then the remembrance of his disguise flashed upon him but he had only time to throw away his hat and snatch a sword from a falling lieutenant before a scorching flash seemed to pass before his eyes and burn through his hair and he dropped like a log beside his subaltern    an aching under the bandage around his head where a spent bullet had grazed his scalp and the sound of impossible voices in his ears were all he knew as he struggled slowly back to consciousness again even then it still seemed a delusionfor he was lying on a cot in his own hospital yet with officers of the division staff around him and the division commander himself standing by his side and regarding him with an air of grave but not unkindly concern but the wounded man felt instinctively that it was not the effect of his physical condition and a sense of shame came suddenly over him which was not dissipated by his superiors words for motioning the others aside the majorgeneral leaned over his cot and said  until a few moments ago the report was that you had been captured in the first rush of the rearguard which we were rolling up for your attack and when you were picked up just now in plain clothes on the slope you were not recognized the one thing seemed to be as improbable as the other he added significantly  the miserable truth flashed across brants mind hooker must have been captured in his clothesperhaps in some extravagant sallyand had not been recognized in the confusion by his own officers nevertheless he raised his eyes to his superior  you got my note  the generals brow darkened  yes he said slowly but finding you thus unpreparedi had been thinking just now that you had been deceived by that womanor by othersand that it was a clumsy forgery he stopped and seeing the hopeless bewilderment in the face of the wounded man added more kindly but we will not talk of that in your present condition the doctor says a few hours will put you straight again get strong for i want you to lose no timefor your own saketo report yourself at washington  report myselfat washington repeated brant slowly  that was last nights order said the commander with military curtness then he burst out i dont understand it brant i believe you have been misunderstood misrepresented perhaps maligned and i shall make it my business to see the thing throughbut those are the department orders and for the presenti am sorry to say you are relieved of your command  he turned away and brant closed his eyes with them it seemed to him that he closed his career no one would ever understand his explanationeven had he been tempted to give one and he knew he never would everything was over now even this wretched bullet had not struck him fairly and culminated his fate as it might for an instant he recalled his wifes last offer to fly with him beyond the seasbeyond this cruel injusticebut even as he recalled it he knew that flight meant the worst of alla halfconfession but she had escaped thank god for that again and again in his hopeless perplexity this comfort returned to himhe had saved her he had done his duty and harping upon this in his strange fatalism it at last seemed to him that this was for what he had livedfor what he had sufferedfor what he had fitly ended his career perhaps it was left for him now to pass his remaining years in forgotten exileeven as his father hadhis fatherhis breath came quickly at the thoughtgod knows perhaps as wrongfully accused it may have been a providence that she had borne him no child to whom this dreadful heritage could be again transmitted  there was something of this strange and fateful resignation in his face a few hours later when he was able to be helped again into the saddle but he could see in the eyes of the few comrades who commiseratingly took leave of him a vague halfrepressed awe of some indefinite weakness in the man that mingled with their heartfelt parting with a gallant soldier yet even this touched him no longer he cast a glance at the house and the room where he had parted from her at the slope from which she had passedand rode away  and then as his figure disappeared down the road the restrained commentary of wonder surmise and criticism broke out  it must have been something mighty bad for the old man who swears by him looked rather troubled and it was deuced queer you know this changing clothes with somebody just before this surprise  nonsense its something away back of that didnt you hear the old man say that the orders for him to report himself came from washington last night nothe speaker lowered his voicestrangeways says that he had regularly sold himself out to one of them dd secesh woman spies its the old marc antony business over again  now i think of it said a younger subaltern he did seem mightily taken with one of those quadroons or mulattoes he issued orders against i suppose that was a blind for us i remember the first day he saw her he was regularly keen to know all about her  major curtis gave a short laugh  that mulatto martin was a white woman burntcorked she was trying to get through the lines last night and fell off a wall or got a knock on the head from a sentrys carbine when she was brought in doctor simmons set to washing the blood off her face the cork came off and the whole thing came out brant hushed it upand the woman tooin his own quarters its supposed now that she got away somehow in the rush  it goes further back than that gentlemen said the adjutant authoritatively they say his wife was a howling secessionist four years ago in california was mixed up in a conspiracy and he had to leave on account of it look how thick he and that miss faulkner became before he helped her off  thats your jealousy tommy she knew he was by all odds the biggest man here and a good deal more too and you had no show  in the laugh that followed it would seem that brants eulogy had been spoken and forgotten but as lieutenant martin was turning away a lingering corporal touched his cap  you were speaking of those prowling mulattoes sir you know the general passed one out this morning  so i have heard  i reckon she didnt get very far it was just at the time that we were driven in by their first fire and i think she got her share of it too do you mind walking this way sir  the lieutenant did not mind although he rather languidly followed when they had reached the top of the gully the corporal pointed to what seemed to be a bit of striped calico hanging on a thorn bush in the ravine  thats her said the corporal i know the dress i was on guard when she was passed the searchers who were picking up our men havent got to her yet but she aint moved or stirred these two hours would you like to go down and see her  the lieutenant hesitated he was young and slightly fastidious as to unnecessary unpleasantness he believed he would wait until the searchers brought her up when the corporal might call him  the mist came up gloriously from the swamp like a golden halo and as clarence brant already forgotten rode moodily through it towards washington hugging to his heart the solitary comfort of his great sacrifice his wife alice brant for whom he had made it was lying in the ravine dead and uncared for perhaps it was part of the inconsistency of her sex that she was pierced with the bullets of those she had loved and was wearing the garments of the race that she had wronged    part iii     chapter i   it was sunset of a hot day at washington even at that hour the broad avenues which diverged from the capitol like the rays of another sun were fierce and glittering the sterile distances between glowed more cruelly than ever and pedestrians keeping in the scant shade hesitated on the curbstones before plunging into the saharalike waste of crossings the city seemed deserted even that vast army of contractors speculators placehunters and lobbyists which hung on the heels of the other army and had turned this pacific camp of the nation into a battlefield of ignoble conflict and contentionmore disastrous than the one to the southhad slunk into their holes in hotel back bedrooms in shady barrooms or in the negro quarters of georgetown as if the majestic whiterobed goddess enthroned upon the dome of the capitol had at last descended among them and was smiting to right and left with the flat and flash of her insufferable sword  into this stifling atmosphere of greed and corruption clarence brant stepped from the shadow of the war department for the last three weeks he had haunted its anterooms and audiencechambers in the vain hope of righting himself before his superiors who were content without formulating charges against him to keep him in this disgrace of inaction and the anxiety of suspense unable to ascertain the details of the accusation and conscious of his own secret he was debarred the last resort of demanding a courtmartial which he knew could only exonerate him by the exposure of the guilt of his wife whom he still hoped had safely escaped his division commander in active operations in the field had no time to help him at washington elbowed aside by greedy contractors forestalled by selfish politicians and disdaining the ordinary method of influence he had no friend to turn to in his few years of campaigning he had lost his instinct of diplomacy without acquiring a soldiers bluntness  the nearly level rays of the sun forced him at last to turn aside into one of the openings of a large buildinga famous caravansary of that hotelhaunted capital and he presently found himself in the luxurious barroom fragrant with mint and cool with iceslabs piled symmetrically on its marble counters a few groups of men were seeking coolness at small tables with glasses before them and palmleaf fans in their hands but a larger and noisier assemblage was collected before the bar where a man collarless and in his shirtsleeves with his back to the counter was pretentiously addressing them brant who had moodily dropped into a chair in the corner after ordering a cooling drink as an excuse for his temporary refuge from the stifling street halfregretted his enforced participation in their conviviality but a sudden lowering of the speakers voice into a note of gloomy significance seemed familiar to him he glanced at him quickly from the shadow of his corner he was not mistakenit was jim hooker  for the first time in his life brant wished to evade him in the days of his own prosperity his heart had always gone out towards this old companion of his boyhood in his present humiliation his presence jarred upon him he would have slipped away but to do so he would have had to pass before the counter again and hooker with the selfconsciousness of a storyteller had an eye on his audience brant with a palmleaf fan before his face was obliged to listen  yes gentlemen said hooker examining his glass dramatically when a mans been cooped up in a rebel prison with a death line before him that hes obliged to cross every time he wants a square drink it seems sort of like a dream of his boyhood to be standin here comfble before his liquor alongside o white men once more and when he knows hes bin put to all that trouble jest to save the reputation of another man and the secrets of a few high and mighty ones its almost enough to make his liquor go agin him he stopped theatrically seemed to choke emotionally over his brandy squash but with a pause of dramatic determination finally dashed it down no gentlemen he continued gloomily i dont say what im back in washington fori dont say what ive been sayin to myself when ive bin picking the weevils outer my biscuits in libby prisonbut ef you dont see some pretty big men in the war department obliged to climb down in the next few days my name aint jim hooker of hooker meacham  co army beef contractors and the man who saved the fight at gray oaks  the smile of satisfaction that went around his audiencean audience quick to seize the weakness of any performancemight have startled a vanity less oblivious than hookers but it only aroused brants indignation and pity and made his position still more intolerable but hooker scornfully expectorating a thin stream of tobacco juice against the spittoon remained for an instant gloomily silent  tell us about the fight again said a smiling auditor  hooker looked around the room with a certain dark suspiciousness and then in an affected lower voice which his theatrical experience made perfectly audible went on  it aint much to speak of and if it wasnt for the principle of the thing i wouldnt be talking a man whos seen injin fightin dont go much on this here west point fightin by ruleofthreebut that aint here or there well id bin out ascoutinjust to help the boys along and i was sittin in my wagon about daybreak when along comes a brigadiergeneral and he looks into the wagon flap i oughter to tell you first gentlemen that every minit he was expecting an attackbut he didnt let on a hint of it to me how are you jim said he how are you general said i would you mind lendin me your coat and hat says he ive got a little game here with our pickets and i dont want to be recognized anything to oblige general said i and with that i strips off my coat and hat and he peels and puts them on nearly the same figure jim he says lookin at me suppose you try on my things and see with that he hands me his coatfull uniform by gdwith the little gold cords and laces and the epaulettes with a star and i puts it onquite innocentlike and then he says handin me his sword and belt same inches round the waist i reckon and i puts that on too you may as well keep em on till i come back says he for its mighty damp and malarious at this time around the swamp and with that he lights out well gentlemen i hadnt sat there five minutes before bang bang rattle rattle kershiz and i hears a yell i steps out of the wagon everythings quite dark but the rattle goes on then along trots an orderly leadin a horse mount general he says were attackedthe rearguards on us  he paused looked round his audience and then in a lower voice said darkly  i aint a fool an in that minute a mans brain works at high pressure and i saw it all i saw the little game of the brigadier to skunk away in my clothes and leave me to be captured in his but i aint a dog neither and i mounted that horse gentlemen and lit out to where the men were formin i didnt dare to speak lest they should know me but i waved my sword and by gd they followed me and the next minit we was in the thick of it i had my hat as full of holes as that ice strainer i had a dozen bullets through my coat the fringe of my epaulettes was shot away but i kept the boys at their workand we stopped em stopped em gentlemen until we heard the bugles of the rest of our division that all this time had been rolling that blasted rearguard over on us and it saved the fight but the next minute the johnny rebs made a last dash and cut me offand there i wasby gd a prisoner me that had saved the fight  a ripple of ironical applause went round as hooker gloomily drained his glass and then held up his hand in scornful deprecation  i said i was a prisoner gentlemen he went on bitterly but that aint all i asked to see johnston told him what i had done and demanded to be exchanged for a general officer he said you be dd i then sent word to the division commanderinchief and told him how i had saved gray oaks when his brigadier ran away and he said you be dd ive bin you be dd from the lowest noncom to the commanderinchief and when i was at last exchanged i was exchanged gentlemen for two mules and a broken wagon but im here gentlemenas i was thar  why dont you see the president about it asked a bystander in affected commiseration  mr hooker stared contemptuously at the suggestion and expectorated his scornful dissent  not much he said but im going to see the man that carries him and his cabinet in his breechespocketsenator boompointer  boompointers a big man continued his auditor doubtfully do you know him  know him mr hooker laughed a bitter sardonic laugh well gentlemen i aint the kind o man to go in for family influence but he added with gloomy elevation considering hes an intimate relation of mine by marriage i should say i did  brant heard no more the facing around of his old companion towards the bar gave him that opportunity of escaping he had been waiting for the defection of hooker and his peculiar inventions were too characteristic of him to excite surprise and although they no longer awakened his goodhumored tolerance they were powerless to affect him in his greater trouble only one thing he learnedthat hooker knew nothing of his wife being in camp as a spythe incident would have been too tempting to have escaped his dramatic embellishment and the allusion to senator boompointer monstrous as it seemed in hookers mouth gave him a grim temptation he had heard of boompointers wonderful power he believed that susy would and could help himclarencewhether she did or did not help hooker but the next moment he dismissed the idea with a flushing cheek how low had he already sunk even to think of it  it had been once or twice in his mind to seek the president and under a promise of secrecy reveal a part of his story he had heard many anecdotes of his goodness of heart and generous tolerance of all things but with this was joinedso said contemporaneous historya flippancy of speech and a brutality of directness from which clarences sensibility shrank would he see anything in his wife but a common spy on his army would he see anything in him but the weak victim like many others of a scheming woman stories current in camp and congress of the way that this grim humorist had with an apposite anecdote or a rugged illustration brushed away the most delicate sentiment or the subtlest poetry even as he had exposed the sham of puritanic morality or of epicurean ethics brant had even solicited an audience but had retired awkwardly and with his confidence unspoken before the dark humorous eyes that seemed almost too tolerant of his grievance he had been to levees and his heart had sunk equally before the vulgar crowd who seemed to regard this man as their own buffoon and the pompousness of position learning and dignity which he seemed to delight to shake and disturb  one afternoon a few days later in sheer listlessness of purpose he found himself again at the white house the president was giving audience to a deputation of fanatics who with a pathetic simplicity almost equal to his own pathetic tolerance were urging upon this ruler of millions the policy of an insignificant score and brant listened to his patient practical response of facts and logic clothed in simple but sinewy english up to the inevitable climax of humorous illustration which the young brigadier could now see was necessary to relieve the grimness of his refusal for the first time brant felt the courage to address him and resolved to wait until the deputation retired as they left the gallery he lingered in the anteroom for the president to appear but as he did not come afraid of losing his chances he returned to the gallery alone in his privacy and shadow the man he had just left was standing by a column in motionless abstraction looking over the distant garden but the kindly humorous face was almost tragic with an intensity of weariness every line of those strong rustic features was relaxed under a burden which even the long lank angular figureovergrown and unfinished as his own westseemed to be distorted in its efforts to adjust itself to while the dark deepset eyes were abstracted with the vague prescience of the prophet and the martyr shocked at that sudden change brant felt his cheek burn with shame and he was about to break upon that wearied mans unbending he was about to add his petty burden to the shoulders of this western atlas he drew back silently and descended the stairs  but before he had left the house while mingling with the crowd in one of the larger rooms he saw the president reappear beside an important prosperouslooking figure on whom the kindly giant was now smiling with humorous toleration he noticed the divided attention of the crowd the name of senator boompointer was upon every lip he was nearly face to face with that famous dispenser of place and prefermentthis second husband of susy an indescribable feelinghalf cynical half fatefulcame over him he would not have been surprised to see jim hooker join the throng which now seemed to him to even dwarf the lonely central figure that had so lately touched him he wanted to escape it all  but his fate brought him to the entrance at the same moment that boompointer was leaving it and that distinguished man brushed hastily by him as a gorgeous carriage drawn by two spirited horses and driven by a resplendent negro coachman dashed up it was the boompointer carriage  a fashionablydressed pretty woman who in style bearing opulent contentment and ingenuous selfconsciousness was in perfect keeping with the slight ostentation of the equipage was its only occupant as boompointer stepped into the vehicle her blue eyes fell for an instant on brant a happy childlike pink flush came into her cheeks and a violet ray of recognition and mischief darted from her eyes to his for it was susy      chapter ii   when brant returned to his hotel there was an augmented respect in the voice of the clerk as he handed him a note with the remark that it had been left by senator boompointers coachman he had no difficulty in recognizing susys peculiarly brobdingnagian schoolgirl hand  klauns i call it real mean i believe you just hoped i wouldnt know you if youre a bit like your old self youll come right off herethis very night ive got a big party onbut we can talk somewhere between the acts havent i growed tell me and my what a gloomy swell the young brigadier is the carriage will come for youso you have no excuse  the effect of this childish note upon brant was strangely out of proportion to its triviality but then it was susys very trivialityso expressive of her characteristic irresponsibilitywhich had always affected him at such moments again as at robles he felt it react against his own ethics was she not right in her delightful materialism was she not happier than if she had been consistently true to mrs peyton to the convent to the episode of her theatrical career to jim hookereven to himself and did he conscientiously believe that hooker or himself had suffered from her inconsistency no from all that he had heard she was a suitable helpmate to the senator in her social attractiveness her charming ostentations her engaging vanity that disarmed suspicion and her lack of responsibility even in her partisanship nobody ever dared to hold the senator responsible for her promises even while enjoying the fellowship of both and it is said that the worthy man singularly profited by it looking upon the invitation as a possible distraction to his gloomy thoughts brant resolved to go  the moon was high as the carriage whirled him out of the still stifling avenues towards the soldiers homea sylvan suburb frequented by cabinet ministers and the presidentwhere the good senator had decreed like kubla khan a stately pleasure dome to entertain his friends and partisans as they approached the house the trembling light like fireflies through the leaves the warm silence broken only by a military band playing a drowsy waltz on the veranda and the heavy odors of jessamine in the air thrilled brant with a sense of shame as he thought of his old comrades in the field but this was presently dissipated by the uniforms that met him in the hall with the presence of some of his distinguished superiors at the head of the stairs with a circling background of the shining crosses and ribbons of the diplomatic corps stood susyher bare arms and neck glittering with diamonds her face radiant with childlike vivacity a significant pressure of her little glove as he made his bow seemed to be his only welcome but a moment later she caught his arm youve yet to know him she said in a half whisper he thinks a good deal of himselfjust like jim but he makes others believe it and thats where poor jim slipped up she paused before the man thus characteristically disposed of and presented brant it was the man he had seen beforematerial capable dogmatic a glance from his shrewd eyesaccustomed to the weighing of mens weaknesses and ambitionsand a few hurried phrases apparently satisfied him that brant was not just then important or available to him and the two men a moment later drifted easily apart brant sauntered listlessly through the crowded rooms half remorsefully conscious that he had taken some irrevocable step and none the less assured by the presence of two or three reporters and correspondents who were dogging his steps or the glance of two or three pretty women whose curiosity had evidently been aroused by the singular abstraction of this handsome distinguished but sardoniclooking officer but the next moment he was genuinely moved  a tall young woman had just glided into the centre of the room with an indolent yet supple gracefulness that seemed familiar to him a change in her position suddenly revealed her face it was miss faulkner previously he had known her only in the riding habit of confederate gray which she had at first affected or in the light muslin morning dress she had worn at gray oaks it seemed to him tonight that the studied elegance of her full dress became her still more that the pretty willfulness of her chin and shoulders was chastened and modified by the pearls round her fair throat suddenly their eyes met her face paled visibly he fancied that she almost leaned against her companion for support then she met his glance again with a face into which the color had as suddenly rushed but with eyes that seemed to be appealing to him even to the point of pain and fright brant was not conceited he could see that the girls agitation was not the effect of any mere personal influence in his recognition but of something else he turned hastily away when he looked around again she was gone  nevertheless he felt filled with a vague irritation did she think him such a fool as to imperil her safety by openly recognizing her without her consent did she think that he would dare to presume upon the service she had done him or more outrageous thought had she heard of his disgrace known its cause and feared that he would drag her into a disclosure to save himself no no she could not think that she had perhaps regretted what she had done in a freak of girlish chivalry she had returned to her old feelings and partisanship she was only startled at meeting the single witness of her folly well she need not fear he would as studiously avoid her hereafter and she should know it and yetyes there was a yet for he could not forgetindeed in the past three weeks it had been more often before him than he cared to thinkthat she was the one human being who had been capable of a great act of selfsacrifice for himher enemy her accuser the man who had scarcely treated her civilly he was ashamed to remember now that this thought had occurred to him at the bedside of his wifeat the hour of her escapeeven on the fatal slope on which he had been struck down and now this fond illusion must go with the restthe girl who had served him so loyally was ashamed of it a bitter smile crossed his face  well i dont wonder here are all the women asking me who is that goodlooking mephistopheles with the burning eyes who is prowling around my rooms as if searching for a victim why youre smiling for all the world like poor jim when he used to do the red avenger  susys voiceand illustrationrecalled him to himself  furious i may be he said with a gentler smile although his eyes still glittered furious that i have to wait until the one woman i came to seethe one woman i have not seen for so long while these puppets have been nightly dancing before hercan give me a few moments from them to talk of the old days  in his reaction he was quite sincere although he felt a slight sense of remorse as he saw the quick faint color rise as in those old days even through the tonights powder of her cheek  thats like the old klauns she said with a slight pressure of his arm but we will not have a chance to speak until later when they are nearly all gone youll take me to get a little refreshment and well have a chat in the conservatory but you must drop that awfully wicked look and make yourself generally agreeable to those women until then  it was perhaps part of this reaction which enabled him to obey his hostess commands with a certain recklessness that however seemed to be in keeping with the previous satanic reputation he had all unconsciously achieved the women listened to the cynical flippancy of this goodlooking soldier with an undisguised admiration which in turn excited curiosity and envy from his own sex he saw the whispered questioning the lifted eyebrows scornful shrugging of shouldersand knew that the story of his disgrace was in the air but i fear this only excited him to further recklessness and triumph once he thought he recognized miss faulkners figure at a distance and even fancied that she had been watching him but he only redoubled his attentions to the fair woman beside him and looked no more  yet he was glad when the guests began to drop off the great rooms thinned and susy appearing on the arm of her husband coquettishly reminded him of his promise  for i want to talk to you of old times general brant she went on turning explanatorily to boompointer married my adopted mother in californiaat robles a dear old place where i spent my earliest years so you see we are sort of relations by marriage she added with delightful naivete  hookers own vainglorious allusion to his relations to the man before him flashed across brants mind but it left now only a smile on his lips he felt he had already become a part of the irresponsible comedy played around him why should he resist or examine its ethics too closely he offered his arm to susy as they descended the stairs but instead of pausing in the supperroom she simply passed through it with a significant pressure on his arm and drawing aside a muslin curtain stepped into the moonlit conservatory behind the curtain there was a small rustic settee without releasing his arm she sat down so that when he dropped beside her their hands met and mutually clasped  now klauns she said with a slight comfortable shiver as she nestled beside him its a little like your chair down at old robles isnt ittell me and to think its five years ago but klauns whats the matter you are changed she said looking at his dark face in the moonlight or you have something to tell me  i have  and its something dreadful i know she said wrinkling her brows with a pretty terror couldnt you pretend you had told it to me and let us go on just the same couldnt you klauns tell me  i am afraid i couldnt he said with a sad smile  is it about yourself klauns you know she went on with cheerful rapidity i know everything about youi always did you knowand i dont care and never did care and it dont and never did make the slightest difference to me so dont tell it and waste time klauns  its not about me but about my wife he said slowly  her expression changed slightly  oh her she said after a pause then halfresignedly go on klauns  he began he had a dozen times rehearsed to himself his miserable story always feeling it keenly and even fearing that he might be carried away by emotion or morbid sentiment in telling it to another but to his astonishment he found himself telling it practically calmly almost cynically to his old playmate repressing the half devotion and even tenderness that had governed him from the time that his wife disguised as the mulatto woman had secretly watched him at his office to the hour that he had passed through the lines he withheld only the incident of miss faulkners complicity and sacrifice  and she got away after having kicked you out of your place klauns said susy when he had ended  clarence stiffened beside her but he felt he had gone too far to quarrel with his confidante  she went away i honestly believe we shall never meet again or i should not be telling you this  klauns she said lightly taking his hand again dont you believe it she wont let you go youre one of those men that a woman when shes once hooked on to wont let go of even when she believes she no longer loves him or meets bigger and better men i reckon its because youre so different from other men maybe there are so many different things about you to hook on to and you dont slip off as easily as the others now if you were like old peyton her first husband or like poor jim or even my boompointer youd be all right no my boy all we can do is to try to keep her from getting at you here i reckon she wont trust herself in washington again in a hurry  but i cannot stay here my career is in the field  your career is alongside o me honeyand boompointer but nearer me well fix all that i heard something about your being in disgrace but the story was that you were sweet on some secesh girl down there and neglected your business klauns but lordy to think it was only your own wife never mind well straighten that out weve had worse jobs than that on why there was that commissary who was buying up dead horses at one end of the field and selling them to the government for mess beef at the other and there was that general who wouldnt make an attack when it rained and the other generalyou know who i mean klaunswho wouldnt invade the state where his sister lived but we straightened them out somehow and they were a heap worse than you well get you a position in the war department here one of the bureau offices where you keep your rank and your uniformyou dont look bad in it klaunson better pay and youll come and see me and well talk over old times  brant felt his heart turn sick within him but he was at her mercy now he said with an effort  but ive told you that my careernay my lifenow is in the field  dont you be a fool klauns and leave it there you have done your work of fightingmighty good fighting tooand everybody knows it youve earned a change let others take your place  he shuddered as he remembered that his wife had made the same appeal was he a fool then and these two womenso totally unlike in everythingright in this  come klauns said susy relapsing again against his shoulder now talk to me you dont say what you think of me of my home of my furniture of my positioneven of him tell me  i find you well prosperous and happy he said with a faint smile  is that all and how do i look  she turned her still youthful mischievous face towards him in the moonlight the witchery of her blue eyes was still there as of old the same frank irresponsibility beamed from them her parted lips seemed to give him back the breath of his youth he started but she did not  susy dear  it was her husbands voice  i quite forgot the senator went on as he drew the curtain aside that you are engaged with a friend but miss faulkner is waiting to say goodnight and i volunteered to find you  tell her to wait a moment said susy with an impatience that was as undisguised as it was without embarrassment or confusion  but miss faulkner unconsciously following mr boompointer was already upon them for a moment the whole four were silent although perfectly composed senator boompointer unconscious of any infelicity in his interruption was calmly waiting clarence opposed suddenly to the young girl whom he believed was avoiding his recognition rose coldly imperturbable miss faulkner looking taller and more erect in the long folds of her satin cloak neither paled nor blushed as she regarded susy and brant with a smile of wellbred apology  i expect to leave washington tomorrow and may not be able to call again she said or i would not have so particularly pressed a leavetaking upon you  i was talking with my old friend general brant said susy more by way of introduction than apology  brant bowed for an instant the clear eyes of miss faulkner slipped icily across his as she made him an oldfashioned southern courtesy and taking susys arm she left the room brant did not linger but took leave of his host almost in the same breath at the front door a wellappointed carriage of one of the legations had just rolled into waiting he looked back he saw miss faulkner erect and looking like a bride in her gauzy draperies descending the stairs before the waiting servants he felt his heart beat strangely he hesitated recalled himself with an effort hurriedly stepped from the porch into the path as he heard the carriage door close behind him in the distance and then felt the dust from her horses hoofs rise around him as she drove past him and away      chapter iii   although brant was convinced as soon as he left the house that he could not accept anything from the boompointer influence and that his interview with susy was fruitless he knew that he must temporize while he did not believe that his old playmate would willingly betray him he was uneasy when he thought of the vanity and impulsiveness which might compromise himor of a possible jealousy that might seek revenge yet he had no reason to believe that susys nature was jealous or that she was likely to have any cause but the fact remained that miss faulkners innocent intrusion upon their teteatete affected him more strongly than anything else in his interview with susy once out of the atmosphere of that house it struck him too that miss faulkner was almost as much of an alien in it as himself he wondered what she had been doing there could it be possible that she was obtaining information for the south but he rejected the idea as quickly as it had occurred to him perhaps there could be no stronger proof of the unconscious influence the young girl already had over him  he remembered the liveries of the diplomatic carriage that had borne her away and ascertained without difficulty that her sister had married one of the foreign ministers and that she was a guest in his house but he was the more astonished to hear that she and her sister were considered to be southern unionistsand were greatly petted in governmental circles for their sacrificing fidelity to the flag his informant an official in the state department added that miss matilda might have been a good deal of a madcap at the outbreak of the warfor the sisters had a brother in the confederate servicebut that she had changed greatly and indeed within a month for he added she was at the white house for the first time last week and they say the president talked more to her than to any other woman  the indescribable sensation with which this simple information filled brant startled him more than the news itself hope joy fear distrust and despair alternately distracted him he recalled miss faulkners almost agonizing glance of appeal to him in the drawingroom at susys and it seemed to be equally consistent with the truth of what he had just heardor some monstrous treachery and deceit of which she might be capable even now she might be a secret emissary of some spy within the presidents family she might have been in correspondence with some traitor in the boompointer clique and her imploring glance only the result of a fear of exposure or again she might have truly recanted after her escapade at gray oaks and feared only his recollection of her as gobetween of spies and yet both of these presumptions were inconsistent with her conduct in the conservatory it seemed impossible that this impulsive woman capable of doing what he had himself known her to do and equally sensitive to the shame or joy of such impulses should be the same conventional woman of society who had so coldly recognized and parted from him  but this interval of doubt was transitory the next day he received a dispatch from the war department ordering him to report himself for duty at once with a beating heart he hurried to the secretary but that official had merely left a memorandum with his assistant directing general brant to accompany some fresh levies to a camp of organization near the front brant felt a chill of disappointment duties of this kind had been left to dubious regular army veterans hurriedly displaced general officers and favored detrimentals but if it was not restoration it was no longer inaction and it was at least a release from washington  it was also evidently the result of some influencebut hardly that of the boompointers for he knew that susy wished to keep him at the capital was there another power at work to send him away from washington his previous doubts returned nor were they dissipated when the chief of the bureau placed a letter before him with the remark that it had been entrusted to him by a lady with the request that it should be delivered only into his own hands  she did not know your hotel address but ascertained you were to call here she said it was of some importance there is no mystery about it general continued the official with a mischievous glance at brants handsome perplexed face although its from a very pretty womanwhom we all know  mrs boompointer suggested brant with affected lightness  it was a maladroit speech the officials face darkened  we have not yet become a postal department for the boompointers general he said dryly however great their influence elsewhere it was from rather a different style of womanmiss faulkner you will receive your papers later at your hotel and leave tonight  brants unlucky slip was still potent enough to divert the official attention or he would have noticed the change in his visitors face and the abruptness of his departure  once in the street brant tore off the envelope but beneath it was another on which was written in a delicate refined hand please do not open this until you reach your destination  then she knew he was going and perhaps this was her influence all his suspicions again returned she knew he was going near the lines and his very appointment through her power might be a plot to serve her and the enemy was this letter which she was entrusting to him the cover of some missive to her southern friends which she expected him to carryperhaps as a return for her own act of selfsacrifice was this the appeal she had been making to his chivalry his gratitude his honor the perspiration stood in beads on his forehead what defect lay hidden in his nature that seemed to make him an easy victim of these intriguing women he had not even the excuse of gallantry less susceptible to the potencies of the sex than most men he was still compelled to bear that reputation he remembered his coldness to miss faulkner in the first days of their meeting and her effect upon his subalterns why had she selected him from among themwhen she could have modeled the others like wax to her purposes why and yet with the question came a possible answer that he hardly dared to think ofthat in its very vagueness seemed to fill him with a stimulating thrill and hopefulness he quickened his pace he would take the letter and yet be master of himself when the time came to open it  that time came three days later in his tent at three pines crossing as he broke open the envelope he was relieved to find that it contained no other inclosure and seemed intended only for himself it began abruptly  when you read this you will understand why i did not speak to you when we met last night why i even dreaded that you might speak to me knowing as i did what i ought to tell you at that place and momentsomething you could only know from me i did not know you were in washington although i knew you were relieved i had no way of seeing you or sending to you before and i only came to mrs boompointers party in the hope of hearing news of you  you know that my brother was captured by your pickets in company with another officer he thinks you suspected the truththat he and his friend were hovering near your lines to effect the escape of the spy but he says that although they failed to help her she did escape or was passed through the lines by your connivance he says that you seemed to know her that from what rosethe mulatto womantold him you and she were evidently old friends i would not speak of this nor intrude upon your private affairs only that i think you ought to know that i had no knowledge of it when i was in your house but believed her to be a stranger to you you gave me no intimation that you knew her and i believed that you were frank with me but i should not speak of this at allfor i believe that it would have made no difference to me in repairing the wrong that i thought i had done youonly that as i am forced by circumstances to tell you the terrible ending of this story you ought to know it all  my brother wrote to me that the evening after you left the burying party picked up the body of what they believed to be a mulatto woman lying on the slope it was not rose but the body of the very womanthe real and only spywhom you had passed through the lines she was accidentally killed by the confederates in the first attack upon you at daybreak but only my brother and his friend recognized her through her blackened face and disguise and on the plea that she was a servant of one of their friends they got permission from the division commander to take her away and she was buried by her friends and among her people in the little cemetery of three pines crossing not far from where you have gone my brother thought that i ought to tell you this it seems that he and his friend had a strange sympathy for you in what they appear to know or guess of your relations with that woman and i think he was touched by what he thought was your kindness and chivalry to him on account of his sister but i do not think he ever knew or will know how great is the task that he has imposed upon me  you know now do you not why i did not speak to you when we first met it seemed so impossible to do it in an atmosphere and a festivity that was so incongruous with the dreadful message i was charged with and when i had to meet you laterperhaps i may have wronged youbut it seemed to me that you were so preoccupied and interested with other things that i might perhaps only be wearying you with something you cared little for or perhaps already knew and had quickly forgotten  i had been wanting to say something else to you when i had got rid of my dreadful message i do not know if you still care to hear it but you were once generous enough to think that i had done you a service in bringing a letter to your commander although i know better than anybody else the genuine devotion to your duty that made you accept my poor service from all that i can hear you have never had the credit of it will you not try me again i am more in favor here and i might yet be more successful in showing your superiors how true you have been to your trust even if you have little faith in your friend matilda faulkner  for a long time he remained motionless with the letter in his hand then he arose ordered his horse and galloped away  there was little difficulty in finding the cemetery of three pines crossinga hillside slope hearsed with pine and cypress and starred with white crosses that in the distance looked like flowers still less was there in finding the newer marble shaft among the older lichenspotted slabs which bore the simple words alice benham martyr a few confederate soldiers under still plainer and newer wooden headstones carved only with initials lay at her feet brant sank on his knees beside the grave but he was shocked to see that the base of the marble was stained with the red pollen of the fateful lily whose blossoms had been heaped upon her mound but whose fallen petals lay dark and sodden in decay  how long he remained there he did not know and then a solitary bugle from the camp seemed to summon him as it had once before summoned him and he went awayas he had gone beforeto a separation that he now knew was for all time  then followed a month of superintendence and drill and the infusing into the little camp under his instruction the spirit which seemed to be passing out of his own life forever shut in by alien hills on the borderland of the great struggle from time to time reports reached him of the bitter fighting and almost disastrous successes of his old division commander orders came from washington to hurry the preparation of his raw levies to the field and a faint hope sprang up in his mind but following it came another dispatch ordering his return to the capital  he reached it with neither hope nor fearso benumbed had become his spirit under this last trial and what seemed to be now the mockery of this last sacrifice to his wife though it was no longer a question of her life and safety he knew that he could still preserve her memory from stain by keeping her secret even though its divulgings might clear his own for that reason he had even hesitated to inform susy of her death in the fear that in her thoughtless irresponsibility and impulsiveness she might be tempted to use it in his favor he had made his late appointment a plea for her withholding any present efforts to assist him he even avoided the boompointers house in what he believed was partly a duty to the memory of his wife but he saw no inconsistency in occasionally extending his lonely walks to the vicinity of a foreign legation or in being lifted with a certain expectation at the sight of its liveries on the avenue there was a craving for sympathy in his heart which miss faulkners letter had awakened  meantime he had reported himself for duty at the war departmentwith little hope however in that formality but he was surprised the next day when the chief of the bureau informed him that his claim was before the president  i was not aware that i had presented any claim he said a little haughtily  the bureau chief looked up with some surprise this quiet patient reserved man had puzzled him once or twice before  perhaps i should say case general he said drily but the personal interest of the highest executive in the land strikes me as being desirable in anything  i only mean that i have obeyed the orders of the department in reporting myself here as i have done said brant with less feeling but none the less firmness and i should imagine it was not the duty of a soldier to question them which i fancy a claim or a case would imply  he had no idea of taking this attitude before but the disappointments of the past month added to this first official notice of his disgrace had brought forward that dogged reckless yet halfscornful obstinacy that was part of his nature  the official smiled  i suppose then you are waiting to hear from the president he said drily  i am awaiting orders from the department returned brant quietly but whether they originate in the president as commanderinchief or notit is not for me to inquire  even when he reached his hotel this halfsavage indifference which had taken the place of his former incertitude had not changed it seemed to him that he had reached the crisis of his life where he was no longer a free agent and could wait superior alike to effort or expectation and it was with a merely dispassionate curiosity that he found a note the next morning from the presidents private secretary informing him that the president would see him early that day  a few hours later he was ushered through the public rooms of the white house to a more secluded part of the household the messenger stopped before a modest door and knocked it was opened by a tall figurethe president himself he reached out a long arm to brant who stood hesitatingly on the threshold grasped his hand and led him into the room it had a single large elaborately draped window and a handsome medallioned carpet which contrasted with the otherwise almost appalling simplicity of the furniture a single plain angular desk with a blotting pad and a few sheets of large foolscap upon it a wastepaper basket and four plain armchairs completed the interior with a contrast as simple and homely as its longlimbed blackcoated occupant releasing the hand of the general to shut a door which opened into another apartment the president shoved an armchair towards him and sank somewhat wearily into another before the desk but only for a moment the long shambling limbs did not seem to adjust themselves easily to the chair the high narrow shoulders drooped to find a more comfortable lounging attitude shifted from side to side and the long legs moved dispersedly yet the face that was turned towards brant was humorous and tranquil  i was told i should have to send for you if i wished to see you he said smilingly  already mollified and perhaps again falling under the previous influence of this singular man brant began somewhat hesitatingly to explain  but the president checked him gently  you dont understand it was something new to my experience here to find an ablebodied american citizen with an honest genuine grievance who had to have it drawn from him like a decayed tooth but you have been here before i seem to remember your face  brants reserve had gone he admitted that he had twice sought an audiencebut  you dodged the dentist that was wrong as brant made a slight movement of deprecation the president continued i understand not from fear of giving pain to yourself but to others i dont know that that is right either a certain amount of pain must be suffered in this worldeven by ones enemies well i have looked into your case general brant he took up a piece of paper from his desk scrawled with two or three notes in pencil i think this is the way it stands you were commanding a position at gray oaks when information was received by the department that either through neglect or complicity spies were passing through your lines there was no attempt to prove your neglect your orders the facts of your personal care and precaution were all before the department but it was also shown that your wife from whom you were only temporarily separated was a notorious secessionist that before the war you yourself were suspected and that therefore you were quite capable of evading your own orders which you may have only given as a blind on this information you were relieved by the department of your command later on it was discovered that the spy was none other than your own wife disguised as a mulatto that after her arrest by your own soldiers you connived at her escapeand this was considered conclusive proof ofwell let us sayyour treachery  but i did not know it was my wife until she was arrested said brant impulsively  the president knitted his eyebrows humorously  dont let us travel out of the record general youre as bad as the department the question was one of your personal treachery but you need not accept the fact that you were justly removed because your wife was a spy now general i am an old lawyer and i dont mind telling you that in illinois we wouldnt hang a yellow dog on that evidence before the department but when i was asked to look into the matter by your friends i discovered something of more importance to you i had been trying to find a scrap of evidence that would justify the presumption that you had sent information to the enemy i found that it was based upon the fact of the enemy being in possession of knowledge at the first battle at gray oaks which could only have been obtained from our side and which led to a federal disaster that you however retrieved by your gallantry i then asked the secretary if he was prepared to show that you had sent the information with that view or that you had been overtaken by a tardy sense of repentance he preferred to consider my suggestion as humorous but the inquiry led to my further discovery that the only treasonable correspondence actually in evidence was found upon the body of a trusted federal officer and had been forwarded to the division commander but there was no record of it in the case  why i forwarded it myself said brant eagerly  so the division commander writes said the president smiling and he forwarded it to the department but it was suppressed in some way have you any enemies general brant  not that i know of  then you probably have you are young and successful think of the hundred other officers who naturally believe themselves better than you are and havent a traitorous wife still the department may have made an example of you for the benefit of the only man who couldnt profit by it  might it not have been sir that this suppression was for the good report of the serviceas the chief offender was dead  i am glad to hear you say so general for it is the argument i have used successfully in behalf of your wife  then you know it all sir said brant after a gloomy pause  all i think come general you seemed just now to be uncertain about your enemies let me assure you you need not be so in regard to your friends  i dare to hope i have found one sir said brant with almost boyish timidity  oh not me said the president with a laugh of deprecation some one much more potent  may i know his name mr president  no for it is a woman you were nearly ruined by one general i suppose its quite right that you should be saved by one and of course irregularly  a woman echoed brant  yes one who was willing to confess herself a worse spy than your wifea double traitorto save you upon my word general i dont know if the department was far wrong a man with such an alternately unsettling and convincing effect upon a womans highest political convictions should be under some restraint luckily the department knows nothing of it  nor would any one else have known from me said brant eagerly i trust that she did not thinkthat you sir did not for an instant believe that i  oh dear no nobody would have believed you it was her free confidence to me that was what made the affair so difficult to handle for even her bringing your dispatch to the division commander looked bad for you and you know he even doubted its authenticity  does shedoes miss faulkner know the spy was my wife hesitated brant  the president twisted himself in his chair so as to regard brant more gravely with his deepset eyes and then thoughtfully rubbed his leg  dont let us travel out of the record general he said after a pause but as the color surged into brants cheek he raised his eyes to the ceiling and said in halfhumorous recollection  no i think that fact was first gathered from your other friendmr hooker  hooker said brant indignantly did he come here  pray dont destroy my faith in mr hooker general said the president in halfweary halfhumorous deprecation dont tell me that any of his inventions are true leave me at least that magnificent liarthe one perfectly intelligible witness you have for from the time that he first appeared here with a grievance and a claim for a commission he has been an unspeakable joy to me and a convincing testimony to you other witnesses have been partisans and prejudiced mr hooker was frankly true to himself how else should i have known of the care you took to disguise yourself save the honor of your uniform and run the risk of being shot as an unknown spy at your wifes side except from his magnificent version of his part in it how else should i have known the story of your discovery of the californian conspiracy except from his supreme portrayal of it with himself as the hero no you must not forget to thank mr hooker when you meet him miss faulkner is at present more accessible she is calling on some members of my family in the next room shall i leave you with her  brant rose with a pale face and a quickly throbbing heart as the president glancing at the clock untwisted himself from the chair and shook himself out full length and rose gradually to his feet  your wish for active service is granted general brant he said slowly and you will at once rejoin your old division commander who is now at the head of the tenth army corps but he said after a deliberate pause there are certain rules and regulations of your service that even i cannot with decent respect to your department override you will therefore understand that you cannot rejoin the army in your former position  the slight flush that came to brants cheek quickly passed and there was only the unmistakable sparkle of renewed youth in his frank eyes as he said  let me go to the front again mr president and i care not how  the president smiled and laying his heavy hand on brants shoulder pushed him gently towards the door of the inner room  i was only about to say he added as he opened the door that it would be necessary for you to rejoin your promoted commander as a majorgeneral and he continued lifting his voice as he gently pushed his guest into the room he hasnt even thanked me for it miss faulkner  the door closed behind him and he stood for a moment dazed and still hearing the distant voice of the president in the room he had just quitted now welcoming a new visitor but the room before him opening into a conservatory was empty save for a single figure that turned half timidly half mischievously towards him the same quick sympathetic glance was in both their faces the same timid happy look in both their eyes he moved quickly to her side  then you knew thatthatwoman was my wife he said hurriedly as he grasped her hand  she cast a halfappealing look at his facea halffrightened one around the room and at the open door beyond  let us she said faintly go into the conservatory    it is but a few years ago that the veracious chronicler of these pages moved with a wondering crowd of sightseers in the gardens of the white house the war cloud had long since lifted and vanished the potomac flowed peacefully by and on to where once lay the broad plantation of a great confederate leadernow a national cemetery that had gathered the soldier dead of both sections side by side in equal rest and honorand the great goddess once more looked down serenely from the dome of the white capitol the chroniclers attention was attracted by an erect handsome soldierlylooking man with a beard and moustache slightly streaked with gray pointing out the various objects of interest to a boy of twelve or fourteen at his side  yes although as i told you this house belongs only to the president of the united states and his family said the gentleman smilingly in that little conservatory i proposed to your mother  oh clarence how can you said the lady reprovingly you know it was long after that
