act    scene  lawn in front of the terrace at hunstanton  sir john and lady caroline pontefract miss worsley on chairs under large yew tree  lady caroline  i believe this is the first english country house you have stayed at miss worsley  hester  yes lady caroline  lady caroline  you have no country houses i am told in america  hester  we have not many  lady caroline  have you any country  what we should call country  hester  smiling  we have the largest country in the world lady caroline  they used to tell us at school that some of our states are as big as france and england put together  lady caroline  ah you must find it very draughty i should fancy to sir john  john you should have your muffler  what is the use of my always knitting mufflers for you if you wont wear them  sir john  i am quite warm caroline i assure you  lady caroline  i think not john  well you couldnt come to a more charming place than this miss worsley though the house is excessively damp quite unpardonably damp and dear lady hunstanton is sometimes a little lax about the people she asks down here  to sir john  jane mixes too much  lord illingworth of course is a man of high distinction  it is a privilege to meet him  and that member of parliament mr kettle   sir john  kelvil my love kelvil  lady caroline  he must be quite respectable  one has never heard his name before in the whole course of ones life which speaks volumes for a man nowadays  but mrs allonby is hardly a very suitable person  hester  i dislike mrs allonby  i dislike her more than i can say  lady caroline  i am not sure miss worsley that foreigners like yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are invited to meet  mrs allonby is very well born  she is a niece of lord brancasters  it is said of course that she ran away twice before she was married  but you know how unfair people often are  i myself dont believe she ran away more than once  hester  mr arbuthnot is very charming  lady caroline  ah yes the young man who has a post in a bank lady hunstanton is most kind in asking him here and lord illingworth seems to have taken quite a fancy to him  i am not sure however that jane is right in taking him out of his position  in my young days miss worsley one never met any one in society who worked for their living  it was not considered the thing  hester  in america those are the people we respect most  lady caroline  i have no doubt of it  hester  mr arbuthnot has a beautiful nature  he is so simple so sincere  he has one of the most beautiful natures i have ever come across  it is a privilege to meet him  lady caroline  it is not customary in england miss worsley for a young lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex  english women conceal their feelings till after they are married  they show them then  hester  do you in england allow no friendship to exist between a young man and a young girl  enter lady hunstanton followed by footman with shawls and a cushion  lady caroline  we think it very inadvisable  jane i was just saying what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet  you have a wonderful power of selection  it is quite a gift  lady hunstanton  dear caroline how kind of you  i think we all do fit in very nicely together  and i hope our charming american visitor will carry back pleasant recollections of our english country life  to footman  the cushion there francis  and my shawl  the shetland  get the shetland  exit footman for shawl  enter gerald arbuthnot  gerald  lady hunstanton i have such good news to tell you  lord illingworth has just offered to make me his secretary  lady hunstanton  his secretary  that is good news indeed gerald it means a very brilliant future in store for you  your dear mother will be delighted  i really must try and induce her to come up here tonight  do you think she would gerald  i know how difficult it is to get her to go anywhere  gerald  oh  i am sure she would lady hunstanton if she knew lord illingworth had made me such an offer  enter footman with shawl  lady hunstanton  i will write and tell her about it and ask her to come up and meet him  to footman  just wait francis writes letter  lady caroline  that is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as you are mr arbuthnot  gerald  it is indeed lady caroline  i trust i shall be able to show myself worthy of it  lady caroline  i trust so  gerald  to hester  you have not congratulated me yet miss worsley  hester  are you very pleased about it  gerald  of course i am  it means everything to me  things that were out of the reach of hope before may be within hopes reach now  hester  nothing should be out of the reach of hope  life is a hope  lady hunstanton  i fancy caroline that diplomacy is what lord illingworth is aiming at  i heard that he was offered vienna  but that may not be true  lady caroline  i dont think that england should be represented abroad by an unmarried man jane  it might lead to complications  lady hunstanton  you are too nervous caroline  believe me you are too nervous  besides lord illingworth may marry any day  i was in hopes he would have married lady kelso  but i believe he said her family was too large  or was it her feet  i forget which  i regret it very much  she was made to be an ambassadors wife  lady caroline  she certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering peoples names and forgetting their faces  lady hunstanton  well that is very natural caroline is it not to footman  tell henry to wait for an answer  i have written a line to your dear mother gerald to tell her your good news and to say she really must come to dinner  exit footman  gerald  that is awfully kind of you lady hunstanton  to hester  will you come for a stroll miss worsley  hester  with pleasure  exit with gerald  lady hunstanton  i am very much gratified at gerald arbuthnots good fortune  he is quite a protege of mine  and i am particularly pleased that lord illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord without my suggesting anything  nobody likes to be asked favours  i remember poor charlotte pagden making herself quite unpopular one season because she had a french governess she wanted to recommend to every one  lady caroline  i saw the governess jane  lady pagden sent her to me  it was before eleanor came out  she was far too goodlooking to be in any respectable household  i dont wonder lady pagden was so anxious to get rid of her  lady hunstanton  ah that explains it  lady caroline  john the grass is too damp for you  you had better go and put on your overshoes at once  sir john  i am quite comfortable caroline i assure you  lady caroline  you must allow me to be the best judge of that john  pray do as i tell you  sir john gets up and goes off  lady hunstanton  you spoil him caroline you do indeed  enter mrs allonby and lady stutfield   to mrs allonby  well dear i hope you like the park  it is said to be well timbered  mrs allonby  the trees are wonderful lady hunstanton  lady stutfield  quite quite wonderful  mrs allonby  but somehow i feel sure that if i lived in the country for six months i should become so unsophisticated that no one would take the slightest notice of me  lady hunstanton  i assure you dear that the country has not that effect at all  why it was from melthorpe which is only two miles from here that lady belton eloped with lord fethersdale  i remember the occurrence perfectly  poor lord belton died three days afterwards of joy or gout  i forget which  we had a large party staying here at the time so we were all very much interested in the whole affair  mrs allonby  i think to elope is cowardly  its running away from danger  and danger has become so rare in modern life  lady caroline  as far as i can make out the young women of the present day seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing with fire  mrs allonby  the one advantage of playing with fire lady caroline is that one never gets even singed  it is the people who dont know how to play with it who get burned up  lady stutfield  yes i see that  it is very very helpful  lady hunstanton  i dont know how the world would get on with such a theory as that dear mrs allonby  lady stutfield  ah  the world was made for men and not for women  mrs allonby  oh dont say that lady stutfield  we have a much better time than they have  there are far more things forbidden to us than are forbidden to them  lady stutfield  yes that is quite quite true  i had not thought of that  enter sir john and mr kelvil  lady hunstanton  well mr kelvil have you got through your work  kelvil  i have finished my writing for the day lady hunstanton it has been an arduous task  the demands on the time of a public man are very heavy nowadays very heavy indeed  and i dont think they meet with adequate recognition  lady caroline  john have you got your overshoes on  sir john  yes my love  lady caroline  i think you had better come over here john  it is more sheltered  sir john  i am quite comfortable caroline  lady caroline  i think not john  you had better sit beside me sir john rises and goes across  lady stutfield  and what have you been writing about this morning mr kelvil  kelvil  on the usual subject lady stutfield  on purity  lady stutfield  that must be such a very very interesting thing to write about  kelvil  it is the one subject of really national importance nowadays lady stutfield  i purpose addressing my constituents on the question before parliament meets  i find that the poorer classes of this country display a marked desire for a higher ethical standard  lady stutfield  how quite quite nice of them  lady caroline  are you in favour of women taking part in politics mr kettle  sir john  kelvil my love kelvil  kelvil  the growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in our political life lady caroline  women are always on the side of morality public and private  lady stutfield  it is so very very gratifying to hear you say that  lady hunstanton  ah yes  the moral qualities in women  that is the important thing  i am afraid caroline that dear lord illingworth doesnt value the moral qualities in women as much as he should  enter lord illingworth  lady stutfield  the world says that lord illingworth is very very wicked  lord illingworth  but what world says that lady stutfield  it must be the next world  this world and i are on excellent terms sits down beside mrs allonby  lady stutfield  every one i know says you are very very wicked  lord illingworth  it is perfectly monstrous the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind ones back that are absolutely and entirely true  lady hunstanton  dear lord illingworth is quite hopeless lady stutfield  i have given up trying to reform him  it would take a public company with a board of directors and a paid secretary to do that  but you have the secretary already lord illingworth havent you  gerald arbuthnot has told us of his good fortune it is really most kind of you  lord illingworth  oh dont say that lady hunstanton  kind is a dreadful word  i took a great fancy to young arbuthnot the moment i met him and hell be of considerable use to me in something i am foolish enough to think of doing  lady hunstanton  he is an admirable young man  and his mother is one of my dearest friends  he has just gone for a walk with our pretty american  she is very pretty is she not  lady caroline  far too pretty  these american girls carry off all the good matches  why cant they stay in their own country  they are always telling us it is the paradise of women  lord illingworth  it is lady caroline  that is why like eve they are so extremely anxious to get out of it  lady caroline  who are miss worsleys parents  lord illingworth  american women are wonderfully clever in concealing their parents  lady hunstanton  my dear lord illingworth what do you mean  miss worsley caroline is an orphan  her father was a very wealthy millionaire or philanthropist or both i believe who entertained my son quite hospitably when he visited boston  i dont know how he made his money originally  kelvil  i fancy in american dry goods  lady hunstanton  what are american dry goods  lord illingworth  american novels  lady hunstanton  how very singular    well from whatever source her large fortune came i have a great esteem for miss worsley  she dresses exceedingly well  all americans do dress well  they get their clothes in paris  mrs allonby  they say lady hunstanton that when good americans die they go to paris  lady hunstanton  indeed  and when bad americans die where do they go to  lord illingworth  oh they go to america  kelvil  i am afraid you dont appreciate america lord illingworth  it is a very remarkable country especially considering its youth  lord illingworth  the youth of america is their oldest tradition it has been going on now for three hundred years  to hear them talk one would imagine they were in their first childhood  as far as civilisation goes they are in their second  kelvil  there is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption in american politics  i suppose you allude to that  lord illingworth  i wonder  lady hunstanton  politics are in a sad way everywhere i am told they certainly are in england  dear mr cardew is ruining the country  i wonder mrs cardew allows him  i am sure lord illingworth you dont think that uneducated people should be allowed to have votes  lord illingworth  i think they are the only people who should  kelvil  do you take no side then in modern politics lord illingworth  lord illingworth  one should never take sides in anything mr kelvil  taking sides is the beginning of sincerity and earnestness follows shortly afterwards and the human being becomes a bore  however the house of commons really does very little harm  you cant make people good by act of parliament  that is something  kelvil  you cannot deny that the house of commons has always shown great sympathy with the sufferings of the poor  lord illingworth  that is its special vice  that is the special vice of the age  one should sympathise with the joy the beauty the colour of life  the less said about lifes sores the better mr kelvil  kelvil  still our east end is a very important problem  lord illingworth  quite so  it is the problem of slavery  and we are trying to solve it by amusing the slaves  lady hunstanton  certainly a great deal may be done by means of cheap entertainments as you say lord illingworth  dear dr daubeny our rector here provides with the assistance of his curates really admirable recreations for the poor during the winter  and much good may be done by means of a magic lantern or a missionary or some popular amusement of that kind  lady caroline  i am not at all in favour of amusements for the poor jane  blankets and coals are sufficient  there is too much love of pleasure amongst the upper classes as it is  health is what we want in modern life  the tone is not healthy not healthy at all  kelvil  you are quite right lady caroline  lady caroline  i believe i am usually right  mrs allonby  horrid word health  lord illingworth  silliest word in our language and one knows so well the popular idea of health  the english country gentleman galloping after a fox  the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable  kelvil  may i ask lord illingworth if you regard the house of lords as a better institution than the house of commons  lord illingworth  a much better institution of course  we in the house of lords are never in touch with public opinion  that makes us a civilised body  kelvil  are you serious in putting forward such a view  lord illingworth  quite serious mr kelvil  to mrs allonby vulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one after one has given them an idea whether one is serious or not  nothing is serious except passion  the intellect is not a serious thing and never has been  it is an instrument on which one plays that is all  the only serious form of intellect i know is the british intellect  and on the british intellect the illiterates play the drum  lady hunstanton  what are you saying lord illingworth about the drum  lord illingworth  i was merely talking to mrs allonby about the leading articles in the london newspapers  lady hunstanton  but do you believe all that is written in the newspapers  lord illingworth  i do  nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs  rises with mrs allonby  lady hunstanton  are you going mrs allonby  mrs allonby  just as far as the conservatory  lord illingworth told me this morning that there was an orchid there m beautiful as the seven deadly sins  lady hunstanton  my dear i hope there is nothing of the kind  i will certainly speak to the gardener  exit mrs allonby and lord illingworth  lady caroline  remarkable type mrs allonby  lady hunstanton  she lets her clever tongue run away with her sometimes  lady caroline  is that the only thing jane mrs allonby allows to run away with her  lady hunstanton  i hope so caroline i am sure  enter lord alfred  dear lord alfred do join us  lord alfred sits down beside lady stutfield  lady caroline  you believe good of every one jane  it is a great fault  lady stutfield  do you really really think lady caroline that one should believe evil of every one  lady caroline  i think it is much safer to do so lady stutfield until of course people are found out to be good  but that requires a great deal of investigation nowadays  lady stutfield  but there is so much unkind scandal in modern life  lady caroline  lord illingworth remarked to me last night at dinner that the basis of every scandal is an absolutely immoral certainty  kelvil  lord illingworth is of course a very brilliant man but he seems to me to be lacking in that fine faith in the nobility and purity of life which is so important in this century  lady stutfield  yes quite quite important is it not  kelvil  he gives me the impression of a man who does not appreciate the beauty of our english homelife  i would say that he was tainted with foreign ideas on the subject  lady stutfield  there is nothing nothing like the beauty of home life is there  kelvil  it is the mainstay of our moral system in england lady stutfield  without it we would become like our neighbours  lady stutfield  that would be so so sad would it not  kelvil  i am afraid too that lord illingworth regards woman simply as a toy  now i have never regarded woman as a toy  woman is the intellectual helpmeet of man in public as in private life without her we should forget the true ideals  sits down beside lady stutfield  lady stutfield  i am so very very glad to hear you say that  lady caroline  you a married man mr kettle  sir john  kelvil dear kelvil  kelvil  i am married lady caroline  lady caroline  family  kelvil  yes  lady caroline  how many  kelvil  eight  lady stutfield turns her attention to lord alfred  lady caroline  mrs kettle and the children are i suppose at the seaside  sir john shrugs his shoulders  kelvil  my wife is at the seaside with the children lady caroline  lady caroline  you will join them later on no doubt  kelvil  if my public engagements permit me  lady caroline  your public life must be a great source of gratification to mrs kettle  sir john  kelvil my love kelvil  lady stutfield  to lord alfred  how very very charming those goldtipped cigarettes of yours are lord alfred  lord alfred  they are awfully expensive  i can only afford them when im in debt  lady stutfield  it must be terribly terribly distressing to be in debt  lord alfred  one must have some occupation nowadays  if i hadnt my debts i shouldnt have anything to think about  all the chaps i know are in debt  lady stutfield  but dont the people to whom you owe the money give you a great great deal of annoyance  enter footman  lord alfred  oh no they write i dont  lady stutfield  how very very strange  lady hunstanton  ah here is a letter caroline from dear mrs arbuthnot  she wont dine  i am so sorry  but she will come in the evening  i am very pleased indeed  she is one of the sweetest of women  writes a beautiful hand too so large so firm  hands letter to lady caroline  lady caroline  looking at it  a little lacking in femininity jane  femininity is the quality i admire most in women  lady hunstanton  taking back letter and leaving it on table oh she is very feminine caroline and so good too  you should hear what the archdeacon says of her  he regards her as his right hand in the parish  footman speaks to her  in the yellow drawingroom  shall we all go in  lady stutfield shall we go in to tea  lady stutfield  with pleasure lady hunstanton  they rise and proceed to go off  sir john offers to carry lady stutfields cloak  lady caroline  john  if you would allow your nephew to look after lady stutfields cloak you might help me with my workbasket  enter lord illingworth and mrs allonby  sir john  certainly my love  exeunt  mrs allonby  curious thing plain women are always jealous of their husbands beautiful women never are  lord illingworth  beautiful women never have time  they are always so occupied in being jealous of other peoples husbands  mrs allonby  i should have thought lady caroline would have grown tired of conjugal anxiety by this time  sir john is her fourth  lord illingworth  so much marriage is certainly not becoming twenty years of romance make a woman look like a ruin but twenty years of marriage make her something like a public building  mrs allonby  twenty years of romance  is there such a thing  lord illingworth  not in our day  women have become too brilliant  nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in the woman  mrs allonby  or the want of it in the man  lord illingworth  you are quite right  in a temple every one should be serious except the thing that is worshipped  mrs allonby  and that should be man  lord illingworth  women kneel so gracefully men dont  mrs allonby  you are thinking of lady stutfield  lord illingworth  i assure you i have not thought of lady stutfield for the last quarter of an hour  mrs allonby  is she such a mystery  lord illingworth  she is more than a mystery  she is a mood  mrs allonby  moods dont last  lord illingworth  it is their chief charm  enter hester and gerald  gerald  lord illingworth every one has been congratulating me lady hunstanton and lady caroline and    every one  i hope i shall make a good secretary  lord illingworth  you will be the pattern secretary gerald talks to him  mrs allonby  you enjoy country life miss worsley  hester  very much indeed  mrs allonby  dont find yourself longing for a london dinner party  hester  i dislike london dinnerparties  mrs allonby  i adore them  the clever people never listen and the stupid people never talk  hester  i think the stupid people talk a great deal  mrs allonby  ah i never listen  lord illingworth  my dear boy if i didnt like you i wouldnt have made you the offer  it is because i like you so much that i want to have you with me  exit hester with gerald  charming fellow gerald arbuthnot  mrs allonby  he is very nice very nice indeed  but i cant stand the american young lady  lord illingworth  why  mrs allonby  she told me yesterday and in quite a loud voice too that she was only eighteen  it was most annoying  lord illingworth  one should never trust a woman who tells one her real age  a woman who would tell one that would tell one anything  mrs allonby  she is a puritan besides   lord illingworth  ah that is inexcusable  i dont mind plain women being puritans  it is the only excuse they have for being plain  but she is decidedly pretty  i admire her immensely looks steadfastly at mrs allonby  mrs allonby  what a thoroughly bad man you must be  lord illingworth  what do you call a bad man  mrs allonby  the sort of man who admires innocence  lord illingworth  and a bad woman  mrs allonby  oh the sort of woman a man never gets tired of  lord illingworth  you are severe  on yourself  mrs allonby  define us as a sex  lord illingworth  sphinxes without secrets  mrs allonby  does that include the puritan women  lord illingworth  do you know i dont believe in the existence of puritan women  i dont think there is a woman in the world who would not be a little flattered if one made love to her  it is that which makes women so irresistibly adorable  mrs allonby  you think there is no woman in the world who would object to being kissed  lord illingworth  very few  mrs allonby  miss worsley would not let you kiss her  lord illingworth  are you sure  mrs allonby  quite  lord illingworth  what do you think shed do if i kissed her  mrs allonby  either marry you or strike you across the face with her glove  what would you do if she struck you across the face with her glove  lord illingworth  fall in love with her probably  mrs allonby  then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her  lord illingworth  is that a challenge  mrs allonby  it is an arrow shot into the air  lord illingworth  dont you know that i always succeed in whatever i try  mrs allonby  i am sorry to hear it  we women adore failures they lean on us  lord illingworth  you worship successes  you cling to them  mrs allonby  we are the laurels to hide their baldness  lord illingworth  and they need you always except at the moment of triumph  mrs allonby  they are uninteresting then  lord illingworth  how tantalising you are  a pause  mrs allonby  lord illingworth there is one thing i shall always like you for  lord illingworth  only one thing  and i have so many bad qualities  mrs allonby  ah dont be too conceited about them  you may lose them as you grow old  lord illingworth  i never intend to grow old  the soul is born old but grows young  that is the comedy of life  mrs allonby  and the body is born young and grows old  that is lifes tragedy  lord illingworth  its comedy also sometimes  but what is the mysterious reason why you will always like me  mrs allonby  it is that you have never made love to me  lord illingworth  i have never done anything else  mrs allonby  really  i have not noticed it  lord illingworth  how fortunate  it might have been a tragedy for both of us  mrs allonby  we should each have survived  lord illingworth  one can survive everything nowadays except death and live down anything except a good reputation  mrs allonby  have you tried a good reputation  lord illingworth  it is one of the many annoyances to which i have never been subjected  mrs allonby  it may come  lord illingworth  why do you threaten me  mrs allonby  i will tell you when you have kissed the puritan  enter footman  francis  tea is served in the yellow drawingroom my lord  lord illingworth  tell her ladyship we are coming in  francis  yes my lord  exit  lord illingworth  shall we go in to tea  mrs allonby  do you like such simple pleasures  lord illingworth  i adore simple pleasures  they are the last refuge of the complex  but if you wish let us stay here  yes let us stay here  the book of life begins with a man and a woman in a garden  mrs allonby  it ends with revelations  lord illingworth  you fence divinely  but the button has come of your foil  mrs allonby  i have still the mask  lord illingworth  it makes your eyes lovelier  mrs allonby  thank you  come  lord illingworth  sees mrs arbuthnots letter on table and takes it up and looks at envelope  what a curious handwriting it reminds me of the handwriting of a woman i used to know years ago  mrs allonby  who  lord illingworth  oh no one  no one in particular  a woman of no importance  throws letter down and passes up the steps of the terrace with mrs allonby  they smile at each other  act drop    second act     scene  drawingroom at hunstanton after dinner lamps lit  door lc door rc  ladies seated on sofas  mrs allonby  what a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a little  lady stutfield  yes men persecute us dreadfully dont they  mrs allonby  persecute us  i wish they did  lady hunstanton  my dear  mrs allonby  the annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly happy without us  that is why i think it is every womans duty never to leave them alone for a single moment except during this short breathing space after dinner without which i believe we poor women would be absolutely worn to shadows  enter servants with coffee  lady hunstanton  worn to shadows dear  mrs allonby  yes lady hunstanton  it is such a strain keeping men up to the mark  they are always trying to escape from us  lady stutfield  it seems to me that it is we who are always trying to escape from them  men are so very very heartless  they know their power and use it  lady caroline  takes coffee from servant  what stuff and nonsense all this about men is  the thing to do is to keep men in their proper place  mrs allonby  but what is their proper place lady caroline  lady caroline  looking after their wives mrs allonby  mrs allonby  takes coffee from servant  really  and if theyre not married  lady caroline  if they are not married they should be looking after a wife  its perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going about society  there should be a law passed to compel them all to marry within twelve months  lady stutfield  refuses coffee  but if theyre in love with some one who perhaps is tied to another  lady caroline  in that case lady stutfield they should be married off in a week to some plain respectable girl in order to teach them not to meddle with other peoples property  mrs allonby  i dont think that we should ever be spoken of as other peoples property  all men are married womens property that is the only true definition of what married womens property really is  but we dont belong to any one  lady stutfield  oh i am so very very glad to hear you say so  lady hunstanton  but do you really think dear caroline that legislation would improve matters in any way  i am told that nowadays all the married men live like bachelors and all the bachelors like married men  mrs allonby  i certainly never know one from the other  lady stutfield  oh i think one can always know at once whether a man has home claims upon his life or not  i have noticed a very very sad expression in the eyes of so many married men  mrs allonby  ah all that i have noticed is that they are horribly tedious when they are good husbands and abominably conceited when they are not  lady hunstanton  well i suppose the type of husband has completely changed since my young days but im bound to state that poor dear hunstanton was the most delightful of creatures and as good as gold  mrs allonby  ah my husband is a sort of promissory note im tired of meeting him  lady caroline  but you renew him from time to time dont you  mrs allonby  oh no lady caroline  i have only had one husband as yet  i suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur  lady caroline  with your views on life i wonder you married at all  mrs allonby  so do i  lady hunstanton  my dear child i believe you are really very happy in your married life but that you like to hide your happiness from others  mrs allonby  i assure you i was horribly deceived in ernest  lady hunstanton  oh i hope not dear  i knew his mother quite well  she was a stratton caroline one of lord crowlands daughters  lady caroline  victoria stratton  i remember her perfectly  a silly fairhaired woman with no chin  mrs allonby  ah ernest has a chin  he has a very strong chin a square chin  ernests chin is far too square  lady stutfield  but do you really think a mans chin can be too square  i think a man should look very very strong and that his chin should be quite quite square  mrs allonby  then you should certainly know ernest lady stutfield  it is only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all  lady stutfield  i adore silent men  mrs allonby  oh ernest isnt silent  he talks the whole time but he has got no conversation  what he talks about i dont know i havent listened to him for years  lady stutfield  have you never forgiven him then  how sad that seems  but all life is very very sad is it not  mrs allonby  life lady stutfield is simply a mauvais quart dheure made up of exquisite moments  lady stutfield  yes there are moments certainly  but was it something very very wrong that mr allonby did  did he become angry with you and say anything that was unkind or true  mrs allonby  oh dear no  ernest is invariably calm  that is one of the reasons he always gets on my nerves  nothing is so aggravating as calmness  there is something positively brutal about the good temper of most modern men  i wonder we women stand it as well as we do  lady  stutfield  yes mens good temper shows they are not so sensitive as we are not so finely strung  it makes a great barrier often between husband and wife does it not  but i would so much like to know what was the wrong thing mr allonby did  mrs allonby  well i will tell you if you solemnly promise to tell everybody else  lady stutfield  thank you thank you  i will make a point of repeating it  mrs allonby  when ernest and i were engaged he swore to me positively on his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course of his life  i was very young at the time so i didnt believe him i neednt tell you  unfortunately however i made no enquiries of any kind till after i had been actually married four or five months  i found out then that what he had told me was perfectly true  and that sort of thing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting  lady hunstanton  my dear  mrs allonby  men always want to be a womans first love  that is their clumsy vanity  we women have a more subtle instinct about things  what we like is to be a mans last romance  lady stutfield  i see what you mean  its very very beautiful  lady hunstanton  my dear child you dont mean to tell me that you wont forgive your husband because he never loved any one else did you ever hear such a thing caroline  i am quite surprised  lady caroline  oh women have become so highly educated jane that nothing should surprise us nowadays except happy marriages they apparently are getting remarkably rare  mrs allonby  oh theyre quite out of date  lady stutfield  except amongst the middle classes i have been told  mrs allonby  how like the middle classes  lady stutfield  yes  is it not  very very like them  lady caroline  if what you tell us about the middle classes is true lady stutfield it redounds greatly to their credit  it is much to be regretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently frivolous under the impression apparently that it is the proper thing to be  it is to that i attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we all know of in society  mrs allonby  do you know lady caroline i dont think the frivolity of the wife has ever anything to do with it more marriages are ruined nowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else  how can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she were a perfectly rational being  lady hunstanton  my dear  mrs allonby  man poor awkward reliable necessary man belongs to a sex that has been rational for millions and millions of years he cant help himself  it is in his race  the history of woman is very different  we have always been picturesque protests against the mere existence of common sense  we saw its dangers from the first  lady stutfield  yes the common sense of husbands is certainly most most trying  do tell me your conception of the ideal husband  i think it would be so very very helpful  mrs allonby  the ideal husband  there couldnt be such a thing the institution is wrong  lady stutfield  the ideal man then in his relations to us  lady caroline  he would probably be extremely realistic  mrs caroline  the ideal man  oh the ideal man should talk to us as if we were goddesses and treat us as if we were children  he should refuse all our serious requests and gratify every one of our whims  he should encourage us to have caprices and forbid us to have missions  he should always say much more than he means and always mean much more than he says  lady hunstanton  but how could he do both dear  mrs allonby  he should never run down other pretty women  that would show he had no taste or make one suspect that he had too much  no he should be nice about them all but say that somehow they dont attract him  lady stutfield  yes that is always very very pleasant to hear about other women  mrs allonby  if we ask him a question about anything he should give us an answer all about ourselves  he should invariably praise us for whatever qualities he knows we havent got  but he should be pitiless quite pitiless in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never dreamed of possessing  he should never believe that we know the use of useful things  that would be unforgiveable but he should shower on us everything we dont want  lady caroline  as far as i can see he is to do nothing but pay bills and compliments  mrs allonby  he should persistently compromise us in public and treat us with absolute respect when we are alone  and yet he should be always ready to have a perfectly terrible scene whenever we want one and to become miserable absolutely miserable at a moments notice and to overwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes and to be positively violent at the end of half an hour and to leave us for ever at a quarter to eight when we have to go and dress for dinner  and when after that one has seen him for really the last time and he has refused to take back the little things he has given one and promised never to communicate with one again or to write one any foolish letters he should be perfectly brokenhearted and telegraph to one all day long and send one little notes every halfhour by a private hansom and dine quite alone at the club so that every one should know how unhappy he was  and after a whole dreadful week during which one has gone about everywhere with ones husband just to show how absolutely lonely one was he may be given a third last parting in the evening and then if his conduct has been quite irreproachable and one has behaved really badly to him he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in the wrong and when he has admitted that it becomes a womans duty to forgive and one can do it all over again from the beginning with variations  lady hunstanton  how clever you are my dear  you never mean a single word you say  lady stutfield  thank you thank you  it has been quite quite entrancing  i must try and remember it all  there are such a number of details that are so very very important  lady caroline  but you have not told us yet what the reward of the ideal man is to be  mrs allonby  his reward  oh infinite expectation  that is quite enough for him  lady stutfield  but men are so terribly terribly exacting are they not  mrs allonby  that makes no matter  one should never surrender  lady stutfield  not even to the ideal man  mrs allonby  certainly not to him  unless of course one wants to grow tired of him  lady stutfield  oh    yes  i see that  it is very very helpful  do you think mrs allonby i shall ever meet the ideal man  or are there more than one  mrs allonby  there are just four in london lady stutfield  lady hunstanton  oh my dear  mrs allonby  going over to her  what has happened  do tell me  lady hunstanton in a low voice  i had completely forgotten that the american young lady has been in the room all the time  i am afraid some of this clever talk may have shocked her a little  mrs allonby  ah that will do her so much good  lady hunstanton  let us hope she didnt understand much  i think i had better go over and talk to her  rises and goes across to hester worsley  well dear miss worsley sitting down beside her  how quiet you have been in your nice little corner all this time  i suppose you have been reading a book  there are so many books here in the library  hester  no i have been listening to the conversation  lady hunstanton  you mustnt believe everything that was said you know dear  hester  i didnt believe any of it  lady hunstanton  that is quite right dear  hester  continuing  i couldnt believe that any women could really hold such views of life as i have heard tonight from some of your guests  an awkward pause  lady hunstanton  i hear you have such pleasant society in america quite like our own in places my son wrote to me  hester  there are cliques in america as elsewhere lady hunstanton  but true american society consists simply of all the good women and good men we have in our country  lady hunstanton  what a sensible system and i dare say quite pleasant too  i am afraid in england we have too many artificial social barriers  we dont see as much as we should of the middle and lower classes  hester  in america we have no lower classes  lady hunstanton  really  what a very strange arrangement  mrs allonby  what is that dreadful girl talking about  lady stutfield  she is painfully natural is she not  lady caroline  there are a great many things you havent got in america i am told miss worsley  they say you have no ruins and no curiosities  mrs allonby  to lady stutfield  what nonsense  they have their mothers and their manners  hester  the english aristocracy supply us with our curiosities lady caroline  they are sent over to us every summer regularly in the steamers and propose to us the day after they land  as for ruins we are trying to build up something that will last longer than brick or stone  gets up to take her fan from table  lady hunstanton  what is that dear  ah yes an iron exhibition is it not at that place that has the curious name  hester  standing by table  we are trying to build up life lady hunstanton on a better truer purer basis than life rests on here  this sounds strange to you all no doubt  how could it sound other than strange  you rich people in england you dont know how you are living  how could you know  you shut out from your society the gentle and the good  you laugh at the simple and the pure  living as you all do on others and by them you sneer at selfsacrifice and if you throw bread to the poor it is merely to keep them quiet for a season  with all your pomp and wealth and art you dont know how to live  you dont even know that  you love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle the beauty that you can destroy and do destroy but of the unseen beauty of life of the unseen beauty of a higher life you know nothing  you have lost lifes secret  oh your english society seems to me shallow selfish foolish  it has blinded its eyes and stopped its ears  it lies like a leper in purple  it sits like a dead thing smeared with gold  it is all wrong all wrong  lady stutfield  i dont think one should know of these things  it is not very very nice is it  lady hunstanton  my dear miss worsley i thought you liked english society so much  you were such a success in it  and you were so much admired by the best people  i quite forget what lord henry weston said of you  but it was most complimentary and you know what an authority he is on beauty  hester  lord henry weston  i remember him lady hunstanton  a man with a hideous smile and a hideous past  he is asked everywhere  no dinnerparty is complete without him  what of those whose ruin is due to him  they are outcasts  they are nameless  if you met them in the street you would turn your head away  i dont complain of their punishment  let all women who have sinned be punished  mrs arbuthnot enters from terrace behind in a cloak with a lace veil over her head  she hears the last words and starts  lady hunstanton  my dear young lady  hester  it is right that they should be punished but dont let them be the only ones to suffer  if a man and woman have sinned let them both go forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there  let them both be branded  set a mark if you wish on each but dont punish the one and let the other go free  dont have one law for men and another for women  you are unjust to women in england  and till you count what is a shame in a woman to be an infamy in a man you will always be unjust and right that pillar of fire and wrong that pillar of cloud will be made dim to your eyes or be not seen at all or if seen not regarded  lady caroline  might i dear miss worsley as you are standing up ask you for my cotton that is just behind you  thank you  lady hunstanton  my dear mrs arbuthnot  i am so pleased you have come up  but i didnt hear you announced  mrs allonby  oh i came straight in from the terrace lady hunstanton just as i was  you didnt tell me you had a party  lady hunstanton  not a party  only a few guests who are staying in the house and whom you must know  allow me  tries to help her  rings bell  caroline this is mrs arbuthnot one of my sweetest friends  lady caroline pontefract lady stutfield mrs allonby and my young american friend miss worsley who has just been telling us all how wicked we are  hester  i am afraid you think i spoke too strongly lady hunstanton  but there are some things in england   lady hunstanton  my dear young lady there was a great deal of truth i dare say in what you said and you looked very pretty while you said it which is much more important lord illingworth would tell us  the only point where i thought you were a little hard was about lady carolines brother about poor lord henry  he is really such good company  enter footman  take mrs arbuthnots things  exit footman with wraps  hester  lady caroline i had no idea it was your brother  i am sorry for the pain i must have caused you  i   lady caroline  my dear miss worsley the only part of your little speech if i may so term it with which i thoroughly agreed was the part about my brother  nothing that you could possibly say could be too bad for him  i regard henry as infamous absolutely infamous  but i am bound to state as you were remarking jane that he is excellent company and he has one of the best cooks in london and after a good dinner one can forgive anybody even ones own relations  lady hunstanton to miss worsley  now do come dear and make friends with mrs arbuthnot  she is one of the good sweet simple people you told us we never admitted into society  i am sorry to say mrs arbuthnot comes very rarely to me  but that is not my fault  mrs allonby  what a bore it is the men staying so long after dinner  i expect they are saying the most dreadful things about us  lady stutfield  do you really think so  mrs allonby  i was sure of it  lady stutfield  how very very horrid of them  shall we go onto the terrace  mrs allonby  oh anything to get away from the dowagers and the dowdies  rises and goes with lady stutfield to door lc  we are only going to look at the stars lady hunstanton  lady hunstanton  you will find a great many dear a great many but dont catch cold  to mrs arbuthnot  we shall all miss gerald so much dear mrs arbuthnot  mrs arbuthnot  but has lord illingworth really offered to make gerald his secretary  lady hunstanton  oh yes  he has been most charming about it  he has the highest possible opinion of your boy  you dont know lord illingworth i believe dear  mrs arbuthnot  i have never met him  lady hunstanton  you know him by name no doubt  mrs arbuthnot  i am afraid i dont  i live so much out of the world and see so few people  i remember hearing years ago of an old lord illingworth who lived in yorkshire i think  lady hunstanton  ah yes  that would be the last earl but one he was a very curious man  he wanted to marry beneath him  or wouldnt i believe  there was some scandal about it  the present lord illingworth is quite different  he is very distinguished  he does  well he does nothing which i am afraid our pretty american visitor here thinks very wrong of anybody and i dont know that he cares much for the subjects in which you are so interested dear mrs arbuthnot  do you think caroline that lord illingworth is interested in the housing of the poor  lady caroline  i should fancy not at all jane  lady hunstanton  we all have our different tastes have we not but lord illingworth has a very high position and there is nothing he couldnt get if he chose to ask for it  of course he is comparatively a young man still and he has only come to his title within  how long exactly is it caroline since lord illingworth succeeded  lady caroline  about four years i think jane  i know it was the same year in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers  lady hunstanton  ah i remember  that would be about four years ago  of course there were a great many people between the present lord illingworth and the title mrs arbuthnot  there was  who was there caroline  lady caroline  there was poor margarets baby  you remember how anxious she was to have a boy and it was a boy but it died and her husband died shortly afterwards and she married almost immediately one of lord ascots sons who i am told beats her  lady hunstanton  ah that is in the family dear that is in the family  and there was also i remember a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic or a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman i forget which but i know the court of chancery investigated the matter and decided that he was quite sane  and i saw him afterwards at poor lord plumsteads with straws in his hair or something very odd about him  i cant recall what  i often regret lady caroline that dear lady cecilia never lived to see her son get the title  mrs arbuthnot  lady cecilia  lady  hunstanton  lord illingworths mother dear mrs arbuthnot was one of the duchess of jerninghams pretty daughters and she married sir thomas harford who wasnt considered a very good match for her at the time though he was said to be the handsomest man in london  i knew them all quite intimately and both the sons arthur and george  mrs arbuthnot  it was the eldest son who succeeded of course lady hunstanton  lady hunstanton  no dear he was killed in the hunting field  or was it fishing caroline  i forget  but george came in for everything  i always tell him that no younger son has ever had such good luck as he has had  mrs arbuthnot  lady hunstanton i want to speak to gerald at once  might i see him  can he be sent for  lady hunstanton  certainly dear  i will send one of the servants into the diningroom to fetch him  i dont know what keeps the gentlemen so long  rings bell  when i knew lord illingworth first as plain george harford he was simply a very brilliant young man about town with not a penny of money except what poor dear lady cecilia gave him  she was quite devoted to him  chiefly i fancy because he was on bad terms with his father  oh here is the dear archdeacon  to servant  it doesnt matter  enter sir john and doctor daubeny  sir john goes over to lady stutfield doctor daubeny to lady hunstanton  the archdeacon  lord illingworth has been most entertaining  i have never enjoyed myself more  sees mrs arbuthnot  ah mrs arbuthnot  lady hunstanton  to doctor daubeny  you see i have got mrs arbuthnot to come to me at last  the archdeacon  that is a great honour lady hunstanton  mrs daubeny will be quite jealous of you  lady hunstanton  ah i am so sorry mrs daubeny could not come with you tonight  headache as usual i suppose  the archdeacon  yes lady hunstanton a perfect martyr  but she is happiest alone  she is happiest alone  lady caroline  to her husband  john  sir john goes over to his wife  doctor daubeny talks to lady hunstanton and mrs arbuthnot  mrs arbuthnot watches lord illingworth the whole time  he has passed across the room without noticing her and approaches mrs allonby who with lady stutfield is standing by the door looking on to the terrace  lord illingworth  how is the most charming woman in the world  mrs allonby  taking lady stutfield by the hand  we are both quite well thank you lord illingworth  but what a short time you have been in the diningroom  it seems as if we had only just left  lord illingworth  i was bored to death  never opened my lips the whole time  absolutely longing to come in to you  mrs allonby  you should have  the american girl has been giving us a lecture  lord illingworth  really  all americans lecture i believe  i suppose it is something in their climate  what did she lecture about  mrs allonby  oh puritanism of course  lord illingworth  i am going to convert her am i not  how long do you give me  mrs allonby  a week  lord illingworth  a week is more than enough  enter gerald and lord alfred  gerald  going to mrs arbuthnot  dear mother  mrs arbuthnot  gerald i dont feel at all well  see me home gerald  i shouldnt have come  gerald  i am so sorry mother  certainly  but you must know lord illingworth first  goes across room  mrs arbuthnot  not tonight gerald  gerald  lord illingworth i want you so much to know my mother  lord illingworth  with the greatest pleasure  to mrs allonby ill be back in a moment  peoples mothers always bore me to death  all women become like their mothers  that is their tragedy  mrs allonby  no man does  that is his  lord illingworth  what a delightful mood you are in tonight turns round and goes across with gerald to mrs arbuthnot  when he sees her he starts back in wonder  then slowly his eyes turn towards gerald  gerald  mother this is lord illingworth who has offered to take me as his private secretary  mrs arbuthnot bows coldly  it is a wonderful opening for me isnt it  i hope he wont be disappointed in me that is all  youll thank lord illingworth mother wont you  mrs arbuthnot  lord illingworth in very good i am sure to interest himself in you for the moment  lord illingworth  putting his hand on geralds shoulder  oh gerald and i are great friends already mrs    arbuthnot  mrs arbuthnot  there can be nothing in common between you and my son lord illingworth  gerald  dear mother how can you say so  of course lord illingworth is awfully clever and that sort of thing  there is nothing lord illingworth doesnt know  lord illingworth  my dear boy  gerald  he knows more about life than any one i have ever met  i feel an awful duffer when i am with you lord illingworth  of course i have had so few advantages  i have not been to eton or oxford like other chaps  but lord illingworth doesnt seem to mind that  he has been awfully good to me mother  mrs arbuthnot  lord illingworth may change his mind  he may not really want you as his secretary  gerald  mother  mrs arbuthnot  you must remember as you said yourself you have had so few advantages  mrs allonby  lord illingworth i want to speak to you for a moment  do come over  lord illingworth  will you excuse me mrs arbuthnot  now dont let your charming mother make any more difficulties gerald  the thing is quite settled isnt it  gerald  i hope so  lord illingworth goes across to mrs arbuthnot  mrs allonby  i thought you were never going to leave the lady in black velvet  lord illingworth  she is excessively handsome  looks at mrs arbuthnot  lady hunstanton  caroline shall we all make a move to the music room  miss worsley is going to play  youll come too dear mrs arbuthnot wont you  you dont know what a treat is in store for you  to doctor daubeny  i must really take miss worsley down some afternoon to the rectory  i should so much like dear mrs daubeny to hear her on the violin  ah i forgot  dear mrs daubenys hearing is a little defective is it not  the archdeacon  her deafness is a great privation to her  she cant even hear my sermons now  she reads them at home  but she has many resources in herself many resources  lady hunstanton  she reads a good deal i suppose  the archdeacon  just the very largest print  the eyesight is rapidly going  but shes never morbid never morbid  gerald  to lord illingworth  do speak to my mother lord illingworth before you go into the musicroom  she seems to think somehow you dont mean what you said to me  mrs allonby  arent you coming  lord illingworth  in a few moments  lady hunstanton if mrs arbuthnot would allow me i would like to say a few words to her and we will join you later on  lady hunstanton  ah of course  you will have a great deal to say to her and she will have a great deal to thank you for  it is not every son who gets such an offer mrs arbuthnot  but i know you appreciate that dear  lady caroline  john  lady hunstanton  now dont keep mrs arbuthnot too long lord illingworth  we cant spare her  exit following the other guests  sound of violin heard from musicroom  lord illingworth  so that is our son rachel  well i am very proud of him  he in a harford every inch of him  by the way why arbuthnot rachel  mrs arbuthnot  one name is as good as another when one has no right to any name  lord illingworth  i suppose so  but why gerald  mrs arbuthnot  after a man whose heart i broke  after my father  lord illingworth  well rachel what in over is over  all i have got to say now in that i am very very much pleased with our boy the world will know him merely as my private secretary but to me he will be something very near and very dear  it is a curious thing rachel my life seemed to be quite complete  it was not so it lacked something it lacked a son  i have found my son now i am glad i have found him  mrs arbuthnot  you have no right to claim him or the smallest part of him  the boy is entirely mine and shall remain mine  lord illingworth  my dear rachel you have had him to yourself for over twenty years  why not let me have him for a little now  he is quite as much mine as yours  mrs arbuthnot  are you talking of the child you abandoned  of the child who as far as you are concerned might have died of hunger and of want  lord illingworth  you forget rachel it was you who left me  it was not i who left you  mrs arbuthnot  i left you because you refused to give the child a name  before my son was born i implored you to marry me  lord illingworth  i had no expectations then  and besides rachel i wasnt much older than you were  i was only twentytwo i was twentyone i believe when the whole thing began in your fathers garden  mrs arbuthnot  when a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old enough to do right also  lord illingworth  my dear rachel intellectual generalities are always interesting but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing  as for saying i left our child to starve that of course is untrue and silly  my mother offered you six hundred a year  but you wouldnt take anything  you simply disappeared and carried the child away with you  mrs arbuthnot  i wouldnt have accepted a penny from her  your father was different  he told you in my presence when we were in paris that it was your duty to marry me  lord illingworth  oh duty is what one expects from others it is not what one does oneself  of course i was influenced by my mother  every man is when he is young  mrs arbuthnot  i am glad to hear you say so  gerald shall certainly not go away with you  lord illingworth  what nonsense rachel  mrs arbuthnot  do you think i would allow my son   lord illingworth  our son  mrs arbuthnot  my son lord illingworth shrugs his shoulders  to go away with the man who spoiled my youth who ruined my life who has tainted every moment of my days  you dont realise what my past has been in suffering and in shame  lord illingworth  my dear rachel i must candidly say that i think geralds future considerably more important than your past  mrs arbuthnot  gerald cannot separate his future from my past  lord illingworth  that is exactly what he should do  that is exactly what you should help him to do  what a typical woman you are  you talk sentimentally and you are thoroughly selfish the whole time  but dont let us have a scene  rachel i want you to look at this matter from the commonsense point of view from the point of view of what is best for our son leaving you and me out of the question  what is our son at present  an underpaid clerk in a small provincial bank in a thirdrate english town  if you imagine he is quite happy in such a position you are mistaken  he is thoroughly discontented  mrs arbuthnot  he was not discontented till he met you  you have made him so  lord illingworth  of course i made him so  discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation  but i did not leave him with a mere longing for things he could not get  no i made him a charming offer  he jumped at it i need hardly say any young man would  and now simply because it turns out that i am the boys own father and he my own son you propose practically to ruin his career  that is to say if i were a perfect stranger you would allow gerald to go away with me but as he is my own flesh and blood you wont  how utterly illogical you are  mrs arbuthnot  i will not allow him to go  lord illingworth  how can you prevent it  what excuse can you give to him for making him decline such an offer as mine  i wont tell him in what relations i stand to him i need hardly say  but you darent tell him  you know that  look how you have brought him up  mrs arbuthnot  i have brought him up to be a good man  lord illingworth  quite so  and what is the result  you have educated him to be your judge if he ever finds you out  and a bitter an unjust judge he will be to you  dont be deceived rachel  children begin by loving their parents  after a time they judge them  rarely if ever do they forgive them  mrs arbuthnot  george dont take my son away from me  i have had twenty years of sorrow and i have only had one thing to love me only one thing to love  you have had a life of joy and pleasure and success  you have been quite happy you have never thought of us  there was no reason according to your views of life why you should have remembered us at all  your meeting us was a mere accident a horrible accident  forget it  dont come now and rob me of    of all i have in the whole world  you are so rich in other things  leave me the little vineyard of my life leave me the walledin garden and the well of water the ewelamb god sent me in pity or in wrath oh leave me that  george dont take gerald from me  lord illingworth  rachel at the present moment you are not necessary to geralds career i am  there is nothing more to be said on the subject  mrs arbuthnot  i will not let him go  lord illingworth  here is gerald  he has a right to decide for himself  enter gerald  gerald  well dear mother i hope you have settled it all with lord illingworth  mrs arbuthnot  i have not gerald  lord illingworth  your mother seems not to like your coming with me for some reason  gerald  why mother  mrs arbuthnot  i thought you were quite happy here with me gerald  i didnt know you were so anxious to leave me  gerald  mother how can you talk like that  of course i have been quite happy with you  but a man cant stay always with his mother no chap does  i want to make myself a position to do something i thought you would have been proud to see me lord illingworths secretary  mrs arbuthnot  i do not think you would be suitable as a private secretary to lord illingworth  you have no qualifications  lord illingworth  i dont wish to seem to interfere for a moment mrs arbuthnot but as far as your last objection is concerned i surely am the best judge  and i can only tell you that your son has all the qualifications i had hoped for  he has more in fact than i had even thought of  far more  mrs arbuthnot remains silent  have you any other reason mrs arbuthnot why you dont wish your son to accept this post  gerald  have you mother  do answer  lord illingworth  if you have mrs arbuthnot pray pray say it we are quite by ourselves here  whatever it is i need not say i will not repeat it  gerald  mother  lord illingworth  if you would like to be alone with your son i will leave you  you may have some other reason you dont wish me to hear  mrs arbuthnot  i have no other reason  lord illingworth  then my dear boy we may look on the thing as settled  come you and i will smoke a cigarette on the terrace together  and mrs arbuthnot pray let me tell you that i think you have acted very very wisely  exit with gerald  mrs arbuthnot is left alone  she stands immobile with a look of unutterable sorrow on her face  act drop    third act    scene   the picture gallery at hunstanton  door at back leading on to terrace  lord illingworth and gerald rc  lord illingworth lolling on a sofa  gerald in a chair  lord illingworth  thoroughly sensible woman your mother gerald i knew she would come round in the end  gerald  my mother is awfully conscientious lord illingworth and i know she doesnt think i am educated enough to be your secretary she is perfectly right too  i was fearfully idle when i was at school and i couldnt pass an examination now to save my life  lord illingworth  my dear gerald examinations are of no value whatsoever  if a man is a gentleman he knows quite enough and if he is not a gentleman whatever he knows is bad for him  gerald  but i am so ignorant of the world lord illingworth  lord illingworth  dont be afraid gerald  remember that youve got on your side the most wonderful thing in the world  youth there is nothing like youth  the middleaged are mortgaged to life  the old are in lifes lumberroom  but youth is the lord of life  youth has a kingdom waiting for it  every one is born a king and most people die in exile like most kings  to win back my youth gerald there is nothing i wouldnt do  except take exercise get up early or be a useful member of the community  gerald  but you dont call yourself old lord illingworth  lord illingworth  i am old enough to be your father gerald  gerald  i dont remember my father he died years ago  lord illingworth  so lady hunstanton told me  gerald  it is very curious my mother never talks to me about my father  i sometimes think she must have married beneath her  lord illingworth  winces slightly  really  goes over and puts his hand on geralds shoulder  you have missed not having a father i suppose gerald  gerald  oh no my mother has been so good to me  no one ever had such a mother as i have had  lord illingworth  i am quite sure of that  still i should imagine that most mothers dont quite understand their sons  dont realise i mean that a son has ambitions a desire to see life to make himself a name  after all gerald you couldnt be expected to pass all your life in such a hole as wrockley could you  gerald  oh no  it would be dreadful  lord illingworth  a mothers love is very touching of course but it is often curiously selfish  i mean there is a good deal of selfishness in it  gerald  slowly  i suppose there is  lord illingworth  your mother is a thoroughly good woman  but good women have such limited views of life their horizon is so small their interests are so petty arent they  gerald  they are awfully interested certainly in things we dont care much about  lord illingworth  i suppose your mother is very religious and that sort of thing  gerald  oh yes shes always going to church  lord illingworth  ah she is not modern and to be modern is the only thing worth being nowadays  you want to be modern dont you gerald  you want to know life as it really is  not to be put of with any oldfashioned theories about life  well what you have to do at present is simply to fit yourself for the best society  a man who can dominate a london dinnertable can dominate the world the future belongs to the dandy  it is the exquisites who are going to rule  gerald  i should like to wear nice things awfully but i have always been told that a man should not think too much about his clothes  lord illingworth  people nowadays are so absolutely superficial that they dont understand the philosophy of the superficial  by the way gerald you should learn how to tie your tie better sentiment is all very well for the buttonhole  but the essential thing for a necktie is style  a welltied tie is the first serious step in life  gerald  laughing  i might be able to learn how to tie a tie lord illingworth but i should never be able to talk as you do  i dont know how to talk  lord illingworth  oh talk to every woman as if you loved her and to every man as if he bored you and at the end of your first season you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact  gerald  but it is very difficult to get into society isnt it  lord illingworth  to get into the best society nowadays one has either to feed people amuse people or shock people  that is all  gerald  i suppose society is wonderfully delightful  lord illingworth  to be in it is merely a bore  but to be out of it simply a tragedy  society is a necessary thing  no man has any real success in this world unless he has got women to back him and women rule society  if you have not got women on your side you are quite over  you might just as well be a barrister or a stockbroker or a journalist at once  gerald  it is very difficult to understand women is it not  lord illingworth  you should never try to understand them  women are pictures  men are problems  if you want to know what a woman really means  which by the way is always a dangerous thing to do  look at her dont listen to her  gerald  but women are awfully clever arent they  lord illingworth  one should always tell them so  but to the philosopher my dear gerald women represent the triumph of matter over mind  just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals  gerald  how then can women have so much power as you say they have  lord illingworth  the history of women is the history of the worst form of tyranny the world has ever known  the tyranny of the weak over the strong  it is the only tyranny that lasts  gerald  but havent women got a refining influence  lord illingworth  nothing refines but the intellect  gerald  still there are many different kinds of women arent there  lord illingworth  only two kinds in society the plain and the coloured  gerald  but there are good women in society arent there  lord illingworth  far too many  gerald  but do you think women shouldnt be good  lord illingworth  one should never tell them so theyd all become good at once  women are a fascinatingly wilful sex  every woman is a rebel and usually in wild revolt against herself  gerald  you have never been married lord illingworth have you  lord illingworth  men marry because they are tired women because they are curious  both are disappointed  gerald  but dont you think one can be happy when one is married  lord illingworth  perfectly happy  but the happiness of a married man my dear gerald depends on the people he has not married  gerald  but if one is in love  lord illingworth  one should always be in love  that is the reason one should never marry  gerald  love is a very wonderful thing isnt it  lord illingworth  when one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself  and one ends by deceiving others  that is what the world calls a romance  but a really grande passion is comparatively rare nowadays  it is the privilege of people who have nothing to do that is the one use of the idle classes in a country and the only possible explanation of us harfords  gerald  harfords lord illingworth  lord illingworth  that is my family name  you should study the peerage gerald  it is the one book a young man about town should know thoroughly and it is the best thing in fiction the english have ever done  and now gerald you are going into a perfectly new life with me and i want you to know how to live  mrs arbuthnot appears on terrace behind  for the world has been made by fools that wise men should live in it  enter lc lady hunstanton and dr daubeny  lady hunstanton  ah here you are dear lord illingworth  well i suppose you have been telling our young friend gerald what his new duties are to be and giving him a great deal of good advice over a pleasant cigarette  lord illingworth  i have been giving him the best of advice lady hunstanton and the best of cigarettes  lady hunstanton  i am so sorry i was not here to listen to you but i suppose i am too old now to learn  except from you dear archdeacon when you are in your nice pulpit  but then i always know what you are going to say so i dont feel alarmed  sees mrs arbuthnot  ah dear mrs arbuthnot do come and join us come dear  enter mrs arbuthnot  gerald has been having such a long talk with lord illingworth i am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant way in which everything has turned out for him  let us sit down  they sit down  and how is your beautiful embroidery going on  mrs arbuthnot  i am always at work lady hunstanton  lady hunstanton  mrs daubeny embroiders a little too doesnt she  the archdeacon  she was very deft with her needle once quite a dorcas  but the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal  she has not touched the tambour frame for nine or ten years  but she has many other amusements  she is very much interested in her own health  lady hunstanton  ah that is always a nice distraction in it not now what are you talking about lord illingworth  do tell us  lord illingworth  i was on the point of explaining to gerald that the world has always laughed at its own tragedies that being the only way in which it has been able to bear them  and that consequently whatever the world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things  lady hunstanton  now i am quite out of my depth  i usually am when lord illingworth says anything  and the humane society is most careless  they never rescue me  i am left to sink  i have a dim idea dear lord illingworth that you are always on the side of the sinners and i know i always try to be on the side of the saints but that is as far as i get  and after all it may be merely the fancy of a drowning person  lord illingworth  the only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future  lady hunstanton  ah that quite does for me  i havent a word to say  you and i dear mrs arbuthnot are behind the age  we cant follow lord illingworth  too much care was taken with our education i am afraid  to have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays  it shuts one out from so much  mrs arbuthnot  i should be sorry to follow lord illingworth in any of his opinions  lady hunstanton  you are quite right dear  gerald shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother  enter lady caroline  lady caroline  jane have you seen john anywhere  lady hunstanton  you neednt be anxious about him dear  he is with lady stutfield i saw them some time ago in the yellow drawingroom  they seem quite happy together  you are not going caroline  pray sit down  lady caroline  i think i had better look after john  exit lady caroline  lady hunstanton  it doesnt do to pay men so much attention  and caroline has really nothing to be anxious about  lady stutfield is very sympathetic  she is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about another  a beautiful nature  enter sir john and mrs allonby  ah here is sir john  and with mrs allonby too  i suppose it was mrs allonby i saw him with  sir john caroline has been looking everywhere for you  mrs allonby  we have been waiting for her in the musicroom dear lady hunstanton  lady hunstanton  ah the musicroom of course  i thought it was the yellow drawingroom my memory is getting so defective  to the archdeacon  mrs daubeny has a wonderful memory hasnt she  the archdeacon  she used to be quite remarkable for her memory but since her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her early childhood  but she finds great pleasure in such retrospections great pleasure  enter lady stutfield and mr kelvil  lady hunstanton  ah dear lady stutfield and what has mr kelvil been talking to you about  lady stutfield  about bimetallism as well as i remember  lady hunstanton  bimetallism  is that quite a nice subject however i know people discuss everything very freely nowadays what did sir john talk to you about dear mrs allonby  mrs allonby  about patagonia  lady hunstanton  really  what a remote topic  but very improving i have no doubt  mrs allonby  he has been most interesting on the subject of patagonia  savages seem to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost all subjects  they are excessively advanced  lady hunstanton  what do they do  mrs allonby  apparently everything  lady hunstanton  well it is very gratifying dear archdeacon is it not to find that human nature is permanently one  on the whole the world is the same world is it not  lord illingworth  the world is simply divided into two classes  those who believe the incredible like the public  and those who do the improbable   mrs allonby  like yourself  lord illingworth  yes i am always astonishing myself  it is the only thing that makes life worth living  lady stutfield  and what have you been doing lately that astonishes you  lord illingworth  i have been discovering all kinds of beautiful qualities in my own nature  mrs allonby  ah dont become quite perfect all at once  do it gradually  lord illingworth  i dont intend to grow perfect at all  at least i hope i shant  it would be most inconvenient  women love us for our defects  if we have enough of them they will forgive us everything even our gigantic intellects  mrs allonby  it is premature to ask us to forgive analysis  we forgive adoration that is quite as much as should be expected from us  enter lord alfred  he joins lady stutfield  lady hunstanton  ah we women should forgive everything shouldnt we dear mrs arbuthnot  i am sure you agree with me in that  mrs arbuthnot  i do not lady hunstanton  i think there are many things women should never forgive  lady hunstanton  what sort of things  mrs arbuthnot  the ruin of another womans life  moves slowly away to back of stage  lady  hunstanton  ah those things are very sad no doubt but i believe there are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and reformed and i think on the whole that the secret of life is to take things very very easily  mrs allonby  the secret of life is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming  lady stutfield  the secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of being terribly terribly deceived  kelvil  the secret of life is to resist temptation lady stutfield  lord illingworth  there is no secret of life  lifes aim if it has one is simply to be always looking for temptations  there are not nearly enough  i sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a single one  it is quite dreadful  it makes one so nervous about the future  lady hunstanton  shakes her fan at him  i dont know how it is dear lord illingworth but everything you have said today seems to me excessively immoral  it has been most interesting listening to you  lord illingworth  all thought is immoral  its very essence is destruction  if you think of anything you kill it  nothing survives being thought of  lady hunstanton  i dont understand a word lord illingworth  but i have no doubt it is all quite true  personally i have very little to reproach myself with on the score of thinking  i dont believe in women thinking too much  women should think in moderation as they should do all things in moderation  lord illingworth  moderation is a fatal thing lady hunstanton nothing succeeds like excess  lady hunstanton  i hope i shall remember that  it sounds an admirable maxim  but im beginning to forget everything  its a great misfortune  lord illingworth  it is one of your most fascinating qualities lady hunstanton  no woman should have a memory  memory in a woman is the beginning of dowdiness  one can always tell from a womans bonnet whether she has got a memory or not  lady hunstanton  how charming you are dear lord illingworth  you always find out that ones most glaring fault is ones most important virtue  you have the most comforting views of life  enter farquhar  farquhar  doctor daubenys carriage  lady hunstanton  my dear archdeacon  it is only halfpast ten  the archdeacon  rising  i am afraid i must go lady hunstanton tuesday is always one of mrs daubenys bad nights  lady hunstanton  rising  well i wont keep you from her goes with him towards door  i have told farquhar to put a brace of partridge into the carriage  mrs daubeny may fancy them  the archdeacon  it is very kind of you but mrs daubeny never touches solids now  lives entirely on jellies  but she is wonderfully cheerful wonderfully cheerful  she has nothing to complain of  exit with lady hunstanton  mrs allonby  goes over to lord illingworth  there is a beautiful moon tonight  lord illingworth  let us go and look at it  to look at anything that is inconstant is charming nowadays  mrs allonby  you have your lookingglass  lord illingworth  it is unkind  it merely shows me my wrinkles  mrs allonby  mine is better behaved  it never tells me the truth  lord illingworth  then it is in love with you  exeunt sir john lady stutfield mr kelvil and lord alfred  gerald  to lord illingworth  may i come too  lord illingworth  do my dear boy  moves towards with mrs allonby and gerald  lady caroline enters looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite direction to that taken by sir john and lady stutfield  mrs arbuthnot  gerald  gerald  what mother  exit lord illingworth with mrs allonby  mrs arbuthnot  it is getting late  let us go home  gerald  my dear mother  do let us wait a little longer  lord illingworth is so delightful and by the way mother i have a great surprise for you  we are starting for india at the end of this month  mrs arbuthnot  let us go home  gerald  if you really want to of course mother but i must bid goodbye to lord illingworth first  ill be back in five minutes exit  mrs arbuthnot  let him leave me if he chooses but not with him  not with him  i couldnt bear it  walks up and down  enter hester  hester  what a lovely night it is mrs arbuthnot  mrs arbuthnot  is it  hester  mrs arbuthnot i wish you would let us be friends  you are so different from the other women here  when you came into the drawingroom this evening somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and pure in life  i had been foolish  there are things that are right to say but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people  mrs arbuthnot  i heard what you said  i agree with it miss worsley  hester  i didnt know you had heard it  but i knew you would agree with me  a woman who has sinned should be punished shouldnt she  mrs arbuthnot  yes  hester  she shouldnt be allowed to come into the society of good men and women  mrs arbuthnot  she should not  hester  and the man should be punished in the same way  mrs arbuthnot  in the same way  and the children if there are children in the same way also  hester  yes it is right that the sins of the parents should be visited on the children  it is a just law  it is gods law  mrs arbuthnot  it is one of gods terrible laws  moves away to fireplace  hester  you are distressed about your son leaving you mrs arbuthnot  mrs arbuthnot  yes  hester  do you like him going away with lord illingworth  of course there is position no doubt and money but position and money are not everything are they  mrs arbuthnot  they are nothing they bring misery  hester  then why do you let your son go with him  mrs arbuthnot  he wishes it himself  hester  but if you asked him he would stay would he not  mrs arbuthnot  he has set his heart on going  hester  he couldnt refuse you anything  he loves you too much ask him to stay  let me send him in to you  he is on the terrace at this moment with lord illingworth  i heard them laughing together as i passed through the musicroom  mrs arbuthnot  dont trouble miss worsley i can wait  it is of no consequence  hester  no ill tell him you want him  do  do ask him to stay exit hester  mrs arbuthnot  he wont come  i know he wont come  enter lady caroline  she looks round anxiously  enter gerald  lady caroline  mr arbuthnot may i ask you is sir john anywhere on the terrace  gerald  no lady caroline he is not on the terrace  lady caroline  it is very curious  it is time for him to retire  exit lady caroline  gerald  dear mother i am afraid i kept you waiting  i forgot all about it  i am so happy tonight mother i have never been so happy  mrs arbuthnot  at the prospect of going away  gerald  dont put it like that mother  of course i am sorry to leave you  why you are the best mother in the whole world  but after all as lord illingworth says it is impossible to live in such a place as wrockley  you dont mind it  but im ambitions i want something more than that  i want to have a career  i want to do something that will make you proud of me and lord illingworth is going to help me  he is going to do everything for me  mrs arbuthnot  gerald dont go away with lord illingworth  i implore you not to  gerald i beg you  gerald  mother how changeable you are  you dont seem to know your own mind for a single moment  an hour and a half ago in the drawingroom you agreed to the whole thing now you turn round and make objections and try to force me to give up my one chance in life  yes my one chance  you dont suppose that men like lord illingworth are to be found every day do you mother  it is very strange that when i have had such a wonderful piece of good luck the one person to put difficulties in my way should be my own mother  besides you know mother i love hester worsley  who could help loving her  i love her more than i have ever told you far more  and if i had a position if i had prospects i could  i could ask her to  dont you understand now mother what it means to me to be lord illingworths secretary  to start like that is to find a career ready for one  before one  waiting for one  if i were lord illingworths secretary i could ask hester to be my wife as a wretched bank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an impertinence  mrs arbuthnot  i fear you need have no hopes of miss worsley  i know her views on life  she has just told them to me  a pause  gerald  then i have my ambition left at any rate  that is something  i am glad i have that  you have always tried to crush my ambition mother  havent you  you have told me that the world is a wicked place that success is not worth having that society is shallow and all that sort of thing  well i dont believe it mother  i think the world must be delightful  i think society must be exquisite  i think success is a thing worth having  you have been wrong in all that you taught me mother quite wrong lord illingworth is a successful man  he is a fashionable man  he is a man who lives in the world and for it  well i would give anything to be just like lord illingworth  mrs arbuthnot  i would sooner see you dead  gerald  mother what is your objection to lord illingworth  tell me  tell me right out  what is it  mrs arbuthnot  he is a bad man  gerald  in what way bad  i dont understand what you mean  mrs arbuthnot  i will tell you  gerald  i suppose you think him bad because he doesnt believe the same things as you do  well men are different from women mother  it is natural that they should have different views  mrs arbuthnot  it is not what lord illingworth believes or what he does not believe that makes him bad  it is what he is  gerald  mother is it something you know of him  something you actually know  mrs arbuthnot  it is something i know  gerald  something you are quite sure of  mrs arbuthnot  quite sure of  gerald  how long have you known it  mrs arbuthnot  for twenty years  gerald  is it fair to go back twenty years in any mans career and what have you or i to do with lord illingworths early life what business is it of ours  mrs arbuthnot  what this man has been he is now and will be always  gerald  mother tell me what lord illingworth did  if he did anything shameful i will not go away with him  surely you know me well enough for that  mrs arbuthnot  gerald come near to me  quite close to me as you used to do when you were a little boy when you were mothers own boy  gerald sits down betide his mother  she runs her fingers through his hair and strokes his hands  gerald there was a girl once she was very young she was little over eighteen at the time  george harford  that was lord illingworths name then  george harford met her  she knew nothing about life  he  knew everything  he made this girl love him  he made her love him so much that she left her fathers house with him one morning  she loved him so much and he had promised to marry her  he had solemnly promised to marry her and she had believed him  she was very young and  and ignorant of what life really is  but he put the marriage off from week to week and month to month  she trusted in him all the while  she loved him  before her child was born  for she had a child  she implored him for the childs sake to marry her that the child might have a name that her sin might not be visited on the child who was innocent  he refused after the child was born she left him taking the child away and her life was ruined and her soul ruined and all that was sweet and good and pure in her ruined also  she suffered terribly  she suffers now  she will always suffer  for her there is no joy no peace no atonement  she is a woman who drags a chain like a guilty thing  she is a woman who wears a mask like a thing that is a leper  the fire cannot purify her  the waters cannot quench her anguish  nothing can heal her no anodyne can give her sleep no poppies forgetfulness  she is lost  she is a lost soul  that is why i call lord illingworth a bad man  that is why i dont want my boy to be with him  gerald  my dear mother it all sounds very tragic of course  but i dare say the girl was just as much to blame as lord illingworth was  after all would a really nice girl a girl with any nice feelings at all go away from her home with a man to whom she was not married and live with him as his wife  no nice girl would  mrs arbuthnot  after a pause  gerald i withdraw all my objections  you are at liberty to go away with lord illingworth when and where you choose  gerald  dear mother i knew you wouldnt stand in my way  you are the best woman god ever made  and as for lord illingworth i dont believe he is capable of anything infamous or base  i cant believe it of him  i cant  hester  outside  let me go  let me go  enter hester in terror and rushes over to gerald and flings herself in his arms  hester  oh save me  save me from him  gerald  from whom  hester  he has insulted me  horribly insulted me  save me  gerald  who  who has dared    lord illingworth enters at back of stage  hester breaks from geralds arms and points to him  gerald  he is quite beside himself with rage and indignation lord illingworth you have insulted the purest thing on gods earth a thing as pure as my own mother  you have insulted the woman i love most in the world with my own mother  as there is a god in heaven i will kill you  mrs arbuthnot  rushing across and catching hold of him  no no  gerald  thrusting her back  dont hold me mother  dont hold me  ill kill him  mrs arbuthnot  gerald  gerald  let me go i say  mrs arbuthnot  stop gerald stop  he is your own father  gerald clutches his mothers hands and looks into her face  she sinks slowly on the ground in shame  hester steals towards the door  lord illingworth frowns and bites his lip  after a time gerald raises his mother up puts his am round her and leads her from the room  act drop    fourth act    scene  sittingroom at mrs arbuthnots  large open french window at back looking on to garden  doors rc and lc  gerald arbuthnot writing at table  enter alice rc followed by lady hunstanton and mrs allonby  alice  lady hunstanton and mrs allonby  exit lc  lady hunstanton  good morning gerald  gerald  rising  good morning lady hunstanton  good morning mrs allonby  lady hunstanton  sitting down  we came to inquire for your dear mother gerald  i hope she is better  gerald  my mother has not come down yet lady hunstanton  lady  hunstanton  ah i am afraid the heat was too much for her last night  i think there must have been thunder in the air  or perhaps it was the music  music makes one feel so romantic  at least it always gets on ones nerves  mrs allonby  its the same thing nowadays  lady hunstanton  i am so glad i dont know what you mean dear  i am afraid you mean something wrong  ah i see youre examining mrs arbuthnots pretty room  isnt it nice and oldfashioned  mrs allonby  surveying the room through her lorgnette  it looks quite the happy english home  lady hunstanton  thats just the word dear that just describes it  one feels your mothers good influence in everything she has about her gerald  mrs allonby  lord illingworth says that all influence is bad but that a good influence is the worst in the world  lady hunstanton  when lord illingworth knows mrs arbuthnot better he will change his mind  i must certainly bring him here  mrs allonby  i should like to see lord illingworth in a happy english home  lady hunstanton  it would do him a great deal of good dear  most women in london nowadays seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but orchids foreigners and french novels  but here we have the room of a sweet saint  fresh natural flowers books that dont shock one pictures that one can look at without blushing  mrs allonby  but i like blushing  lady hunstanton  well there is a good deal to be said for blushing if one can do it at the proper moment  poor dear hunstanton used to tell me i didnt blush nearly often enough  but then he was so very particular  he wouldnt let me know any of his men friends except those who were over seventy like poor lord ashton who afterwards by the way was brought into the divorce court  a most unfortunate case  mrs allonby  i delight in men over seventy  they always offer one the devotion of a lifetime  i think seventy an ideal age for a man  lady hunstanton  she is quite incorrigible gerald isnt she bytheby gerald i hope your dear mother will come and see me more often now  you and lord illingworth start almost immediately dont you  gerald  i have given up my intention of being lord illingworths secretary  lady hunstanton  surely not gerald  it would be most unwise of you  what reason can you have  gerald  i dont think i should be suitable for the post  mrs allonby  i wish lord illingworth would ask me to be his secretary  but he says i am not serious enough  lady hunstanton  my dear you really mustnt talk like that in this house  mrs arbuthnot doesnt know anything about the wicked society in which we all live  she wont go into it  she is far too good  i consider it was a great honour her coming to me last night  it gave quite an atmosphere of respectability to the party  mrs allonby  ah that must have been what you thought was thunder in the air  lady hunstanton  my dear how can you say that  there is no resemblance between the two things at all  but really gerald what do you mean by not being suitable  gerald  lord illingworths views of life and mine are too different  lady hunstanton  but my dear gerald at your age you shouldnt have any views of life  they are quite out of place  you must be guided by others in this matter  lord illingworth has made you the most flattering offer and travelling with him you would see the world  as much of it at least as one should look at  under the best auspices possible and stay with all the right people which is so important at this solemn moment in your career  gerald  i dont want to see the world ive seen enough of it  mrs allonby  i hope you dont think you have exhausted life mr arbuthnot  when a man says that one knows that life has exhausted him  gerald  i dont wish to leave my mother  lady hunstanton  now gerald that is pure laziness on your part not leave your mother  if i were your mother i would insist on your going  enter alice lc  alice  mrs arbuthnots compliments my lady but she has a bad headache and cannot see any one this morning  exit rc  lady hunstanton  rising  a bad headache  i am so sorry perhaps youll bring her up to hunstanton this afternoon if she is better gerald  gerald  i am afraid not this afternoon lady hunstanton  lady hunstanton  well tomorrow then  ah if you had a father gerald he wouldnt let you waste your life here  he would send you off with lord illingworth at once  but mothers are so weak they give up to their sons in everything  we are all heart all heart  come dear i must call at the rectory and inquire for mrs daubeny who i am afraid is far from well  it is wonderful how the archdeacon bears up quite wonderful  he is the most sympathetic of husbands  quite a model  goodbye gerald give my fondest love to your mother  mrs allonby  goodbye mr arbuthnot  gerald  goodbye  exit lady hunstanton and mrs allonby  gerald sits down and reads over his letter  gerald  what name can i sign  i who have no right to any name signs name puts letter into envelope addresses it and is about to seal it when door lc opens and mrs arbuthnot enters  gerald lays down sealingwax  mother and son look at each other  lady hunstanton  through french window at the back  goodbye again gerald  we are taking the short cut across your pretty garden  now remember my advice to you  start at once with lord illingworth  mrs allonby  au revoir mr arbuthnot  mind you bring me back something nice from your travels  not an indian shawl  on no account an indian shawl  exeunt  gerald  mother i have just written to him  mrs arbuthnot  to whom  gerald  to my father  i have written to tell him to come here at four oclock this afternoon  mrs arbuthnot  he shall not come here  he shall not cross the threshold of my house  gerald  he must come  mrs arbuthnot  gerald if you are going away with lord illingworth go at once  go before it kills me but dont ask me to meet him  gerald  mother you dont understand  nothing in the world would induce me to go away with lord illingworth or to leave you surely you know me well enough for that  no i have written to him to say   mrs arbuthnot  what can you have to say to him  gerald  cant you guess mother what i have written in this letter  mrs arbuthnot  no  gerald  mother surely you can  think think what must be done now at once within the next few days  mrs arbuthnot  there is nothing to be done  gerald  i have written to lord illingworth to tell him that he must marry you  mrs arbuthnot  marry me  gerald  mother i will force him to do it  the wrong that has been done you must be repaired  atonement must be made  justice may be slow mother but it comes in the end  in a few days you shall be lord illingworths lawful wife  mrs arbuthnot  but gerald   gerald  i will insist upon his doing it  i will make him do it he will not dare to refuse  mrs arbuthnot  but gerald it is i who refuse  i will not marry lord illingworth  gerald  not marry him  mother  mrs arbuthnot  i will not marry him  gerald  but you dont understand it is for your sake i am talking not for mine  this marriage this necessary marriage this marriage which for obvious reasons must inevitably take place will not help me will not give me a name that will be really rightly mine to bear  but surely it will be something for you that you my mother should however late become the wife of the man who is my father  will not that be something  mrs arbuthnot  i will not marry him  gerald  mother you must  mrs arbuthnot  i will not  you talk of atonement for a wrong done  what atonement can be made to me  there is no atonement possible  i am disgraced he is not  that is all  it is the usual history of a man and a woman as it usually happens as it always happens  and the ending is the ordinary ending  the woman suffers  the man goes free  gerald  i dont know if that is the ordinary ending mother i hope it is not  but your life at any rate shall not end like that  the man shall make whatever reparation is possible  it is not enough  it does not wipe out the past i know that  but at least it makes the future better better for you mother  mrs arbuthnot  i refuse to marry lord illingworth  gerald  if he came to you himself and asked you to be his wife you would give him a different answer  remember he is my father  mrs arbuthnot  if he came himself which he will not do my answer would be the same  remember i am your mother  gerald  mother you make it terribly difficult for me by talking like that and i cant understand why you wont look at this matter from the right from the only proper standpoint  it is to take away the bitterness out of your life to take away the shadow that lies on your name that this marriage must take place  there is no alternative and after the marriage you and i can go away together but the marriage must take place first  it is a duty that you owe not merely to yourself but to all other women  yes to all the other women in the world lest he betray more  mrs arbuthnot  i owe nothing to other women  there is not one of them to help me  there is not one woman in the world to whom i could go for pity if i would take it or for sympathy if i could win it  women are hard on each other  that girl last night good though she is fled from the room as though i were a tainted thing she was right  i am a tainted thing  but my wrongs are my own and i will bear them alone  i must bear them alone  what have women who have not sinned to do with me or i with them  we do not understand each other  enter hester behind  gerald  i implore you to do what i ask you  mrs arbuthnot  what son has ever asked of his mother to make so hideous a sacrifice  none  gerald  what mother has ever refused to marry the father of her own child  none  mrs arbuthnot  let me be the first then  i will not do it  gerald  mother you believe in religion and you brought me up to believe in it also  well surely your religion the religion that you taught me when i was a boy mother must tell you that i am right  you know it you feel it  mrs arbuthnot  i do not know it  i do not feel it nor will i ever stand before gods altar and ask gods blessing on so hideous a mockery as a marriage between me and george harford  i will not say the words the church bids us to say  i will not say them  i dare not  how could i swear to love the man i loathe to honour him who wrought you dishonour to obey him who in his mastery made me to sin  no marriage is a sacrament for those who love each other  it is not for such as him or such as me  gerald to save you from the worlds sneers and taunts i have lied to the world  for twenty years i have lied to the world  i could not tell the world the truth  who can ever  but not for my own sake will i lie to god and in gods presence  no gerald no ceremony churchhallowed or statemade shall ever bind me to george harford  it may be that i am too bound to him already who robbing me yet left me richer so that in the mire of my life i found the pearl of price or what i thought would be so  gerald  i dont understand you now  mrs arbuthnot  men dont understand what mothers are  i am no different from other women except in the wrong done me and the wrong i did and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace  and yet to bear you i had to look on death  to nurture you i had to wrestle with it  death fought with me for you  all women have to fight with death to keep their children  death being childless wants our children from us  gerald when you were naked i clothed you when you were hungry i gave you food  night and day all that long winter i tended you  no office is too mean no care too lowly for the thing we women love  and oh how i loved you  not hannah samuel more  and you needed love for you were weakly and only love could have kept you alive  only love can keep any one alive and boys are careless often and without thinking give pain and we always fancy that when they come to mans estate and know us better they will repay us  but it is not so  the world draws them from our side and they make friends with whom they are happier than they are with us and have amusements from which we are barred and interests that are not ours and they are unjust to us often for when they find life bitter they blame us for it and when they find it sweet we do not taste its sweetness with them    you made many friends and went into their houses and were glad with them and i knowing my secret did not dare to follow but stayed at home and closed the door shut out the sun and sat in darkness what should i have done in honest households  my past was ever with me    and you thought i didnt care for the pleasant things of life  i tell you i longed for them but did not dare to touch them feeling i had no right  you thought i was happier working amongst the poor  that was my mission you imagined  it was not but where else was i to go  the sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is pure nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the kiss of sin  it was you i thought of all the time i gave to them the love you did not need lavished on them a love that was not theirs    and you thought i spent too much of my time in going to church and in church duties  but where else could i turn  gods house is the only house where sinners are made welcome and you were always in my heart gerald too much in my heart  for though day after day at morn or evensong i have knelt in gods house i have never repented of my sin  how could i repent of my sin when you my love were its fruit  even now that you are bitter to me i cannot repent  i do not  you are more to me than innocence  i would rather be your mother  oh much rather  than have been always pure    oh dont you see dont you understand  it is my dishonour that has made you so dear to me  it is my disgrace that has bound you so closely to me  it is the price i paid for you  the price of soul and body  that makes me love you as i do  oh dont ask me to do this horrible thing  child of my shame be still the child of my shame  gerald  mother i didnt know you loved me so much as that  and i will be a better son to you than i have been  and you and i must never leave each other    but mother    i cant help it    you must become my fathers wife  you must marry him  it is your duty  hester  running forwards and embracing mrs arbuthnot  no no you shall not  that would be real dishonour the first you have ever known  that would be real disgrace the first to touch you leave him and come with me  there are other countries than england    oh other countries over sea better wiser and less unjust lands  the world is very wide and very big  mrs arbuthnot  no not for me  for me the world is shrivelled to a palms breadth and where i walk there are thorns  hester  it shall not be so  we shall somewhere find green valleys and fresh waters and if we weep well we shall weep together have we not both loved him  gerald  hester  hester  waving him back  dont dont  you cannot love me at all unless you love her also  you cannot honour me unless shes holier to you  in her all womanhood is martyred  not she alone but all of us are stricken in her house  gerald  hester hester what shall i do  hester  do you respect the man who is your father  gerald  respect him  i despise him  he is infamous  hester  i thank you for saving me from him last night  gerald  ah that is nothing  i would die to save you  but you dont tell me what to do now  hester  have i not thanked you for saving me  gerald  but what should i do  hester  ask your own heart not mine  i never had a mother to save or shame  mrs arbuthnot  he is hard  he is hard  let me go away  gerald  rushes over and kneels down bedside his mother  mother forgive me i have been to blame  mrs arbuthnot  dont kiss my hands they are cold  my heart is cold something has broken it  hester  ah dont say that  hearts live by being wounded pleasure may turn a heart to stone riches may make it callous but sorrow  oh sorrow cannot break it  besides what sorrows have you now  why at this moment you are more dear to him than ever dear though you have been and oh how dear you have been always ah be kind to him  gerald  you are my mother and my father all in one  i need no second parent  it was for you i spoke for you alone  oh say something mother  have i but found one love to lose another dont tell me that  o mother you are cruel  gets up and flings himself sobbing on a sofa  mrs arbuthnot  to hester  but has he found indeed another love  hester  you know i have loved him always  mrs arbuthnot  but we are very poor  hester  who being loved is poor  oh no one  i hate my riches they are a burden  let him share it with me  mrs arbuthnot  but we are disgraced  we rank among the outcasts gerald is nameless  the sins of the parents should be visited on the children  it is gods law  hester  i was wrong  gods law is only love  mrs arbuthnot  rises and taking hester by the hand goes slowly over to where gerald is lying on the sofa with his head buried in his hands  she touches him and he looks up  gerald i cannot give you a father but i have brought you a wife  gerald  mother i am not worthy either of her or you  mrs arbuthnot  so she comes first you are worthy  and when you are away gerald    with    her  oh think of me sometimes dont forget me  and when you pray pray for me  we should pray when we are happiest and you will be happy gerald  hester  oh you dont think of leaving us  gerald  mother you wont leave us  mrs arbuthnot  i might bring shame upon you  gerald  mother  mrs arbuthnot  for a little then and if you let me near you always  hester  to mrs arbuthnot  come out with us to the garden  mrs arbuthnot  later on later on  exeunt hester and gerald mrs arbuthnot goes towards door lc   stops at lookingglass over mantelpiece and looks into it  enter alice rc  alice  a gentleman to see you maam  mrs arbuthnot  say i am not at home  show me the card  takes card from salver and looks at it  say i will not see him  lord illingworth enters  mrs arbuthnot sees him in the glass and starts but does not turn round  exit alice  what can you have to say to me today george harford  you can have nothing to say to me  you must leave this house  lord illingworth  rachel gerald knows everything about you and me now so some arrangement must be come to that will suit us all three  i assure you he will find in me the most charming and generous of fathers  mrs arbuthnot  my son may come in at any moment  i saved you last night  i may not be able to save you again  my son feels my dishonour strongly terribly strongly  i beg you to go  lord illingworth  sitting down  last night was excessively unfortunate  that silly puritan girl making a scene merely because i wanted to kiss her  what harm is there in a kiss  mrs arbuthnot  turning round  a kiss may ruin a human life george harford  i know that  i know that too well  lord illingworth  we wont discuss that at present  what is of importance today as yesterday is still our son  i am extremely fond of him as you know and odd though it may seem to you i admired his conduct last night immensely  he took up the cudgels for that pretty prude with wonderful promptitude  he is just what i should have liked a son of mine to be  except that no son of mine should ever take the side of the puritans that is always an error  now what i propose is this  mrs arbuthnot  lord illingworth no proposition of yours interests me  lord illingworth  according to our ridiculous english laws i cant legitimise gerald  but i can leave him my property illingworth is entailed of course but it is a tedious barrack of a place  he can have ashby which is much prettier harborough which has the best shooting in the north of england and the house in st james square  what more can a gentleman require in this world  mrs arbuthnot  nothing more i am quite sure  lord illingworth  as for a title a title is really rather a nuisance in these democratic days  as george harford i had everything i wanted  now i have merely everything that other people want which isnt nearly so pleasant  well my proposal is this  mrs arbuthnot  i told you i was not interested and i beg you to go  lord illingworth  the boy is to be with you for six months in the year and with me for the other six  that is perfectly fair is it not  you can have whatever allowance you like and live where you choose  as for your past no one knows anything about it except myself and gerald  there is the puritan of course the puritan in white muslin but she doesnt count  she couldnt tell the story without explaining that she objected to being kissed could she and all the women would think her a fool and the men think her a bore  and you need not be afraid that gerald wont be my heir  i neednt tell you i have not the slightest intention of marrying  mrs arbuthnot  you come too late  my son has no need of you you are not necessary  lord illingworth  what do you mean rachel  mrs arbuthnot  that you are not necessary to geralds career  he does not require you  lord illingworth  i do not understand you  mrs arbuthnot  look into the garden  lord illingworth rises and goes towards window  you had better not let them see you you bring unpleasant memories  lord illingworth looks out and starts  she loves him  they love each other  we are safe from you and we are going away  lord illingworth  where  mrs arbuthnot  we will not tell you and if you find us we will not know you  you seem surprised  what welcome would you get from the girl whose lips you tried to soil from the boy whose life you have shamed from the mother whose dishonour comes from you  lord illingworth  you have grown hard rachel  mrs arbuthnot  i was too weak once  it is well for me that i have changed  lord illingworth  i was very young at the time  we men know life too early  mrs arbuthnot  and we women know life too late  that is the difference between men and women  a pause  lord illingworth  rachel i want my son  my money may be of no use to him now  i may be of no use to him but i want my son bring us together rachel  you can do it if you choose  sees letter on table  mrs arbuthnot  there is no room in my boys life for you  he is not interested in you  lord illingworth  then why does he write to me  mrs arbuthnot  what do you mean  lord illingworth  what letter is this  takes up letter  mrs arbuthnot  that  is nothing  give it to me  lord illingworth  it is addressed to me  mrs arbuthnot  you are not to open it  i forbid you to open it  lord illingworth  and in geralds handwriting  mrs arbuthnot  it was not to have been sent  it is a letter he wrote to you this morning before he saw me  but he is sorry now he wrote it very sorry  you are not to open it  give it to me  lord illingworth  it belongs to me  opens it sits down and reads it slowly mrs arbuthnot watches him all the time  you have read this letter i suppose rachel  mrs arbuthnot  no  lord illingworth  you know what is in it  mrs arbuthnot  yes  lord illingworth  i dont admit for a moment that the boy is right in what he says  i dont admit that it is any duty of mine to marry you  i deny it entirely  but to get my son back i am ready  yes i am ready to marry you rachel  and to treat you always with the deference and respect due to my wife  i will marry you as soon as you choose  i give you my word of honour  mrs arbuthnot  you made that promise to me once before and broke it  lord illingworth  i will keep it now  and that will show you that i love my son at least as much as you love him  for when i marry you rachel there are some ambitions i shall have to surrender high ambitions too if any ambition is high  mrs arbuthnot  i decline to marry you lord illingworth  lord illingworth  are you serious  mrs arbuthnot  yes  lord illingworth  do tell me your reasons  they would interest me enormously  mrs arbuthnot  i have already explained them to my son  lord illingworth  i suppose they were intensely sentimental werent they  you women live by your emotions and for them  you have no philosophy of life  mrs arbuthnot  you are right  we women live by our emotions and for them  by our passions and for them if you will  i have two passions lord illingworth my love of him my hate of you  you cannot kill those  they feed each other  lord illingworth  what sort of love is that which needs to have hate as its brother  mrs arbuthnot  it is the sort of love i have for gerald  do you think that terrible  well it is terrible  all love is terrible all love is a tragedy  i loved you once lord illingworth  oh what a tragedy for a woman to have loved you  lord illingworth  so you really refuse to marry me  mrs arbuthnot  yes  lord illingworth  because you hate me  mrs arbuthnot  yes  lord illingworth  and does my son hate me as you do  mrs arbuthnot  no  lord illingworth  i am glad of that rachel  mrs arbuthnot  he merely despises you  lord illingworth  what a pity  what a pity for him i mean  mrs arbuthnot  dont be deceived george  children begin by loving their parents  after a time they judge them  rarely if ever do they forgive them  lord illingworth  reads letter over again very slowly  may i ask by what arguments you made the boy who wrote this letter this beautiful passionate letter believe that you should not marry his father the father of your own child  mrs arbuthnot  it was not i who made him see it  it was another  lord illingworth  what findesiecle person  mrs arbuthnot  the puritan lord illingworth  a pause  lord illingworth  winces then rises slowly and goes over to table where his hat and gloves are  mrs arbuthnot is standing close to the table  he picks up one of the gloves and begins pulling it on  there is not much then for me to do here rachel  mrs arbuthnot  nothing  lord illingworth  it is goodbye is it  mrs arbuthnot  for ever i hope this time lord illingworth  lord illingworth  how curious  at this moment you look exactly as you looked the night you left me twenty years ago  you have just the same expression in your mouth  upon my word rachel no woman ever loved me as you did  why you gave yourself to me like a flower to do anything i liked with  you were the prettiest of playthings the most fascinating of small romances    pulls out watch  quarter to two  must be strolling back to hunstanton dont suppose i shall see you there again  im sorry i am really  its been an amusing experience to have met amongst people of ones own rank and treated quite seriously too ones mistress and ones   mrs arbuthnot snatches up glove and strikes lord illingworth across the face with it  lord illingworth starts  he is dazed by the insult of his punishment  then he controls himself and goes to window and looks out at his son  sighs and leaves the room  mrs arbuthnot  falls sobbing on the sofa  he would have said it  he would have said it  enter gerald and hester from the garden  gerald  well dear mother  you never came out after all  so we have come in to fetch you  mother you have not been crying kneels down beside her  mrs arbuthnot  my boy  my boy  my boy  running her fingers through his hair  hester  coming over  but you have two children now  youll let me be your daughter  mrs arbuthnot  looking up  would you choose me for a mother  hester  you of all women i have ever known  they move towards the door leading into garden with their arms round each others waists  gerald goes to table lc for his hat on turning round he sees lord illingworths glove lying on the floor and picks it up  gerald  hallo mother whose glove is this  you have had a visitor  who was it  mrs arbuthnot  turning round  oh no one  no one in particular  a man of no importance  curtain
