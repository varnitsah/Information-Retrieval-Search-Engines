bolton   the gentleman connected with the press vii  familiar epistle from a parent to a child aged two years and two months    public life of mr tulrumbleonce mayor of mudfog    mudfog is a pleasant towna remarkably pleasant townsituated in a charming hollow by the side of a river from which river mudfog derives an agreeable scent of pitch tar coals and ropeyarn a roving population in oilskin hats a pretty steady influx of drunken bargemen and a great many other maritime advantages there is a good deal of water about mudfog and yet it is not exactly the sort of town for a wateringplace either  water is a perverse sort of element at the best of times and in mudfog it is particularly so  in winter it comes oozing down the streets and tumbling over the fieldsnay rushes into the very cellars and kitchens of the houses with a lavish prodigality that might well be dispensed with but in the hot summer weather it will dry up and turn green  and although green is a very good colour in its way especially in grass still it certainly is not becoming to water and it cannot be denied that the beauty of mudfog is rather impaired even by this trifling circumstance  mudfog is a healthy placevery healthydamp perhaps but none the worse for that its quite a mistake to suppose that damp is unwholesome  plants thrive best in damp situations and why shouldnt men  the inhabitants of mudfog are unanimous in asserting that there exists not a finer race of people on the face of the earth here we have an indisputable and veracious contradiction of the vulgar error at once  so admitting mudfog to be damp we distinctly state that it is salubrious  the town of mudfog is extremely picturesque  limehouse and ratcliff highway are both something like it but they give you a very faint idea of mudfog  there are a great many more public houses in mudfogmore than in ratcliff highway and limehouse put together  the public buildings too are very imposing  we consider the townhall one of the finest specimens of shed architecture extant  it is a combination of the pigsty and tea gardenbox orders and the simplicity of its design is of surpassing beauty  the idea of placing a large window on one side of the door and a small one on the other is particularly happy there is a fine old doric beauty too about the padlock and scraper which is strictly in keeping with the general effect  in this room do the mayor and corporation of mudfog assemble together in solemn council for the public weal  seated on the massive wooden benches which with the table in the centre form the only furniture of the whitewashed apartment the sage men of mudfog spend hour after hour in grave deliberation  here they settle at what hour of the night the publichouses shall be closed at what hour of the morning they shall be permitted to open how soon it shall be lawful for people to eat their dinner on church days and other great political questions and sometimes long after silence has fallen on the town and the distant lights from the shops and houses have ceased to twinkle like faroff stars to the sight of the boatmen on the river the illumination in the two unequalsized windows of the townhall warns the inhabitants of mudfog that its little body of legislators like a larger and betterknown body of the same genus a great deal more noisy and not a whit more profound are patriotically dozing away in company far into the night for their countrys good  among this knot of sage and learned men no one was so eminently distinguished during many years for the quiet modesty of his appearance and demeanour as nicholas tulrumble the wellknown coaldealer  however exciting the subject of discussion however animated the tone of the debate or however warm the personalities exchanged and even in mudfog we get personal sometimes nicholas tulrumble was always the same  to say truth nicholas being an industrious man and always up betimes was apt to fall asleep when a debate began and to remain asleep till it was over when he would wake up very much refreshed and give his vote with the greatest complacency  the fact was that nicholas tulrumble knowing that everybody there had made up his mind beforehand considered the talking as just a long botheration about nothing at all and to the present hour it remains a question whether on this point at all events nicholas tulrumble was not pretty near right  time which strews a mans head with silver sometimes fills his pockets with gold  as he gradually performed one good office for nicholas tulrumble he was obliging enough not to omit the other nicholas began life in a wooden tenement of four feet square with a capital of two and ninepence and a stock in trade of three bushels and ahalf of coals exclusive of the large lump which hung by way of signboard outside  then he enlarged the shed and kept a truck then he left the shed and the truck too and started a donkey and a mrs tulrumble then he moved again and set up a cart the cart was soon afterwards exchanged for a waggon and so he went on like his great predecessor whittingtononly without a cat for a partnerincreasing in wealth and fame until at last he gave up business altogether and retired with mrs tulrumble and family to mudfog hall which he had himself erected on something which he attempted to delude himself into the belief was a hill about a quarter of a mile distant from the town of mudfog  about this time it began to be murmured in mudfog that nicholas tulrumble was growing vain and haughty that prosperity and success had corrupted the simplicity of his manners and tainted the natural goodness of his heart in short that he was setting up for a public character and a great gentleman and affected to look down upon his old companions with compassion and contempt  whether these reports were at the time wellfounded or not certain it is that mrs tulrumble very shortly afterwards started a fourwheel chaise driven by a tall postilion in a yellow capthat mr tulrumble junior took to smoking cigars and calling the footman a fellerand that mr tulrumble from that time forth was no more seen in his old seat in the chimneycorner of the lightermans arms at night  this looked bad but more than this it began to be observed that mr nicholas tulrumble attended the corporation meetings more frequently than heretofore and he no longer went to sleep as he had done for so many years but propped his eyelids open with his two forefingers that he read the newspapers by himself at home and that he was in the habit of indulging abroad in distant and mysterious allusions to masses of people and the property of the country and productive power and the monied interest all of which denoted and proved that nicholas tulrumble was either mad or worse and it puzzled the good people of mudfog amazingly  at length about the middle of the month of october mr tulrumble and family went up to london the middle of october being as mrs tulrumble informed her acquaintance in mudfog the very height of the fashionable season  somehow or other just about this time despite the health preserving air of mudfog the mayor died  it was a most extraordinary circumstance he had lived in mudfog for eightyfive years  the corporation didnt understand it at all indeed it was with great difficulty that one old gentleman who was a great stickler for forms was dissuaded from proposing a vote of censure on such unaccountable conduct  strange as it was however die he did without taking the slightest notice of the corporation and the corporation were imperatively called upon to elect his successor  so they met for the purpose and being very full of nicholas tulrumble just then and nicholas tulrumble being a very important man they elected him and wrote off to london by the very next post to acquaint nicholas tulrumble with his new elevation  now it being november time and mr nicholas tulrumble being in the capital it fell out that he was present at the lord mayors show and dinner at sight of the glory and splendour whereof he mr tulrumble was greatly mortified inasmuch as the reflection would force itself on his mind that had he been born in london instead of in mudfog he might have been a lord mayor too and have patronized the judges and been affable to the lord chancellor and friendly with the premier and coldly condescending to the secretary to the treasury and have dined with a flag behind his back and done a great many other acts and deeds which unto lord mayors of london peculiarly appertain  the more he thought of the lord mayor the more enviable a personage he seemed  to be a king was all very well but what was the king to the lord mayor  when the king made a speech everybody knew it was somebody elses writing whereas here was the lord mayor talking away for half an hourall out of his own headamidst the enthusiastic applause of the whole company while it was notorious that the king might talk to his parliament till he was black in the face without getting so much as a single cheer  as all these reflections passed through the mind of mr nicholas tulrumble the lord mayor of london appeared to him the greatest sovereign on the face of the earth beating the emperor of russia all to nothing and leaving the great mogul immeasurably behind  mr nicholas tulrumble was pondering over these things and inwardly cursing the fate which had pitched his coalshed in mudfog when the letter of the corporation was put into his hand a crimson flush mantled over his face as he read it for visions of brightness were already dancing before his imagination  my dear said mr tulrumble to his wife they have elected me mayor of mudfog  loramussy said mrs tulrumble  why whats become of old sniggs  the late mr sniggs mrs tulrumble said mr tulrumble sharply for he by no means approved of the notion of unceremoniously designating a gentleman who filled the high office of mayor as old sniggsthe late mr sniggs mrs tulrumble is dead  the communication was very unexpected but mrs tulrumble only ejaculated loramussy once again as if a mayor were a mere ordinary christian at which mr tulrumble frowned gloomily  what a pity tant in london aint it said mrs tulrumble after a short pause what a pity tant in london where you might have had a show  i might have a show in mudfog if i thought proper i apprehend said mr tulrumble mysteriously  lor so you might i declare replied mrs tulrumble  and a good one too said mr tulrumble  delightful exclaimed mrs tulrumble  one which would rather astonish the ignorant people down there said mr tulrumble  it would kill them with envy said mrs tulrumble  so it was agreed that his majestys lieges in mudfog should be astonished with splendour and slaughtered with envy and that such a show should take place as had never been seen in that town or in any other town beforeno not even in london itself  on the very next day after the receipt of the letter down came the tall postilion in a postchaisenot upon one of the horses but insideactually inside the chaiseand driving up to the very door of the townhall where the corporation were assembled delivered a letter written by the lord knows who and signed by nicholas tulrumble in which nicholas said all through four sides of closelywritten giltedged hotpressed bath post letter paper that he responded to the call of his fellowtownsmen with feelings of heartfelt delight that he accepted the arduous office which their confidence had imposed upon him that they would never find him shrinking from the discharge of his duty that he would endeavour to execute his functions with all that dignity which their magnitude and importance demanded and a great deal more to the same effect  but even this was not all  the tall postilion produced from his righthand topboot a damp copy of that afternoons number of the county paper and there in large type running the whole length of the very first column was a long address from nicholas tulrumble to the inhabitants of mudfog in which he said that he cheerfully complied with their requisition and in short as if to prevent any mistake about the matter told them over again what a grand fellow he meant to be in very much the same terms as those in which he had already told them all about the matter in his letter  the corporation stared at one another very hard at all this and then looked as if for explanation to the tall postilion but as the tall postilion was intently contemplating the gold tassel on the top of his yellow cap and could have afforded no explanation whatever even if his thoughts had been entirely disengaged they contented themselves with coughing very dubiously and looking very grave  the tall postilion then delivered another letter in which nicholas tulrumble informed the corporation that he intended repairing to the townhall in grand state and gorgeous procession on the monday afternoon next ensuing  at this the corporation looked still more solemn but as the epistle wound up with a formal invitation to the whole body to dine with the mayor on that day at mudfog hall mudfog hill mudfog they began to see the fun of the thing directly and sent back their compliments and theyd be sure to come  now there happened to be in mudfog as somehow or other there does happen to be in almost every town in the british dominions and perhaps in foreign dominions toowe think it very likely but being no great traveller cannot distinctly saythere happened to be in mudfog a merrytempered pleasantfaced goodfornothing sort of vagabond with an invincible dislike to manual labour and an unconquerable attachment to strong beer and spirits whom everybody knew and nobody except his wife took the trouble to quarrel with who inherited from his ancestors the appellation of edward twigger and rejoiced in the sobriquet of bottlenosed ned he was drunk upon the average once a day and penitent upon an equally fair calculation once a month and when he was penitent he was invariably in the very last stage of maudlin intoxication  he was a ragged roving roaring kind of fellow with a burly form a sharp wit and a ready head and could turn his hand to anything when he chose to do it  he was by no means opposed to hard labour on principle for he would work away at a cricketmatch by the day togetherrunning and catching and batting and bowling and revelling in toil which would exhaust a galleyslave  he would have been invaluable to a fireoffice never was a man with such a natural taste for pumping engines running up ladders and throwing furniture out of twopairofstairs windows  nor was this the only element in which he was at home he was a humane society in himself a portable drag an animated lifepreserver and had saved more people in his time from drowning than the plymouth life boat or captain manbys apparatus  with all these qualifications notwithstanding his dissipation bottlenosed ned was a general favourite and the authorities of mudfog remembering his numerous services to the population allowed him in return to get drunk in his own way without the fear of stocks fine or imprisonment  he had a general licence and he showed his sense of the compliment by making the most of it  we have been thus particular in describing the character and avocations of bottlenosed ned because it enables us to introduce a fact politely without hauling it into the readers presence with indecent haste by the head and shoulders and brings us very naturally to relate that on the very same evening on which mr nicholas tulrumble and family returned to mudfog mr tulrumbles new secretary just imported from london with a pale face and light whiskers thrust his head down to the very bottom of his neckclothtie in at the taproom door of the lightermans arms and inquiring whether one ned twigger was luxuriating within announced himself as the bearer of a message from nicholas tulrumble esquire requiring mr twiggers immediate attendance at the hall on private and particular business  it being by no means mr twiggers interest to affront the mayor he rose from the fireplace with a slight sigh and followed the lightwhiskered secretary through the dirt and wet of mudfog streets up to mudfog hall without further ado  mr nicholas tulrumble was seated in a small cavern with a skylight which he called his library sketching out a plan of the procession on a large sheet of paper and into the cavern the secretary ushered ned twigger  well twigger said nicholas tulrumble condescendingly  there was a time when twigger would have replied well nick but that was in the days of the truck and a couple of years before the donkey so he only bowed  i want you to go into training twigger said mr tulrumble  what for sir inquired ned with a stare  hush hush twigger said the mayor  shut the door mr jennings  look here twigger  as the mayor said this he unlocked a high closet and disclosed a complete suit of brass armour of gigantic dimensions  i want you to wear this next monday twigger said the mayor  bless your heart and soul sir replied ned you might as well ask me to wear a seventyfour pounder or a castiron boiler  nonsense twigger nonsense said the mayor  i couldnt stand under it sir said twigger it would make mashed potatoes of me if i attempted it  pooh pooh twigger returned the mayor  i tell you i have seen it done with my own eyes in london and the man wasnt half such a man as you are either  i should as soon have thought of a mans wearing the case of an eightday clock to save his linen said twigger casting a look of apprehension at the brass suit  its the easiest thing in the world rejoined the mayor  its nothing said mr jennings  when youre used to it added ned  you do it by degrees said the mayor  you would begin with one piece tomorrow and two the next day and so on till you had got it all on  mr jennings give twigger a glass of rum  just try the breastplate twigger  stay take another glass of rum first help me to lift it mr jennings  stand firm twigger  thereit isnt half as heavy as it looks is it  twigger was a good strong stout fellow so after a great deal of staggering he managed to keep himself up under the breastplate and even contrived with the aid of another glass of rum to walk about in it and the gauntlets into the bargain  he made a trial of the helmet but was not equally successful inasmuch as he tipped over instantlyan accident which mr tulrumble clearly demonstrated to be occasioned by his not having a counteracting weight of brass on his legs  now wear that with grace and propriety on monday next said tulrumble and ill make your fortune  ill try what i can do sir said twigger  it must be kept a profound secret said tulrumble  of course sir replied twigger  and you must be sober said tulrumble perfectly sober  mr twigger at once solemnly pledged himself to be as sober as a judge and nicholas tulrumble was satisfied although had we been nicholas we should certainly have exacted some promise of a more specific nature inasmuch as having attended the mudfog assizes in the evening more than once we can solemnly testify to having seen judges with very strong symptoms of dinner under their wigs however thats neither here nor there  the next day and the day following and the day after that ned twigger was securely locked up in the small cavern with the sky light hard at work at the armour  with every additional piece he could manage to stand upright in he had an additional glass of rum and at last after many partial suffocations he contrived to get on the whole suit and to stagger up and down the room in it like an intoxicated effigy from westminster abbey  never was man so delighted as nicholas tulrumble never was woman so charmed as nicholas tulrumbles wife  here was a sight for the common people of mudfog  a live man in brass armour  why they would go wild with wonder  the daythe mondayarrived  if the morning had been made to order it couldnt have been better adapted to the purpose  they never showed a better fog in london on lord mayors day than enwrapped the town of mudfog on that eventful occasion  it had risen slowly and surely from the green and stagnant water with the first light of morning until it reached a little above the lamppost tops and there it had stopped with a sleepy sluggish obstinacy which bade defiance to the sun who had got up very bloodshot about the eyes as if he had been at a drinkingparty overnight and was doing his days work with the worst possible grace  the thick damp mist hung over the town like a huge gauze curtain  all was dim and dismal  the church steeples had bidden a temporary adieu to the world below and every object of lesser importancehouses barns hedges trees and bargeshad all taken the veil  the churchclock struck one  a cracked trumpet from the front garden of mudfog hall produced a feeble flourish as if some asthmatic person had coughed into it accidentally the gate flew open and out came a gentleman on a moistsugar coloured charger intended to represent a herald but bearing a much stronger resemblance to a courtcard on horseback  this was one of the circus people who always came down to mudfog at that time of the year and who had been engaged by nicholas tulrumble expressly for the occasion  there was the horse whisking his tail about balancing himself on his hindlegs and flourishing away with his forefeet in a manner which would have gone to the hearts and souls of any reasonable crowd  but a mudfog crowd never was a reasonable one and in all probability never will be  instead of scattering the very fog with their shouts as they ought most indubitably to have done and were fully intended to do by nicholas tulrumble they no sooner recognized the herald than they began to growl forth the most unqualified disapprobation at the bare notion of his riding like any other man  if he had come out on his head indeed or jumping through a hoop or flying through a redhot drum or even standing on one leg with his other foot in his mouth they might have had something to say to him but for a professional gentleman to sit astride in the saddle with his feet in the stirrups was rather too good a joke  so the herald was a decided failure and the crowd hooted with great energy as he pranced ingloriously away  on the procession came  we are afraid to say how many supernumeraries there were in striped shirts and black velvet caps to imitate the london watermen or how many base imitations of runningfootmen or how many banners which owing to the heaviness of the atmosphere could by no means be prevailed on to display their inscriptions  still less do we feel disposed to relate how the men who played the wind instruments looking up into the sky we mean the fog with musical fervour walked through pools of water and hillocks of mud till they covered the powdered heads of the runningfootmen aforesaid with splashes that looked curious but not ornamental or how the barrelorgan performer put on the wrong stop and played one tune while the band played another or how the horses being used to the arena and not to the streets would stand still and dance instead of going on and prancingall of which are matters which might be dilated upon to great advantage but which we have not the least intention of dilating upon notwithstanding  oh it was a grand and beautiful sight to behold a corporation in glass coaches provided at the sole cost and charge of nicholas tulrumble coming rolling along like a funeral out of mourning and to watch the attempts the corporation made to look great and solemn when nicholas tulrumble himself in the fourwheel chaise with the tall postilion rolled out after them with mr jennings on one side to look like a chaplain and a supernumerary on the other with an old lifeguardsmans sabre to imitate the sword bearer and to see the tears rolling down the faces of the mob as they screamed with merriment  this was beautiful and so was the appearance of mrs tulrumble and son as they bowed with grave dignity out of their coachwindow to all the dirty faces that were laughing around them  but it is not even with this that we have to do but with the sudden stopping of the procession at another blast of the trumpet whereat and whereupon a profound silence ensued and all eyes were turned towards mudfog hall in the confident anticipation of some new wonder  they wont laugh now mr jennings said nicholas tulrumble  i think not sir said mr jennings  see how eager they look said nicholas tulrumble  aha the laugh will be on our side now eh mr jennings  no doubt of that sir replied mr jennings and nicholas tulrumble in a state of pleasurable excitement stood up in the fourwheel chaise and telegraphed gratification to the mayoress behind  while all this was going forward ned twigger had descended into the kitchen of mudfog hall for the purpose of indulging the servants with a private view of the curiosity that was to burst upon the town and somehow or other the footman was so companionable and the housemaid so kind and the cook so friendly that he could not resist the offer of the firstmentioned to sit down and take somethingjust to drink success to master in  so down ned twigger sat himself in his brass livery on the top of the kitchentable and in a mug of something strong paid for by the unconscious nicholas tulrumble and provided by the companionable footman drank success to the mayor and his procession and as ned laid by his helmet to imbibe the something strong the companionable footman put it on his own head to the immeasurable and unrecordable delight of the cook and housemaid the companionable footman was very facetious to ned and ned was very gallant to the cook and housemaid by turns  they were all very cosy and comfortable and the something strong went briskly round  at last ned twigger was loudly called for by the procession people  and having had his helmet fixed on in a very complicated manner by the companionable footman and the kind housemaid and the friendly cook he walked gravely forth and appeared before the multitude  the crowd roaredit was not with wonder it was not with surprise it was most decidedly and unquestionably with laughter  what said mr tulrumble starting up in the fourwheel chaise laughing  if they laugh at a man in real brass armour theyd laugh when their own fathers were dying  why doesnt he go into his place mr jennings  whats he rolling down towards us for he has no business here  i am afraid sir faltered mr jennings  afraid of what sir said nicholas tulrumble looking up into the secretarys face  i am afraid hes drunk sir replied mr jennings  nicholas tulrumble took one look at the extraordinary figure that was bearing down upon them and then clasping his secretary by the arm uttered an audible groan in anguish of spirit  it is a melancholy fact that mr twigger having full licence to demand a single glass of rum on the putting on of every piece of the armour got by some means or other rather out of his calculation in the hurry and confusion of preparation and drank about four glasses to a piece instead of one not to mention the something strong which went on the top of it  whether the brass armour checked the natural flow of perspiration and thus prevented the spirit from evaporating we are not scientific enough to know but whatever the cause was mr twigger no sooner found himself outside the gate of mudfog hall than he also found himself in a very considerable state of intoxication and hence his extraordinary style of progressing  this was bad enough but as if fate and fortune had conspired against nicholas tulrumble mr twigger not having been penitent for a good calendar month took it into his head to be most especially and particularly sentimental just when his repentance could have been most conveniently dispensed with  immense tears were rolling down his cheeks and he was vainly endeavouring to conceal his grief by applying to his eyes a blue cotton pockethandkerchief with white spotsan article not strictly in keeping with a suit of armour some three hundred years old or thereabouts  twigger you villain said nicholas tulrumble quite forgetting his dignity go back  never said ned  im a miserable wretch  ill never leave you  the bystanders of course received this declaration with acclamations of thats right ned dont  i dont intend it said ned with all the obstinacy of a very tipsy man  im very unhappy  im the wretched father of an unfortunate family but i am very faithful sir  ill never leave you  having reiterated this obliging promise ned proceeded in broken words to harangue the crowd upon the number of years he had lived in mudfog the excessive respectability of his character and other topics of the like nature  here will anybody lead him away said nicholas  if theyll call on me afterwards ill reward them well  two or three men stepped forward with the view of bearing ned off when the secretary interposed  take care take care said mr jennings  i beg your pardon sir but theyd better not go too near him because if he falls over hell certainly crush somebody  at this hint the crowd retired on all sides to a very respectful distance and left ned like the duke of devonshire in a little circle of his own  but mr jennings said nicholas tulrumble hell be suffocated  im very sorry for it sir replied mr jennings but nobody can get that armour off without his own assistance  im quite certain of it from the way he put it on  here ned wept dolefully and shook his helmeted head in a manner that might have touched a heart of stone but the crowd had not hearts of stone and they laughed heartily  dear me mr jennings said nicholas turning pale at the possibility of neds being smothered in his antique costumedear me mr jennings can nothing be done with him  nothing at all replied ned nothing at all  gentlemen im an unhappy wretch  im a body gentlemen in a brass coffin  at this poetical idea of his own conjuring up ned cried so much that the people began to get sympathetic and to ask what nicholas tulrumble meant by putting a man into such a machine as that and one individual in a hairy waistcoat like the top of a trunk who had previously expressed his opinion that if ned hadnt been a poor man nicholas wouldnt have dared do it hinted at the propriety of breaking the fourwheel chaise or nicholass head or both which last compound proposition the crowd seemed to consider a very good notion  it was not acted upon however for it had hardly been broached when ned twiggers wife made her appearance abruptly in the little circle before noticed and ned no sooner caught a glimpse of her face and form than from the mere force of habit he set off towards his home just as fast as his legs could carry him and that was not very quick in the present instance either for however ready they might have been to carry him they couldnt get on very well under the brass armour  so mrs twigger had plenty of time to denounce nicholas tulrumble to his face  to express her opinion that he was a decided monster and to intimate that if her illused husband sustained any personal damage from the brass armour she would have the law of nicholas tulrumble for manslaughter  when she had said all this with due vehemence she posted after ned who was dragging himself along as best he could and deploring his unhappiness in most dismal tones  what a wailing and screaming neds children raised when he got home at last  mrs twigger tried to undo the armour first in one place and then in another but she couldnt manage it so she tumbled ned into bed helmet armour gauntlets and all  such a creaking as the bedstead made under neds weight in his new suit it didnt break down though and there ned lay like the anonymous vessel in the bay of biscay till next day drinking barleywater and looking miserable  and every time he groaned his good lady said it served him right which was all the consolation ned twigger got  nicholas tulrumble and the gorgeous procession went on together to the townhall amid the hisses and groans of all the spectators who had suddenly taken it into their heads to consider poor ned a martyr  nicholas was formally installed in his new office in acknowledgment of which ceremony he delivered himself of a speech composed by the secretary which was very long and no doubt very good only the noise of the people outside prevented anybody from hearing it but nicholas tulrumble himself  after which the procession got back to mudfog hall any how it could and nicholas and the corporation sat down to dinner  but the dinner was flat and nicholas was disappointed  they were such dull sleepy old fellows that corporation  nicholas made quite as long speeches as the lord mayor of london had done nay he said the very same things that the lord mayor of london had said and the deuce a cheer the corporation gave him  there was only one man in the party who was thoroughly awake and he was insolent and called him nick  nick  what would be the consequence thought nicholas of anybody presuming to call the lord mayor of london nick  he should like to know what the swordbearer would say to that or the recorder or the toast master or any other of the great officers of the city  theyd nick him  but these were not the worst of nicholas tulrumbles doings  if they had been he might have remained a mayor to this day and have talked till he lost his voice  he contracted a relish for statistics and got philosophical and the statistics and the philosophy together led him into an act which increased his unpopularity and hastened his downfall  at the very end of the mudfog highstreet and abutting on the riverside stands the jolly boatmen an oldfashioned lowroofed baywindowed house with a bar kitchen and taproom all in one and a large fireplace with a kettle to correspond round which the working men have congregated time out of mind on a winters night refreshed by draughts of good strong beer and cheered by the sounds of a fiddle and tambourine  the jolly boatmen having been duly licensed by the mayor and corporation to scrape the fiddle and thumb the tambourine from time whereof the memory of the oldest inhabitants goeth not to the contrary  now nicholas tulrumble had been reading pamphlets on crime and parliamentary reportsor had made the secretary read them to him which is the same thing in effectand he at once perceived that this fiddle and tambourine must have done more to demoralize mudfog than any other operating causes that ingenuity could imagine  so he read up for the subject and determined to come out on the corporation with a burst the very next time the licence was applied for  the licensing day came and the redfaced landlord of the jolly boatmen walked into the townhall looking as jolly as need be having actually put on an extra fiddle for that night to commemorate the anniversary of the jolly boatmens music licence it was applied for in due form and was just about to be granted as a matter of course when up rose nicholas tulrumble and drowned the astonished corporation in a torrent of eloquence  he descanted in glowing terms upon the increasing depravity of his native town of mudfog and the excesses committed by its population  then he related how shocked he had been to see barrels of beer sliding down into the cellar of the jolly boatmen week after week and how he had sat at a window opposite the jolly boatmen for two days together to count the people who went in for beer between the hours of twelve and one oclock alonewhich bythebye was the time at which the great majority of the mudfog people dined  then he went on to state how the number of people who came out with beerjugs averaged twentyone in five minutes which being multiplied by twelve gave two hundred and fiftytwo people with beerjugs in an hour and multiplied again by fifteen the number of hours during which the house was open daily yielded three thousand seven hundred and eighty people with beerjugs per day or twentysix thousand four hundred and sixty people with beerjugs per week  then he proceeded to show that a tambourine and moral degradation were synonymous terms and a fiddle and vicious propensities wholly inseparable  all these arguments he strengthened and demonstrated by frequent references to a large book with a blue cover and sundry quotations from the middlesex magistrates and in the end the corporation who were posed with the figures and sleepy with the speech and sadly in want of dinner into the bargain yielded the palm to nicholas tulrumble and refused the music licence to the jolly boatmen  but although nicholas triumphed his triumph was short  he carried on the war against beerjugs and fiddles forgetting the time when he was glad to drink out of the one and to dance to the other till the people hated and his old friends shunned him  he grew tired of the lonely magnificence of mudfog hall and his heart yearned towards the lightermans arms  he wished he had never set up as a public man and sighed for the good old times of the coal shop and the chimney corner  at length old nicholas being thoroughly miserable took heart of grace paid the secretary a quarters wages in advance and packed him off to london by the next coach  having taken this step he put his hat on his head and his pride in his pocket and walked down to the old room at the lightermans arms  there were only two of the old fellows there and they looked coldly on nicholas as he proffered his hand  are you going to put down pipes mr tulrumble said one  or trace the progress of crime to bacca growled another  neither replied nicholas tulrumble shaking hands with them both whether they would or not  ive come down to say that im very sorry for having made a fool of myself and that i hope youll give me up the old chair again  the old fellows opened their eyes and three or four more old fellows opened the door to whom nicholas with tears in his eyes thrust out his hand too and told the same story  they raised a shout of joy that made the bells in the ancient churchtower vibrate again and wheeling the old chair into the warm corner thrust old nicholas down into it and ordered in the very largest sized bowl of hot punch with an unlimited number of pipes directly  the next day the jolly boatmen got the licence and the next night old nicholas and ned twiggers wife led off a dance to the music of the fiddle and tambourine the tone of which seemed mightily improved by a little rest for they never had played so merrily before  ned twigger was in the very height of his glory and he danced hornpipes and balanced chairs on his chin and straws on his nose till the whole company including the corporation were in raptures of admiration at the brilliancy of his acquirements  mr tulrumble junior couldnt make up his mind to be anything but magnificent so he went up to london and drew bills on his father and when he had overdrawn and got into debt he grew penitent and came home again  as to old nicholas he kept his word and having had six weeks of public life never tried it any more  he went to sleep in the townhall at the very next meeting and in full proof of his sincerity has requested us to write this faithful narrative  we wish it could have the effect of reminding the tulrumbles of another sphere that puffedup conceit is not dignity and that snarling at the little pleasures they were once glad to enjoy because they would rather forget the times when they were of lower station renders them objects of contempt and ridicule  this is the first time we have published any of our gleanings from this particular source  perhaps at some future period we may venture to open the chronicles of mudfog    full report of the first meeting of the mudfog association for the advancement of everything    we have made the most unparalleled and extraordinary exertions to place before our readers a complete and accurate account of the proceedings at the late grand meeting of the mudfog association holden in the town of mudfog it affords us great happiness to lay the result before them in the shape of various communications received from our able talented and graphic correspondent expressly sent down for the purpose who has immortalized us himself mudfog and the association all at one and the same time we have been indeed for some days unable to determine who will transmit the greatest name to posterity ourselves who sent our correspondent down our correspondent who wrote an account of the matter or the association who gave our correspondent something to write about  we rather incline to the opinion that we are the greatest man of the party inasmuch as the notion of an exclusive and authentic report originated with us this may be prejudice  it may arise from a prepossession on our part in our own favour  be it so  we have no doubt that every gentleman concerned in this mighty assemblage is troubled with the same complaint in a greater or less degree and it is a consolation to us to know that we have at least this feeling in common with the great scientific stars the brilliant and extraordinary luminaries whose speculations we record  we give our correspondents letters in the order in which they reached us  any attempt at amalgamating them into one beautiful whole would only destroy that glowing tone that dash of wildness and rich vein of picturesque interest which pervade them throughout  mudfog monday night seven oclock  we are in a state of great excitement here  nothing is spoken of but the approaching meeting of the association  the inndoors are thronged with waiters anxiously looking for the expected arrivals and the numerous bills which are wafered up in the windows of private houses intimating that there are beds to let within give the streets a very animated and cheerful appearance the wafers being of a great variety of colours and the monotony of printed inscriptions being relieved by every possible size and style of handwriting  it is confidently rumoured that professors snore doze and wheezy have engaged three beds and a sittingroom at the pig and tinderbox  i give you the rumour as it has reached me but i cannot as yet vouch for its accuracy  the moment i have been enabled to obtain any certain information upon this interesting point you may depend upon receiving it  halfpast seven  i have just returned from a personal interview with the landlord of the pig and tinderbox  he speaks confidently of the probability of professors snore doze and wheezy taking up their residence at his house during the sitting of the association but denies that the beds have been yet engaged in which representation he is confirmed by the chambermaida girl of artless manners and interesting appearance  the boots denies that it is at all likely that professors snore doze and wheezy will put up here but i have reason to believe that this man has been suborned by the proprietor of the original pig which is the opposition hotel amidst such conflicting testimony it is difficult to arrive at the real truth but you may depend upon receiving authentic information upon this point the moment the fact is ascertained  the excitement still continues  a boy fell through the window of the pastrycooks shop at the corner of the highstreet about half an hour ago which has occasioned much confusion  the general impression is that it was an accident  pray heaven it may prove so  tuesday noon  at an early hour this morning the bells of all the churches struck seven oclock the effect of which in the present lively state of the town was extremely singular  while i was at breakfast a yellow gig drawn by a dark grey horse with a patch of white over his right eyelid proceeded at a rapid pace in the direction of the original pig stables it is currently reported that this gentleman has arrived here for the purpose of attending the association and from what i have heard i consider it extremely probable although nothing decisive is yet known regarding him  you may conceive the anxiety with which we are all looking forward to the arrival of the four oclock coach this afternoon  notwithstanding the excited state of the populace no outrage has yet been committed owing to the admirable discipline and discretion of the police who are nowhere to be seen  a barrel organ is playing opposite my window and groups of people offering fish and vegetables for sale parade the streets  with these exceptions everything is quiet and i trust will continue so  five oclock  it is now ascertained beyond all doubt that professors snore doze and wheezy will not repair to the pig and tinderbox but have actually engaged apartments at the original pig  this intelligence is exclusive and i leave you and your readers to draw their own inferences from it  why professor wheezy of all people in the world should repair to the original pig in preference to the pig and tinderbox it is not easy to conceive  the professor is a man who should be above all such petty feelings  some people here openly impute treachery and a distinct breach of faith to professors snore and doze while others again are disposed to acquit them of any culpability in the transaction and to insinuate that the blame rests solely with professor wheezy  i own that i incline to the latter opinion and although it gives me great pain to speak in terms of censure or disapprobation of a man of such transcendent genius and acquirements still i am bound to say that if my suspicions be well founded and if all the reports which have reached my ears be true i really do not well know what to make of the matter  mr slug so celebrated for his statistical researches arrived this afternoon by the four oclock stage  his complexion is a dark purple and he has a habit of sighing constantly  he looked extremely well and appeared in high health and spirits  mr woodensconce also came down in the same conveyance  the distinguished gentleman was fast asleep on his arrival and i am informed by the guard that he had been so the whole way  he was no doubt preparing for his approaching fatigues but what gigantic visions must those be that flit through the brain of such a man when his body is in a state of torpidity  the influx of visitors increases every moment  i am told i know not how truly that two postchaises have arrived at the original pig within the last halfhour and i myself observed a wheelbarrow containing three carpet bags and a bundle entering the yard of the pig and tinderbox no longer ago than five minutes since  the people are still quietly pursuing their ordinary occupations but there is a wildness in their eyes and an unwonted rigidity in the muscles of their countenances which shows to the observant spectator that their expectations are strained to the very utmost pitch  i fear unless some very extraordinary arrivals take place tonight that consequences may arise from this popular ferment which every man of sense and feeling would deplore  twenty minutes past six  i have just heard that the boy who fell through the pastrycooks window last night has died of the fright  he was suddenly called upon to pay three and sixpence for the damage done and his constitution it seems was not strong enough to bear up against the shock  the inquest it is said will be held tomorrow  threequarters part seven  professors muff and nogo have just driven up to the hotel door they at once ordered dinner with great condescension  we are all very much delighted with the urbanity of their manners and the ease with which they adapt themselves to the forms and ceremonies of ordinary life  immediately on their arrival they sent for the head waiter and privately requested him to purchase a live dog as cheap a one as he could meet withand to send him up after dinner with a pieboard a knife and fork and a clean plate  it is conjectured that some experiments will be tried upon the dog to night if any particulars should transpire i will forward them by express  halfpast eight  the animal has been procured  he is a pugdog of rather intelligent appearance in good condition and with very short legs  he has been tied to a curtainpeg in a dark room and is howling dreadfully  ten minutes to nine  the dog has just been rung for  with an instinct which would appear almost the result of reason the sagacious animal seized the waiter by the calf of the leg when he approached to take him and made a desperate though ineffectual resistance  i have not been able to procure admission to the apartment occupied by the scientific gentlemen but judging from the sounds which reached my ears when i stood upon the landingplace outside the door just now i should be disposed to say that the dog had retreated growling beneath some article of furniture and was keeping the professors at bay  this conjecture is confirmed by the testimony of the ostler who after peeping through the keyhole assures me that he distinctly saw professor nogo on his knees holding forth a small bottle of prussic acid to which the animal who was crouched beneath an armchair obstinately declined to smell  you cannot imagine the feverish state of irritation we are in lest the interests of science should be sacrificed to the prejudices of a brute creature who is not endowed with sufficient sense to foresee the incalculable benefits which the whole human race may derive from so very slight a concession on his part  nine oclock  the dogs tail and ears have been sent downstairs to be washed from which circumstance we infer that the animal is no more  his forelegs have been delivered to the boots to be brushed which strengthens the supposition  half after ten  my feelings are so overpowered by what has taken place in the course of the last hour and a half that i have scarcely strength to detail the rapid succession of events which have quite bewildered all those who are cognizant of their occurrence  it appears that the pugdog mentioned in my last was surreptitiously obtainedstolen in factby some person attached to the stable department from an unmarried lady resident in this town  frantic on discovering the loss of her favourite the lady rushed distractedly into the street calling in the most heartrending and pathetic manner upon the passengers to restore her her augustus for so the deceased was named in affectionate remembrance of a former lover of his mistress to whom he bore a striking personal resemblance which renders the circumstances additionally affecting  i am not yet in a condition to inform you what circumstance induced the bereaved lady to direct her steps to the hotel which had witnessed the last struggles of her protege  i can only state that she arrived there at the very instant when his detached members were passing through the passage on a small tray her shrieks still reverberate in my ears  i grieve to say that the expressive features of professor muff were much scratched and lacerated by the injured lady and that professor nogo besides sustaining several severe bites has lost some handfuls of hair from the same cause  it must be some consolation to these gentlemen to know that their ardent attachment to scientific pursuits has alone occasioned these unpleasant consequences for which the sympathy of a grateful country will sufficiently reward them  the unfortunate lady remains at the pig and tinderbox and up to this time is reported in a very precarious state  i need scarcely tell you that this unlookedfor catastrophe has cast a damp and gloom upon us in the midst of our exhilaration natural in any case but greatly enhanced in this by the amiable qualities of the deceased animal who appears to have been much and deservedly respected by the whole of his acquaintance  twelve oclock  i take the last opportunity before sealing my parcel to inform you that the boy who fell through the pastrycooks window is not dead as was universally believed but alive and well  the report appears to have had its origin in his mysterious disappearance  he was found half an hour since on the premises of a sweetstuff maker where a raffle had been announced for a secondhand seal skin cap and a tambourine and wherea sufficient number of members not having been obtained at firsthe had patiently waited until the list was completed  this fortunate discovery has in some degree restored our gaiety and cheerfulness  it is proposed to get up a subscription for him without delay  everybody is nervously anxious to see what tomorrow will bring forth  if any one should arrive in the course of the night i have left strict directions to be called immediately  i should have sat up indeed but the agitating events of this day have been too much for me  no news yet of either of the professors snore doze or wheezy it is very strange  wednesday afternoon  all is now over and upon one point at least i am at length enabled to set the minds of your readers at rest  the three professors arrived at ten minutes after two oclock and instead of taking up their quarters at the original pig as it was universally understood in the course of yesterday that they would assuredly have done drove straight to the pig and tinderbox where they threw off the mask at once and openly announced their intention of remaining  professor wheezy may reconcile this very extraordinary conduct with his notions of fair and equitable dealing but i would recommend professor wheezy to be cautious how he presumes too far upon his wellearned reputation  how such a man as professor snore or which is still more extraordinary such an individual as professor doze can quietly allow himself to be mixed up with such proceedings as these you will naturally inquire  upon this head rumour is silent i have my speculations but forbear to give utterance to them just now  four oclock  the town is filling fast eighteenpence has been offered for a bed and refused  several gentlemen were under the necessity last night of sleeping in the brick fields and on the steps of doors for which they were taken before the magistrates in a body this morning and committed to prison as vagrants for various terms one of these persons i understand to be a highlyrespectable tinker of great practical skill who had forwarded a paper to the president of section d mechanical science on the construction of pipkins with copper bottoms and safetyvalues of which report speaks highly  the incarceration of this gentleman is greatly to be regretted as his absence will preclude any discussion on the subject  the bills are being taken down in all directions and lodgings are being secured on almost any terms  i have heard of fifteen shillings a week for two rooms exclusive of coals and attendance but i can scarcely believe it  the excitement is dreadful  i was informed this morning that the civil authorities apprehensive of some outbreak of popular feeling had commanded a recruiting sergeant and two corporals to be under arms and that with the view of not irritating the people unnecessarily by their presence they had been requested to take up their position before daybreak in a turnpike distant about a quarter of a mile from the town the vigour and promptness of these measures cannot be too highly extolled  intelligence has just been brought me that an elderly female in a state of inebriety has declared in the open street her intention to do for mr slug  some statistical returns compiled by that gentleman relative to the consumption of raw spirituous liquors in this place are supposed to be the cause of the wretchs animosity it is added that this declaration was loudly cheered by a crowd of persons who had assembled on the spot and that one man had the boldness to designate mr slug aloud by the opprobrious epithet of stickinthemud  it is earnestly to be hoped that now when the moment has arrived for their interference the magistrates will not shrink from the exercise of that power which is vested in them by the constitution of our common country  halfpast ten  the disturbance i am happy to inform you has been completely quelled and the ringleader taken into custody  she had a pail of cold water thrown over her previous to being locked up and expresses great contrition and uneasiness  we are all in a fever of anticipation about tomorrow but now that we are within a few hours of the meeting of the association and at last enjoy the proud consciousness of having its illustrious members amongst us i trust and hope everything may go off peaceably  i shall send you a full report of tomorrows proceedings by the night coach  eleven oclock  i open my letter to say that nothing whatever has occurred since i folded it up  thursday  the sun rose this morning at the usual hour  i did not observe anything particular in the aspect of the glorious planet except that he appeared to me it might have been a delusion of my heightened fancy to shine with more than common brilliancy and to shed a refulgent lustre upon the town such as i had never observed before  this is the more extraordinary as the sky was perfectly cloudless and the atmosphere peculiarly fine  at halfpast nine oclock the general committee assembled with the last years president in the chair  the report of the council was read and one passage which stated that the council had corresponded with no less than three thousand five hundred and seventyone persons all of whom paid their own postage on no fewer than seven thousand two hundred and fortythree topics was received with a degree of enthusiasm which no efforts could suppress  the various committees and sections having been appointed and the more formal business transacted the great proceedings of the meeting commenced at eleven oclock precisely  i had the happiness of occupying a most eligible position at that time in   section azoology and botany great room pig and tinderbox   presidentprofessor snore  vicepresidentsprofessors doze and wheezy  the scene at this moment was particularly striking  the sun streamed through the windows of the apartments and tinted the whole scene with its brilliant rays bringing out in strong relief the noble visages of the professors and scientific gentlemen who some with bald heads some with red heads some with brown heads some with grey heads some with black heads some with block heads presented a coup doeil which no eyewitness will readily forget in front of these gentlemen were papers and inkstands and round the room on elevated benches extending as far as the forms could reach were assembled a brilliant concourse of those lovely and elegant women for which mudfog is justly acknowledged to be without a rival in the whole world  the contrast between their fair faces and the dark coats and trousers of the scientific gentlemen i shall never cease to remember while memory holds her seat  time having been allowed for a slight confusion occasioned by the falling down of the greater part of the platforms to subside the president called on one of the secretaries to read a communication entitled some remarks on the industrious fleas with considerations on the importance of establishing infantschools among that numerous class of society of directing their industry to useful and practical ends and of applying the surplus fruits thereof towards providing for them a comfortable and respectable maintenance in their old age  the author stated that having long turned his attention to the moral and social condition of these interesting animals he had been induced to visit an exhibition in regentstreet london commonly known by the designation of the industrious fleas  he had there seen many fleas occupied certainly in various pursuits and avocations but occupied he was bound to add in a manner which no man of wellregulated mind could fail to regard with sorrow and regret  one flea reduced to the level of a beast of burden was drawing about a miniature gig containing a particularly small effigy of his grace the duke of wellington while another was staggering beneath the weight of a golden model of his great adversary napoleon bonaparte  some brought up as mountebanks and balletdancers were performing a figuredance he regretted to observe that of the fleas so employed several were females others were in training in a small cardboard box for pedestriansmere sporting charactersand two were actually engaged in the coldblooded and barbarous occupation of duelling a pursuit from which humanity recoiled with horror and disgust  he suggested that measures should be immediately taken to employ the labour of these fleas as part and parcel of the productive power of the country which might easily be done by the establishment among them of infant schools and houses of industry in which a system of virtuous education based upon sound principles should be observed and moral precepts strictly inculcated  he proposed that every flea who presumed to exhibit for hire music or dancing or any species of theatrical entertainment without a licence should be considered a vagabond and treated accordingly in which respect he only placed him upon a level with the rest of mankind  he would further suggest that their labour should be placed under the control and regulation of the state who should set apart from the profits a fund for the support of superannuated or disabled fleas their widows and orphans  with this view he proposed that liberal premiums should be offered for the three best designs for a general almshouse from whichas insect architecture was well known to be in a very advanced and perfect statewe might possibly derive many valuable hints for the improvement of our metropolitan universities national galleries and other public edifices  the president wished to be informed how the ingenious gentleman proposed to open a communication with fleas generally in the first instance so that they might be thoroughly imbued with a sense of the advantages they must necessarily derive from changing their mode of life and applying themselves to honest labour  this appeared to him the only difficulty  the author submitted that this difficulty was easily overcome or rather that there was no difficulty at all in the case  obviously the course to be pursued if her majestys government could be prevailed upon to take up the plan would be to secure at a remunerative salary the individual to whom he had alluded as presiding over the exhibition in regentstreet at the period of his visit  that gentleman would at once be able to put himself in communication with the mass of the fleas and to instruct them in pursuance of some general plan of education to be sanctioned by parliament until such time as the more intelligent among them were advanced enough to officiate as teachers to the rest  the president and several members of the section highly complimented the author of the paper last read on his most ingenious and important treatise  it was determined that the subject should be recommended to the immediate consideration of the council  mr wigsby produced a cauliflower somewhat larger than a chaise umbrella which had been raised by no other artificial means than the simple application of highly carbonated sodawater as manure he explained that by scooping out the head which would afford a new and delicious species of nourishment for the poor a parachute in principle something similar to that constructed by m garnerin was at once obtained the stalk of course being kept downwards  he added that he was perfectly willing to make a descent from a height of not less than three miles and a quarter and had in fact already proposed the same to the proprietors of vauxhall gardens who in the handsomest manner at once consented to his wishes and appointed an early day next summer for the undertaking merely stipulating that the rim of the cauliflower should be previously broken in three or four places to ensure the safety of the descent  the president congratulated the public on the grand gala in store for them and warmly eulogised the proprietors of the establishment alluded to for their love of science and regard for the safety of human life both of which did them the highest honour  a member wished to know how many thousand additional lamps the royal property would be illuminated with on the night after the descent  mr wigsby replied that the point was not yet finally decided but he believed it was proposed over and above the ordinary illuminations to exhibit in various devices eight millions and a half of additional lamps  the member expressed himself much gratified with this announcement  mr blunderum delighted the section with a most interesting and valuable paper on the last moments of the learned pig which produced a very strong impression on the assembly the account being compiled from the personal recollections of his favourite attendant  the account stated in the most emphatic terms that the animals name was not toby but solomon and distinctly proved that he could have no near relatives in the profession as many designing persons had falsely stated inasmuch as his father mother brothers and sisters had all fallen victims to the butcher at different times  an uncle of his indeed had with very great labour been traced to a sty in somers town but as he was in a very infirm state at the time being afflicted with measles and shortly afterwards disappeared there appeared too much reason to conjecture that he had been converted into sausages  the disorder of the learned pig was originally a severe cold which being aggravated by excessive trough indulgence finally settled upon the lungs and terminated in a general decay of the constitution  a melancholy instance of a presentiment entertained by the animal of his approaching dissolution was recorded  after gratifying a numerous and fashionable company with his performances in which no falling off whatever was visible he fixed his eyes on the biographer and turning to the watch which lay on the floor and on which he was accustomed to point out the hour deliberately passed his snout twice round the dial  in precisely fourand twenty hours from that time he had ceased to exist  professor wheezy inquired whether previous to his demise the animal had expressed by signs or otherwise any wishes regarding the disposal of his little property  mr blunderum replied that when the biographer took up the pack of cards at the conclusion of the performance the animal grunted several times in a significant manner and nodding his head as he was accustomed to do when gratified  from these gestures it was understood that he wished the attendant to keep the cards which he had ever since done  he had not expressed any wish relative to his watch which had accordingly been pawned by the same individual  the president wished to know whether any member of the section had ever seen or conversed with the pigfaced lady who was reported to have worn a black velvet mask and to have taken her meals from a golden trough  after some hesitation a member replied that the pigfaced lady was his motherinlaw and that he trusted the president would not violate the sanctity of private life  the president begged pardon  he had considered the pigfaced lady a public character  would the honourable member object to state with a view to the advancement of science whether she was in any way connected with the learned pig  the member replied in the same low tone that as the question appeared to involve a suspicion that the learned pig might be his halfbrother he must decline answering it   section banatomy and medicine coachhouse pig and tinderbox   presidentdr toorell  vicepresidentsprofessors muff and nogo  dr kutankumagen of moscow read to the section a report of a case which had occurred within his own practice strikingly illustrative of the power of medicine as exemplified in his successful treatment of a virulent disorder  he had been called in to visit the patient on the 1st of april 1837  he was then labouring under symptoms peculiarly alarming to any medical man  his frame was stout and muscular his step firm and elastic his cheeks plump and red his voice loud his appetite good his pulse full and round he was in the constant habit of eating three meals per diem and of drinking at least one bottle of wine and one glass of spirituous liquors diluted with water in the course of the fourandtwenty hours  he laughed constantly and in so hearty a manner that it was terrible to hear him  by dint of powerful medicine low diet and bleeding the symptoms in the course of three days perceptibly decreased  a rigid perseverance in the same course of treatment for only one week accompanied with small doses of watergruel weak broth and barleywater led to their entire disappearance in the course of a month he was sufficiently recovered to be carried downstairs by two nurses and to enjoy an airing in a close carriage supported by soft pillows  at the present moment he was restored so far as to walk about with the slight assistance of a crutch and a boy  it would perhaps be gratifying to the section to learn that he ate little drank little slept little and was never heard to laugh by any accident whatever  dr w r fee in complimenting the honourable member upon the triumphant cure he had effected begged to ask whether the patient still bled freely  dr kutankumagen replied in the affirmative  dr w r feeand you found that he bled freely during the whole course of the disorder  dr kutankumagenoh dear yes most freely  dr neeshawts supposed that if the patient had not submitted to be bled with great readiness and perseverance so extraordinary a cure could never in fact have been accomplished  dr kutankumagen rejoined certainly not  mr knight bell mrcs exhibited a wax preparation of the interior of a gentleman who in early life had inadvertently swallowed a doorkey  it was a curious fact that a medical student of dissipated habits being present at the post mortem examination found means to escape unobserved from the room with that portion of the coats of the stomach upon which an exact model of the instrument was distinctly impressed with which he hastened to a locksmith of doubtful character who made a new key from the pattern so shown to him  with this key the medical student entered the house of the deceased gentleman and committed a burglary to a large amount for which he was subsequently tried and executed  the president wished to know what became of the original key after the lapse of years  mr knight bell replied that the gentleman was always much accustomed to punch and it was supposed the acid had gradually devoured it  dr neeshawts and several of the members were of opinion that the key must have lain very cold and heavy upon the gentlemans stomach  mr knight bell believed it did at first  it was worthy of remark perhaps that for some years the gentleman was troubled with a nightmare under the influence of which he always imagined himself a winecellar door  professor muff related a very extraordinary and convincing proof of the wonderful efficacy of the system of infinitesimal doses which the section were doubtless aware was based upon the theory that the very minutest amount of any given drug properly dispersed through the human frame would be productive of precisely the same result as a very large dose administered in the usual manner thus the fortieth part of a grain of calomel was supposed to be equal to a fivegrain calomel pill and so on in proportion throughout the whole range of medicine  he had tried the experiment in a curious manner upon a publican who had been brought into the hospital with a broken head and was cured upon the infinitesimal system in the incredibly short space of three months this man was a hard drinker  he professor muff had dispersed three drops of rum through a bucket of water and requested the man to drink the whole  what was the result  before he had drunk a quart he was in a state of beastly intoxication and five other men were made dead drunk with the remainder  the president wished to know whether an infinitesimal dose of sodawater would have recovered them  professor muff replied that the twentyfifth part of a teaspoonful properly administered to each patient would have sobered him immediately  the president remarked that this was a most important discovery and he hoped the lord mayor and court of aldermen would patronize it immediately  a member begged to be informed whether it would be possible to administersay the twentieth part of a grain of bread and cheese to all grownup paupers and the fortieth part to children with the same satisfying effect as their present allowance  professor muff was willing to stake his professional reputation on the perfect adequacy of such a quantity of food to the support of human lifein workhouses the addition of the fifteenth part of a grain of pudding twice a week would render it a high diet  professor nogo called the attention of the section to a very extraordinary case of animal magnetism  a private watchman being merely looked at by the operator from the opposite side of a wide street was at once observed to be in a very drowsy and languid state  he was followed to his box and being once slightly rubbed on the palms of the hands fell into a sound sleep in which he continued without intermission for ten hours    section cstatistics hayloft original pig  presidentmr woodensconce  vicepresidentsmr ledbrain and mr timbered  mr slug stated to the section the result of some calculations he had made with great difficulty and labour regarding the state of infant education among the middle classes of london  he found that within a circle of three miles from the elephant and castle the following were the names and numbers of childrens books principally in circulation   jack the giantkiller           7943 ditto and beanstalk             8621 ditto and eleven brothers        2845 ditto and jill                   1998 total                           21407   he found that the proportion of robinson crusoes to philip quarlls was as four and a half to one and that the preponderance of valentine and orsons over goody two shoeses was as three and an eighth of the former to half a one of the latter a comparison of seven champions with simple simons gave the same result  the ignorance that prevailed was lamentable  one child on being asked whether he would rather be saint george of england or a respectable tallowchandler instantly replied taint george of ingling  another a little boy of eight years old was found to be firmly impressed with a belief in the existence of dragons and openly stated that it was his intention when he grew up to rush forth sword in hand for the deliverance of captive princesses and the promiscuous slaughter of giants  not one child among the number interrogated had ever heard of mungo parksome inquiring whether he was at all connected with the black man that swept the crossing and others whether he was in any way related to the regents park  they had not the slightest conception of the commonest principles of mathematics and considered sindbad the sailor the most enterprising voyager that the world had ever produced  a member strongly deprecating the use of all the other books mentioned suggested that jack and jill might perhaps be exempted from the general censure inasmuch as the hero and heroine in the very outset of the tale were depicted as going up a hill to fetch a pail of water which was a laborious and useful occupation supposing the family linen was being washed for instance  mr slug feared that the moral effect of this passage was more than counterbalanced by another in a subsequent part of the poem in which very gross allusion was made to the mode in which the heroine was personally chastised by her mother   for laughing at jacks disaster   besides the whole work had this one great fault it was not true  the president complimented the honourable member on the excellent distinction he had drawn  several other members too dwelt upon the immense and urgent necessity of storing the minds of children with nothing but facts and figures which process the president very forcibly remarked had made them the section the men they were  mr slug then stated some curious calculations respecting the dogsmeat barrows of london  he found that the total number of small carts and barrows engaged in dispensing provision to the cats and dogs of the metropolis was one thousand seven hundred and fortythree  the average number of skewers delivered daily with the provender by each dogsmeat cart or barrow was thirtysix now multiplying the number of skewers so delivered by the number of barrows a total of sixtytwo thousand seven hundred and forty eight skewers daily would be obtained  allowing that of these sixtytwo thousand seven hundred and fortyeight skewers the odd two thousand seven hundred and fortyeight were accidentally devoured with the meat by the most voracious of the animals supplied it followed that sixty thousand skewers per day or the enormous number of twentyone millions nine hundred thousand skewers annually were wasted in the kennels and dustholes of london which if collected and warehoused would in ten years time afford a mass of timber more than sufficient for the construction of a firstrate vessel of war for the use of her majestys navy to be called the royal skewer and to become under that name the terror of all the enemies of this island  mr x ledbrain read a very ingenious communication from which it appeared that the total number of legs belonging to the manufacturing population of one great town in yorkshire was in round numbers forty thousand while the total number of chair and stool legs in their houses was only thirty thousand which upon the very favourable average of three legs to a seat yielded only ten thousand seats in all  from this calculation it would appear not taking wooden or cork legs into the account but allowing two legs to every personthat ten thousand individuals onehalf of the whole population were either destitute of any rest for their legs at all or passed the whole of their leisure time in sitting upon boxes   section dmechanical science coachhouse original pig   presidentmr carter  vicepresidentsmr truck and mr waghorn  professor queerspeck exhibited an elegant model of a portable railway neatly mounted in a green case for the waistcoat pocket by attaching this beautiful instrument to his boots any bank or publicoffice clerk could transport himself from his place of residence to his place of business at the easy rate of sixtyfive miles an hour which to gentlemen of sedentary pursuits would be an incalculable advantage  the president was desirous of knowing whether it was necessary to have a level surface on which the gentleman was to run  professor queerspeck explained that city gentlemen would run in trains being handcuffed together to prevent confusion or unpleasantness  for instance trains would start every morning at eight nine and ten oclock from camden town islington camberwell hackney and various other places in which city gentlemen are accustomed to reside  it would be necessary to have a level but he had provided for this difficulty by proposing that the best line that the circumstances would admit of should be taken through the sewers which undermine the streets of the metropolis and which well lighted by jets from the gas pipes which run immediately above them would form a pleasant and commodious arcade especially in wintertime when the inconvenient custom of carrying umbrellas now so general could be wholly dispensed with  in reply to another question professor queerspeck stated that no substitute for the purposes to which these arcades were at present devoted had yet occurred to him but that he hoped no fanciful objection on this head would be allowed to interfere with so great an undertaking  mr jobba produced a forcingmachine on a novel plan for bringing jointstock railway shares prematurely to a premium  the instrument was in the form of an elegant gilt weatherglass of most dazzling appearance and was worked behind by strings after the manner of a pantomime trick the strings being always pulled by the directors of the company to which the machine belonged  the quicksilver was so ingeniously placed that when the acting directors held shares in their pockets figures denoting very small expenses and very large returns appeared upon the glass but the moment the directors parted with these pieces of paper the estimate of needful expenditure suddenly increased itself to an immense extent while the statements of certain profits became reduced in the same proportion  mr jobba stated that the machine had been in constant requisition for some months past and he had never once known it to fail  a member expressed his opinion that it was extremely neat and pretty  he wished to know whether it was not liable to accidental derangement  mr jobba said that the whole machine was undoubtedly liable to be blown up but that was the only objection to it  professor nogo arrived from the anatomical section to exhibit a model of a safety fireescape which could be fixed at any time in less than half an hour and by means of which the youngest or most infirm persons successfully resisting the progress of the flames until it was quite ready could be preserved if they merely balanced themselves for a few minutes on the sill of their bedroom window and got into the escape without falling into the street the professor stated that the number of boys who had been rescued in the daytime by this machine from houses which were not on fire was almost incredible  not a conflagration had occurred in the whole of london for many months past to which the escape had not been carried on the very next day and put in action before a concourse of persons  the president inquired whether there was not some difficulty in ascertaining which was the top of the machine and which the bottom in cases of pressing emergency  professor nogo explained that of course it could not be expected to act quite as well when there was a fire as when there was not a fire but in the former case he thought it would be of equal service whether the top were up or down   with the last section our correspondent concludes his most able and faithful report which will never cease to reflect credit upon him for his scientific attainments and upon us for our enterprising spirit  it is needless to take a review of the subjects which have been discussed of the mode in which they have been examined of the great truths which they have elicited  they are now before the world and we leave them to read to consider and to profit  the place of meeting for next year has undergone discussion and has at length been decided regard being had to and evidence being taken upon the goodness of its wines the supply of its markets the hospitality of its inhabitants and the quality of its hotels we hope at this next meeting our correspondent may again be present and that we may be once more the means of placing his communications before the world  until that period we have been prevailed upon to allow this number of our miscellany to be retailed to the public or wholesaled to the trade without any advance upon our usual price  we have only to add that the committees are now broken up and that mudfog is once again restored to its accustomed tranquillity that professors and members have had balls and soirees and suppers and great mutual complimentations and have at length dispersed to their several homeswhither all good wishes and joys attend them until next year  signed boz    full report of the second meeting of the mudfog association for the advancement of everything    in october last we did ourselves the immortal credit of recording at an enormous expense and by dint of exertions unnpralleled in the history of periodical publication the proceedings of the mudfog association for the advancement of everything which in that month held its first great halfyearly meeting to the wonder and delight of the whole empire  we announced at the conclusion of that extraordinary and most remarkable report that when the second meeting of the society should take place we should be found again at our post renewing our gigantic and spirited endeavours and once more making the world ring with the accuracy authenticity immeasurable superiority and intense remarkability of our account of its proceedings  in redemption of this pledge we caused to be despatched per steam to oldcastle at which place this second meeting of the society was held on the 20th instant the same superhumanlyendowed gentleman who furnished the former report and whogifted by nature with transcendent abilities and furnished by us with a body of assistants scarcely inferior to himselfhas forwarded a series of letters which for faithfulness of description power of language fervour of thought happiness of expression and importance of subjectmatter have no equal in the epistolary literature of any age or country  we give this gentlemans correspondence entire and in the order in which it reached our office  saloon of steamer thursday night halfpast eight  when i left new burlington street this evening in the hackney cabriolet number four thousand two hundred and eightyfive i experienced sensations as novel as they were oppressive  a sense of the importance of the task i had undertaken a consciousness that i was leaving london and stranger still going somewhere else a feeling of loneliness and a sensation of jolting quite bewildered my thoughts and for a time rendered me even insensible to the presence of my carpetbag and hatbox  i shall ever feel grateful to the driver of a blackwall omnibus who by thrusting the pole of his vehicle through the small door of the cabriolet awakened me from a tumult of imaginings that are wholly indescribable  but of such materials is our imperfect nature composed  i am happy to say that i am the first passenger on board and shall thus be enabled to give you an account of all that happens in the order of its occurrence  the chimney is smoking a good deal and so are the crew and the captain i am informed is very drunk in a little house upon deck something like a black turnpike  i should infer from all i hear that he has got the steam up  you will readily guess with what feelings i have just made the discovery that my berth is in the same closet with those engaged by professor woodensconce mr slug and professor grime  professor woodensconce has taken the shelf above me and mr slug and professor grime the two shelves opposite  their luggage has already arrived  on mr slugs bed is a long tin tube of about three inches in diameter carefully closed at both ends  what can this contain  some powerful instrument of a new construction doubtless  ten minutes past nine  nobody has yet arrived nor has anything fresh come in my way except several joints of beef and mutton from which i conclude that a good plain dinner has been provided for tomorrow  there is a singular smell below which gave me some uneasiness at first but as the steward says it is always there and never goes away i am quite comfortable again  i learn from this man that the different sections will be distributed at the black boy and stomachache and the bootjack and countenance  if this intelligence be true and i have no reason to doubt it your readers will draw such conclusions as their different opinions may suggest  i write down these remarks as they occur to me or as the facts come to my knowledge in order that my first impressions may lose nothing of their original vividness  i shall despatch them in small packets as opportunities arise  half past nine  some dark object has just appeared upon the wharf  i think it is a travelling carriage  a quarter to ten  no it isnt  halfpast ten  the passengers are pouring in every instant  four omnibuses full have just arrived upon the wharf and all is bustle and activity the noise and confusion are very great  cloths are laid in the cabins and the steward is placing blue platesfull of knobs of cheese at equal distances down the centre of the tables  he drops a great many knobs but being used to it picks them up again with great dexterity and after wiping them on his sleeve throws them back into the plates  he is a young man of exceedingly prepossessing appearanceeither dirty or a mulatto but i think the former  an interesting old gentleman who came to the wharf in an omnibus has just quarrelled violently with the porters and is staggering towards the vessel with a large trunk in his arms  i trust and hope that he may reach it in safety but the board he has to cross is narrow and slippery  was that a splash  gracious powers  i have just returned from the deck  the trunk is standing upon the extreme brink of the wharf but the old gentleman is nowhere to be seen  the watchman is not sure whether he went down or not but promises to drag for him the first thing tomorrow morning  may his humane efforts prove successful  professor nogo has this moment arrived with his nightcap on under his hat  he has ordered a glass of cold brandy and water with a hard biscuit and a basin and has gone straight to bed  what can this mean  the three other scientific gentlemen to whom i have already alluded have come on board and have all tried their beds with the exception of professor woodensconce who sleeps in one of the top ones and cant get into it  mr slug who sleeps in the other top one is unable to get out of his and is to have his supper handed up by a boy  i have had the honour to introduce myself to these gentlemen and we have amicably arranged the order in which we shall retire to rest which it is necessary to agree upon because although the cabin is very comfortable there is not room for more than one gentleman to be out of bed at a time and even he must take his boots off in the passage  as i anticipated the knobs of cheese were provided for the passengers supper and are now in course of consumption  your readers will be surprised to hear that professor woodensconce has abstained from cheese for eight years although he takes butter in considerable quantities  professor grime having lost several teeth is unable i observe to eat his crusts without previously soaking them in his bottled porter  how interesting are these peculiarities  halfpast eleven  professors woodensconce and grime with a degree of good humour that delights us all have just arranged to toss for a bottle of mulled port  there has been some discussion whether the payment should be decided by the first toss or the best out of three eventually the latter course has been determined on  deeply do i wish that both gentlemen could win but that being impossible i own that my personal aspirations i speak as an individual and do not compromise either you or your readers by this expression of feeling are with professor woodensconce  i have backed that gentleman to the amount of eighteenpence  twenty minutes to twelve  professor grime has inadvertently tossed his halfcrown out of one of the cabinwindows and it has been arranged that the steward shall toss for him  bets are offered on any side to any amount but there are no takers  professor woodensconce has just called woman but the coin having lodged in a beam is a long time coming down again  the interest and suspense of this one moment are beyond anything that can be imagined  twelve oclock  the mulled port is smoking on the table before me and professor grime has won  tossing is a game of chance but on every ground whether of public or private character intellectual endowments or scientific attainments i cannot help expressing my opinion that professor woodensconce ought to have come off victorious  there is an exultation about professor grime incompatible i fear with true greatness  a quarter past twelve  professor grime continues to exult and to boast of his victory in no very measured terms observing that he always does win and that he knew it would be a head beforehand with many other remarks of a similar nature  surely this gentleman is not so lost to every feeling of decency and propriety as not to feel and know the superiority of professor woodensconce  is professor grime insane or does he wish to be reminded in plain language of his true position in society and the precise level of his acquirements and abilities  professor grime will do well to look to this  one oclock  i am writing in bed  the small cabin is illuminated by the feeble light of a flickering lamp suspended from the ceiling professor grime is lying on the opposite shelf on the broad of his back with his mouth wide open  the scene is indescribably solemn  the rippling of the tide the noise of the sailors feet overhead the gruff voices on the river the dogs on the shore the snoring of the passengers and a constant creaking of every plank in the vessel are the only sounds that meet the ear  with these exceptions all is profound silence  my curiosity has been within the last moment very much excited mr slug who lies above professor grime has cautiously withdrawn the curtains of his berth and after looking anxiously out as if to satisfy himself that his companions are asleep has taken up the tin tube of which i have before spoken and is regarding it with great interest  what rare mechanical combination can be contained in that mysterious case  it is evidently a profound secret to all  a quarter past one  the behaviour of mr slug grows more and more mysterious  he has unscrewed the top of the tube and now renews his observations upon his companions evidently to make sure that he is wholly unobserved  he is clearly on the eve of some great experiment pray heaven that it be not a dangerous one but the interests of science must be promoted and i am prepared for the worst  five minutes later  he has produced a large pair of scissors and drawn a roll of some substance not unlike parchment in appearance from the tin case the experiment is about to begin  i must strain my eyes to the utmost in the attempt to follow its minutest operation  twenty minutes before two  i have at length been enabled to ascertain that the tin tube contains a few yards of some celebrated plaster recommendedas i discover on regarding the label attentively through my eyeglass as a preservative against seasickness  mr slug has cut it up into small portions and is now sticking it over himself in every direction  three oclock  precisely a quarter of an hour ago we weighed anchor and the machinery was suddenly put in motion with a noise so appalling that professor woodensconce who had ascended to his berth by means of a platform of carpetbags arranged by himself on geometrical principals darted from his shelf head foremost and gaining his feet with all the rapidity of extreme terror ran wildly into the ladies cabin under the impression that we were sinking and uttering loud cries for aid  i am assured that the scene which ensued baffles all description  there were one hundred and forty seven ladies in their respective berths at the time  mr slug has remarked as an additional instance of the extreme ingenuity of the steamengine as applied to purposes of navigation that in whatever part of the vessel a passengers berth may be situated the machinery always appears to be exactly under his pillow  he intends stating this very beautiful though simple discovery to the association  halfpast ten  we are still in smooth water that is to say in as smooth water as a steamvessel ever can be for as professor woodensconce who has just woke up learnedly remarks another great point of ingenuity about a steamer is that it always carries a little storm with it  you can scarcely conceive how exciting the jerking pulsation of the ship becomes  it is a matter of positive difficulty to get to sleep  friday afternoon six oclock  i regret to inform you that mr slugs plaster has proved of no avail  he is in great agony but has applied several large additional pieces notwithstanding  how affecting is this extreme devotion to science and pursuit of knowledge under the most trying circumstances  we were extremely happy this morning and the breakfast was one of the most animated description  nothing unpleasant occurred until noon with the exception of doctor foxeys brown silk umbrella and white hat becoming entangled in the machinery while he was explaining to a knot of ladies the construction of the steam engine  i fear the gravy soup for lunch was injudicious  we lost a great many passengers almost immediately afterwards  halfpast six  i am again in bed  anything so heartrending as mr slugs sufferings it has never yet been my lot to witness  seven oclock  a messenger has just come down for a clean pockethandkerchief from professor woodensconces bag that unfortunate gentleman being quite unable to leave the deck and imploring constantly to be thrown overboard  from this man i understand that professor nogo though in a state of utter exhaustion clings feebly to the hard biscuit and cold brandy and water under the impression that they will yet restore him  such is the triumph of mind over matter  professor grime is in bed to all appearance quite well but he will eat and it is disagreeable to see him  has this gentleman no sympathy with the sufferings of his fellowcreatures  if he has on what principle can he call for muttonchopsand smile  black boy and stomachache oldcastle saturday noon  you will be happy to learn that i have at length arrived here in safety  the town is excessively crowded and all the private lodgings and hotels are filled with savans of both sexes  the tremendous assemblage of intellect that one encounters in every street is in the last degree overwhelming  notwithstanding the throng of people here i have been fortunate enough to meet with very comfortable accommodation on very reasonable terms having secured a sofa in the firstfloor passage at one guinea per night which includes permission to take my meals in the bar on condition that i walk about the streets at all other times to make room for other gentlemen similarly situated  i have been over the outhouses intended to be devoted to the reception of the various sections both here and at the bootjack and countenance and am much delighted with the arrangements  nothing can exceed the fresh appearance of the sawdust with which the floors are sprinkled  the forms are of unplaned deal and the general effect as you can well imagine is extremely beautiful  halfpast nine  the number and rapidity of the arrivals are quite bewildering within the last ten minutes a stagecoach has driven up to the door filled inside and out with distinguished characters comprising mr muddlebranes mr drawley professor muff mr x misty mr x x misty mr purblind professor rummun the honourable and reverend mr long eers professor john ketch sir william joltered doctor buffer mr smith of london mr brown of edinburgh sir hookham snivey and professor pumpkinskull the ten lastnamed gentlemen were wet through and looked extremely intelligent  sunday two oclock pm  the honourable and reverend mr long eers accompanied by sir william joltered walked and drove this morning  they accomplished the former feat in boots and the latter in a hired fly  this has naturally given rise to much discussion  i have just learnt that an interview has taken place at the boot jack and countenance between sowster the active and intelligent beadle of this place and professor pumpkinskull who as your readers are doubtless aware is an influential member of the council  i forbear to communicate any of the rumours to which this very extraordinary proceeding has given rise until i have seen sowster and endeavoured to ascertain the truth from him  halfpast six  i engaged a donkeychaise shortly after writing the above and proceeded at a brisk trot in the direction of sowsters residence passing through a beautiful expanse of country with red brick buildings on either side and stopping in the marketplace to observe the spot where mr kwakleys hat was blown off yesterday it is an uneven piece of paving but has certainly no appearance which would lead one to suppose that any such event had recently occurred there  from this point i proceededpassing the gasworks and tallowmeltersto a lane which had been pointed out to me as the beadles place of residence and before i had driven a dozen yards further i had the good fortune to meet sowster himself advancing towards me  sowster is a fat man with a more enlarged development of that peculiar conformation of countenance which is vulgarly termed a double chin than i remember to have ever seen before  he has also a very red nose which he attributes to a habit of early risingso red indeed that but for this explanation i should have supposed it to proceed from occasional inebriety  he informed me that he did not feel himself at liberty to relate what had passed between himself and professor pumpkinskull but had no objection to state that it was connected with a matter of police regulation and added with peculiar significance never wos sitch times  you will easily believe that this intelligence gave me considerable surprise not wholly unmixed with anxiety and that i lost no time in waiting on professor pumpkinskull and stating the object of my visit  after a few moments reflection the professor who i am bound to say behaved with the utmost politeness openly avowed i mark the passage in italics that he had requested sowster to attend on the monday morning at the boot jack and countenance to keep off the boys and that he had further desired that the underbeadle might be stationed with the same object at the black boy and stomachache  now i leave this unconstitutional proceeding to your comments and the consideration of your readers  i have yet to learn that a beadle without the precincts of a church churchyard or work house and acting otherwise than under the express orders of churchwardens and overseers in council assembled to enforce the law against people who come upon the parish and other offenders has any lawful authority whatever over the rising youth of this country  i have yet to learn that a beadle can be called out by any civilian to exercise a domination and despotism over the boys of britain  i have yet to learn that a beadle will be permitted by the commissioners of poor law regulation to wear out the soles and heels of his boots in illegal interference with the liberties of people not proved poor or otherwise criminal  i have yet to learn that a beadle has power to stop up the queens highway at his will and pleasure or that the whole width of the street is not free and open to any man boy or woman in existence up to the very walls of the housesay be they black boys and stomachaches or boot jacks and countenances i care not  nine oclock  i have procured a local artist to make a faithful sketch of the tyrant sowster which as he has acquired this infamous celebrity you will no doubt wish to have engraved for the purpose of presenting a copy with every copy of your next number  i enclose it  picture which cannot be reproduced  the underbeadle has consented to write his life but it is to be strictly anonymous  the accompanying likeness is of course from the life and complete in every respect  even if i had been totally ignorant of the mans real character and it had been placed before me without remark i should have shuddered involuntarily  there is an intense malignity of expression in the features and a baleful ferocity of purpose in the ruffians eye which appals and sickens  his whole air is rampant with cruelty nor is the stomach less characteristic of his demoniac propensities  monday  the great day has at length arrived  i have neither eyes nor ears nor pens nor ink nor paper for anything but the wonderful proceedings that have astounded my senses  let me collect my energies and proceed to the account   section azoology and botany front parlour black boy and stomachache   presidentsir william joltered  vicepresidentsmr muddlebranes and mr drawley  mr x x misty communicated some remarks on the disappearance of dancingbears from the streets of london with observations on the exhibition of monkeys as connected with barrelorgans  the writer had observed with feelings of the utmost pain and regret that some years ago a sudden and unaccountable change in the public taste took place with reference to itinerant bears who being discountenanced by the populace gradually fell off one by one from the streets of the metropolis until not one remained to create a taste for natural history in the breasts of the poor and uninstructed  one bear indeeda brown and ragged animalhad lingered about the haunts of his former triumphs with a worn and dejected visage and feeble limbs and had essayed to wield his quarterstaff for the amusement of the multitude but hunger and an utter want of any due recompense for his abilities had at length driven him from the field and it was only too probable that he had fallen a sacrifice to the rising taste for grease  he regretted to add that a similar and no less lamentable change had taken place with reference to monkeys  these delightful animals had formerly been almost as plentiful as the organs on the tops of which they were accustomed to sit the proportion in the year 1829 it appeared by the parliamentary return being as one monkey to three organs  owing however to an altered taste in musical instruments and the substitution in a great measure of narrow boxes of music for organs which left the monkeys nothing to sit upon this source of public amusement was wholly dried up considering it a matter of the deepest importance in connection with national education that the people should not lose such opportunities of making themselves acquainted with the manners and customs of two most interesting species of animals the author submitted that some measures should be immediately taken for the restoration of these pleasing and truly intellectual amusements  the president inquired by what means the honourable member proposed to attain this most desirable end  the author submitted that it could be most fully and satisfactorily accomplished if her majestys government would cause to be brought over to england and maintained at the public expense and for the public amusement such a number of bears as would enable every quarter of the town to be visitedsay at least by three bears a week  no difficulty whatever need be experienced in providing a fitting place for the reception of these animals as a commodious beargarden could be erected in the immediate neighbourhood of both houses of parliament obviously the most proper and eligible spot for such an establishment  professor mull doubted very much whether any correct ideas of natural history were propagated by the means to which the honourable member had so ably adverted  on the contrary he believed that they had been the means of diffusing very incorrect and imperfect notions on the subject  he spoke from personal observation and personal experience when he said that many children of great abilities had been induced to believe from what they had observed in the streets at and before the period to which the honourable gentleman had referred that all monkeys were born in red coats and spangles and that their hats and feathers also came by nature  he wished to know distinctly whether the honourable gentleman attributed the want of encouragement the bears had met with to the decline of public taste in that respect or to a want of ability on the part of the bears themselves  mr x x misty replied that he could not bring himself to believe but that there must be a great deal of floating talent among the bears and monkeys generally which in the absence of any proper encouragement was dispersed in other directions  professor pumpkinskull wished to take that opportunity of calling the attention of the section to a most important and serious point the author of the treatise just read had alluded to the prevalent taste for bearsgrease as a means of promoting the growth of hair which undoubtedly was diffused to a very great and as it appeared to him very alarming extent  no gentleman attending that section could fail to be aware of the fact that the youth of the present age evinced by their behaviour in the streets and at all places of public resort a considerable lack of that gallantry and gentlemanly feeling which in more ignorant times had been thought becoming  he wished to know whether it were possible that a constant outward application of bearsgrease by the young gentlemen about town had imperceptibly infused into those unhappy persons something of the nature and quality of the bear  he shuddered as he threw out the remark but if this theory on inquiry should prove to be well founded it would at once explain a great deal of unpleasant eccentricity of behaviour which without some such discovery was wholly unaccountable  the president highly complimented the learned gentleman on his most valuable suggestion which produced the greatest effect upon the assembly and remarked that only a week previous he had seen some young gentlemen at a theatre eyeing a box of ladies with a fierce intensity which nothing but the influence of some brutish appetite could possibly explain  it was dreadful to reflect that our youth were so rapidly verging into a generation of bears  after a scene of scientific enthusiasm it was resolved that this important question should be immediately submitted to the consideration of the council  the president wished to know whether any gentleman could inform the section what had become of the dancingdogs  a member replied after some hesitation that on the day after three gleesingers had been committed to prison as criminals by a late most zealous policemagistrate of the metropolis the dogs had abandoned their professional duties and dispersed themselves in different quarters of the town to gain a livelihood by less dangerous means  he was given to understand that since that period they had supported themselves by lying in wait for and robbing blind mens poodles  mr flummery exhibited a twig claiming to be a veritable branch of that noble tree known to naturalists as the shakspeare which has taken root in every land and climate and gathered under the shade of its broad green boughs the great family of mankind  the learned gentleman remarked that the twig had been undoubtedly called by other names in its time but that it had been pointed out to him by an old lady in warwickshire where the great tree had grown as a shoot of the genuine shakspeare by which name he begged to introduce it to his countrymen  the president wished to know what botanical definition the honourable gentleman could afford of the curiosity  mr flummery expressed his opinion that it was a decided plant   section bdisplay of models and mechanical science large room bootjack and countenance   presidentmr mallett  vicepresidentsmessrs leaver and scroo  mr crinkles exhibited a most beautiful and delicate machine of little larger size than an ordinary snuffbox manufactured entirely by himself and composed exclusively of steel by the aid of which more pockets could be picked in one hour than by the present slow and tedious process in fourandtwenty  the inventor remarked that it had been put into active operation in fleet street the strand and other thoroughfares and had never been once known to fail  after some slight delay occasioned by the various members of the section buttoning their pockets  the president narrowly inspected the invention and declared that he had never seen a machine of more beautiful or exquisite construction  would the inventor be good enough to inform the section whether he had taken any and what means for bringing it into general operation  mr crinkles stated that after encountering some preliminary difficulties he had succeeded in putting himself in communication with mr fogle hunter and other gentlemen connected with the swell mob who had awarded the invention the very highest and most unqualified approbation  he regretted to say however that these distinguished practitioners in common with a gentleman of the name of gimleteyed tommy and other members of a secondary grade of the profession whom he was understood to represent entertained an insuperable objection to its being brought into general use on the ground that it would have the inevitable effect of almost entirely superseding manual labour and throwing a great number of highly deserving persons out of employment  the president hoped that no such fanciful objections would be allowed to stand in the way of such a great public improvement  mr crinkles hoped so too but he feared that if the gentlemen of the swell mob persevered in their objection nothing could be done  professor grime suggested that surely in that case her majestys government might be prevailed upon to take it up  mr crinkles said that if the objection were found to be insuperable he should apply to parliament which he thought could not fail to recognise the utility of the invention  the president observed that up to this time parliament had certainly got on very well without it but as they did their business on a very large scale he had no doubt they would gladly adopt the improvement  his only fear was that the machine might be worn out by constant working  mr coppernose called the attention of the section to a proposition of great magnitude and interest illustrated by a vast number of models and stated with much clearness and perspicuity in a treatise entitled practical suggestions on the necessity of providing some harmless and wholesome relaxation for the young noblemen of england  his proposition was that a space of ground of not less than ten miles in length and four in breadth should be purchased by a new company to be incorporated by act of parliament and inclosed by a brick wall of not less than twelve feet in height  he proposed that it should be laid out with highway roads turnpikes bridges miniature villages and every object that could conduce to the comfort and glory of fourinhand clubs so that they might be fairly presumed to require no drive beyond it  this delightful retreat would be fitted up with most commodious and extensive stables for the convenience of such of the nobility and gentry as had a taste for ostlering and with houses of entertainment furnished in the most expensive and handsome style  it would be further provided with whole streets of doorknockers and bellhandles of extra size so constructed that they could be easily wrenched off at night and regularly screwed on again by attendants provided for the purpose every day  there would also be gas lamps of real glass which could be broken at a comparatively small expense per dozen and a broad and handsome foot pavement for gentlemen to drive their cabriolets upon when they were humorously disposedfor the full enjoyment of which feat live pedestrians would be procured from the workhouse at a very small charge per head  the place being inclosed and carefully screened from the intrusion of the public there would be no objection to gentlemen laying aside any article of their costume that was considered to interfere with a pleasant frolic or indeed to their walking about without any costume at all if they liked that better  in short every facility of enjoyment would be afforded that the most gentlemanly person could possibly desire but as even these advantages would be incomplete unless there were some means provided of enabling the nobility and gentry to display their prowess when they sallied forth after dinner and as some inconvenience might be experienced in the event of their being reduced to the necessity of pummelling each other the inventor had turned his attention to the construction of an entirely new police force composed exclusively of automaton figures which with the assistance of the ingenious signor gagliardi of windmillstreet in the haymarket he had succeeded in making with such nicety that a policeman cabdriver or old woman made upon the principle of the models exhibited would walk about until knocked down like any real man nay more if set upon and beaten by six or eight noblemen or gentlemen after it was down the figure would utter divers groans mingled with entreaties for mercy thus rendering the illusion complete and the enjoyment perfect  but the invention did not stop even here for stationhouses would be built containing good beds for noblemen and gentlemen during the night and in the morning they would repair to a commodious police office where a pantomimic investigation would take place before the automaton magistratesquite equal to lifewho would fine them in so many counters with which they would be previously provided for the purpose  this office would be furnished with an inclined plane for the convenience of any nobleman or gentleman who might wish to bring in his horse as a witness and the prisoners would be at perfect liberty as they were now to interrupt the complainants as much as they pleased and to make any remarks that they thought proper  the charge for these amusements would amount to very little more than they already cost and the inventor submitted that the public would be much benefited and comforted by the proposed arrangement  professor nogo wished to be informed what amount of automaton police force it was proposed to raise in the first instance  mr coppernose replied that it was proposed to begin with seven divisions of police of a score each lettered from a to g inclusive  it was proposed that not more than half this number should be placed on active duty and that the remainder should be kept on shelves in the police office ready to be called out at a moments notice  the president awarding the utmost merit to the ingenious gentleman who had originated the idea doubted whether the automaton police would quite answer the purpose  he feared that noblemen and gentlemen would perhaps require the excitement of thrashing living subjects  mr coppernose submitted that as the usual odds in such cases were ten noblemen or gentlemen to one policeman or cabdriver it could make very little difference in point of excitement whether the policeman or cabdriver were a man or a block  the great advantage would be that a policemans limbs might be all knocked off and yet he would be in a condition to do duty next day  he might even give his evidence next morning with his head in his hand and give it equally well  professor muffwill you allow me to ask you sir of what materials it is intended that the magistrates heads shall be composed  mr coppernosethe magistrates will have wooden heads of course and they will be made of the toughest and thickest materials that can possibly be obtained  professor muffi am quite satisfied  this is a great invention  professor nogoi see but one objection to it  it appears to me that the magistrates ought to talk  mr coppernose no sooner heard this suggestion than he touched a small spring in each of the two models of magistrates which were placed upon the table one of the figures immediately began to exclaim with great volubility that he was sorry to see gentlemen in such a situation and the other to express a fear that the policeman was intoxicated  the section as with one accord declared with a shout of applause that the invention was complete and the president much excited retired with mr coppernose to lay it before the council  on his return  mr tickle displayed his newlyinvented spectacles which enabled the wearer to discern in very bright colours objects at a great distance and rendered him wholly blind to those immediately before him  it was he said a most valuable and useful invention based strictly upon the principle of the human eye  the president required some information upon this point  he had yet to learn that the human eye was remarkable for the peculiarities of which the honourable gentleman had spoken  mr tickle was rather astonished to hear this when the president could not fail to be aware that a large number of most excellent persons and great statesmen could see with the naked eye most marvellous horrors on west india plantations while they could discern nothing whatever in the interior of manchester cotton mills  he must know too with what quickness of perception most people could discover their neighbours faults and how very blind they were to their own  if the president differed from the great majority of men in this respect his eye was a defective one and it was to assist his vision that these glasses were made  mr blank exhibited a model of a fashionable annual composed of copperplates gold leaf and silk boards and worked entirely by milk and water  mr prosee after examining the machine declared it to be so ingeniously composed that he was wholly unable to discover how it went on at all  mr blanknobody can and that is the beauty of it   section canatomy and medicine bar room black boy and stomachache   presidentdr soemup  vicepresidentsmessrs pessell and mortair  dr grummidge stated to the section a most interesting case of monomania and described the course of treatment he had pursued with perfect success  the patient was a married lady in the middle rank of life who having seen another lady at an evening party in a full suit of pearls was suddenly seized with a desire to possess a similar equipment although her husbands finances were by no means equal to the necessary outlay  finding her wish ungratified she fell sick and the symptoms soon became so alarming that he dr grummidge was called in  at this period the prominent tokens of the disorder were sullenness a total indisposition to perform domestic duties great peevishness and extreme languor except when pearls were mentioned at which times the pulse quickened the eyes grew brighter the pupils dilated and the patient after various incoherent exclamations burst into a passion of tears and exclaimed that nobody cared for her and that she wished herself dead  finding that the patients appetite was affected in the presence of company he began by ordering a total abstinence from all stimulants and forbidding any sustenance but weak gruel he then took twenty ounces of blood applied a blister under each ear one upon the chest and another on the back having done which and administered five grains of calomel he left the patient to her repose  the next day she was somewhat low but decidedly better and all appearances of irritation were removed  the next day she improved still further and on the next again  on the fourth there was some appearance of a return of the old symptoms which no sooner developed themselves than he administered another dose of calomel and left strict orders that unless a decidedly favourable change occurred within two hours the patients head should be immediately shaved to the very last curl  from that moment she began to mend and in less than fourandtwenty hours was perfectly restored  she did not now betray the least emotion at the sight or mention of pearls or any other ornaments  she was cheerful and goodhumoured and a most beneficial change had been effected in her whole temperament and condition  mr pipkin mrcs read a short but most interesting communication in which he sought to prove the complete belief of sir william courtenay otherwise thorn recently shot at canterbury in the homoeopathic system  the section would bear in mind that one of the homoeopathic doctrines was that infinitesimal doses of any medicine which would occasion the disease under which the patient laboured supposing him to be in a healthy state would cure it  now it was a remarkable circumstanceproved in the evidencethat the deceased thorn employed a woman to follow him about all day with a pail of water assuring her that one drop a purely homoeopathic remedy the section would observe placed upon his tongue after death would restore him  what was the obvious inference  that thorn who was marching and countermarching in osier beds and other swampy places was impressed with a presentiment that he should be drowned in which case had his instructions been complied with he could not fail to have been brought to life again instantly by his own prescription  as it was if this woman or any other person had administered an infinitesimal dose of lead and gunpowder immediately after he fell he would have recovered forthwith  but unhappily the woman concerned did not possess the power of reasoning by analogy or carrying out a principle and thus the unfortunate gentleman had been sacrificed to the ignorance of the peasantry   section dstatistics outhouse black boy and stomachache  presidentmr slug  vicepresidentsmessrs noakes and styles  mr kwakley stated the result of some most ingenious statistical inquiries relative to the difference between the value of the qualification of several members of parliament as published to the world and its real nature and amount  after reminding the section that every member of parliament for a town or borough was supposed to possess a clear freehold estate of three hundred pounds per annum the honourable gentleman excited great amusement and laughter by stating the exact amount of freehold property possessed by a column of legislators in which he had included himself  it appeared from this table that the amount of such income possessed by each was 0 pounds 0 shillings and 0 pence yielding an average of the same great laughter  it was pretty well known that there were accommodating gentlemen in the habit of furnishing new members with temporary qualifications to the ownership of which they swore solemnlyof course as a mere matter of form  he argued from these data that it was wholly unnecessary for members of parliament to possess any property at all especially as when they had none the public could get them so much cheaper   supplementary section eumbugology and ditchwaterisics   presidentmr grub  vice presidentsmessrs dull and dummy  a paper was read by the secretary descriptive of a bay pony with one eye which had been seen by the author standing in a butchers cart at the corner of newgate market  the communication described the author of the paper as having in the prosecution of a mercantile pursuit betaken himself one saturday morning last summer from somers town to cheapside in the course of which expedition he had beheld the extraordinary appearance above described  the pony had one distinct eye and it had been pointed out to him by his friend captain blunderbore of the horse marines who assisted the author in his search that whenever he winked this eye he whisked his tail possibly to drive the flies off but that he always winked and whisked at the same time  the animal was lean spavined and tottering and the author proposed to constitute it of the family of fitfordogsmeataurious  it certainly did occur to him that there was no case on record of a pony with one clearlydefined and distinct organ of vision winking and whisking at the same moment  mr q j snuffletoffle had heard of a pony winking his eye and likewise of a pony whisking his tail but whether they were two ponies or the same pony he could not undertake positively to say at all events he was acquainted with no authenticated instance of a simultaneous winking and whisking and he really could not but doubt the existence of such a marvellous pony in opposition to all those natural laws by which ponies were governed  referring however to the mere question of his one organ of vision might he suggest the possibility of this pony having been literally half asleep at the time he was seen and having closed only one eye  the president observed that whether the pony was half asleep or fast asleep there could be no doubt that the association was wide awake and therefore that they had better get the business over and go to dinner  he had certainly never seen anything analogous to this pony but he was not prepared to doubt its existence for he had seen many queerer ponies in his time though he did not pretend to have seen any more remarkable donkeys than the other gentlemen around him  professor john ketch was then called upon to exhibit the skull of the late mr greenacre which he produced from a blue bag remarking on being invited to make any observations that occurred to him that hed pound it as that ere spectable section had never seed a more gamerer cove nor he vos  a most animated discussion upon this interesting relic ensued and some difference of opinion arising respecting the real character of the deceased gentleman mr blubb delivered a lecture upon the cranium before him clearly showing that mr greenacre possessed the organ of destructiveness to a most unusual extent with a most remarkable development of the organ of carveativeness sir hookham snivey was proceeding to combat this opinion when professor ketch suddenly interrupted the proceedings by exclaiming with great excitement of manner walker  the president begged to call the learned gentleman to order  professor ketchorder be blowed youve got the wrong un i tell you  it aint no ed at all its a cokernut as my brother inlaw has been acarvin to hornament his new baked taturstall wots acomin down ere vile the sociations in the town  hand over vill you  with these words professor ketch hastily repossessed himself of the cocoanut and drew forth the skull in mistake for which he had exhibited it  a most interesting conversation ensued but as there appeared some doubt ultimately whether the skull was mr greenacres or a hospital patients or a paupers or a mans or a womans or a monkeys no particular result was obtained   i cannot says our talented correspondent in conclusion i cannot close my account of these gigantic researches and sublime and noble triumphs without repeating a bon mot of professor woodensconces which shows how the greatest minds may occasionally unbend when truth can be presented to listening ears clothed in an attractive and playful form  i was standing by when after a week of feasting and feeding that learned gentleman accompanied by the whole body of wonderful men entered the hall yesterday where a sumptuous dinner was prepared where the richest wines sparkled on the board and fat buckspropitiatory sacrifices to learningsent forth their savoury odours  ah said professor woodensconce rubbing his hands this is what we meet for this is what inspires us this is what keeps us together and beckons us onward this is the spread of science and a glorious spread it is     the pantomime of life     before we plunge headlong into this paper let us at once confess to a fondness for pantomimesto a gentle sympathy with clowns and pantaloonsto an unqualified admiration of harlequins and columbinesto a chaste delight in every action of their brief existence varied and manycoloured as those actions are and inconsistent though they occasionally be with those rigid and formal rules of propriety which regulate the proceedings of meaner and less comprehensive minds  we revel in pantomimesnot because they dazzle ones eyes with tinsel and gold leaf not because they present to us once again the wellbeloved chalked faces and goggle eyes of our childhood not even because like christmasday and twelfthnight and shrovetuesday and ones own birthday they come to us but once a yearour attachment is founded on a graver and a very different reason  a pantomime is to us a mirror of life nay more we maintain that it is so to audiences generally although they are not aware of it and that this very circumstance is the secret cause of their amusement and delight  let us take a slight example  the scene is a street  an elderly gentleman with a large face and strongly marked features appears his countenance beams with a sunny smile and a perpetual dimple is on his broad red cheek  he is evidently an opulent elderly gentleman comfortable in circumstances and welltodo in the world  he is not unmindful of the adornment of his person for he is richly not to say gaudily dressed and that he indulges to a reasonable extent in the pleasures of the table may be inferred from the joyous and oily manner in which he rubs his stomach by way of informing the audience that he is going home to dinner  in the fulness of his heart in the fancied security of wealth in the possession and enjoyment of all the good things of life the elderly gentleman suddenly loses his footing and stumbles  how the audience roar  he is set upon by a noisy and officious crowd who buffet and cuff him unmercifully  they scream with delight every time the elderly gentleman struggles to get up his relentless persecutors knock him down again  the spectators are convulsed with merriment  and when at last the elderly gentleman does get up and staggers away despoiled of hat wig and clothing himself battered to pieces and his watch and money gone they are exhausted with laughter and express their merriment and admiration in rounds of applause  is this like life  change the scene to any real streetto the stock exchange or the city bankers the merchants counting house or even the tradesmans shop  see any one of these men fallthe more suddenly and the nearer the zenith of his pride and riches the better  what a wild hallo is raised over his prostrate carcase by the shouting mob how they whoop and yell as he lies humbled beneath them  mark how eagerly they set upon him when he is down and how they mock and deride him as he slinks away  why it is the pantomime to the very letter  of all the pantomimic dramatis personae we consider the pantaloon the most worthless and debauched  independent of the dislike one naturally feels at seeing a gentleman of his years engaged in pursuits highly unbecoming his gravity and time of life we cannot conceal from ourselves the fact that he is a treacherous worldly minded old villain constantly enticing his younger companion the clown into acts of fraud or petty larceny and generally standing aside to watch the result of the enterprise  if it be successful he never forgets to return for his share of the spoil but if it turn out a failure he generally retires with remarkable caution and expedition and keeps carefully aloof until the affair has blown over  his amorous propensities too are eminently disagreeable and his mode of addressing ladies in the open street at noonday is downright improper being usually neither more nor less than a perceptible tickling of the aforesaid ladies in the waist after committing which he starts back manifestly ashamed as well he may be of his own indecorum and temerity continuing nevertheless to ogle and beckon to them from a distance in a very unpleasant and immoral manner  is there any man who cannot count a dozen pantaloons in his own social circle  is there any man who has not seen them swarming at the west end of the town on a sunshiny day or a summers evening going through the lastnamed pantomimic feats with as much liquorish energy and as total an absence of reserve as if they were on the very stage itself  we can tell upon our fingers a dozen pantaloons of our acquaintance at this momentcapital pantaloons who have been performing all kinds of strange freaks to the great amusement of their friends and acquaintance for years past and who to this day are making such comical and ineffectual attempts to be young and dissolute that all beholders are like to die with laughter  take that old gentleman who has just emerged from the cafe de leurope in the haymarket where he has been dining at the expense of the young man upon town with whom he shakes hands as they part at the door of the tavern  the affected warmth of that shake of the hand the courteous nod the obvious recollection of the dinner the savoury flavour of which still hangs upon his lips are all characteristics of his great prototype  he hobbles away humming an opera tune and twirling his cane to and fro with affected carelessness  suddenly he stopstis at the milliners window  he peeps through one of the large panes of glass and his view of the ladies within being obstructed by the india shawls directs his attentions to the young girl with the bandbox in her hand who is gazing in at the window also  see he draws beside her  he coughs she turns away from him  he draws near her again she disregards him  he gleefully chucks her under the chin and retreating a few steps nods and beckons with fantastic grimaces while the girl bestows a contemptuous and supercilious look upon his wrinkled visage  she turns away with a flounce and the old gentleman trots after her with a toothless chuckle the pantaloon to the life   but the close resemblance which the clowns of the stage bear to those of everyday life is perfectly extraordinary  some people talk with a sigh of the decline of pantomime and murmur in low and dismal tones the name of grimaldi  we mean no disparagement to the worthy and excellent old man when we say that this is downright nonsense  clowns that beat grimaldi all to nothing turn up every day and nobody patronizes themmores the pity  i know who you mean says some dirtyfaced patron of mr osbaldistones laying down the miscellany when he has got thus far and bestowing upon vacancy a most knowing glance you mean c j smith as did guy fawkes and george barnwell at the garden the dirtyfaced gentleman has hardly uttered the words when he is interrupted by a young gentleman in no shirtcollar and a petersham coat  no no says the young gentleman he means brown king and gibson at the delphi  now with great deference both to the firstnamed gentleman with the dirty face and the lastnamed gentleman in the nonexisting shirtcollar we do not mean either the performer who so grotesquely burlesqued the popish conspirator or the three unchangeables who have been dancing the same dance under different imposing titles and doing the same thing under various highsounding names for some five or six years last past we have no sooner made this avowal than the public who have hitherto been silent witnesses of the dispute inquire what on earth it is we do mean and with becoming respect we proceed to tell them  it is very well known to all playgoers and pantomimeseers that the scenes in which a theatrical clown is at the very height of his glory are those which are described in the playbills as cheesemongers shop and crockery warehouse or tailors shop and mrs queertables boardinghouse or places bearing some such title where the great fun of the thing consists in the heros taking lodgings which he has not the slightest intention of paying for or obtaining goods under false pretences or abstracting the stockintrade of the respectable shopkeeper next door or robbing warehouse porters as they pass under his window or to shorten the catalogue in his swindling everybody he possibly can it only remaining to be observed that the more extensive the swindling is and the more barefaced the impudence of the swindler the greater the rapture and ecstasy of the audience  now it is a most remarkable fact that precisely this sort of thing occurs in real life day after day and nobody sees the humour of it  let us illustrate our position by detailing the plot of this portion of the pantomimenot of the theatre but of life  the honourable captain fitzwhisker fiercy attended by his livery servant doema most respectable servant to look at who has grown grey in the service of the captains familyviews treats for and ultimately obtains possession of the unfurnished house such a number such a street  all the tradesmen in the neighbourhood are in agonies of competition for the captains custom the captain is a goodnatured kindhearted easy man and to avoid being the cause of disappointment to any he most handsomely gives orders to all  hampers of wine baskets of provisions cartloads of furniture boxes of jewellery supplies of luxuries of the costliest description flock to the house of the honourable captain fitzwhisker fiercy where they are received with the utmost readiness by the highly respectable doem while the captain himself struts and swaggers about with that compound air of conscious superiority and general bloodthirstiness which a military captain should always and does most times wear to the admiration and terror of plebeian men  but the tradesmens backs are no sooner turned than the captain with all the eccentricity of a mighty mind and assisted by the faithful doem whose devoted fidelity is not the least touching part of his character disposes of everything to great advantage for although the articles fetch small sums still they are sold considerably above cost price the cost to the captain having been nothing at all  after various manoeuvres the imposture is discovered fitzfiercy and doem are recognized as confederates and the police office to which they are both taken is thronged with their dupes  who can fail to recognize in this the exact counterpart of the best portion of a theatrical pantomimefitzwhisker fiercy by the clown doem by the pantaloon and supernumeraries by the tradesmen  the best of the joke too is that the very coal merchant who is loudest in his complaints against the person who defrauded him is the identical man who sat in the centre of the very front row of the pit last night and laughed the most boisterously at this very same thingand not so well done either talk of grimaldi we say again  did grimaldi in his best days ever do anything in this way equal to da costa  the mention of this latter justly celebrated clown reminds us of his last piece of humour the fraudulently obtaining certain stamped acceptances from a young gentleman in the army  we had scarcely laid down our pen to contemplate for a few moments this admirable actors performance of that exquisite practical joke than a new branch of our subject flashed suddenly upon us  so we take it up again at once  all people who have been behind the scenes and most people who have been before them know that in the representation of a pantomime a good many men are sent upon the stage for the express purpose of being cheated or knocked down or both  now down to a moment ago we had never been able to understand for what possible purpose a great number of odd lazy largeheaded men whom one is in the habit of meeting here and there and everywhere could ever have been created  we see it all now  they are the supernumeraries in the pantomime of life the men who have been thrust into it with no other view than to be constantly tumbling over each other and running their heads against all sorts of strange things  we sat opposite to one of these men at a supper table only last week  now we think of it he was exactly like the gentlemen with the pasteboard heads and faces who do the corresponding business in the theatrical pantomimes there was the same broad stolid simperthe same dull leaden eyethe same unmeaning vacant stare and whatever was said or whatever was done he always came in at precisely the wrong place or jostled against something that he had not the slightest business with  we looked at the man across the table again and again and could not satisfy ourselves what race of beings to class him with  how very odd that this never occurred to us before  we will frankly own that we have been much troubled with the harlequin  we see harlequins of so many kinds in the real living pantomime that we hardly know which to select as the proper fellow of him of the theatres  at one time we were disposed to think that the harlequin was neither more nor less than a young man of family and independent property who had run away with an operadancer and was fooling his life and his means away in light and trivial amusements  on reflection however we remembered that harlequins are occasionally guilty of witty and even clever acts and we are rather disposed to acquit our young men of family and independent property generally speaking of any such misdemeanours  on a more mature consideration of the subject we have arrived at the conclusion that the harlequins of life are just ordinary men to be found in no particular walk or degree on whom a certain station or particular conjunction of circumstances confers the magic wand and this brings us to a few words on the pantomime of public and political life which we shall say at once and then conclude merely premising in this place that we decline any reference whatever to the columbine being in no wise satisfied of the nature of her connection with her particoloured lover and not feeling by any means clear that we should be justified in introducing her to the virtuous and respectable ladies who peruse our lucubrations  we take it that the commencement of a session of parliament is neither more nor less than the drawing up of the curtain for a grand comic pantomime and that his majestys most gracious speech on the opening thereof may be not inaptly compared to the clowns opening speech of here we are  my lords and gentlemen here we are appears to our mind at least to be a very good abstract of the point and meaning of the propitiatory address of the ministry when we remember how frequently this speech is made immediately after the change too the parallel is quite perfect and still more singular  perhaps the cast of our political pantomime never was richer than at this day  we are particularly strong in clowns  at no former time we should say have we had such astonishing tumblers or performers so ready to go through the whole of their feats for the amusement of an admiring throng  their extreme readiness to exhibit indeed has given rise to some illnatured reflections it having been objected that by exhibiting gratuitously through the country when the theatre is closed they reduce themselves to the level of mountebanks and thereby tend to degrade the respectability of the profession  certainly grimaldi never did this sort of thing and though brown king and gibson have gone to the surrey in vacation time and mr c j smith has ruralised at sadlers wells we find no theatrical precedent for a general tumbling through the country except in the gentleman name unknown who threw summersets on behalf of the late mr richardson and who is no authority either because he had never been on the regular boards  but laying aside this question which after all is a mere matter of taste we may reflect with pride and gratification of heart on the proficiency of our clowns as exhibited in the season  night after night will they twist and tumble about till two three and four oclock in the morning playing the strangest antics and giving each other the funniest slaps on the face that can possibly be imagined without evincing the smallest tokens of fatigue  the strange noises the confusion the shouting and roaring amid which all this is done too would put to shame the most turbulent sixpenny gallery that ever yelled through a boxingnight  it is especially curious to behold one of these clowns compelled to go through the most surprising contortions by the irresistible influence of the wand of office which his leader or harlequin holds above his head  acted upon by this wonderful charm he will become perfectly motionless moving neither hand foot nor finger and will even lose the faculty of speech at an instants notice or on the other hand he will become all life and animation if required pouring forth a torrent of words without sense or meaning throwing himself into the wildest and most fantastic contortions and even grovelling on the earth and licking up the dust  these exhibitions are more curious than pleasing indeed they are rather disgusting than otherwise except to the admirers of such things with whom we confess we have no fellowfeeling  strange tricksvery strange tricksare also performed by the harlequin who holds for the time being the magic wand which we have just mentioned  the mere waving it before a mans eyes will dispossess his brains of all the notions previously stored there and fill it with an entirely new set of ideas one gentle tap on the back will alter the colour of a mans coat completely and there are some expert performers who having this wand held first on one side and then on the other will change from side to side turning their coats at every evolution with so much rapidity and dexterity that the quickest eye can scarcely detect their motions occasionally the genius who confers the wand wrests it from the hand of the temporary possessor and consigns it to some new performer on which occasions all the characters change sides and then the race and the hard knocks begin anew  we might have extended this chapter to a much greater lengthwe might have carried the comparison into the liberal professionswe might have shown as was in fact our original purpose that each is in itself a little pantomime with scenes and characters of its own complete but as we fear we have been quite lengthy enough already we shall leave this chapter just where it is  a gentleman not altogether unknown as a dramatic poet wrote thus a year or two ago    all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players   and we tracking out his footsteps at the scarcelyworthmentioning little distance of a few millions of leagues behind venture to add by way of new reading that he meant a pantomime and that we are all actors in the pantomime of life    some particulars concerning a lion    we have a great respect for lions in the abstract  in common with most other people we have heard and read of many instances of their bravery and generosity  we have duly admired that heroic selfdenial and charming philanthropy which prompts them never to eat people except when they are hungry and we have been deeply impressed with a becoming sense of the politeness they are said to display towards unmarried ladies of a certain state  all natural histories teem with anecdotes illustrative of their excellent qualities and one old spellingbook in particular recounts a touching instance of an old lion of high moral dignity and stern principle who felt it his imperative duty to devour a young man who had contracted a habit of swearing as a striking example to the rising generation  all this is extremely pleasant to reflect upon and indeed says a very great deal in favour of lions as a mass  we are bound to state however that such individual lions as we have happened to fall in with have not put forth any very striking characteristics and have not acted up to the chivalrous character assigned them by their chroniclers  we never saw a lion in what is called his natural state certainly that is to say we have never met a lion out walking in a forest or crouching in his lair under a tropical sun waiting till his dinner should happen to come by hot from the bakers  but we have seen some under the influence of captivity and the pressure of misfortune and we must say that they appeared to us very apathetic heavyheaded fellows  the lion at the zoological gardens for instance  he is all very well he has an undeniable mane and looks very fierce but lord bless us what of that  the lions of the fashionable world look just as ferocious and are the most harmless creatures breathing a boxlobby lion or a regentstreet animal will put on a most terrible aspect and roar fearfully if you affront him but he will never bite and if you offer to attack him manfully will fairly turn tail and sneak off  doubtless these creatures roam about sometimes in herds and if they meet any especially meek looking and peaceablydisposed fellow will endeavour to frighten him but the faintest show of a vigorous resistance is sufficient to scare them even then  these are pleasant characteristics whereas we make it matter of distinct charge against the zoological lion and his brethren at the fairs that they are sleepy dreamy sluggish quadrupeds  we do not remember to have ever seen one of them perfectly awake except at feedingtime  in every respect we uphold the biped lions against their fourfooted namesakes and we boldly challenge controversy upon the subject  with these opinions it may be easily imagined that our curiosity and interest were very much excited the other day when a lady of our acquaintance called on us and resolutely declined to accept our refusal of her invitation to an evening party for said she i have got a lion coming  we at once retracted our plea of a prior engagement and became as anxious to go as we had previously been to stay away  we went early and posted ourselves in an eligible part of the drawingroom from whence we could hope to obtain a full view of the interesting animal  two or three hours passed the quadrilles began the room filled but no lion appeared  the lady of the house became inconsolablefor it is one of the peculiar privileges of these lions to make solemn appointments and never keep themwhen all of a sudden there came a tremendous double rap at the streetdoor and the master of the house after gliding out unobserved as he flattered himself to peep over the banisters came into the room rubbing his hands together with great glee and cried out in a very important voice my dear mrnaming the lion has this moment arrived  upon this all eyes were turned towards the door and we observed several young ladies who had been laughing and conversing previously with great gaiety and good humour grow extremely quiet and sentimental while some young gentlemen who had been cutting great figures in the facetious and smalltalk way suddenly sank very obviously in the estimation of the company and were looked upon with great coldness and indifference  even the young man who had been ordered from the music shop to play the pianoforte was visibly affected and struck several false notes in the excess of his excitement  all this time there was a great talking outside more than once accompanied by a loud laugh and a cry of oh capital excellent from which we inferred that the lion was jocose and that these exclamations were occasioned by the transports of his keeper and our host  nor were we deceived for when the lion at last appeared we overheard his keeper who was a little prim man whisper to several gentlemen of his acquaintance with uplifted hands and every expression of halfsuppressed admiration that naming the lion again was in such cue tonight  the lion was a literary one  of course there were a vast number of people present who had admired his roarings and were anxious to be introduced to him and very pleasant it was to see them brought up for the purpose and to observe the patient dignity with which he received all their patting and caressing  this brought forcibly to our mind what we had so often witnessed at country fairs where the other lions are compelled to go through as many forms of courtesy as they chance to be acquainted with just as often as admiring parties happen to drop in upon them  while the lion was exhibiting in this way his keeper was not idle for he mingled among the crowd and spread his praises most industriously  to one gentleman he whispered some very choice thing that the noble animal had said in the very act of coming up stairs which of course rendered the mental effort still more astonishing to another he murmured a hasty account of a grand dinner that had taken place the day before where twentyseven gentlemen had got up all at once to demand an extra cheer for the lion and to the ladies he made sundry promises of interceding to procure the majestic brutes signmanual for their albums  then there were little private consultations in different corners relative to the personal appearance and stature of the lion whether he was shorter than they had expected to see him or taller or thinner or fatter or younger or older whether he was like his portrait or unlike it and whether the particular shade of his eyes was black or blue or hazel or green or yellow or mixture  at all these consultations the keeper assisted and in short the lion was the sole and single subject of discussion till they sat him down to whist and then the people relapsed into their old topics of conversationthemselves and each other  we must confess that we looked forward with no slight impatience to the announcement of supper for if you wish to see a tame lion under particularly favourable circumstances feedingtime is the period of all others to pitch upon  we were therefore very much delighted to observe a sensation among the guests which we well knew how to interpret and immediately afterwards to behold the lion escorting the lady of the house downstairs  we offered our arm to an elderly female of our acquaintance whodear old soul is the very best person that ever lived to lead down to any meal for be the room ever so small or the party ever so large she is sure by some intuitive perception of the eligible to push and pull herself and conductor close to the best dishes on the table we say we offered our arm to this elderly female and descending the stairs shortly after the lion were fortunate enough to obtain a seat nearly opposite him  of course the keeper was there already  he had planted himself at precisely that distance from his charge which afforded him a decent pretext for raising his voice when he addressed him to so loud a key as could not fail to attract the attention of the whole company and immediately began to apply himself seriously to the task of bringing the lion out and putting him through the whole of his manoeuvres  such flashes of wit as he elicited from the lion first of all they began to make puns upon a saltcellar and then upon the breast of a fowl and then upon the trifle but the best jokes of all were decidedly on the lobster salad upon which latter subject the lion came out most vigorously and in the opinion of the most competent authorities quite outshone himself  this is a very excellent mode of shining in society and is founded we humbly conceive upon the classic model of the dialogues between mr punch and his friend the proprietor wherein the latter takes all the uphill work and is content to pioneer to the jokes and repartees of mr p himself who never fails to gain great credit and excite much laughter thereby  whatever it be founded on however we recommend it to all lions present and to come for in this instance it succeeded to admiration and perfectly dazzled the whole body of hearers  when the saltcellar and the fowls breast and the trifle and the lobster salad were all exhausted and could not afford standingroom for another solitary witticism the keeper performed that very dangerous feat which is still done with some of the caravan lions although in one instance it terminated fatally of putting his head in the animals mouth and placing himself entirely at its mercy  boswell frequently presents a melancholy instance of the lamentable results of this achievement and other keepers and jackals have been terribly lacerated for their daring it is due to our lion to state that he condescended to be trifled with in the most gentle manner and finally went home with the showman in a hack cab  perfectly peaceable but slightly fuddled  being in a contemplative mood we were led to make some reflections upon the character and conduct of this genus of lions as we walked homewards and we were not long in arriving at the conclusion that our former impression in their favour was very much strengthened and confirmed by what we had recently seen  while the other lions receive company and compliments in a sullen moody not to say snarling manner these appear flattered by the attentions that are paid them while those conceal themselves to the utmost of their power from the vulgar gaze these court the popular eye and unlike their brethren whom nothing short of compulsion will move to exertion are ever ready to display their acquirements to the wondering throng  we have known bears of undoubted ability who when the expectations of a large audience have been wound up to the utmost pitch have peremptorily refused to dance welltaught monkeys who have unaccountably objected to exhibit on the slack wire and elephants of unquestioned genius who have suddenly declined to turn the barrelorgan but we never once knew or heard of a biped lion literary or otherwiseand we state it as a fact which is highly creditable to the whole specieswho occasion offering did not seize with avidity on any opportunity which was afforded him of performing to his hearts content on the first violin    mr robert bolton  the gentleman connected with the press    in the parlour of the green dragon a publichouse in the immediate neighbourhood of westminster bridge everybody talks politics every evening the great political authority being mr robert bolton an individual who defines himself as a gentleman connected with the press which is a definition of peculiar indefiniteness mr robert boltons regular circle of admirers and listeners are an undertaker a greengrocer a hairdresser a baker a large stomach surmounted by a mans head and placed on the top of two particularly short legs and a thin man in black name profession and pursuit unknown who always sits in the same position always displays the same long vacant face and never opens his lips surrounded as he is by most enthusiastic conversation except to puff forth a volume of tobacco smoke or give vent to a very snappy loud and shrill hem  the conversation sometimes turns upon literature mr bolton being a literary character and always upon such news of the day as is exclusively possessed by that talented individual  i found myself of course accidentally in the green dragon the other evening and being somewhat amused by the following conversation preserved it  can you lend me a tenpound note till christmas inquired the hairdresser of the stomach  wheres your security mr clip  my stock in tradetheres enough of it im thinking mr thicknesse  some fifty wigs two poles halfadozen head blocks and a dead bruin  no i wont then growled out thicknesse  i lends nothing on the security of the whigs or the poles either  as for whigs theyre cheats as for the poles theyve got no cash  i never have nothing to do with blockheads unless i cant awoid it ironically and a dead bears about as much use to me as i could be to a dead bear  well then urged the other theres a book as belonged to pope byrons poems valued at forty pounds because its got popes identical scratch on the back what do you think of that for security  well to be sure cried the baker  but how dye mean mr clip  mean why that its got the hottergruff of pope   steal not this book for fear of hangmans rope for it belongs to alexander pope   all thats written on the inside of the binding of the book so as my son says were bound to believe it  well sir observed the undertaker deferentially and in a half whisper leaning over the table and knocking over the hairdressers grog as he spoke that arguments very easy upset  perhaps sir said clip a little flurried youll pay for the first upset afore you thinks of another  now said the undertaker bowing amicably to the hairdresser i think i says i thinkyoull excuse me mr clip i think you see that wont go down with the present companyunfortunately my master had the honour of making the coffin of that ere lords housemaid not no more nor twenty year ago  dont think im proud on it gentlemen others might be but i hate rank of any sort ive no more respect for a lords footman than i have for any respectable tradesman in this room  i may say no more nor i have for mr clip bowing  therefore that ere lord must have been born long after pope died  and its a logical interference to defer that they neither of them lived at the same time  so what i mean is this here that pope never had no book never seed felt never smelt no book triumphantly as belonged to that ere lord and gentlemen when i consider how patiently you have eared the ideas what i have expressed i feel bound as the best way to reward you for the kindness you have exhibited to sit down without saying anything morepartickler as i perceive a worthier visitor nor myself is just entered  i am not in the habit of paying compliments gentlemen when i do therefore i hope i strikes with double force  ah mr murgatroyd whats all this about striking with double force said the object of the above remark as he entered  i never excuse a mans getting into a rage during winter even when hes seated so close to the fire as you are  it is very injudicious to put yourself into such a perspiration  what is the cause of this extreme physical and mental excitement sir  such was the very philosophical address of mr robert bolton a shorthandwriter as he termed himselfa bit of equivoque passing current among his fraternity which must give the uninitiated a vast idea of the establishment of the ministerial organ while to the initiated it signifies that no one paper can lay claim to the enjoyment of their services  mr bolton was a young man with a somewhat sickly and very dissipated expression of countenance  his habiliments were composed of an exquisite union of gentility slovenliness assumption simplicity newness and old age  half of him was dressed for the winter the other half for the summer his hat was of the newest cut the dorsay his trousers had been white but the inroads of mud and ink etc had given them a pie bald appearance round his throat he wore a very high black cravat of the most tyrannical stiffness while his tout ensemble was hidden beneath the enormous folds of an old brown poodlecollared greatcoat which was closely buttoned up to the aforesaid cravat his fingers peeped through the ends of his black kid gloves and two of the toes of each foot took a similar view of society through the extremities of his highlows  sacred to the bare walls of his garret be the mysteries of his interior dress  he was a short spare man of a somewhat inferior deportment  everybody seemed influenced by his entry into the room and his salutation of each member partook of the patronizing  the hairdresser made way for him between himself and the stomach  a minute afterwards he had taken possession of his pint and pipe  a pause in the conversation took place  everybody was waiting anxious for his first observation  horrid murder in westminster this morning observed mr bolton  everybody changed their positions  all eyes were fixed upon the man of paragraphs  a baker murdered his son by boiling him in a copper said mr bolton  good heavens exclaimed everybody in simultaneous horror  boiled him gentlemen added mr bolton with the most effective emphasis boiled him  and the particulars mr b inquired the hairdresser the particulars  mr bolton took a very long draught of porter and some two or three dozen whiffs of tobacco doubtless to instil into the commercial capacities of the company the superiority of a gentlemen connected with the press and then said   the man was a baker gentlemen  every one looked at the baker present who stared at bolton  his victim being his son also was necessarily the son of a baker  the wretched murderer had a wife whom he was frequently in the habit while in an intoxicated state of kicking pummelling flinging mugs at knocking down and halfkilling while in bed by inserting in her mouth a considerable portion of a sheet or blanket  the speaker took another draught everybody looked at everybody else and exclaimed horrid  it appears in evidence gentlemen continued mr bolton that on the evening of yesterday sawyer the baker came home in a reprehensible state of beer  mrs s connubially considerate carried him in that condition upstairs into his chamber and consigned him to their mutual couch  in a minute or two she lay sleeping beside the man whom the morrows dawn beheld a murderer entire silence informed the reporter that his picture had attained the awful effect he desired  the son came home about an hour afterwards opened the door and went up to bed  scarcely gentlemen conceive his feelings of alarm scarcely had he taken off his indescribables when shrieks to his experienced ear maternal shrieks scared the silence of surrounding night  he put his indescribables on again and ran downstairs  he opened the door of the parental bedchamber  his father was dancing upon his mother  what must have been his feelings  in the agony of the minute he rushed at his male parent as he was about to plunge a knife into the side of his female  the mother shrieked  the father caught the son who had wrested the knife from the paternal grasp up in his arms carried him downstairs shoved him into a copper of boiling water among some linen closed the lid and jumped upon the top of it in which position he was found with a ferocious countenance by the mother who arrived in the melancholy washhouse just as he had so settled himself  wheres my boy shrieked the mother  in that copper boiling coolly replied the benign father  struck by the awful intelligence the mother rushed from the house and alarmed the neighbourhood  the police entered a minute afterwards  the father having bolted the washhouse door had bolted himself  they dragged the lifeless body of the boiled baker from the cauldron and with a promptitude commendable in men of their station they immediately carried it to the stationhouse subsequently the baker was apprehended while seated on the top of a lamppost in parliament street lighting his pipe  the whole horrible ideality of the mysteries of udolpho condensed into the pithy effect of a tenline paragraph could not possibly have so affected the narrators auditory  silence the purest and most noble of all kinds of applause bore ample testimony to the barbarity of the baker as well as to boltons knack of narration and it was only broken after some minutes had elapsed by interjectional expressions of the intense indignation of every man present  the baker wondered how a british baker could so disgrace himself and the highly honourable calling to which he belonged and the others indulged in a variety of wonderments connected with the subject among which not the least wonderment was that which was awakened by the genius and information of mr robert bolton who after a glowing eulogium on himself and his unspeakable influence with the daily press was proceeding with a most solemn countenance to hear the pros and cons of the pope autograph question when i took up my hat and left    familiar epistle from a parent to a child aged two years and two months    my child  to recount with what trouble i have brought you upwith what an anxious eye i have regarded your progresshow late and how often i have sat up at night working for youand how many thousand letters i have received from and written to your various relations and friends many of whom have been of a querulous and irritable turnto dwell on the anxiety and tenderness with which i have as far as i possessed the power inspected and chosen your food rejecting the indigestible and heavy matter which some injudicious but wellmeaning old ladies would have had you swallow and retaining only those light and pleasant articles which i deemed calculated to keep you free from all gross humours and to render you an agreeable child and one who might be popular with society in generalto dilate on the steadiness with which i have prevented your annoying any company by talking politicsalways assuring you that you would thank me for it yourself some day when you grew olderto expatiate in short upon my own assiduity as a parent is beside my present purpose though i cannot but contemplate your fair appearanceyour robust health and unimpeded circulation which i take to be the great secret of your good looks without the liveliest satisfaction and delight  it is a trite observation and one which young as you are i have no doubt you have often heard repeated that we have fallen upon strange times and live in days of constant shiftings and changes i had a melancholy instance of this only a week or two since  i was returning from manchester to london by the mail train when i suddenly fell into another traina mixed trainof reflection occasioned by the dejected and disconsolate demeanour of the post office guard  we were stopping at some station where they take in water when he dismounted slowly from the little box in which he sits in ghastly mockery of his old condition with pistol and blunderbuss beside him ready to shoot the first highwayman or railwayman who shall attempt to stop the horses which now travel when they travel at all inside and in a portable stable invented for the purposehe dismounted i say slowly and sadly from his post and looking mournfully about him as if in dismal recollection of the old roadside publichouse the blazing firethe glass of foaming alethe buxom handmaid and admiring hangerson of taproom and stable all honoured by his notice and retiring a little apart stood leaning against a signalpost surveying the engine with a look of combined affliction and disgust which no words can describe  his scarlet coat and golden lace were tarnished with ignoble smoke flakes of soot had fallen on his bright green shawl his pride in days of yorethe steam condensed in the tunnel from which we had just emerged shone upon his hat like rain  his eye betokened that he was thinking of the coachman and as it wandered to his own seat and his own fastfading garb it was plain to see that he felt his office and himself had alike no business there and were nothing but an elaborate practical joke  as we whirled away i was led insensibly into an anticipation of those days to come when mailcoach guards shall no longer be judges of horsefleshwhen a mailcoach guard shall never even have seen a horsewhen stations shall have superseded stables and corn shall have given place to coke  in those dawning times thought i exhibitionrooms shall teem with portraits of her majestys favourite engine with boilers after nature by future landseers  some amburgh yet unborn shall break wild horses by his magic power and in the dress of a mailcoach guard exhibit his trained animals in a mock mailcoach  then shall wondering crowds observe how that with the exception of his whip it is all his eye and crowned heads shall see them fed on oats and stand alone unmoved and undismayed while counters flee affrighted when the coursers neigh  such my child were the reflections from which i was only awakened then as i am now by the necessity of attending to matters of present though minor importance  i offer no apology to you for the digression for it brings me very naturally to the subject of change which is the very subject of which i desire to treat  in fact my child you have changed hands  henceforth i resign you to the guardianship and protection of one of my most intimate and valued friends mr ainsworth with whom and with you my best wishes and warmest feelings will ever remain  i reap no gain or profit by parting from you nor will any conveyance of your property be required for in this respect you have always been literally bentleys miscellany and never mine  unlike the driver of the old manchester mail i regard this altered state of things with feelings of unmingled pleasure and satisfaction  unlike the guard of the new manchester mail your guard is at home in his new place and has roystering highwaymen and gallant desperadoes ever within call  and if i might compare you my child to an engine not a tory engine nor a whig engine but a brisk and rapid locomotive your friends and patrons to passengers and he who now stands towards you in loco parentis as the skilful engineer and supervisor of the whole i would humbly crave leave to postpone the departure of the train on its new and auspicious course for one brief instant while with hat in hand i approach side by side with the friend who travelled with me on the old road and presume to solicit favour and kindness in behalf of him and his new charge both for their sakes and that of the old coachman  boz
