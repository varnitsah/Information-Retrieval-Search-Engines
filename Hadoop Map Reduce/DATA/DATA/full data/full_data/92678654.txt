 here maggie come and hear if i can say this  o tom please dont cried maggie     maggie and tom tulliver   chapter i  tom must go to school  what i want you know said mr tulliver of dorlcote millwhat i want is to give tom a good eddication  that was what i was thinking of when i gave notice for him to leave th academy at lady day  i meant to put him to a downright good school at midsummer  the two years at th academy ud ha done well enough the miller went on if id meant to make a miller and farmer of him like myself but i should like tom to be a bit of a scholard so as he might be up to the tricks o these fellows as talk fine and write with a flourish it ud be a help to me wi these lawsuits and things  mr tulliver was speaking to his wife a blond comely woman in a fanshaped cap  well mr tulliver said she you know best  but hadnt i better kill a couple o fowl and have th aunts and uncles to dinner next week so as you may hear what sister glegg and sister pullet have got to say about it  theres a couple o fowl wants killing  you may kill every fowl i the yard if you like bessy but i shall ask neither aunt nor uncle what im to do wi my own lad said mr tulliver  dear heart said mrs tulliver how can you talk so mr tulliver however if toms to go to a new school i should like him to go where i can wash him and mend him else he might as well have calico as linen for theyd be one as yallow as th other before theyd been washed half a dozen times  and then when the box is goin backards and forrards i could send the lad a cake or a porkpie or an apple  well well we wont send him out o reach o the carriers cart if other things fit in said mr tulliver  but you mustnt put a spoke i the wheel about the washin if we cant get a school near enough but its an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school to pick  mr tulliver paused a minute or two and dived with both hands into his pockets as if he hoped to find some idea there  then he said i know what ill do ill talk it over wi riley  hes coming tomorrow  well mr tulliver ive put the sheets out for the best bed and kezias got em hanging at the fire  they arent the best sheets but theyre good enough for anybody to sleep in be he who he will  as mrs tulliver spoke she drew a bright bunch of keys from her pocket and singled out one rubbing her thumb and finger up and down it with a placid smile while she looked at the clear fire  i think ive hit it bessy said mr tulliver after a short silence rileys as likely a man as any to know o some school hes had schooling himself an goes about to all sorts o placesauctioneering and vallyin and that  i want tom to be such a sort o man as riley you knowas can talk pretty nigh as well as if it was all wrote out for him and a good solid knowledge o business too  well said mrs tulliver so far as talking proper and knowing everything and walking with a bend in his back and setting his hair up i shouldnt mind the lad being brought up to that  but them finetalking men from the big towns mostly wear the false shirtfronts they wear a frill till its all a mess and then hide it with a bibi know riley does  and then if toms to go and live at mudport like riley hell have a house with a kitchen hardly big enough to turn in an niver get a fresh egg for his breakfast an sleep up three pair o stairsor four for what i knowan be burnt to death before he can get down     no no said mr tulliver ive no thoughts of his going to mudport i mean him to set up his office at st oggs close by us an live at home  i doubt toms a bit slowish  he takes after your family bessy  yes that he does said mrs tulliver hes wonderful for liking a deal o salt in his broth  that was my brothers way and my fathers before him  it seems a bit of a pity though said mr tulliver as the lad should take after the mothers side instead o the little wench  the little un takes after my side now shes twice as cute as tom  yes mr tulliver and it all runs to naughtiness  how to keep her in a clean pinafore two hours together passes my cunning  an now you put me i mind continued mrs tulliver rising and going to the window i dont know where she is now an its pretty nigh teatime  ah i thought sothere she is wanderin up an down by the water like a wild thing  shell tumble in some day  mrs tulliver rapped the window sharply beckoned and shook her head  you talk o cuteness mr tulliver she said as she sat down but im sure the childs very slow i some things for if i send her upstairs to fetch anything she forgets what shes gone for  pooh nonsense said mr tulliver  shes a straight blackeyed wench as anybody need wish to see and she can read almost as well as the parson  but her hair wont curl all i can do with it and shes so franzy about having it put i paper and ive such work as never was to make her stand and have it pinched with th irons  cut it offcut it off short said the father rashly  how can you talk so mr tulliver  shes too big a gellgone nine and tall of her ageto have her hair cut shortmaggie maggie continued the mother as the child herself entered the room wheres the use o my telling you to keep away from the water  youll tumble in and be drownded some day and then youll be sorry you didnt do as mother told you  maggie threw off her bonnet  now mrs tulliver desiring her daughter to have a curled crop had had it cut too short in front to be pushed behind the ears and as it was usually straight an hour after it had been taken out of paper maggie was incessantly tossing her head to keep the dark heavy locks out of her gleaming black eyes  oh dear oh dear maggie what are you thinkin of to throw your bonnet down there  take it upstairs theres a good gell an let your hair be brushed an put your other pinafore on an change your shoesdo for shame an come and go on with your patchwork like a little lady  o mother said maggie in a very cross tone i dont want to do my patchwork  what not your pretty patchwork to make a counterpane for your aunt glegg  its silly work said maggie with a toss of her manetearing things to pieces to sew em together again  and i dont want to sew anything for my aunt glegg i dont like her  exit maggie drawing her bonnet by the string while mr tulliver laughs audibly  i wonder at you as youll laugh at her mr tulliver said the mother  an her aunts will have it as its me spoils her     chapter ii  the choice of a school  mr riley who came next day was a gentleman with a waxen face and fat hands  he talked with his host for some time about the water supply to dorlcote mill  then after a short silence mr tulliver changed the subject  theres a thing ive got i my head said he at last in rather a lower tone than usual as he turned his head and looked at his companion  ah said mr riley in a tone of mild interest  its a very particular thing mr tulliver went on its about my boy tom  at the sound of this name maggie who was seated on a low stool close by the fire with a large book open on her lap shook her heavy hair back and looked up eagerly  you see i want to put him to a new school at midsummer said mr tulliver  hes comin away from the cademy at lady day an i shall let him run loose for a quarter but after that i want to send him to a downright good school where theyll make a scholard of him  well said mr riley theres no greater advantage you can give him than a good education  i dont mean tom to be a miller and farmer said mr tulliver i see no fun i that  why if i made him a miller hed be expectin to take the mill an the land an ahinting at me as it was time for me to lay by  nay nay ive seen enough o that wi sons  these words cut maggie to the quick  tom was supposed capable of turning his father out of doors  this was not to be borne and maggie jumped up from her stool forgetting all about her heavy book which fell with a bang within the fender and going up between her fathers knees said in a halfcrying halfangry voice  father tom wouldnt be naughty to you ever i know he wouldnt  what they mustnt say any harm o tom eh said mr tulliver looking at maggie with a twinkling eye  then he added gently go go and see after your mother  did you ever hear the like ont said mr tulliver as maggie retired its a pity but what shed been the lad  mr riley laughed took a pinch of snuff and said  but your lads not stupid is he said mr riley  i saw him when i was here last busy making fishingtackle he seemed quite up to it  well he isnt stupid  hes got a notion o things out o door an a sort o common sense and hell lay hold o things by the right handle but hes slow with his tongue you see and he reads but poorly and cant abide the books and spells all wrong they tell me an you never hear him say cute things like the little wench  now what i want is to send him to a school where theyll make him a bit nimble with his tongue and his pen and make a smart chap of him  youre quite in the right of it tulliver observed mr riley better spend an extra hundred or two on your sons education than leave it him in your will  i dare say now you know of a school as ud be just the thing for tom said mr tulliver  mr riley took a pinch of snuff and waited a little before he said  i know of a very fine chance for any one thats got the necessary money and thats what you have tulliver  but if any one wanted his boy to be placed under a firstrate fellow i know his man  hes an oxford man and a parson  hes willing to take one or two boys as pupils to fill up his time  the boys would be quite of the familythe finest thing in the world for themunder stellings eye continually  but do you think theyd give the poor lad twice o pudding said mrs tulliver who was now in her place again  and what money ud he want said mr tulliver  stelling is moderate in his terms hes not a grasping man said mr riley  ive no doubt hed take your boy at a hundred  ill write to him about it if you like  mr tulliver rubbed his knees and looked at the carpet  but belike hes a bachelor observed mrs tulliver an ive no opinion o housekeepers  it ud break my heart to send tom where theres a housekeeper an i hope you wont think of it mr tulliver  you may set your mind at rest on that score mrs tulliver said mr riley for stelling is married to as nice a little woman as any man need wish for a wife  there isnt a kinder little soul in the world  father broke in maggie who had stolen to her fathers elbow again listening with parted lips while she held her doll topsyturvy and crushed its nose against the wood of the chairfather is it a long way off where tom is to go  shant we ever go to see him  i dont know my wench said the father tenderly  ask mr riley he knows  maggie came round promptly in front of mr riley and said how far is it please sir  oh a long long way off that gentleman answered  you must borrow the sevenleagued boots to get to him  thats nonsense said maggie tossing her head and turning away with the tears springing to her eyes  hush maggie for shame of you chattering so said her mother come and sit down on your little stool and hold your tongue do but added mrs tulliver who had her own alarm awakened is it so far off as i couldnt wash him and mend him  about fifteen miles thats all said mr riley  you can drive there and back in a day quite comfortably  orstelling is a kind pleasant manhed be glad to have you stay  but its too far off for the linen i doubt said mrs tulliver sadly     chapter iii  tom comes home  tom was to arrive early one afternoon and there was another fluttering heart besides maggies when it was late enough for the sound of the gig wheels to be expected for if mrs tulliver had a strong feeling it was fondness for her boy  at last the sound came and in spite of the wind which was blowing the clouds about and was not likely to respect mrs tullivers curls and capstrings she came and stood outside the door with her hand on maggies head  there he is my sweet lad  but hes got never a collar on its been lost on the road ill be bound and spoilt the set  mrs tulliver stood with her arms open maggie jumped first on one leg and then on the other while tom stepped down from the gig and said hallo yap what are you there  then he allowed himself to be kissed willingly enough though maggie hung on his neck in rather a strangling fashion while his blue eyes wandered towards the croft and the lambs and the river where he promised himself that he would begin to fish the first thing tomorrow morning  he was a lad with light brown hair cheeks of cream and roses and full lips  maggie said tom taking her into a corner as soon as his mother was gone out to examine his box you dont know what ive got in my pockets nodding his head up and down as a means of rousing her sense of mystery  no said maggie  how stodgy they look tom  is it marls marbles or cobnuts  maggies heart sank a little because tom always said it was no good playing with her at those games she played so badly  marls no  ive swopped all my marls with the little fellows and cobnuts are no fun you sillyonly when the nuts are green  but see here  he drew something out of his righthand pocket  what is it said maggie in a whisper  i can see nothing but a bit of yellow  why its a new  guess maggie  oh i cant guess tom said maggie impatiently  dont be a spitfire else i wont tell you said tom thrusting his hand back into his pocket  no tom said maggie laying hold of the arm that was held stiffly in the pocket  im not cross tom it was only because i cant bear guessing  please be good to me  toms arm slowly relaxed and he said well then its a new fishlinetwo new unsone for you maggie all to yourself  i wouldnt go halves in the toffee and gingerbread on purpose to save the money and gibson and spouncer fought with me because i wouldnt  and heres hooks see here  i say wont we go and fish tomorrow down by round pond  and you shall catch your own fish and put the worms on and everything  wont it be fun  maggies answer was to throw her arms round toms neck and hug him and hold her cheek against his without speaking while he slowly unwound some of the line saying after a pause  wasnt i a good brother now to buy you a line all to yourself  you know i neednt have bought it if i hadnt liked  yes very very good  i do love you tom  tom had put the line back in his pocket and was looking at the hooks one by one before he spoke again  and the fellows fought me because i wouldnt give in about the toffee  oh dear  i wish they wouldnt fight at your school tom  didnt it hurt you  hurt me  no said tom putting up the hooks again  then he took out a large pocketknife and slowly opened the largest blade and rubbed his finger along it  at last he said  i gave spouncer a black eye i knowthats what he got by wanting to leather me i wasnt going to go halves because anybody leathered me  oh how brave you are tom  i think youre like samson  if there came a lion roaring at me i think youd fight him wouldnt you tom  how can a lion come roaring at you you silly thing  theres no lionsonly in the shows  no but if we were in the lion countriesi mean in africa where its very hotthe lions eat people there  i can show it you in the book where i read it  well i should get a gun and shoot him  but if you hadnt got a gun  we might have gone out you know not thinking just as we go fishing and then a great lion might run towards us roaring and we couldnt get away from him  what should you do tom  tom paused and at last turned away saying  but the lion isnt coming  whats the use of talking  but i like to fancy how it would be said maggie following him just think what you would do tom  oh dont bother maggie youre such a silly  i shall go and see my rabbits  upon this maggies heart began to flutter with fear for she had bad news for tom  she dared not tell the sad truth at once but she walked after tom in trembling silence as he went out  tom she said timidly when they were out of doors how much money did you give for your rabbits  two halfcrowns and a sixpence said tom promptly  i think ive got a great deal more than that in my steel purse upstairs  ill ask mother to give it you  what for said tom  i dont want your money you silly thing  ive got a great deal more money than you because im a boy  well but tom if mother would let me give you two halfcrowns and a sixpence out of my purse to put into your pocket and spend you know and buy some more rabbits with it  more rabbits  i dont want any more  oh but tom theyre all dead  tom stopped and turned round towards maggie  you forgot to feed em then and harry forgot he said his colour rising for a moment ill pitch into harryill have him turned away  and i dont love you maggie  you shant go fishing with me tomorrow  i told you to go and see the rabbits every day  he walked on again  yes but i forgot and i couldnt help it indeed tom  im so very sorry said maggie while the tears rushed fast  youre a naughty girl said tom severely and im sorry i bought you the fishline  i dont love you  o tom its very cruel sobbed maggie  id forgive you if you forgot anythingi wouldnt mind what you didid forgive you and love you  yes youre a silly but i never do forget thingsi dont  oh please forgive me tom my heart will break said maggie shaking with sobs clinging to toms arm and laying her wet cheek on his shoulder  tom shook her off  now maggie you just listen  arent i a good brother to you  yeyees sobbed maggie  didnt i think about your fishline all this quarter and mean to buy it and saved my money o purpose and wouldnt go halves in the toffee and spouncer fought me because i wouldnt  yeyeesand ilololove you so tom  but youre a naughty girl  last holidays you licked the paint off my lozengebox and the holidays before that you let the boat drag my fishline down when id set you to watch it and you pushed your head through my kite all for nothing  but i didnt mean said maggie i couldnt help it  yes you could said tom if youd minded what you were doing  and youre a naughty girl and you shant go fishing with me tomorrow  with this tom ran away from maggie towards the mill meaning to greet luke there and complain to him of harry  oh he is cruel maggie sobbed aloud  she would stay up in the attic and starve herselfhide herself behind the tub and stay there all night and then they would all be frightened and tom would be sorry  thus maggie thought in the pride of her heart as she crept behind the tub but presently she began to cry again at the idea that they didnt mind her being there  meanwhile tom was too much interested in his talk with luke and in going the round of the mill to think of maggie at all  but when he had been called in to tea his father said why wheres the little wench  and mrs tulliver almost at the same moment said wheres your little sister  i dont know said tom  he didnt want to tell of maggie though he was angry with her for tom tulliver was a lad of honour  what hasnt she been playing with you all this while said the father  shed been thinking o nothing but your coming home  i havent seen her this two hours says tom  goodness heart shes got drownded exclaimed mrs tulliver rising from her seat and running to the window  nay nay shes none drownded said mr tulliveryouve been naughty to her i doubt tom  im sure i havent father said tom quickly  i think shes in the house  perhaps up in that attic said mrs tulliver asinging and talking to herself and forgetting all about mealtimes  you go and fetch her down tom said mr tulliver rather sharply and be good to her do you hear  else ill let you know better  maggie who had taken refuge in the attic knew toms step and her heart began to beat with the shock of hope  but he only stood still on the top of the stairs and said maggie youre to come down  then she rushed to him and clung round his neck sobbing o tom please forgive me  i cant bear it  i will always be goodalways remember things  do love meplease dear tom  and the boy quite forgot his desire to punish her as much as she deserved he actually began to kiss her in return and say  dont cry then magsie here eat a bit o cake  maggies sobs began to subside and she put out her mouth for the cake and bit a piece and then tom bit a piece just for company and they ate together and rubbed each others cheeks and brows and noses together while they ate like two friendly ponies  come along magsie and have tea said tom at last  so ended the sorrows of this day and the next morning maggie was to be seen trotting out with her own fishingrod in one hand and a handle of the basket in the other  she had told tom however that she should like him to put the worms on the hook for her  they were on their way to the round poolthat wonderful pool which the floods had made a long while ago  the sight of the old spot always heightened toms goodhumour and he opened the basket and prepared their tackle  he threw maggies line for her and put the rod into her hand  she thought it probable that the small fish would come to her hook and the large ones to toms  but after a few moments she had forgotten all about the fish and was looking dreamily at the glassy water when tom said in a loud whisper look look maggie and came running to prevent her from snatching her line away  maggie was frightened lest she had been doing something wrong as usual but presently tom drew out her line and brought a large tench bouncing out upon the grass  tom was excited  o magsie you little duck  empty the basket  maggie did not know how clever she had been but it was quite enough that tom called her magsie and was pleased with her  there was nothing to mar her delight in the whispers and the dreamy silences when she listened to the light dipping sounds of the rising fish and the gentle rustling as if the willows and the reeds and the water had their happy whisperings also  maggie thought it would make a very nice heaven to sit by the pool in that way and never be scolded  she never knew she had a bite until tom told her it is true but she liked fishing very much  it was one of their happy mornings  they trotted along and sat down together with no thought that life would ever change much for them they would only get bigger and not go to school and it would always be like the holidays they would always live together and be very very fond of each other     chapter iv  all about a jam puff  it was easter week and mrs tullivers cheesecakes were even more light than usual so that no season could have been better for a family party to consult sister glegg and sister pullet and sister deane about toms going to school  on wednesday the day before the aunts and uncles were coming tom and maggie made several inroads into the kitchen where great preparations were being made and were induced to keep aloof for a time only by being allowed to carry away some of the good things to eat  tom said maggie as they sat on the boughs of the elder tree eating their jam puffs shall you run away tomorrow  no said tom slowlyno i shant  why tom  because lucys coming  no said tom opening his pocketknife and holding it over the last jam puff with his head on one side  what do i care about lucy shes only a girl she cant play at bandy  is it the tipsycake then said maggie while she leaned forward towards tom with her eyes fixed on the knife  no you silly thatll be good the day after  its the pudding  i know what the puddings to beapricot rollupoh my buttons  with this the knife came down on the puff and in a moment that dainty lay in two but the result was not pleasing to tom and after a few moments thought he said  shut your eyes maggie  what for  you never mind what for  shut em when i tell you  maggie obeyed  now whichll you have maggieright hand or left  ill have that with the jam run out said maggie keeping her eyes shut to please tom  why you dont like that you silly  you may have it if it comes to you fair but i shant give it you without  right or leftyou choose now  haaa said tom as maggie peeped  you keep your eyes shut now else you shant have any  so maggie shut her eyes quite close till tom told her to say which and then she said left hand  youve got it said tom in rather a bitter tone  what the bit with the jam run out  no here take it said tom firmly handing the best piece to maggie  oh please tom have it  i dont mind i like the other  please take this  no i shant said tom almost crossly  maggie began to eat up her half puff with great relish but tom had finished his own first and had to look on while maggie ate her last morsel or two without noticing that tom was looking at her  oh you greedy thing said tom when she had eaten the last morsel  maggie turned quite pale  o tom why didnt you ask me  i wasnt going to ask you for a bit you greedy  you might have thought of it without when you knew i gave you the best bit  but i wanted you to have ityou know i did said maggie in an injured tone  yes but i wasnt going to do what wasnt fair  but if i go halves ill go em faironly i wouldnt be a greedy  with this tom jumped down from his bough and threw a stone with a hoigh to yap who had also been looking on wistfully while the jam puff vanished  maggie sat still on her bough and gave herself up to misery  she would have given the world not to have eaten all her puff and to have saved some of it for tom  not but that the puff was very nice but she would have gone without it many times over sooner than tom should call her greedy and be cross with her  and he had said he wouldnt have it and she ate it without thinking how could she help it  the tears flowed so plentifully that maggie saw nothing around her for the next ten minutes then she jumped from her bough to look for tom  he was no longer near her nor in the paddock behind the rickyard  where was he likely to be gone and yap with him  maggie ran to the high bank against the great hollytree where she could see far away towards the floss  there was tom in the distance but her heart sank again as she saw how far off he was on his way to the great river and that he had another companion besides yapnaughty bob jakin whose task of frightening the birds was just now at a standstill  it must be owned that tom was fond of bobs company  how could it be otherwise  bob knew directly he saw a birds egg whether it was a swallows or a tomtits or a yellowhammers he found out all the wasps nests and could set all sorts of traps he could climb the trees like a squirrel and had quite a magical power of finding hedgehogs and stoats and every holidaytime maggie was sure to have days of grief because tom had gone off with bob  well there was no help for it  he was gone now and maggie could think of no comfort but to sit down by the holly or wander lonely by the hedgerow nursing her grief     chapter v  the family party  on the day of the family party aunt glegg was the first to arrive and she was followed not long afterwards by aunt pullet and her husband  maggie and tom on their part thought their aunt pullet tolerable because she was not their aunt glegg  tom always declined to go more than once during his holidays to see either of them  both his uncles tipped him that once of course but at his aunt pullets there were a great many toads to pelt in the cellararea so that he preferred the visit to her  maggie disliked the toads and dreamed of them horribly but she liked her uncle pullets musical snuffbox  when maggie and tom came in from the garden with their father and their uncle glegg they found that aunt deane and cousin lucy had also arrived  maggie had thrown her bonnet off very carelessly and coming in with her hair rough as well as out of curl rushed at once to lucy who was standing by her mothers knee  lucy put up the neatest little rosebud mouth to be kissed  everything about her was neather little round neck with the row of coral beads her little straight nose not at all snubby her little clear eyebrows rather darker than her curls to match her hazel eyes which looked up with shy pleasure at maggie taller by the head though scarcely a year older  o lucy burst out maggie after kissing her youll stay with tom and me wont youoh kiss her tom  tom too had come up to lucy but he was not going to kiss herno he came up to her with maggie because it seemed easier on the whole than saying how do you do to all those aunts and uncles  heyday said aunt glegg loudly  do little boys and gells come into a room without taking notice o their uncles and aunts  that wasnt the way when i was a little gell  go and speak to your aunts and uncles my dears said mrs tulliver she wanted also to whisper to maggie a command to go and have her hair brushed  well and how do you do  and i hope youre good childrenare you said aunt glegg in the same loud way as she took their hands hurting them with her large rings and kissing their cheeks much against their desire  look up tom look up  boys as go to boardingschools should hold their heads up  look at me now  tom would not do so and tried to draw his hand away  put your hair behind your ears maggie and keep your frock on your shoulder  aunt glegg always spoke to them in this loud way as if she thought them quite deaf or perhaps rather silly  well my dears said aunt pullet sadly you grow wonderful fasti doubt theyll outgrow their strength she added looking over their heads at their mother  i think the gell has too much hair  id have it thinned and cut shorter sister if i was you  it isnt good for her health  its that as makes her skin so brown i shouldnt wonderdont you think so sister deane  i cant say im sure sister said mrs deane  no no said mr tulliver the childs healthy enoughtheres nothing ails her  theres red wheat as well as white for that matter and some like the dark grain best  but it ud be as well if bessy ud have the childs hair cut so as it ud lie smooth  maggie now wished to learn from her aunt deane whether she would leave lucy behind to stay at the mill  aunt deane would hardly ever let lucy come to see them to maggies great regret  you wouldnt like to stay behind without mother should you lucy she said to her little daughter  yes please mother said lucy timidly blushing very pink all over her little neck  well done lucylet her stay mrs deane let her stay said mr deane a large man who held a silver snuffbox very tightly in his hand and now and then exchanged a pinch with mr tulliver  maggie said mrs tulliver beckoning maggie to her and whispering in her ear as soon as this point of lucys staying was settled go and get your hair brusheddo for shame  i told you not to come in without going to martha first you know i did  tom come out with me whispered maggie pulling his sleeve as she passed him and tom followed willingly enough  come upstairs with me tom she whispered when they were outside the door  theres something i want to do before dinner  theres no time to play at anything before dinner said tom  oh yes there is time for this  do come tom  tom followed maggie upstairs into her mothers room and saw her go at once to a drawer from which she took a large pair of scissors  what are they for maggie said tom  maggie answered by seizing her front locks and cutting them straight across the middle of her forehead  oh my buttons maggie youll catch it exclaimed tom youd better not cut any more off  snip went the great scissors again while tom was speaking and he couldnt help feeling it was rather good funmaggie would look so queer  here tom cut it behind for me said maggie much excited  youll catch it you know said tom as he took the scissors  never mind make haste said maggie giving a little stamp with her foot  her cheeks were quite flushed  one delicious grinding snip and then another and another  the hinder locks fell heavily on the floor and soon maggie stood cropped in a jagged uneven manner  o maggie said tom jumping round her and slapping his knees as he laughedoh my buttons what a queer thing you look  look at yourself in the glass  maggie felt an unexpected pang  she didnt want her hair to look prettyshe only wanted people to think her a clever little girl and not to find fault with her untidy head  but now when tom began to laugh at her the affair had quite a new aspect  she looked in the glass and still tom laughed and clapped his hands while maggies flushed cheeks began to pale and her lips to tremble a little  o maggie youll have to go down to dinner directly said tom  oh my  dont laugh at me tom said maggie with an outburst of angry tears stamping and giving him a push  now then spitfire said tom  what did you cut it off for then i shall go down i can smell the dinner going in  he hurried downstairs at once  maggie could see clearly enough now the thing was done that it was very foolish and that she should have to hear and think more about her hair than ever  as she stood crying before the glass she felt it impossible to go down to dinner and endure the severe eyes and severe words of her aunts while tom and lucy and martha who waited at table and perhaps her father and her uncles would laugh at herfor if tom had laughed at her of course every one else would and if she had only let her hair alone she could have sat with tom and lucy and had the apricot pudding and the custard  miss maggie youre to come down this minute said kezia entering the room after a few moments  lawks what have you been adoing  i niver see such a fright  dont kezia said maggie angrily  go away  but i tell you youre to come down miss this minute your mother says so said kezia going up to maggie and taking her by the hand to raise her from the floor on which she had thrown herself  get away kezia i dont want any dinner said maggie resisting kezias arm  i shant come  oh well i cant stay  ive got to wait at dinner said kezia going out again  maggie you little silly said tom peeping into the room ten minutes later why dont you come and have your dinner  theres lots o goodies and mother says youre to come  oh it was dreadful  tom was so hard  if he had been crying on the floor maggie would have cried too  and there was the dinner so nice and she was so hungry  it was very bitter  but tom was not altogether hard  he was not inclined to cry but he went and put his head near her and said in a lower comforting tone  wont you come then magsie  shall i bring you a bit o pudding when ive had mine and a custard and things  yeees said maggie beginning to feel life a little more tolerable  very well said tom going away  but he turned again at the door and said but youd better come you know  theres the dessertnuts you know and cowslip wine  slowly she rose from amongst her scattered locks and slowly she made her way downstairs  then she stood leaning with one shoulder against the frame of the diningparlour door peeping in as it stood ajar  she saw tom and lucy with an empty chair between them and there were the custards on a sidetable  it was too much  she slipped in and went towards the empty chair  but she had no sooner sat down than she wished herself back again  mrs tulliver gave a little scream as she saw her and felt such a turn that she dropped the large gravyspoon into the dish with the most serious results to the tablecloth  mrs tullivers scream made all eyes turn towards the same point as her own and maggies cheeks and ears began to burn while uncle glegg a kindlooking whitehaired old gentleman said  heyday  what little gells this  why i dont know her  is it some little gell youve picked up in the road kezia  why shes gone and cut her hair herself said mr tulliver in an undertone to mr deane laughing with much enjoyment  did you ever know such a little hussy as it is  why little miss youve made yourself look very funny said uncle pullet  fie for shame said aunt glegg in her loudest tone  little gells as cut their own hair should be whipped and fed on bread and waternot come and sit down with their aunts and uncles  ay ay said uncle glegg playfully she must be sent to jail i think and theyll cut the rest off there and make it all even  shes more like a gipsy nor ever said aunt pullet in a pitying tone its very bad luck sister as the gell should be so brown the boys fair enough  i doubt itll stand in her way i life to be so brown  shes a naughty child asll break her mothers heart said mrs tulliver with the tears in her eyes  oh my maggie whispered tom i told you youd catch it  the childs heart swelled and getting up from her chair she ran to her father hid her face on his shoulder and burst out into loud sobbing  come come my wench said her father soothingly putting his arm round her never mind you was i the right to cut it off if it plagued you  give over crying fatherll take your part  how your husband does spoil that child bessy said mrs glegg in a loud aside to mrs tulliver  itll be the ruin of her if you dont take care  my father niver brought his children up so else we should ha been a different sort o family to what we are  mrs tulliver took no notice of her sisters remark but threw back her capstrings and served the pudding in silence  when the dessert came the children were told they might have their nuts and wine in the summerhouse since the day was so mild and they scampered out among the budding bushes of the garden like small animals getting from under a burningglass     chapter vi  the magic music  the children were to pay an afternoon visit on the following day to aunt pullet at garum firs where they would hear uncle pullets musicalbox  already at twelve oclock mrs tulliver had on her visiting costume maggie was frowning and twisting her shoulders that she might if possible shrink away from the prickliest of tuckers while her mother was saying dont maggie my deardont look so ugly  toms cheeks were looking very red against his best blue suit in the pockets of which he had to his great joy stowed away all the contents of his everyday pockets  as for lucy she was just as pretty and neat as she had been yesterday and she looked with wondering pity at maggie pouting and writhing under the tucker  while waiting for the time to set out they were allowed to build cardhouses as a suitable amusement for boys and girls in their best clothes  tom could build splendid houses but maggies would never bear the laying on of the roof  it was always so with the things that maggie made and tom said that no girls could ever make anything  but it happened that lucy was very clever at building she handled the cards so lightly and moved so gently that tom admired her houses as well as his ownthe more readily because she had asked him to teach her  maggie too would have admired lucys houses if tom had not laughed when her houses fell and told her that she was a stupid  dont laugh at me tom she burst out angrily  im not a stupid  i know a great many things you dont  oh i dare say miss spitfire  id never be such a cross thing as youmaking faces like that  lucy doesnt do so  i like lucy better than you  i wish lucy was my sister  then its wicked and cruel of you to wish so said maggie starting up from her place on the floor and upsetting toms wonderful pagoda she really did not mean it but appearances were against her and tom turned white with anger but said nothing  he would have struck her only he knew it was cowardly to strike a girl  maggie stood in dismay and terror while tom got up from the floor and walked away  lucy looked on mutely like a kitten pausing from its lapping  o tom said maggie at last going halfway towards him i didnt mean to knock it downindeed indeed i didnt  tom took no notice of her but took instead two or three hard peas out of his pocket and shot them with his thumbnail against the window with the object of hitting a bluebottle which was sporting in the spring sunshine  thus the morning had been very sad to maggie and when at last they set out toms coldness to her all through their walk spoiled the fresh air and sunshine for her  he called lucy to look at the halfbuilt birds nest without caring to show it to maggie and peeled a willow switch for lucy and himself without offering one to maggie  lucy had said maggie shouldnt you like one but tom was deaf  still the sight of the peacock spreading his tail on the stackyard wall just as they reached the aunts house was enough to turn the mind from sadness  and this was only the beginning of beautiful sights at garum firs  all the farmyard life was wonderful therebantams speckled and topknotted friesland hens with their feathers all turned the wrong way guineafowls that flew and screamed and dropped their prettyspotted feathers pouter pigeons and a tame magpie nay a goat and a wonderful dog half mastiff half bulldog as large as a lion  uncle pullet had seen the party from the window and made haste to unbar and unchain the front door  aunt pullet too appeared at the doorway and as soon as her sister was within hearing said stop the children bessy dont let em come up the doorsteps  sallys bringing the old mat and the duster to rub their shoes  you must come with me into the best room she went on as soon as her guests had passed the portal  may the children come too sister inquired mrs tulliver who saw that maggie and lucy were looking rather eager  well said aunt pullet itll perhaps be safer for the girls to come theyll be touching something if we leave em behind  when they all came down again uncle pullet said that he reckoned the missis had been showing her bonnetthat was what had made them so long upstairs  meanwhile tom had spent the time on the edge of the sofa directly opposite his uncle pullet who looked at him with twinkling gray eyes and spoke to him as young sir  well young sir what do you learn at school was the usual question with uncle pullet whereupon tom always looked sheepish rubbed his hand across his face and answered i dont know  the appearance of the little girls made uncle pullet think of some small sweetcakes of which he kept a stock under lock and key for his own private eating on wet days but the three children had no sooner got them between their fingers than aunt pullet desired them to abstain from eating till the tray and the plates came since with those crisp cakes they would make the floor all over crumbs  lucy didnt mind that much for the cake was so pretty she thought it was rather a pity to eat it but tom watching his chance while the elders were talking hastily stowed his own cake in his mouth at two bites  as for maggie she presently let fall her cake and by an unlucky movement crushed it beneath her foota source of such disgrace to her that she began to despair of hearing the musical snuffbox today till it occurred to her that lucy was in high favour enough to venture on asking for a tune  so she whispered to lucy and lucy who always did what she was asked to do went up quietly to her uncles knee and blushing all over her neck while she fingered her necklace said will you please play us a tune uncle  but uncle pullet never gave a too ready consent  well see about it was the answer he always gave waiting till a suitable number of minutes had passed  perhaps the waiting increased maggies enjoyment when the tune began for the first time she quite forgot that she had a load on her mindthat tom was angry with her and by the time hush ye pretty warbling choir had been played her face wore that bright look of happiness while she sat still with her hands clasped which sometimes comforted her mother that maggie could look pretty now and then in spite of her brown skin  but when the magic music ceased she jumped up and running towards tom put her arm round his neck and said o tom isnt it pretty  now tom had his glass of cowslip wine in his hand and maggie jerked him so as to make him spill half of it  he would have been an extreme milksop if he had not said angrily look there now  why dont you sit still maggie her mother said peevishly  little gells mustnt come to see me if they behave in that way said aunt pullet  why youre too rough little miss said uncle pullet  poor maggie sat down again with the music all chased out of her soul  mrs tulliver wisely took an early opportunity of suggesting that now they were rested after their walk the children might go and play out of doors and aunt pullet gave them leave only telling them not to go off the paved walks in the garden and if they wanted to see the poultry fed to view them from a distance on the horseblock  for a long time after the children had gone out the elders sat deep in talk about family matters till at last mrs pullet observing that it was teatime turned to reach from a drawer a fine damask napkin which she pinned before her in the fashion of an apron  then the door was thrown open but instead of the teatray sally brought in an object so startling that both mrs pullet and mrs tulliver gave a scream causing uncle pullet to swallow a lozenge he was suckingfor the fifth time in his life as he afterwards noted  the startling object was no other than little lucy with one side of her person from her small foot to her bonnetcrown wet and discoloured with mud holding out two tiny blackened hands and making a very piteous face     chapter vii  maggie is very naughty  as soon as the children reached the open air tom said here lucy you come along with me and walked off to the place where the toads were as if there were no maggie in existence  lucy was naturally pleased that cousin tom was so good to her and it was very amusing to see him tickling a fat toad with a piece of string when the toad was safe down the area with an iron grating over him  still lucy wished maggie to enjoy the sight also especially as she would doubtless find a name for the toad and say what had been his past history for lucy loved maggies stories about the live things they came upon by accidenthow mrs earwig had a wash at home and one of her children had fallen into the hot copper for which reason she was running so fast to fetch the doctor  so now the desire to know the history of a very portly toad made her run back to maggie and say oh there is such a big funny toad maggie  do come and see  maggie said nothing but turned away from her with a deep frown  she was actually beginning to think that she should like to make lucy cry by slapping or pinching her especially as it might vex tom whom it was of no use to slap even if she dared because he didnt mind it and if lucy hadnt been there maggie was sure he would have made friends with her sooner  tickling a fat toad is an amusement that does not last and tom byandby began to look round for some other mode of passing the time but in so prim a garden where they were not to go off the paved walks there was not a great choice of sport  i say lucy he began nodding his head up and down as he coiled up his string again what do you think i mean to do  what tom said lucy  i mean to go to the pond and look at the pike  you may go with me if you like  o tom dare you said lucy  aunt said we mustnt go out of the garden  oh i shall go out at the other end of the garden said tom  nobody ull see us  besides i dont care if they do ill run off home  but i couldnt run said lucy  oh never mind they wont be cross with you said tom  you say i took you  tom walked along and lucy trotted by his side  maggie saw them leaving the garden and could not resist the impulse to follow  she kept a few yards behind them unseen by tom who was watching for the pikea highly interesting monster he was said to be so very old so very large and to have such a great appetite  here lucy he said in a loud whisper come here  lucy came carefully as she was bidden and bent down to look at what seemed a golden arrowhead darting through the water  it was a watersnake tom told her and lucy at last could see the wave of its body wondering very much that a snake could swim  maggie had drawn nearer and nearer she must see it too though it was bitter to her like everything else since tom did not care about her seeing it  at last she was close by lucy and tom turned round and said  now get away maggie  theres no room for you on the grass here nobody asked you to come  then maggie with a fierce thrust of her small brown arm pushed poor little pinkandwhite lucy into the cowtrodden mud  tom could not restrain himself and gave maggie two smart slaps on the arm as he ran to pick up lucy who lay crying helplessly  maggie retreated to the roots of a tree a few yards off and looked on  why should she be sorry  tom was very slow to forgive her however sorry she might have been  i shall tell mother you know miss mag said tom as soon as lucy was up and ready to walk away  it was not toms practice to tell but here justice clearly demanded that maggie should be visited with the utmost punishment  sally said tom when they reached the kitchen doorsally tell mother it was maggie pushed lucy into the mud  sally as we have seen lost no time in presenting lucy at the parlour door  goodness gracious aunt pullet exclaimed after giving a scream keep her at the door sally  dont bring her off the oilcloth whatever you do  why shes tumbled into some nasty mud said mrs tulliver going up to lucy  if you please um it was miss maggie as pushed her in said sally master toms been and said so and they must ha been to the pond for its only there they could ha got into such dirt  there it is bessy its what ive been telling you said mrs pullet  its your children theres no knowing what theyll come to  mrs tulliver went out to speak to these naughty children supposing them to be close at hand but it was not until after some search that she found tom leaning with rather a careless air against the white paling of the poultryyard and lowering his piece of string on the other side as a means of teasing the turkeycock  tom you naughty boy wheres your sister said mrs tulliver in a distressed voice  i dont know said tom  why where did you leave her said his mother looking round  sitting under the tree against the pond said tom  then go and fetch her in this minute you naughty boy  and how could you think o going to the pond and taking your sister where there was dirt  you know shell do mischief if theres mischief to be done  the idea of maggie sitting alone by the pond roused a fear in mrs tullivers mind and she mounted the horseblock to satisfy herself by a sight of that fatal child while tom walkednot very quicklyon his way towards her  theyre such children for the water mine are she said aloud without reflecting that there was no one to hear her theyll be brought in dead and drownded some day  i wish that river was far enough  but when she not only failed to see maggie but presently saw tom returning from the pond alone she hurried to meet him  maggies nowhere about the pond mother said tom shes gone away     chapter viii  maggie and the gipsies  after tom and lucy had walked away maggies quick mind formed a plan which was not so simple as that of going home  no she would run away and go to the gipsies and tom should never see her any more  she had been often told she was like a gipsy and half wild so now she would go and live in a little brown tent on the common  the gipsies she considered would gladly receive her and pay her much respect on account of her superior knowledge  she had once mentioned her views on this point to tom and suggested that he should stain his face brown and they should run away together but tom rejected the scheme with contempt observing that gipsies were thieves and hardly got anything to eat and had nothing to drive but a donkey  today however maggie thought her misery had reached a pitch at which gipsydom was her only refuge and she rose from her seat on the roots of the tree with the sense that this was a great crisis in her life  she would run straight away till she came to dunlow common where there would certainly be gipsies and cruel tom and the rest of her relations who found fault with her should never see her any more  she thought of her father as she ran along but made up her mind that she would secretly send him a letter by a small gipsy who would run away without telling where she was and just let him know that she was well and happy and always loved him very much  maggie soon got out of breath with running but by the time that tom got to the pond again she was at the distance of three long fields and was on the edge of the lane leading to the highroad  she presently passed through the gate into the lane and she was soon aware not without trembling that there were two men coming along the lane in front of her  she had not thought of meeting strangers and to her surprise while she was dreading their scolding as a runaway one of the men stopped and in a halfwhining halfcoaxing tone asked her if she had a copper to give a poor fellow  maggie had a sixpence in her pockether uncle gleggs presentwhich she drew out and gave this poor fellow with a polite smile  thats the only money ive got she said  thank you little miss said the man in a less grateful tone than maggie expected and she even saw that he smiled and winked at his companion  she now went on and turning through the first gate that was not locked crept along by the hedgerows  she was used to wandering about the fields by herself and was less timid there than on the highroad sometimes she had to climb over high gates but that was a small evil she was getting out of reach very fast and she should probably soon come within sight of dunlow common  she hoped so for she was getting rather tired and hungry  it was still broad daylight yet it seemed to her that she had been walking a very great distance indeed and it was really surprising that the common did not come in sight  at last however the green fields came to an end and maggie found herself looking through the bars of a gate into a lane with a wide margin of grass on each side of it  she crept through the bars of the gate and walked on with a new spirit and at the next bend in the lane maggie actually saw the little black tent with the blue smoke rising before it which was to be her refuge  she even saw a tall female figure by the column of smokedoubtless the gipsymother who provided the tea and other groceries it was astonishing to herself that she did not feel more delighted  but it was startling to find the gipsies in a lane after all and not on a commonindeed it was rather disappointing for a mysterious common where there were sandpits to hide in and one was out of everybodys reach had always made part of maggies picture of gipsy life  she went on however and before long a tall figure who proved to be a young woman with a baby on her arm walked slowly to meet her  maggie looked up in the new face and thought that her aunt pullet and the rest were right when they called her a gipsy for this face with the bright dark eyes and the long hair was really something like what she used to see in her own glass before she cut her hair off  my little lady where are you going to the gipsy said  it was delightful and just what maggie expectedthe gipsy saw at once that she was a little lady  not any farther said maggie  im come to stay with you please  thats pritty come then  why what a nice little lady you are to be sure said the gipsy taking her by the hand  maggie thought her very nice but wished she had not been so dirty  there was quite a group round the fire when they reached it  an old gipsywoman was seated on the ground nursing her knees and poking a skewer into the round kettle that sent forth an odorous steam two small shockheaded children were lying down resting on their elbows and a donkey was bending his head over a tall girl who lying on her back was scratching his nose and feeding him with a bite of excellent stolen hay  the slanting sunlight fell kindly upon them and the scene was really very pretty and comfortable maggie thought only she hoped they would soon set out the teacups  it was a little confusing though that the young woman began to speak to the old one in a language which maggie did not understand while the tall girl who was feeding the donkey sat up and stared at her  at last the old woman said  what my pretty lady are you come to stay with us  sit ye down and tell us where you come from  illustration my pretty lady are you come to stay with us  it was just like a story  maggie liked to be called pretty lady and treated in this way  she sat down and said  im come from home because im unhappy and i mean to be a gipsy ill live with you if you like and i can teach you a great many things  such a clever little lady said the woman with the baby sitting down by maggie and allowing baby to crawl and such a pritty bonnet and frock she added taking off maggies bonnet and looking at it while she spoke to the old woman in the unknown language  the tall girl snatched the bonnet and put it on her own head hindforemost with a grin but maggie was determined not to show that she cared about her bonnet  i dont want to wear a bonnet she said id rather wear a red handkerchief like yours looking at her friend by her side  my hair was quite long till yesterday when i cut it off but i dare say it will grow again very soon  oh what a nice little ladyand rich im sure said the old woman didnt you live in a beautiful house at home  yes my home is pretty and im very fond of the river where we go fishing but im often very unhappy  i should have liked to bring my books with me but i came away in a hurry you know  but i can tell you almost everything there is in my books ive read them so many times and that will amuse you  and i can tell you something about geography toothats about the world we live invery useful and interesting  did you ever hear about columbus  is that where you live my little lady said the old woman at the mention of columbus  oh no said maggie with some pity  columbus was a very wonderful man who found out half the world and they put chains on him and treated him very badly you knowbut perhaps its rather too long to tell before tea  i want my tea so  why shes hungry poor little lady said the younger woman  give her some o the cold victualyouve been walking a good way ill be bound my dear  wheres your home  its dorlcote milla good way off said maggie  my father is mr tulliver but we mustnt let him know where i am else hell fetch me home again  where does the queen of the gipsies live  what do you want to go to her my little lady said the younger woman  no said maggie im only thinking that if she isnt a very good queen you might be glad when she died and you could choose another if i was a queen id be a very good queen and kind to everybody  heres a bit o nice victual then said the old woman handing to maggie a lump of dry bread which she had taken from a bag of scraps and a piece of cold bacon  thank you said maggie looking at the food without taking it but will you give me some bread and butter and tea instead  i dont like bacon  weve got no tea nor butter said the old woman with something like a scowl  oh a little bread and treacle would do said maggie  we hant got no treacle said the old woman crossly  meanwhile the tall girl gave a shrill cry and presently there came running up a rough urchin about the age of tom  he stared at maggie and she felt very lonely and was quite sure she should begin to cry before long  but the springing tears were checked when two rough men came up while a black cur ran barking up to maggie and threw her into a tremor of fear  maggie felt that it was impossible she should ever be queen of these people  this nice little ladys come to live with us said the young woman arent you glad  ay very glad said the younger man who was soon examining maggies silver thimble and other small matters that had been taken from her pocket  he returned them all except the thimble to the younger woman and she immediately restored them to maggies pocket while the men seated themselves and began to attack the contents of the kettlea stew of meat and potatoeswhich had been taken off the fire and turned out into a yellow platter     chapter ix  the gipsy queen abdicates  maggie began to think that tom must be right about the gipsies they must certainly be thieves unless the man meant to return her thimble byandby  all thieves except robin hood were wicked people  the women now saw she was frightened  weve got nothing nice for a lady to eat said the old woman in her coaxing tone  and shes so hungry sweet little lady  here my dear try if you can eat a bit o this said the younger woman handing some of the stew on a brown dish with an iron spoon to maggie who dared not refuse it though fear had chased away her appetite  if her father would but come by in the gig and take her up or even if jack the giantkiller or mr greatheart or st george who slew the dragon on the halfpennies would happen to pass that way  what you dont like the smell of it my dear said the young woman observing that maggie did not even take a spoonful of the stew  try a bitcome  no thank you said maggie trying to smile in a friendly way  i havent time i thinkit seems getting darker  i think i must go home now and come again another day and then i can bring you a basket with some jamtarts and things  maggie rose from her seat when the old gipsywoman said stop a bit stop a bit little lady well take you home all safe when weve done supper  you shall ride home like a lady  maggie sat down again with little faith in this promise though she presently saw the tall girl putting a bridle on the donkey and throwing a couple of bags on his back  now then little missis said the younger man rising and leading the donkey forward tell us where you live  whats the name o the place  dorlcote mill is my home said maggie eagerly  my father is mr tulliver he lives there  what a big mill a little way this side o st oggs  yes said maggie  is it far off  i think i should like to walk there if you please  no no itll be getting dark we must make haste  and the donkeyll carry you as nice as can beyoull see  he lifted maggie as he spoke and set her on the donkey  heres your pretty bonnet said the younger woman putting it on maggies head  and youll say weve been very good to you wont you and what a nice little lady we said you was  oh yes thank you said maggie im very much obliged to you  but i wish youd go with me too  ah youre fondest o me arent you said the woman  but i cant go youll go too fast for me  it now appeared that the man also was to be seated on the donkey holding maggie before him and no nightmare had ever seemed to her more horrible  when the woman had patted her on the back and said goodbye the donkey at a strong hint from the mans stick set off at a rapid walk along the lane towards the point maggie had come from an hour ago  maggie was completely terrified at this ride on a shortpaced donkey with a gipsy behind her who considered that he was earning half a crown  two low thatched cottagesthe only houses they passed in this laneseemed to add to the dreariness  they had no windows to speak of and the doors were closed  it was probable that they were inhabited by witches and it was a relief to find that the donkey did not stop there  at lastoh sight of joythis lane the longest in the world was coming to an end and was opening on a broad highroad where there was actually a coach passing  and there was a fingerpost at the corner she had surely seen that fingerpost beforeto st oggs 2 miles  the gipsy really meant to take her home then  he was probably a good man after all and might have been rather hurt at the thought that she didnt like coming with him alone  this idea became stronger as she felt more and more certain that she knew the road quite well when as they reached a crossroad maggie caught sight of some one coming on a horse which seemed familiar to her  oh stop stop she cried out  theres my fathero father father  the sudden joy was almost painful and before her father reached her she was sobbing  great was mr tullivers wonder for he had been paying a visit to a married sister and had not yet been home  why whats the meaning o this he said checking his horse while maggie slipped from the donkey and ran to her fathers stirrup  the little miss lost herself i reckon said the gipsy  shed come to our tent at the far end o dunlow lane and i was bringing her where she said her home was  its a good way to come arter being on the tramp all day  oh yes father hes been very good to bring me home said maggiea very kind good man  here then my man said mr tulliver taking out five shillings its the best days work you ever did  i couldnt afford to lose the little wench  here lift her up before me  why maggie hows this hows this he said as they rode along while she laid her head against her father and sobbed  how came you to be rambling about and lose yourself  o father sobbed maggie i ran away because i was so unhappytom was so angry with me  i couldnt bear it  pooh pooh said mr tulliver soothingly you mustnt think o running away from father  what ud father do without his little wench  oh no i never will again fathernever  mr tulliver spoke his mind very strongly when he reached home that evening and maggie never heard one reproach from her mother or one taunt from tom about running away to be queen of the gipsies     chapter x  tom at school  in due time tom found himself at kings lorton under the care of the rev walter stelling a big broadchested man not yet thirty with fair hair standing erect large lightgray eyes and a deep bass voice  the schoolmaster had made up his mind to bring tom on very quickly during the first halfyear but tom did not greatly enjoy the process though he made good progress in a very short time  the boy was however very lonely and longed for playfellows  in his secret heart he yearned to have maggie with him though when he was at home he always made it out to be a great favour on his part to let maggie trot by his side on his pleasure excursions  and before this dreary halfyear was ended maggie actually came  mrs stelling had given a general invitation for the little girl to come and stay with her brother so when mr tulliver drove over to kings lorton late in october maggie came too  it was mr tullivers first visit to see tom for the lad must learn he had said not to think too much about home  well my lad the miller said to tom when mr stelling had left the room and maggie had begun to kiss tom freely you look rarely school agrees with you  tom wished he had looked rather ill  i dont think i am well father said tom i wish youd ask mr stelling not to let me do euclid it brings on the toothache i think  euclid my lad  why whats that said mr tulliver  oh i dont know  its definitions and axioms and triangles and things  its a book ive got to learn in theres no sense in it  go go said mr tulliver you mustnt say so  you must learn what your master tells you  he knows what its right for you to learn  ill help you now tom said maggie  im come to stay ever so long if mrs stelling asks me  ive brought my box and my pinaforeshavent i father  you help me you silly little thing said tom  i should like to see you doing one of my lessons  why i learn latin too  girls never learn such things theyre too silly  i know what latin is very well said maggie confidently  latins a language  there are latin words in the dictionary  theres bonus a gift  now youre just wrong there miss maggie said tom  you think youre very wise  but bonus means good as it happensbonus bona bonum  well thats no reason why it shouldnt mean gift said maggie stoutly  it may mean several thingsalmost every word does  theres lawnit means the grassplot as well as the stuff handkerchiefs are made of  well done little un said mr tulliver laughing while tom felt rather disgusted  mrs stelling did not mention a longer time than a week for maggies stay but mr stelling said that she must stay a fortnight  now then come with me into the study maggie said tom as their father drove away  what do you shake and toss your head now for you silly  it makes you look as if you were crazy  oh i cant help it said maggie  dont tease me tom  oh what books she exclaimed as she saw the bookcases in the study  how i should like to have as many books as that  why you couldnt read one of em said tom triumphantly  theyre all latin  no they arent said maggie  i can read the back of thishistory of the decline and fall of the roman empire  well what does that mean  you dont know said tom wagging his head  but i could soon find out said maggie  why how  i should look inside and see what it was about  youd better not miss maggie said tom seeing her hand on the volume  mr stelling lets nobody touch his books without leave and i shall catch it if you take it out  oh very well  let me see all your books then said maggie turning to throw her arms round toms neck and rub his cheek with her small round nose  tom in the gladness of his heart at having dear old maggie to dispute with and crow over again seized her round the waist and began to jump with her round the large library table  away they jumped with more and more vigour till at last reaching mr stellings readingstand they sent it thundering down with its heavy books to the floor  tom stood dizzy and aghast for a few minutes dreading the appearance of mr or mrs stelling  oh i say maggie said tom at last lifting up the stand we must keep quiet here you know  if we break anything mrs stellingll make us cry peccavi  whats that said maggie  oh its the latin for a good scolding said tom  is she a cross woman said maggie  i believe you said tom with a nod  i think all women are crosser than men said maggie  aunt gleggs a great deal crosser than uncle glegg and mother scolds me more than father does  well youll be a woman some day said tom so you neednt talk  but i shall be a clever woman said maggie with a toss  oh i dare say and a nasty conceited thing  everybodyll hate you  but you oughtnt to hate me tom  itll be very wicked of you for i shall be your sister  yes but if youre a nasty disagreeable thing i shall hate you  oh but tom you wont  i shant be disagreeable  i shall be very good to you and i shall be good to everybody  you wont hate me really will you tom  oh bother never mind  come its time for me to learn my lessons see here what ive got to do tom went on drawing maggie towards him and showing her his theorem while she pushed her hair behind her ears and prepared herself to help him in euclid  its nonsense she said after a few moments reading and very ugly stuff nobody need want to make it out  ah there now miss maggie said tom drawing the book away and wagging his head at her you see youre not so clever as you thought you were  oh said maggie pouting i dare say i could make it out if id learned what goes before as you have  but thats what you just couldnt miss wisdom said tom  for its all the harder when you know what goes before  but get along with you now i must go on with this  heres the latin grammar  see what you can make of that  maggie found the latin grammar quite soothing for she delighted in new words and quickly found that there was an english key at the end which would make her very wise about latin at slight expense  after a short period of silence tom called out  now then magsie give us the grammar  o tom its such a pretty book she said as she jumped out of the large armchair to give it him  i could learn latin very soon  i dont think its at all hard  oh i know what youve been doing said tom youve been reading the english at the end  any donkey can do that  here come and hear if i can say this  stand at that end of the table  illustration here magsie come and hear if i can say this  maggie obeyed and took the open book  where do you begin tom  oh i begin at appellativa arborum because i say all over again what ive been learning this week  tom sailed along pretty well for three lines and then he stuck fast  there you neednt laugh at me tom for you didnt remember it at all you see  pheeeeh  i told you girls couldnt learn latin  very well then said maggie pouting  i can say it as well as you can  and you dont mind your stops  for you ought to stop twice as long at a semicolon as you do at a comma and you make the longest stops where there ought to be no stops at all  oh well dont chatter  let me go on  it was a very happy fortnight to maggie this visit to tom  she was allowed to be in the study while he had his lessons and in time got very deep into the examples in the latin grammar  mr stelling liked her prattle immensely and they were on the best of terms  she told tom she should like to go to school to mr stelling as he did and learn just the same things  she knew she could do euclid for she had looked into it again and she saw what abc meantthey were the names of the lines  im sure you couldnt do it now said tom and ill just ask mr stelling if you could  i dont mind said she  ill ask him myself  mr stelling she said that same evening when they were in the drawingroom couldnt i do euclid and all toms lessons if you were to teach me instead of him  no you couldnt said tom indignantly  girls cant do euclidcan they sir  they can pick up a little of everything i dare say said mr stelling but they couldnt go far into anything  theyre quick and shallow  tom delighted with this wagged his head at maggie behind mr stellings chair  as for maggie she had hardly ever been so angry she had been so proud to be called quick all her little life and now it appeared that this quickness showed what a poor creature she was it would have been better to be slow like tom  ha ha miss maggie said tom when they were alone you see its not such a fine thing to be quick  youll never go far into anything you know  and maggie had no spirit for a retort  but when she was fetched away in the gig by luke and the study was once more quite lonely for tom he missed her grievously  still the dreary halfyear did come to an end at last  how glad tom was to see the last yellow leaves fluttering before the cold wind  the dark afternoons and the first december snow seemed to him far livelier than the august sunshine and that he might make himself the surer about the flight of the days that were carrying him homeward he stuck twentyone sticks deep in a corner of the garden when he was three weeks from the holidays and pulled one up every day with a great wrench throwing it to a distance  but it was worth buying even at the heavy price of the latin grammarthe happiness of seeing the bright light in the parlour at home as the gig passed over the snowcovered bridgethe happiness of passing from the cold air to the warmth and the kisses and the smiles of home     chapter xi  the new schoolfellow  father said tom one evening near the end of the holidays uncle glegg says lawyer wakem is going to send his son to mr stelling  you wont like me to go to school with wakems son will you father  its no matter for that my boy said mr tulliver dont you learn anything bad of him thats all  the lads a poor deformed creatur its a sign wakem thinks high o mr stelling as he sends his son to him and wakem knows meal from bran lawyer and rascal though he is  it was a cold wet january day on which tom went back to school  if he had not carried in his pocket a parcel of sugarcandy there would have been no ray of pleasure to enliven the gloom  well tulliver were glad to see you again said mr stelling heartily on his arrival  take off your wrappings and come into the study till dinner  youll find a bright fire there and a new companion  tom felt in an uncomfortable flutter as he took off his woollen comforter and other wrappings  he had seen philip wakem at st oggs but had always turned his eyes away from him as quickly as possible for he knew that for several reasons his father hated the wakem family with all his heart  here is a new companion for you to shake hands with tulliver said mr stelling on entering the studymaster philip wakem  you already know something of each other i imagine for you are neighbours at home  tom looked confused while philip rose and glanced at him timidly  tom did not like to go up and put out his hand and he was not prepared to say how do you do on so short a notice  mr stelling wisely turned away and closed the door behind him  he knew that boys shyness only wears off in the absence of their elders  philip was at once too proud and too timid to walk towards tom  he thought or rather felt that tom did not like to look at him  so they remained without shaking hands or even speaking while tom went to the fire and warmed himself every now and then casting glances at philip who seemed to be drawing absently first one object and then another on a piece of paper he had before him  what was he drawing wondered tom after a spell of silence  he was quite warm now and wanted something new to be going forward  suddenly he walked across the hearth and looked over philips paper  why thats a donkey with panniers and a spaniel and partridges in the corn he exclaimed  oh my buttons  i wish i could draw like that  im to learn drawing this half  i wonder if i shall learn to make dogs and donkeys  oh you can do them without learning said philip i never learned drawing  never learned said tom in amazement  why when i make dogs and horses and those things the heads and the legs wont come right though i can see how they ought to be very well  i can make houses and all sorts of chimneyschimneys going all down the wall and windows in the roof and all that  but i dare say i could do dogs and horses if i was to try more he added  oh yes said philip its very easy  youve only to look well at things and draw them over and over again  what you do wrong once you can alter the next time  but havent you been taught anything said tom  yes said philip smiling ive been taught latin and greek and mathematics and writing and such things  oh but i say you dont like latin though do you said tom  pretty well i dont care much about it said philip  but ive done with the grammar he added  i dont learn that any more  then you wont have the same lessons as i shall said tom with a sense of disappointment  no but i dare say i can help you  i shall be very glad to help you if i can  tom did not say thank you for he was quite absorbed in the thought that wakems son did not seem so spiteful a fellow as might have been expected  i say he said presently do you love your father  yes said philip colouring deeply dont you love yours  oh yes i only wanted to know said tom rather ashamed of himself now he saw philip colouring and looking uncomfortable  shall you learn drawing now he said by way of changing the subject  no said philip  my father wishes me to give all my time to other things now  what  latin and euclid and those things said tom  yes said philip who had left off using his pencil and was resting his head on one hand while tom was leaning forward on both elbows and looking at the dog and the donkey  and you dont mind that said tom with strong curiosity  no i like to know what everybody else knows  i can study what i like byandby  i cant think why anybody should learn latin said tom  its no good  its part of the education of a gentleman said philip  all gentlemen learn the same things  what do you think sir john crake the master of the harriers knows latin said tom  he learnt it when he was a boy of course said philip  but i dare say hes forgotten it  oh well i can do that then said tom readily  oh i dont mind latin said philip unable to choke a laugh i can remember things easily  and there are some lessons im very fond of im very fond of greek history and everything about the greeks  i should like to have been a greek and fought the persians and then have come home and written tragedies or else have been listened to by everybody for my wisdom like socrates and have died a grand death  why were the greeks great fighters said tom who saw a vista in this direction  is there anything like david and goliath and samson in the greek history  those are the only bits i like in the history of the jews  oh there are very fine stories of that sort about the greeksabout the heroes of early times who killed the wild beasts as samson did and in the odyssey thats a beautiful poem theres a more wonderful giant than goliathpolypheme who had only one eye in the middle of his forehead and ulysses a little fellow but very wise and cunning got a redhot pine tree and stuck it into this one eye and made him roar like a thousand bulls  oh what fun said tom jumping away from the table and stamping first with one leg and then the other  i say can you tell me all about those stories because  i shant learn greek you know  shall i he added pausing in his stamping with a sudden alarm lest the contrary might be possible  does every gentleman learn greek  will mr stelling make me begin with it do you think  no i should think notvery likely not said philip  but you may read those stories without knowing greek  ive got them in english  oh but i dont like reading id sooner have you tell them mebut only the fighting ones you know  my sister maggie is always wanting to tell me stories but theyre stupid things  girls stories always are  can you tell a good many fighting stories  oh yes said philiplots of them besides the greek stories  i can tell you about richard coeurdelion and saladin and about william wallace and robert bruce and james douglas  i know no end  youre older than i am arent you said tom  why how old are you  im fifteen  im only going in fourteen said tom  but i thrashed all the fellows at jacobsthats where i was before i came here  and i beat em all at bandy and climbing  and i wish mr stelling would let us go fishing  i could show you how to fish  you could fish couldnt you its only standing and sitting still you know  philip winced under this allusion to his unfitness for active sports and he answered almost crossly  i cant bear fishing  i think people look like fools sitting watching a line hour after hour or else throwing and throwing and catching nothing  ah but you wouldnt say they looked like fools when they landed a big pike i can tell you said tom  wakems son it was plain had his disagreeable points and must be kept in due check     chapter xii  the duke of wellington  as time went on philip and tom found many common interests and became on the whole good comrades but they had occasional tiffs as was to be expected and at one time had a serious difference which promised to be final  this occurred shortly before maggies second visit to tom  she was going to a boarding school with lucy and wished to see tom before setting out  when maggie came she could not help looking with growing interest at the new schoolfellow although he was the son of that wicked lawyer wakem who made her father so angry  she had arrived in the middle of school hours and had sat by while philip went through his lessons with mr stelling  tom some weeks before had sent her word that philip knew no end of storiesnot stupid stories like hers and she was convinced now that he must be very clever  she hoped he would think her rather clever too when she came to talk to him  i think philip wakem seems a nice boy tom she said when they went out of the study together into the garden  he couldnt choose his father you know and ive read of very bad men who had good sons as well as good parents who had bad children  and if philip is good i think we ought to be the more sorry for him because his father is not a good man  you like him dont you  oh hes a queer fellow said tom curtly and hes as sulky as can be with me because i told him one day his father was a rogue  and id a right to tell him so for it was true and he began it with calling me names  but you stop here by yourself a bit magsie will you ive got something i want to do upstairs  cant i go too said maggie who in this first day of meeting again loved toms very shadow  no its something ill tell you about byandby not yet said tom skipping away  in the afternoon the boys were at their books in the study preparing the morrows lessons that they might have a holiday in the evening in honour of maggies arrival  tom was hanging over his latin grammar and philip at the other end of the room was busy with two volumes that excited maggies curiosity he did not look at all as if he were learning a lesson  she sat on a low stool at nearly a right angle with the two boys watching first one and then the other  i say magsie said tom at last shutting his books ive done my lessons now  come upstairs with me  what is it said maggie when they were outside the door  it isnt a trick youre going to play me now  no no maggie said tom in his most coaxing tone its something youll like ever so  he put his arm round her neck and she put hers round his waist and twined together in this way they went upstairs  i say magsie you must not tell anybody you know said tom else i shall get fifty lines  is it alive said maggie thinking that tom kept a ferret  oh i shant tell you said he  now you go into that corner and hide your face while i reach it out he added as he locked the bedroom door behind them  ill tell you when to turn round  you mustnt squeal out you know  oh but if you frighten me i shall said maggie beginning to look rather serious  you wont be frightened you silly thing said tom  go and hide your face and mind you dont peep  of course i shant peep said maggie disdainfully and she buried her face in the pillow like a person of strict honour  but tom looked round warily as he walked to the closet then he stepped into the narrow space and almost closed the door  maggie kept her face buried until tom called out now then magsie  nothing but very careful study could have enabled tom to present so striking a figure as he did to maggie when she looked up  with some burnt cork he had made himself a pair of black eyebrows that met over his nose and were matched by a blackness about the chin  he had wound a red handkerchief round his cloth cap to give it the air of a turban and his red comforter across his breast as a scarfan amount of red which with the frown on his brow and the firmness with which he grasped a real sword as he held it with its point resting on the ground made him look very fierce and bloodthirsty indeed  maggie looked bewildered for a moment and tom enjoyed that moment keenly but in the next she laughed clapped her hands together and said o tom youve made yourself like bluebeard at the show  it was clear she had not been struck with the presence of the swordit was not unsheathed  her foolish mind required a more direct appeal to its sense of the terrible and tom prepared for his masterstroke frowning fiercely he carefully drew the sworda real onefrom its sheath and pointed it at maggie  o tom please dont cried maggie in a tone of dread shrinking away from him into the opposite corner i shall screamim sure i shall oh dont  i wish id never come upstairs  illustration o tom please dont cried maggie  the corners of toms mouth showed an inclination to a smile that was immediately checked  slowly he let down the scabbard on the floor lest it should make too much noise and then said sternly  im the duke of wellington  march stamping forward with the right leg a little bent and the sword still pointed towards maggie who trembling and with tearfilled eyes got upon the bed as the only means of widening the space between them  tom happy in this spectator even though it was only maggie proceeded to such an exhibition of the cut and thrust as would be expected of the duke of wellington  tom i will not bear iti will scream said maggie at the first movement of the sword  youll hurt yourself youll cut your head off  onetwo said tom firmly though at two his wrist trembled a little  three came more slowly and with it the sword swung downwards and maggie gave a loud shriek  the sword had fallen with its edge on toms foot and in a moment after he had fallen too  maggie leaped from the bed still shrieking and soon there was a rush of footsteps towards the room  mr stelling from his upstairs study was the first to enter  he found both the children on the floor  tom had fainted and maggie was shaking him by the collar of his jacket screaming with wild eyes  she thought he was dead poor child  and yet she shook him as if that would bring him back to life  in another minute she was sobbing with joy because tom had opened his eyes  she couldnt sorrow yet that he had hurt his foot it seemed as if all happiness lay in his being alive  in a very short time the wounded hero was put to bed and a surgeon was fetched who dressed the wound with a serious face which greatly impressed every one     chapter xiii  philip and maggie  poor tom bore his severe pain like a hero but there was a terrible dread weighing on his mindso terrible that he dared not ask the question which might bring the fatal yeshe dared not ask the surgeon or mr stelling shall i be lame sir  it had not occurred to either of these gentlemen to set the lads mind at rest with hopeful words  but philip watched the surgeon out of the house and waylaid mr stelling to ask the very question that tom had not dared to ask for himself  i beg your pardon sir but does mr askern say tulliver will be lame  oh no oh no said mr stelling only for a little while  did he tell tulliver so sir do you think  no nothing was said to him on the subject  then i may go and tell him sir  yes to be sure  now you mention it i dare say he may be troubling about that  go to his bedroom but be very quiet  it had been philips first thought when he heard of the accident will tulliver be lame  it will be very hard for him if he is  and toms offences against himself were all washed out by that pity  mr askern says youll soon be all right again tulliver did you know he said rather timidly as he stepped gently up to toms bed ive just been to ask mr stelling and he says youll walk as well as ever again byandby  tom looked up with that stopping of the breath which comes with a sudden joy then he gave a long sigh and turned his bluegray eyes straight on philips face as he had not done for a fortnight or more as for maggie the bare idea of toms being always lame overcame her and she clung to him and cried afresh  dont be a little silly magsie said tom tenderly feeling very brave now  i shall soon get well  goodbye tulliver said philip putting out his small delicate hand which tom clasped with his strong fingers  i say said tom ask mr stelling to let you come and sit with me sometimes till i get up again wakem and tell me about robert bruce you know  after that philip spent all his time out of lesson hours with tom and maggie  tom liked to hear fighting stories as much as ever but he said he was sure that those great fighters who did so many wonderful things and came off unhurt wore excellent armour from head to foot which made fighting easy work  one day soon after philip had been to visit tom he and maggie were in the study alone together while toms foot was being dressed  philip was at his books and maggie went and leaned on the table near him to see what he was doing for they were quite old friends now and perfectly at home with each other  what are you reading about in greek she said  its poetry i can see that because the lines are so short  its about the lame man i was telling you of yesterday he answered resting his head on his hand and looking at her as if he were not at all sorry to stop  maggie continued to lean forward resting on her arms while her dark eyes got more and more fixed and vacant as if she had quite forgotten philip and his book  maggie said philip after a minute or two still leaning on his elbow and looking at her if you had had a brother like me do you think you should have loved him as well as tom  maggie started a little and said what philip repeated his question  oh yesbetter she answered immediately  no not better because i dont think i could love you better than tom but i should be so sorryso sorry for you  philip coloured  maggie young as she was felt her mistake  hitherto she had behaved as if she were quite unconscious of philips deformity  but you are so very clever philip and you can play and sing she added quickly  i wish you were my brother  im very fond of you and you would stay at home with me when tom went out and you would teach me everything wouldnt yougreek and everything  but youll go away soon and go to school maggie said philip and then youll forget all about me and not care for me any more  and then i shall see you when youre grown up and youll hardly take any notice of me  oh no i shant forget you im sure said maggie shaking her head very seriously  i never forget anything and i think about everybody when im away from them  i think about poor yap  hes got a lump in his throat and luke says hell die  only dont you tell tom because it will vex him so  you never saw yap  hes a queer little dog nobody cares about him but tom and me  do you care as much about me as you do about yap maggie said philip smiling rather sadly  oh yes i should think so said maggie laughing  im very fond of you maggie i shall never forget you said philip and when im very unhappy i shall always think of you and wish i had a sister with dark eyes just like yours  why do you like my eyes said maggie well pleased  she had never heard of any one but her father speak of her eyes as if they had merit  i dont know said philip  theyre not like any other eyes  they seem trying to speaktrying to speak kindly  i dont like other people to look at me much but i like you to look at me maggie  why i think youre fonder of me than tom is said maggie  then wondering how she could convince philip that she could like him just as well although he was crooked she said  should you like me to kiss you as i do tom  i will if you like  yes very much  nobody kisses me  maggie put her arm round his neck and kissed him  there now she said i shall always remember you and kiss you when i see you again if its ever so long  but ill go now because i think mr askerns done with toms foot  when their father came the second time maggie said to him o father philip wakem is so very good to tom he is such a clever boy and i do love himand you love him too tom dont you  say you love him she added entreatingly  tom coloured a little as he looked at his father and said i shant be friends with him when i leave school father  but weve made it up now since my foot has been bad and hes taught me to play at draughts and i can beat him  well well said mr tulliver if hes good to you try and make him amends and be good to him  hes a poor crooked creatur and takes after his dead mother  but dont you be getting too thick with him hes got his fathers blood in him too                                  by the time tom had reached his last quarter at kings lorton the years had made striking changes in him  he was a tall youth now and wore his tailcoat and his standup collars  maggie too was tall now with braided and coiled hair  she was almost as tall as tom though she was only thirteen and she really looked older than he did  at last the day came when tom was to say goodbye to his tutor and maggie came over to kings lorton to fetch him home  mr stelling put his hand on toms shoulder and said god bless you my boy let me know how you get on  then he pressed maggies hand but there were no audible goodbyes  tom had so often thought how joyful he should be the day he left school for good  and now that the great event had come his school years seemed like a holiday that had come to an end     the end     printed in great britain     uniform
