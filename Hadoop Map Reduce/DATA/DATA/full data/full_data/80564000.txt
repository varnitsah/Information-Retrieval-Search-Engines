warriors soul 1917   the old officer with long white moustaches gave rein to his indignation  is it possible that you youngsters should have no more sense than that some of you had better wipe the milk off your upper lip before you start to pass judgment on the few poor stragglers of a generation which has done and suffered not a little in its time  his hearers having expressed much compunction the ancient warrior became appeased but he was not silenced  i am one of themone of the stragglers i mean he went on patiently and what did we do what have we achieved hethe great napoleonstarted upon us to emulate the macedonian alexander with a ruck of nations at his back we opposed empty spaces to french impetuosity then we offered them an interminable battle so that their army went at last to sleep in its positions lying down on the heaps of its own dead then came the wall of fire in moscow it toppled down on them  then began the long rout of the grand army i have seen it stream on like the doomed flight of haggard spectral sinners across the innermost frozen circle of dantes inferno ever widening before their despairing eyes  they who escaped must have had their souls doubly riveted inside their bodies to carry them out of russia through that frost fit to split rocks but to say that it was our fault that a single one of them got away is mere ignorance why our own men suffered nearly to the limit of their strength their russian strength  of course our spirit was not broken and then our cause was goodit was holy but that did not temper the wind much to men and horses  the flesh is weak good or evil purpose humanity has to pay the price why in that very fight for that little village of which i have been telling you we were fighting for the shelter of those old houses as much as victory and with the french it was the same  it wasnt for the sake of glory or for the sake of strategy the french knew that they would have to retreat before morning and we knew perfectly well that they would go as far as the war was concerned there was nothing to fight about yet our infantry and theirs fought like wild cats or like heroes if you like that better amongst the houseshot work enoughwhile the supports out in the open stood freezing in a tempestuous north wind which drove the snow on earth and the great masses of clouds in the sky at a terrific pace the very air was inexpressibly sombre by contrast with the white earth i have never seen gods creation look more sinister than on that day  we the cavalry we were only a handful had not much to do except turn our backs to the wind and receive some stray french round shot this i may tell you was the last of the french guns and it was the last time they had their artillery in position those guns never went away from there either we found them abandoned next morning but that afternoon they were keeping up an infernal fire on our attacking column the furious wind carried away the smoke and even the noise but we could see the constant flicker of the tongues of fire along the french front then a driving flurry of snow would hide everything except the dark red flashes in the white swirl  at intervals when the line cleared we could see away across the plain to the right a sombre column moving endlessly the great rout of the grand army creeping on and on all the time while the fight on our left went on with a great din and fury the cruel whirlwind of snow swept over that scene of death and desolation and then the wind fell as suddenly as it had arisen in the morning  presently we got orders to charge the retreating column i dont know why unless they wanted to prevent us from getting frozen in our saddles by giving us something to do we changed front half right and got into motion at a walk to take that distant dark line in flank it might have been halfpast two in the afternoon  you must know that so far in this campaign my regiment had never been on the main line of napoleons advance all these months since the invasion the army we belonged to had been wrestling with oudinot in the north we had only come down lately driving him before us to the beresina  this was the first occasion then that i and my comrades had a close view of napoleons grand army it was an amazing and terrible sight i had heard of it from others i had seen the stragglers from it small bands of marauders parties of prisoners in the distance but this was the very column itself a crawling stumbling starved halfdemented mob it issued from the forest a mile away and its head was lost in the murk of the fields we rode into it at a trot which was the most we could get out of our horses and we stuck in that human mass as if in a moving bog there was no resistance i heard a few shots half a dozen perhaps their very senses seemed frozen within them i had time for a good look while riding at the head of my squadron well i assure you there were men walking on the outer edge so lost to everything but their misery that they never turned their heads to look at our charge soldiers  my horse pushed over one of them with his chest the poor wretch had a dragoons blue cloak all torn and scorched hanging from his shoulders and he didnt even put his hand out to snatch at my bridle and save himself he just went down our troopers were pointing and slashing well and of course at first i myself what would you have an enemys an enemy yet a sort of sickening awe crept into my heart there was no tumultonly a low deep murmur dwelt over them interspersed with louder cries and groans while that mob kept on pushing and surging past us sightless and without feeling a smell of scorched rags and festering wounds hung in the air my horse staggered in the eddies of swaying men but it was like cutting down galvanized corpses that didnt care invaders yes god was already dealing with them  i touched my horse with the spurs to get clear there was a sudden rush and a sort of angry moan when our second squadron got into them on our right my horse plunged and somebody got hold of my leg as i had no mind to get pulled out of the saddle i gave a backhanded slash without looking i heard a cry and my leg was let go suddenly  just then i caught sight of the subaltern of my troop at some little distance from me his name was tomassov that multitude of resurrected bodies with glassy eyes was seething round his horse as if blind growling crazily he was sitting erect in his saddle not looking down at them and sheathing his sword deliberately  this tomassov well he had a beard of course we all had beards then circumstances lack of leisure want of razors too no seriously we were a wildlooking lot in those unforgotten days which so many so very many of us did not survive you know our losses were awful too yes we looked wild des russes sauvageswhat  so he had a beardthis tomassov i mean but he did not look sauvage he was the youngest of us all and that meant real youth at a distance he passed muster fairly well what with the grime and the particular stamp of that campaign on our faces but directly you were near enough to have a good look into his eyes that was where his lack of age showed though he was not exactly a boy  those same eyes were blue something like the blue of autumn skies dreamy and gay tooinnocent believing eyes a topknot of fair hair decorated his brow like a gold diadem in what one would call normal times  you may think i am talking of him as if he were the hero of a novel why thats nothing to what the adjutant discovered about him he discovered that he had a lovers lipswhatever that may be if the adjutant meant a nice mouth why it was nice enough but of course it was intended for a sneer that adjutant of ours was not a very delicate fellow look at those lovers lips he would exclaim in a loud tone while tomassov was talking  tomassov didnt quite like that sort of thing but to a certain extent he had laid himself open to banter by the lasting character of his impressions which were connected with the passion of love and perhaps were not of such a rare kind as he seemed to think them what made his comrades tolerant of his rhapsodies was the fact that they were connected with france with paris  you of the present generation you cannot conceive how much prestige there was then in those names for the whole world paris was the centre of wonder for all human beings gifted with imagination there we were the majority of us young and well connected but not long out of our hereditary nests in the provinces simple servants of god mere rustics if i may say so so we were only too ready to listen to the tales of france from our comrade tomassov he had been attached to our mission in paris the year before the war high protections very likelyor maybe sheer luck  i dont think he could have been a very useful member of the mission because of his youth and complete inexperience and apparently all his time in paris was his own the use he made of it was to fall in love to remain in that state to cultivate it to exist only for it in a manner of speaking  thus it was something more than a mere memory that he had brought with him from france memory is a fugitive thing it can be falsified it can be effaced it can be even doubted why i myself come to doubt sometimes that i too have been in paris in my turn and the long road there with battles for its stages would appear still more incredible if it were not for a certain musket ball which i have been carrying about my person ever since a little cavalry affair which happened in silesia at the very beginning of the leipsic campaign  passages of love however are more impressive perhaps than passages of danger you dont go affronting love in troops as it were they are rarer more personal and more intimate and remember that with tomassov all that was very fresh yet he had not been home from france three months when the war began  his heart his mind were full of that experience he was really awed by it and he was simple enough to let it appear in his speeches he considered himself a sort of privileged person not because a woman had looked at him with favour but simply because how shall i say it he had had the wonderful illumination of his worship for her as if it were heaven itself that had done this for him  oh yes he was very simple a nice youngster yet no fool and with that utterly inexperienced unsuspicious and unthinking you will find one like that here and there in the provinces he had some poetry in him too it could only be natural something quite his own not acquired i suppose father adam had some poetry in him of that natural sort for the rest un russe sauvage as the french sometimes call us but not of that kind which they maintain eats tallow candle for a delicacy as to the woman the french woman well though i have also been in france with a hundred thousand russians i have never seen her very likely she was not in paris then and in any case hers were not the doors that would fly open before simple fellows of my sort you understand gilded salons were never in my way i could not tell you how she looked which is strange considering that i was if i may say so tomassovs special confidant  he very soon got shy of talking before the others i suppose the usual campfire comments jarred his fine feelings but i was left to him and truly i had to submit you cant very well expect a youngster in tomassovs state to hold his tongue altogether and ii suppose you will hardly believe mei am by nature a rather silent sort of person  very likely my silence appeared to him sympathetic all the month of september our regiment quartered in villages had come in for an easy time it was then that i heard most of thatyou cant call it a story the story i have in my mind is not in that outpourings let us call them  i would sit quite content to hold my peace a whole hour perhaps while tomassov talked with exaltation and when he was done i would still hold my peace and then there would be produced a solemn effect of silence which i imagine pleased tomassov in a way  she was of course not a woman in her first youth a widow maybe at any rate i never heard tomassov mention her husband she had a salon something very distinguished a social centre in which she queened it with great splendour  somehow i fancy her court was composed mostly of men but tomassov i must say kept such details out of his discourses wonderfully well upon my word i dont know whether her hair was dark or fair her eyes brown or blue what was her stature her features or her complexion his love soared above mere physical impressions he never described her to me in set terms but he was ready to swear that in her presence everybodys thoughts and feelings were bound to circle round her she was that sort of woman most wonderful conversations on all sorts of subjects went on in her salon but through them all there flowed unheard like a mysterious strain of music the assertion the power the tyranny of sheer beauty so apparently the woman was beautiful she detached all these talking people from their life interests and even from their vanities she was a secret delight and a secret trouble all the men when they looked at her fell to brooding as if struck by the thought that their lives had been wasted she was the very joy and shudder of felicity and she brought only sadness and torment to the hearts of men  in short she must have been an extraordinary woman or else tomassov was an extraordinary young fellow to feel in that way and to talk like this about her i told you the fellow had a lot of poetry in him and observed that all this sounded true enough it would be just about the sorcery a woman very much out of the common would exercise you know poets do get close to truth somehowthere is no denying that  there is no poetry in my composition i know but i have my share of common shrewdness and i have no doubt that the lady was kind to the youngster once he did find his way inside her salon his getting in is the real marvel however he did get in the innocent and he found himself in distinguished company there amongst men of considerable position and you know what that means thick waists bald heads teeth that are notas some satirist puts it imagine amongst them a nice boy fresh and simple like an apple just off the tree a modest goodlooking impressionable adoring young barbarian my word what a change what a relief for jaded feelings and with that having in his nature that dose of poetry which saves even a simpleton from being a fool  he became an artlessly unconditionally devoted slave he was rewarded by being smiled on and in time admitted to the intimacy of the house it may be that the unsophisticated young barbarian amused the exquisite lady perhapssince he didnt feed on tallow candleshe satisfied some need of tenderness in the woman you know there are many kinds of tenderness highly civilized women are capable of women with heads and imagination i mean and no temperament to speak of you understand but who is going to fathom their needs or their fancies most of the time they themselves dont know much about their innermost moods and blunder out of one into another sometimes with catastrophic results and then who is more surprised than they however tomassovs case was in its nature quite idyllic the fashionable world was amused his devotion made for him a kind of social success but he didnt care there was his one divinity and there was the shrine where he was permitted to go in and out without regard for official reception hours  he took advantage of that privilege freely well lie had no official duties you know the military mission was supposed to be more complimentary than anything else the head of it being a personal friend of our emperor alexander and he too was laying himself out for successes in fashionable life exclusivelyas it seemed as it seemed  one afternoon tomassov called on the mistress of his thoughts earlier than usual she was not alone there was a man with her not one of the thickwaisted baldheaded personages but a somebody all the same a man over thirty a french officer who to some extent was also a privileged intimate tomassov was not jealous of him such a sentiment would have appeared presumptuous to the simple fellow  on the contrary he admired that officer you have no idea of the french military mens prestige in those days even with us russian soldiers who had managed to face them perhaps better than the rest victory had marked them on the foreheadit seemed for ever they would have been more than human if they had not been conscious of it but they were good comrades and had a sort of brotherly feeling for all who bore arms even if it was against them  and this was quite a superior example an officer of the majorgenerals staff and a man of the best society besides he was powerfully built and thoroughly masculine though he was as carefully groomed as a woman he had the courteous selfpossession of a man of the world his forehead white as alabaster contrasted impressively with the healthy colour of his face  i dont know whether he was jealous of tomassov but i suspect that he might have been a little annoyed at him as at a sort of walking absurdity of the sentimental order but these men of the world are impenetrable and outwardly he condescended to recognize tomassovs existence even more distinctly than was strictly necessary once or twice he had offered him some useful worldly advice with perfect tact and delicacy tomassov was completely conquered by that evidence of kindness under the cold polish of the best society  tomassov introduced into the petit salon found these two exquisite people sitting on a sofa together and had the feeling of having interrupted some special conversation they looked at him strangely he thought but he was not given to understand that he had intruded after a time the lady said to the officerhis name was de casteli wish you would take the trouble to ascertain the exact truth as to that rumour  its much more than a mere rumour remarked the officer but he got up submissively and went out the lady turned to tomassov and said you may stay with me  this express command made him supremely happy though as a matter of fact he had had no idea of going  she regarded him with her kindly glances which made something glow and expand within his chest it was a delicious feeling even though it did cut ones breath short now and then ecstatically he drank in the sound of her tranquil seductive talk full of innocent gaiety and of spiritual quietude his passion appeared to him to flame up and envelop her in blue fiery tongues from head to foot and over her head while her soul reposed in the centre like a big white rose  hm good this he told me many other things like that but this is the one i remember he himself remembered everything because these were the last memories of that woman he was seeing her for the last time though he did not know it then  m de castel returned breaking into that atmosphere of enchantment tomassov had been drinking in even to complete unconsciousness of the external world tomassov could not help being struck by the distinction of his movements the ease of his manner his superiority to all the other men he knew and he suffered from it it occurred to him that these two brilliant beings on the sofa were made for each other  de castel sitting down by the side of the lady murmured to her discreetly there is not the slightest doubt that its true and they both turned their eyes to tomassov roused thoroughly from his enchantment he became selfconscious a feeling of shyness came over him he sat smiling faintly at them  the lady without taking her eyes off the blushing tomassov said with a dreamy gravity quite unusual to her  i should like to know that your generosity can be supremewithout a flaw love at its highest should be the origin of every perfection  tomassov opened his eyes wide with admiration at this as though her lips had been dropping real pearls the sentiment however was not uttered for the primitive russian youth but for the exquisitely accomplished man of the world de castel  tomassov could not see the effect it produced because the french officer lowered his head and sat there contemplating his admirably polished boots the lady whispered in a sympathetic tone  you have scruples  de castel without looking up murmured it could be turned into a nice point of honour  she said vivaciously that surely is artificial i am all for natural feelings i believe in nothing else but perhaps your conscience  he interrupted her not at all my conscience is not childish the fate of those people is of no military importance to us what can it matter the fortune of france is invincible  well then she uttered meaningly and rose from the couch the french officer stood up too tomassov hastened to follow their example he was pained by his state of utter mental darkness while he was raising the ladys white hand to his lips he heard the french officer say with marked emphasis  if he has the soul of a warrior at that time you know people really talked in that way if he has the soul of a warrior he ought to fall at your feet in gratitude  tomassov felt himself plunged into even denser darkness than before he followed the french officer out of the room and out of the house for he had a notion that this was expected of him  it was getting dusk the weather was very bad and the street was quite deserted the frenchman lingered in it strangely and tomassov lingered too without impatience he was never in a hurry to get away from the house in which she lived and besides something wonderful had happened to him the hand he had reverently raised by the tips of its fingers had been pressed against his lips he had received a secret favour he was almost frightened the world had reeledand it had hardly steadied itself yet de castel stopped short at the corner of the quiet street  i dont care to be seen too much with you in the lighted thoroughfares m tomassov he said in a strangely grim tone  why asked the young man too startled to be offended  from prudence answered the other curtly so we will have to part here but before we part ill disclose to you something of which you will see at once the importance  this please note was an evening in late march of the year 1812 for a long time already there had been talk of a growing coolness between russia and france the word war was being whispered in drawing rooms louder and louder and at last was heard in official circles thereupon the parisian police discovered that our military envoy had corrupted some clerks at the ministry of war and had obtained from them some very important confidential documents the wretched men there were two of them had confessed their crime and were to be shot that night tomorrow all the town would be talking of the affair but the worst was that the emperor napoleon was furiously angry at the discovery and had made up his mind to have the russian envoy arrested  such was de castels disclosure and though he had spoken in low tones tomassov was stunned as by a great crash  arrested he murmured desolately  yes and kept as a state prisonerwith everybody belonging to him  the french officer seized tomassovs arm above the elbow and pressed it hard  and kept in france he repeated into tomassovs very ear and then letting him go stepped back a space and remained silent  and its you you who are telling me this cried tomassov in an extremity of gratitude that was hardly greater than his admiration for the generosity of his future foe could a brother have done for him more he sought to seize the hand of the french officer but the latter remained wrapped up closely in his cloak possibly in the dark he had not noticed the attempt he moved back a bit and in his selfpossessed voice of a man of the world as though he were speaking across a card table or something of the sort he called tomassovs attention to the fact that if he meant to make use of the warning the moments were precious  indeed they are agreed the awed tomassov goodbye then i have no word of thanks to equal your generosity but if ever i have an opportunity i swear it you may command my life  but the frenchman retreated had already vanished in the dark lonely street tomassov was alone and then he did not waste any of the precious minutes of that night  see how peoples mere gossip and idle talk pass into history in all the memoirs of the time if you read them you will find it stated that our envoy had a warning from some highly placed woman who was in love with him of course its known that he had successes with women and in the highest spheres too but the truth is that the person who warned him was no other than our simple tomassovan altogether different sort of lover from himself  this then is the secret of our emperors representatives escape from arrest he and all his official household got out of france all rightas history records  and amongst that household there was our tomassov of course he had in the words of the french officer the soul of a warrior and what more desolate prospect for a man with such a soul than to be imprisoned on the eve of war to be cut off from his country in danger from his military family from his duty from honour andwellfrom glory too  tomassov used to shudder at the mere thought of the moral torture he had escaped and he nursed in his heart a boundless gratitude to the two people who had saved him from that cruel ordeal they were wonderful for him love and friendship were but two aspects of exalted perfection he had found these fine examples of it and he vowed them indeed a sort of cult it affected his attitude towards frenchmen in general great patriot as he was he was naturally indignant at the invasion of his country but this indignation had no personal animosity in it his was fundamentally a fine nature he grieved at the appalling amount of human suffering he saw around him yes he was full of compassion for all forms of mankinds misery in a manly way  less fine natures than his own did not understand this very well in the regiment they had nicknamed him the humane tomassov  he didnt take offence at it there is nothing incompatible between humanity and a warriors soul people without compassion are the civilians government officials merchants and such like as to the ferocious talk one hears from a lot of decent people in war timewell the tongue is an unruly member at best and when there is some excitement going on there is no curbing its furious activity  so i had not been very surprised to see our tomassov sheathe deliberately his sword right in the middle of that charge you may say as we rode away after it he was very silent he was not a chatterer as a rule but it was evident that this close view of the grand army had affected him deeply like some sight not of this earth i had always been a pretty tough individual myselfwell even i and there was that fellow with a lot of poetry in his nature you may imagine what he made of it to himself we rode side by side without opening our lips it was simply beyond words  we established our bivouac along the edge of the forest so as to get some shelter for our horses however the boisterous north wind had dropped as quickly as it had sprung up and the great winter stillness lay on the land from the baltic to the black sea one could almost feel its cold lifeless immensity reaching up to the stars  our men had lighted several fires for their officers and had cleared the snow around them we had big logs of wood for seats it was a very tolerable bivouac upon the whole even without the exultation of victory we were to feel that later but at present we were oppressed by our stern and arduous task  there were three of us round my fire the third one was that adjutant he was perhaps a wellmeaning chap but not so nice as he might have been had he been less rough in manner and less crude in his perceptions he would reason about peoples conduct as though a man were as simple a figure as say two sticks laid across each other whereas a man is much more like the sea whose movements are too complicated to explain and whose depths may bring up god only knows what at any moment  we talked a little about that charge not much that sort of thing does not lend itself to conversation tomassov muttered a few words about a mere butchery i had nothing to say as i told you i had very soon let my sword hang idle at my wrist that starving mob had not even tried to defend itself just a few shots we had two men wounded two and we had charged the main column of napoleons grand army  tomassov muttered wearily what was the good of it i did not wish to argue so i only just mumbled ah well but the adjutant struck in unpleasantly  why it warmed the men a bit it has made me warm thats a good enough reason but our tomassov is so humane and besides he has been in love with a french woman and thick as thieves with a lot of frenchmen so he is sorry for them never mind my boy we are on the paris road now and you shall soon see her this was one of his usual as we believed them foolish speeches none of us but believed that the getting to paris would be a matter of yearsof years and lo less than eighteen months afterwards i was rooked of a lot of money in a gambling hell in the palais royal  truth being often the most senseless thing in the world is sometimes revealed to fools i dont think that adjutant of ours believed in his own words he just wanted to tease tomassov from habit purely from habit we of course said nothing and so he took his head in his hands and fell into a doze as he sat on a log in front of the fire  our cavalry was on the extreme right wing of the army and i must confess that we guarded it very badly we had lost all sense of insecurity by this time but still we did keep up a pretence of doing it in a way presently a trooper rode up leading a horse and tomassov mounted stiffly and went off on a round of the outposts of the perfectly useless outposts  the night was still except for the crackling of the fires the raging wind had lifted far above the earth and not the faintest breath of it could be heard only the full moon swam out with a rush into the sky and suddenly hung high and motionless overhead i remember raising my hairy face to it for a moment then i verily believe i dozed off too bent double on my log with my head towards the fierce blaze  you know what an impermanent thing such slumber is one moment you drop into an abyss and the next you are back in the world that you would think too deep for any noise but the trumpet of the last judgment and then off you go again your very soul seems to slip down into a bottomless black pit then up once more into a startled consciousness a mere plaything of cruel sleep one is then tormented both ways  however when my orderly appeared before me repeating wont your honour be pleased to eat wont your honour be pleased to eat i managed to keep my hold of iti mean that gaping consciousness he was offering me a sooty pot containing some grain boiled in water with a pinch of salt a wooden spoon was stuck in it  at that time these were the only rations we were getting regularly mere chicken food confound it but the russian soldier is wonderful well my fellow waited till i had feasted and then went away carrying off the empty pot  i was no longer sleepy indeed i had become awake with an exaggerated mental consciousness of existence extending beyond my immediate surroundings those are but exceptional moments with mankind i am glad to say i had the intimate sensation of the earth in all its enormous expanse wrapped in snow with nothing showing on it but trees with their straight stalklike trunks and their funeral verdure and in this aspect of general mourning i seemed to hear the sighs of mankind falling to die in the midst of a nature without life they were frenchmen we didnt hate them they did not hate us we had existed far apartand suddenly they had come rolling in with arms in their hands without fear of god carrying with them other nations and all to perish together in a long long trail of frozen corpses i had an actual vision of that trail a pathetic multitude of small dark mounds stretching away under the moonlight in a clear still and pitiless atmospherea sort of horrible peace  but what other peace could there be for them what else did they deserve i dont know by what connection of emotions there came into my head the thought that the earth was a pagan planet and not a fit abode for christian virtues  you may be surprised that i should remember all this so well what is a passing emotion or halfformed thought to last in so many years of a mans changing inconsequential life but what has fixed the emotion of that evening in my recollection so that the slightest shadows remain indelible was an event of strange finality an event not likely to be forgotten in a lifetimeas you shall see  i dont suppose i had been entertaining those thoughts more than five minutes when something induced me to look over my shoulder i cant think it was a noise the snow deadened all the sounds something it must have been some sort of signal reaching my consciousness anyway i turned my head and there was the event approaching me not that i knew it or had the slightest premonition all i saw in the distance were two figures approaching in the moonlight one of them was our tomassov the dark mass behind him which moved across my sight were the horses which his orderly was leading away tomassov was a very familiar appearance in long boots a tall figure ending in a pointed hood but by his side advanced another figure i mistrusted my eyes at first it was amazing it had a shining crested helmet on its head and was muffled up in a white cloak the cloak was not as white as snow nothing in the world is it was white more like mist with an aspect that was ghostly and martial to an extraordinary degree it was as if tomassov had got hold of the god of war himself i could see at once that he was leading this resplendent vision by the arm then i saw that he was holding it up while i stared and stared they crept onfor indeed they were creepingand at last they crept into the light of our bivouac fire and passed beyond the log i was sitting on the blaze played on the helmet it was extremely battered and the frostbitten face full of sores under it was framed in bits of mangy fur no god of war this but a french officer the great white cuirassiers cloak was torn burnt full of holes his feet were wrapped up in old sheepskins over remnants of boots they looked monstrous and he tottered on them sustained by tomassov who lowered him most carefully on to the log on which i sat  my amazement knew no bounds  you have brought in a prisoner i said to tomassov as if i could not believe my eyes  you must understand that unless they surrendered in large bodies we made no prisoners what would have been the good our cossacks either killed the stragglers or else let them alone just as it happened it came really to the same thing in the end  tomassov turned to me with a very troubled look  he sprang up from the ground somewhere as i was leaving the outpost he said i believe he was making for it for he walked blindly into my horse he got hold of my leg and of course none of our chaps dared touch him then  he had a narrow escape i said  he didnt appreciate it said tomassov looking even more troubled than before he came along holding to my stirrup leather thats what made me so late he told me he was a staff officer and then talking in a voice such i suppose as the damned alone use a croaking of rage and pain he said he had a favour to beg of me a supreme favour did i understand him he asked in a sort of fiendish whisper  of course i told him that i did i said oui je vous comprends  then said he do it now at oncein the pity of your heart  tomassov ceased and stared queerly at me above the head of the prisoner  i said what did he mean  thats what i asked him answered tomassov in a dazed tone and he said that he wanted me to do him the favour to blow his brains out as a fellow soldier he said as a man of feelingasas a humane man  the prisoner sat between us like an awful gashed mummy as to the face a martial scarecrow a grotesque horror of rags and dirt with awful living eyes full of vitality full of unquenchable fire in a body of horrible affliction a skeleton at the feast of glory and suddenly those shining unextinguishable eyes of his became fixed upon tomassov he poor fellow fascinated returned the ghastly stare of a suffering soul in that mere husk of a man the prisoner croaked at him in french  i recognize you know you are her russian youngster you were very grateful i call on you to pay the debt pay it i say with one liberating shot you are a man of honour i have not even a broken sabre all my being recoils from my own degradation you know me  tomassov said nothing  havent you got the soul of a warrior the frenchman asked in an angry whisper but with something of a mocking intention in it  i dont know said poor tomassov  what a look of contempt that scarecrow gave him out of his unquenchable eyes he seemed to live only by the force of infuriated and impotent despair suddenly he gave a gasp and fell forward writhing in the agony of cramp in all his limbs a not unusual effect of the heat of a campfire it resembled the application of some horrible torture but he tried to fight against the pain at first he only moaned low while we bent over him so as to prevent him rolling into the fire and muttered feverishly at intervals tuez moi tuez moi till vanquished by the pain he screamed in agony time after time each cry bursting out through his compressed lips  the adjutant woke up on the other side of the fire and started swearing awfully at the beastly row that frenchman was making  whats this more of your infernal humanity tomassov he yelled at us why dont you have him thrown out of this to the devil on the snow  as we paid no attention to his shouts he got up cursing shockingly and went away to another fire presently the french officer became easier we propped him up against the log and sat silent on each side of him till the bugles started their call at the first break of day the big flame kept up all through the night paled on the livid sheet of snow while the frozen air all round rang with the brazen notes of cavalry trumpets the frenchmans eyes fixed in a glassy stare which for a moment made us hope that he had died quietly sitting there between us two stirred slowly to right and left looking at each of our faces in turn tomassov and i exchanged glances of dismay then de castels voice unexpected in its renewed strength and ghastly selfpossession made us shudder inwardly  bonjour messieurs  his chin dropped on his breast tomassov addressed me in russian  it is he the man himself i nodded and tomassov went on in a tone of anguish yes he brilliant accomplished envied by men loved by that womanthis horrorthis miserable thing that cannot die look at his eyes its terrible  i did not look but i understood what tomassov meant we could do nothing for him this avenging winter of fate held both the fugitives and the pursuers in its iron grip compassion was but a vain word before that unrelenting destiny i tried to say something about a convoy being no doubt collected in the villagebut i faltered at the mute glance tomassov gave me we knew what those convoys were like appalling mobs of hopeless wretches driven on by the butts of cossacks lances back to the frozen inferno with their faces set away from their homes  our two squadrons had been formed along the edge of the forest the minutes of anguish were passing the frenchman suddenly struggled to his feet we helped him almost without knowing what we were doing  come he said in measured tones this is the moment he paused for a long time then with the same distinctness went on on my word of honour all faith is dead in me  his voice lost suddenly its selfpossession after waiting a little while he added in a murmur and even my courage upon my honour  another long pause ensued before with a great effort he whispered hoarsely isnt this enough to move a heart of stone am i to go on my knees to you  again a deep silence fell upon the three of us then the french officer flung his last word of anger at tomassov  milksop  not a feature of the poor fellow moved i made up my mind to go and fetch a couple of our troopers to lead that miserable prisoner away to the village there was nothing else for it i had not moved six paces towards the group of horses and orderlies in front of our squadron when but you have guessed it of course and i too i guessed it for i give you my word that the report of tomassovs pistol was the most insignificant thing imaginable the snow certainly does absorb sound it was a mere feeble pop of the orderlies holding our horses i dont think one turned his head round  yes tomassov had done it destiny had led that de castel to the man who could understand him perfectly but it was poor tomassovs lot to be the predestined victim you know what the worlds justice and mankinds judgment are like they fell heavily on him with a sort of inverted hypocrisy why that brute of an adjutant himself was the first to set going horrified allusions to the shooting of a prisoner in cold blood tomassov was not dismissed from the service of course but after the siege of dantzig he asked for permission to resign from the army and went away to bury himself in the depths of his province where a vague story of some dark deed clung to him for years  yes he had done it and what was it one warriors soul paying its debt a hundredfold to another warriors soul by releasing it from a fate worse than deaththe loss of all faith and courage you may look on it in that way i dont know and perhaps poor tomassov did not know himself but i was the first to approach that appalling dark group on the snow the frenchman extended rigidly on his back tomassov kneeling on one knee rather nearer to the feet than to the frenchmans head he had taken his cap off and his hair shone like gold in the light drift of flakes that had begun to fall he was stooping over the dead in a tenderly contemplative attitude and his young ingenuous face with lowered eyelids expressed no grief no sternness no horrorbut was set in the repose of a profound as if endless and endlessly silent meditation      prince roman 1911   events which happened seventy years ago are perhaps rather too far off to be dragged aptly into a mere conversation of course the year 1831 is for us an historical date one of these fatal years when in the presence of the worlds passive indignation and eloquent sympathies we had once more to murmur vo victis and count the cost in sorrow not that we were ever very good at calculating either in prosperity or in adversity thats a lesson we could never learn to the great exasperation of our enemies who have bestowed upon us the epithet of incorrigible  the speaker was of polish nationality that nationality not so much alive as surviving which persists in thinking breathing speaking hoping and suffering in its grave railed in by a million of bayonets and triplesealed with the seals of three great empires  the conversation was about aristocracy how did this nowadays discredited subject come up it is some years ago now and the precise recollection has faded but i remember that it was not considered practically as an ingredient in the social mixture and i verily believed that we arrived at that subject through some exchange of ideas about patriotisma somewhat discredited sentiment because the delicacy of our humanitarians regards it as a relic of barbarism yet neither the great florentine painter who closed his eyes in death thinking of his city nor st francis blessing with his last breath the town of assisi were barbarians it requires a certain greatness of soul to interpret patriotism worthilyor else a sincerity of feeling denied to the vulgar refinement of modern thought which cannot understand the august simplicity of a sentiment proceeding from the very nature of things and men  the aristocracy we were talking about was the very highest the great families of europe not impoverished not converted not liberalized the most distinctive and specialized class of all classes for which even ambition itself does not exist among the usual incentives to activity and regulators of conduct  the undisputed right of leadership having passed away from them we judged that their great fortunes their cosmopolitanism brought about by wide alliances their elevated station in which there is so little to gain and so much to lose must make their position difficult in times of political commotion or national upheaval no longer born to commandwhich is the very essence of aristocracyit becomes difficult for them to do aught else but hold aloof from the great movements of popular passion  we had reached that conclusion when the remark about faroff events was made and the date of 1831 mentioned and the speaker continued  i dont mean to say that i knew prince roman at that remote time i begin to feel pretty ancient but i am not so ancient as that in fact prince roman was married the very year my father was born it was in 1828 the 19th century was young yet and the prince was even younger than the century but i dont know exactly by how much in any case his was an early marriage it was an ideal alliance from every point of view the girl was young and beautiful an orphan heiress of a great name and of a great fortune the prince then an officer in the guards and distinguished amongst his fellows by something reserved and reflective in his character had fallen headlong in love with her beauty her charm and the serious qualities of her mind and heart he was a rather silent young man but his glances his bearing his whole person expressed his absolute devotion to the woman of his choice a devotion which she returned in her own frank and fascinating manner  the flame of this pure young passion promised to burn for ever and for a season it lit up the dry cynical atmosphere of the great world of st petersburg the emperor nicholas himself the grandfather of the present man the one who died from the crimean war the last perhaps of the autocrats with a mystical belief in the divine character of his mission showed some interest in this pair of married lovers it is true that nicholas kept a watchful eye on all the doings of the great polish nobles the young people leading a life appropriate to their station were obviously wrapped up in each other and society fascinated by the sincerity of a feeling moving serenely among the artificialities of its anxious and fastidious agitation watched them with benevolent indulgence and an amused tenderness  the marriage was the social event of 1828 in the capital just forty years afterwards i was staying in the country house of my mothers brother in our southern provinces  it was the dead of winter the great lawn in front was as pure and smooth as an alpine snowfield a white and feathery level sparkling under the sun as if sprinkled with diamonddust declining gently to the lakea long sinuous piece of frozen water looking bluish and more solid than the earth a cold brilliant sun glided low above an undulating horizon of great folds of snow in which the villages of ukrainian peasants remained out of sight like clusters of boats hidden in the hollows of a running sea and everything was very still  i dont know now how i had managed to escape at eleven oclock in the morning from the schoolroom i was a boy of eight the little girl my cousin a few months younger than myself though hereditarily more quicktempered was less adventurous so i had escaped alone and presently i found myself in the great stonepaved hall warmed by a monumental stove of white tiles a much more pleasant locality than the schoolroom which for some reason or other perhaps hygienic was always kept at a low temperature  we children were aware that there was a guest staying in the house he had arrived the night before just as we were being driven off to bed we broke back through the line of beaters to rush and flatten our noses against the dark window panes but we were too late to see him alight we had only watched in a ruddy glare the big travelling carriage on sleighrunners harnessed with six horses a black mass against the snow going off to the stables preceded by a horseman carrying a blazing ball of tow and resin in an iron basket at the end of a long stick swung from his saddle bow two stable boys had been sent out early in the afternoon along the snowtracks to meet the expected guest at dusk and light his way with these road torches at that time you must remember there was not a single mile of railways in our southern provinces my little cousin and i had no knowledge of trains and engines except from picturebooks as of things rather vague extremely remote and not particularly interesting unless to grownups who travelled abroad  our notion of princes perhaps a little more precise was mainly literary and had a glamour reflected from the light of fairy tales in which princes always appear young charming heroic and fortunate yet as well as any other children we could draw a firm line between the real and the ideal we knew that princes were historical personages and there was some glamour in that fact too but what had driven me to roam cautiously over the house like an escaped prisoner was the hope of snatching an interview with a special friend of mine the head forester who generally came to make his report at that time of the day i yearned for news of a certain wolf you know in a country where wolves are to be found every winter almost brings forward an individual eminent by the audacity of his misdeeds by his more perfect wolfishnessso to speak i wanted to hear some new thrilling tale of that wolfperhaps the dramatic story of his death  but there was no one in the hall  deceived in my hopes i became suddenly very much depressed unable to slip back in triumph to my studies i elected to stroll spiritlessly into the billiard room where certainly i had no business there was no one there either and i felt very lost and desolate under its high ceiling all alone with the massive english billiard table which seemed in heavy rectilinear silence to disapprove of that small boys intrusion  as i began to think of retreat i heard footsteps in the adjoining drawing room and before i could turn tail and flee my uncle and his guest appeared in the doorway to run away after having been seen would have been highly improper so i stood my ground my uncle looked surprised to see me the guest by his side was a spare man of average stature buttoned up in a black frock coat and holding himself very erect with a stiffly soldierlike carriage from the folds of a soft white cambric neckcloth peeped the points of a collar close against each shaven cheek a few wisps of thin gray hair were brushed smoothly across the top of his bald head his face which must have been beautiful in its day had preserved in age the harmonious simplicity of its lines what amazed me was its even almost deathlike pallor he seemed to me to be prodigiously old a faint smile a mere momentary alteration in the set of his thin lips acknowledged my blushing confusion and i became greatly interested to see him reach into the inside breastpocket of his coat he extracted therefrom a lead pencil and a block of detachable pages which he handed to my uncle with an almost imperceptible bow  i was very much astonished but my uncle received it as a matter of course he wrote something at which the other glanced and nodded slightly a thin wrinkled handthe hand was older than the facepatted my cheek and then rested on my head lightly an unringing voice a voice as colourless as the face itself issued from his sunken lips while the eyes dark and still looked down at me kindly  and how old is this shy little boy  before i could answer my uncle wrote down my age on the pad i was deeply impressed what was this ceremony was this personage too great to be spoken to again he glanced at the pad and again gave a nod and again that impersonal mechanical voice was heard he resembles his grandfather  i remembered my paternal grandfather he had died not long before he too was prodigiously old and to me it seemed perfectly natural that two such ancient and venerable persons should have known each other in the dim ages of creation before my birth but my uncle obviously had not been aware of the fact so obviously that the mechanical voice explained yes yes comrades in 31 he was one of those who knew old times my dear sir old times  he made a gesture as if to put aside an importunate ghost and now they were both looking down at me i wondered whether anything was expected from me to my round questioning eyes my uncle remarked hes completely deaf and the unrelated inexpressive voice said give me your hand  acutely conscious of inky fingers i put it out timidly i had never seen a deaf person before and was rather startled he pressed it firmly and then gave me a final pat on the head  my uncle addressed me weightily you have shaken hands with prince roman s its something for you to remember when you grow up  i was impressed by his tone i had enough historical information to know vaguely that the princes s counted amongst the sovereign princes of ruthenia till the union of all ruthenian lands to the kingdom of poland when they became great polish magnates sometime at the beginning of the 15th century but what concerned me most was the failure of the fairytale glamour it was shocking to discover a prince who was deaf bald meagre and so prodigiously old it never occurred to me that this imposing and disappointing man had been young rich beautiful i could not know that he had been happy in the felicity of an ideal marriage uniting two young hearts two great names and two great fortunes happy with a happiness which as in fairy tales seemed destined to last for ever  but it did not last for ever it was fated not to last very long even by the measure of the days allotted to mens passage on this earth where enduring happiness is only found in the conclusion of fairy tales a daughter was born to them and shortly afterwards the health of the young princess began to fail for a time she bore up with smiling intrepidity sustained by the feeling that now her existence was necessary for the happiness of two lives but at last the husband thoroughly alarmed by the rapid changes in her appearance obtained an unlimited leave and took her away from the capital to his parents in the country  the old prince and princess were extremely frightened at the state of their beloved daughterinlaw preparations were at once made for a journey abroad but it seemed as if it were already too late and the invalid herself opposed the project with gentle obstinacy thin and pale in the great armchair where the insidious and obscure nervous malady made her appear smaller and more frail every day without effacing the smile of her eyes or the charming grace of her wasted face she clung to her native land and wished to breathe her native air nowhere else could she expect to get well so quickly nowhere else would it be so easy for her to die  she died before her little girl was two years old the grief of the husband was terrible and the more alarming to his parents because perfectly silent and dryeyed after the funeral while the immense bareheaded crowd of peasants surrounding the private chapel on the grounds was dispersing the prince waving away his friends and relations remained alone to watch the masons of the estate closing the family vault when the last stone was in position he uttered a groan the first sound of pain which had escaped from him for days and walking away with lowered head shut himself up again in his apartments  his father and mother feared for his reason his outward tranquillity was appalling to them they had nothing to trust to but that very youth which made his despair so selfabsorbed and so intense old prince john fretful and anxious repeated poor roman should be roused somehow hes so young but they could find nothing to rouse him with and the old princess wiping her eyes wished in her heart he were young enough to come and cry at her knee  in time prince roman making an effort would join now and again the family circle but it was as if his heart and his mind had been buried in the family vault with the wife he had lost he took to wandering in the woods with a gun watched over secretly by one of the keepers who would report in the evening that his serenity has never fired a shot all day sometimes walking to the stables in the morning he would order in subdued tones a horse to be saddled wait switching his boot till it was led up to him then mount without a word and ride out of the gates at a walking pace he would be gone all day people saw him on the roads looking neither to the right nor to the left whitefaced sitting rigidly in the saddle like a horseman of stone on a living mount  the peasants working in the fields the great unhedged fields looked after him from the distance and sometimes some sympathetic old woman on the threshold of a low thatched hut was moved to make the sign of the cross in the air behind his back as though he were one of themselves a simple village soul struck by a sore affliction  he rode looking straight ahead seeing no one as if the earth were empty and all mankind buried in that grave which had opened so suddenly in his path to swallow up his happiness what were men to him with their sorrows joys labours and passions from which she who had been all the world to him had been cut off so early  they did not exist and he would have felt as completely lonely and abandoned as a man in the toils of a cruel nightmare if it had not been for this countryside where he had been born and had spent his happy boyish years he knew it wellevery slight rise crowned with trees amongst the ploughed fields every dell concealing a village the dammed streams made a chain of lakes set in the green meadows far away to the north the great lithuanian forest faced the sun no higher than a hedge and to the south the way to the plains the vast brown spaces of the earth touched the blue sky  and this familiar landscape associated with the days without thought and without sorrow this land the charm of which he felt without even looking at it soothed his pain like the presence of an old friend who sits silent and disregarded by one in some dark hour of life  one afternoon it happened that the prince after turning his horses head for home remarked a low dense cloud of dark dust cutting off slantwise a part of the view he reined in on a knoll and peered there were slender gleams of steel here and there in that cloud and it contained moving forms which revealed themselves at last as a long line of peasant carts full of soldiers moving slowly in double file under the escort of mounted cossacks  it was like an immense reptile creeping over the fields its head dipped out of sight in a slight hollow and its tail went on writhing and growing shorter as though the monster were eating its way slowly into the very heart of the land  the prince directed his way through a village lying a little off the track the roadside inn with its stable byre and barn under one enormous thatched roof resembled a deformed hunchbacked ragged giant sprawling amongst the small huts of the peasants the innkeeper a portly dignified jew clad in a black satin coat reaching down to his heels and girt with a red sash stood at the door stroking his long silvery beard  he watched the prince approach and bowed gravely from the waist not expecting to be noticed even since it was well known that their young lord had no eyes for anything or anybody in his grief it was quite a shock for him when the prince pulled up and asked  whats all this yankel  that is please your serenity that is a convoy of footsoldiers they are hurrying down to the south  he glanced right and left cautiously but as there was no one near but some children playing in the dust of the village street he came up close to the stirrup  doesnt your serenity know it has begun already down there all the landowners great and small are out in arms and even the common people have risen only yesterday the saddler from grodek it was a tiny markettown near by went through here with his two apprentices on his way to join he left even his cart with me i gave him a guide through our neighbourhood you know your serenity our people they travel a lot and they see all thats going on and they know all the roads  he tried to keep down his excitement for the jew yankel innkeeper and tenant of all the mills on the estate was a polish patriot and in a still lower voice  i was already a married man when the french and all the other nations passed this way with napoleon tse tse that was a great harvest for death nu perhaps this time god will help  the prince nodded perhapsand falling into deep meditation he let his horse take him home  that night he wrote a letter and early in the morning sent a mounted express to the post town during the day he came out of his taciturnity to the great joy of the family circle and conversed with his father of recent eventsthe revolt in warsaw the flight of the grand duke constantine the first slight successes of the polish army at that time there was a polish army the risings in the provinces old prince john moved and uneasy speaking from a purely aristocratic point of view mistrusted the popular origins of the movement regretted its democratic tendencies and did not believe in the possibility of success he was sad inwardly agitated  i am judging all this calmly there are secular principles of legitimity and order which have been violated in this reckless enterprise for the sake of most subversive illusions though of course the patriotic impulses of the heart  prince roman had listened in a thoughtful attitude he took advantage of the pause to tell his father quietly that he had sent that morning a letter to st petersburg resigning his commission in the guards  the old prince remained silent he thought that he ought to have been consulted his son was also ordnance officer to the emperor and he knew that the tsar would never forget this appearance of defection in a polish noble in a discontented tone he pointed out to his son that as it was he had an unlimited leave the right thing would have been to keep quiet they had too much tact at court to recall a man of his name or at worst some distant mission might have been asked forto the caucasus for instanceaway from this unhappy struggle which was wrong in principle and therefore destined to fail  presently you shall find yourself without any interest in life and with no occupation and you shall need something to occupy you my poor boy you have acted rashly i fear  prince roman murmured  i thought it better  his father faltered under his steady gaze  well wellperhaps but as ordnance officer to the emperor and in favour with all the imperial family  those people had never been heard of when our house was already illustrious the young man let fall disdainfully  this was the sort of remark to which the old prince was sensible  wellperhaps it is better he conceded at last  the father and son parted affectionately for the night the next day prince roman seemed to have fallen back into the depths of his indifference he rode out as usual he remembered that the day before he had seen a reptilelike convoy of soldiery bristling with bayonets crawling over the face of that land which was his the woman he loved had been his too death had robbed him of her her loss had been to him a moral shock it had opened his heart to a greater sorrow his mind to a vaster thought his eyes to all the past and to the existence of another love fraught with pain but as mysteriously imperative as that lost one to which he had entrusted his happiness  that evening he retired earlier than usual and rang for his personal servant  go and see if there is light yet in the quarters of the masterofthehorse if he is still up ask him to come and speak to me  while the servant was absent on this errand the prince tore up hastily some papers locked the drawers of his desk and hung a medallion containing the miniature of his wife round his neck against his breast  the man the prince was expecting belonged to that past which the death of his love had called to life he was of a family of small nobles who for generations had been adherents servants and friends of the princes s he remembered the times before the last partition and had taken part in the struggles of the last hour he was a typical old pole of that class with a great capacity for emotion for blind enthusiasm with martial instincts and simple beliefs and even with the oldtime habit of larding his speech with latin words and his kindly shrewd eyes his ruddy face his lofty brow and his thick gray pendent moustache were also very typical of his kind  listen master francis the prince said familiarly and without preliminaries listen old friend i am going to vanish from here quietly i go where something louder than my grief and yet something with a voice very like it calls me i confide in you alone you will say whats necessary when the time comes  the old man understood his extended hands trembled exceedingly but as soon as he found his voice he thanked god aloud for letting him live long enough to see the descendant of the illustrious family in its youngest generation give an example coram gentibus of the love of his country and of valour in the field he doubted not of his dear prince attaining a place in council and in war worthy of his high birth he saw already that in fulgore of family glory affulget patride serenitas at the end of the speech he burst into tears and fell into the princes arms  the prince quieted the old man and when he had him seated in an armchair and comparatively composed he said  dont misunderstand me master francis you know how i loved my wife a loss like that opens ones eyes to unsuspected truths there is no question here of leadership and glory i mean to go alone and to fight obscurely in the ranks i am going to offer my country what is mine to offer that is my life as simply as the saddler from grodek who went through yesterday with his apprentices  the old man cried out at this that could never be he could not allow it but he had to give way before the arguments and the express will of the prince ha if you say that it is a matter of feeling and conscienceso be it but you cannot go utterly alone alas that i am too old to be of any use cripit verba dolor my dear prince at the thought that i am over seventy and of no more account in the world than a cripple in the church porch it seems that to sit at home and pray to god for the nation and for you is all i am fit for but there is my son my youngest son peter he will make a worthy companion for you and as it happens hes staying with me here there has not been for ages a prince s hazarding his life without a companion of our name to ride by his side you must have by you somebody who knows who you are if only to let your parents and your old servant hear what is happening to you and when does your princely mightiness mean to start  in an hour said the prince and the old man hurried off to warn his son  prince roman took up a candlestick and walked quietly along a dark corridor in the silent house the headnurse said afterwards that waking up suddenly she saw the prince looking at his child one hand shading the light from its eyes he stood and gazed at her for some time and then putting the candlestick on the floor bent over the cot and kissed lightly the little girl who did not wake he went out noiselessly taking the light away with him she saw his face perfectly well but she could read nothing of his purpose in it it was pale but perfectly calm and after he turned away from the cot he never looked back at it once  the only other trusted person besides the old man and his son peter was the jew yankel when he asked the prince where precisely he wanted to be guided the prince answered to the nearest party a grandson of the jew a lanky youth conducted the two young men by littleknown paths across woods and morasses and led them in sight of the few fires of a small detachment camped in a hollow some invisible horses neighed a voice in the dark cried who goes there and the young jew departed hurriedly explaining that he must make haste home to be in time for keeping the sabbath  thus humbly and in accord with the simplicity of the vision of duty he saw when death had removed the brilliant bandage of happiness from his eyes did prince roman bring his offering to his country his companion made himself known as the son of the master ofthehorse to the princes s and declared him to be a relation a distant cousin from the same parts as himself and as people presumed of the same name in truth no one inquired much two more young men clearly of the right sort had joined nothing more natural  prince roman did not remain long in the south one day while scouting with several others they were ambushed near the entrance of a village by some russian infantry the first discharge laid low a good many and the rest scattered in all directions the russians too did not stay being afraid of a return in force after some time the peasants coming to view the scene extricated prince roman from under his dead horse he was unhurt but his faithful companion had been one of the first to fall the prince helped the peasants to bury him and the other dead  then alone not certain where to find the body of partizans which was constantly moving about in all directions he resolved to try and join the main polish army facing the russians on the borders of lithuania disguised in peasant clothes in case of meeting some marauding cossacks he wandered a couple of weeks before he came upon a village occupied by a regiment of polish cavalry on outpost duty  on a bench before a peasant hut of a better sort sat an elderly officer whom he took for the colonel the prince approached respectfully told his story shortly and stated his desire to enlist and when asked his name by the officer who had been looking him over carefully he gave on the spur of the moment the name of his dead companion  the elderly officer thought to himself heres the son of some peasant proprietor of the liberated class he liked his appearance  and can you read and write my good fellowhe asked  yes your honour i can said the prince  good come along inside the hut the regimental adjutant is there he will enter your name and administer the oath to you  the adjutant stared very hard at the newcomer but said nothing when all the forms had been gone through and the recruit gone out he turned to his superior officer  do you know who that is  who that peter a likely chap  thats prince roman s  nonsense  but the adjutant was positive he had seen the prince several times about two years before in the castle in warsaw he had even spoken to him once at a reception of officers held by the grand duke  hes changed he seems much older but i am certain of my man i have a good memory for faces  the two officers looked at each other in silence  hes sure to be recognized sooner or later murmured the adjutant the colonel shrugged his shoulders  its no affair of oursif he has a fancy to serve in the ranks as to being recognized its not so likely all our officers and men come from the other end of poland  he meditated gravely for a while then smiled he told me he could read and write theres nothing to prevent me making him a sergeant at the first opportunity hes sure to shape all right  prince roman as a noncommissioned officer surpassed the colonels expectations before long sergeant peter became famous for his resourcefulness and courage it was not the reckless courage of a desperate man it was a selfpossessed as if conscientious valour which nothing could dismay a boundless but equable devotion unaffected by time by reverses by the discouragement of endless retreats by the bitterness of waning hopes and the horrors of pestilence added to the toils and perils of war it was in this year that the cholera made its first appearance in europe it devastated the camps of both armies affecting the firmest minds with the terror of a mysterious death stalking silently between the piledup arms and around the bivouac fires  a sudden shriek would wake up the harassed soldiers and they would see in the glow of embers one of themselves writhe on the ground like a worm trodden on by an invisible foot and before the dawn broke he would be stiff and cold parties so visited have been known to rise like one man abandon the fire and run off into the night in mute panic or a comrade talking to you on the march would stammer suddenly in the middle of a sentence roll affrighted eyes and fall down with distorted face and blue lips breaking the ranks with the convulsions of his agony men were struck in the saddle on sentry duty in the firing line carrying orders serving the guns i have been told that in a battalion forming under fire with perfect steadiness for the assault of a village three cases occurred within five minutes at the head of the column and the attack could not be delivered because the leading companies scattered all over the fields like chaff before the wind  sergeant peter young as he was had a great influence over his men it was said that the number of desertions in the squadron in which he served was less than in any other in the whole of that cavalry division such was supposed to be the compelling example of one mans quiet intrepidity in facing every form of danger and terror  however that may be he was liked and trusted generally when the end came and the remnants of that army corps hard pressed on all sides were preparing to cross the prussian frontier sergeant peter had enough influence to rally round him a score of troopers he managed to escape with them at night from the hemmedin army he led this band through 200 miles of country covered by numerous russian detachments and ravaged by the cholera but this was not to avoid captivity to go into hiding and try to save themselves no he led them into a fortress which was still occupied by the poles and where the last stand of the vanquished revolution was to be made  this looks like mere fanaticism but fanaticism is human man has adored ferocious divinities there is ferocity in every passion even in love itself the religion of undying hope resembles the mad cult of despair of death of annihilation the difference lies in the moral motive springing from the secret needs and the unexpressed aspiration of the believers it is only to vain men that all is vanity and all is deception only to those who have never been sincere with themselves  it was in the fortress that my grandfather found himself together with sergeant peter my grandfather was a neighbour of the s family in the country but he did not know prince roman who however knew his name perfectly well the prince introduced himself one night as they both sat on the ramparts leaning against a gun carriage  the service he wished to ask for was in case of his being killed to have the intelligence conveyed to his parents  they talked in low tones the other servants of the piece lying about near them my grandfather gave the required promise and then asked franklyfor he was greatly interested by the disclosure so unexpectedly made  but tell me prince why this request have you any evil forebodings as to yourself  not in the least i was thinking of my people they have no idea where i am answered prince roman ill engage to do as much for you if you like its certain that half of us at least shall be killed before the end so theres an even chance of one of us surviving the other  my grandfather told him where as he supposed his wife and children were then from that moment till the end of the siege the two were much together on the day of the great assault my grandfather received a severe wound the town was taken next day the citadel itself its hospital full of dead and dying its magazines empty its defenders having burnt their last cartridge opened its gates  during all the campaign the prince exposing his person conscientiously on every occasion had not received a scratch no one had recognized him or at any rate had betrayed his identity till then as long as he did his duty it had mattered nothing who he was  now however the position was changed as exguardsman and as late ordnance officer to the emperor this rebel ran a serious risk of being given special attention in the shape of a firing squad at ten paces for more than a month he remained lost in the miserable crowd of prisoners packed in the casemates of the citadel with just enough food to keep body and soul together but otherwise allowed to die from wounds privation and disease at the rate of forty or so a day  the position of the fortress being central new parties captured in the open in the course of a thorough pacification were being sent in frequently amongst such newcomers there happened to be a young man a personal friend of the prince from his school days he recognized him and in the extremity of his dismay cried aloud my god roman you here  it is said that years of life embittered by remorse paid for this momentary lack of selfcontrol all this happened in the main quadrangle of the citadel the warning gesture of the prince came too late an officer of the gendarmes on guard had heard the exclamation the incident appeared to him worth inquiring into the investigation which followed was not very arduous because the prince asked categorically for his real name owned up at once  the intelligence of the prince s being found amongst the prisoners was sent to st petersburg his parents were already there living in sorrow incertitude and apprehension the capital of the empire was the safest place to reside in for a noble whose son had disappeared so mysteriously from home in a time of rebellion the old people had not heard from him or of him for months they took care not to contradict the rumours of suicide from despair circulating in the great world which remembered the interesting lovematch the charming and frank happiness brought to an end by death but they hoped secretly that their son survived and that he had been able to cross the frontier with that part of the army which had surrendered to the prussians  the news of his captivity was a crushing blow directly nothing could be done for him but the greatness of their name of their position their wide relations and connections in the highest spheres enabled his parents to act indirectly and they moved heaven and earth as the saying is to save their son from the consequences of his madness as poor prince john did not hesitate to express himself great personages were approached by society leaders high dignitaries were interviewed powerful officials were induced to take an interest in that affair the help of every possible secret influence was enlisted some private secretaries got heavy bribes the mistress of a certain senator obtained a large sum of money  but as i have said in such a glaring case no direct appeal could be made and no open steps taken all that could be done was to incline by private representation the mind of the president of the military commission to the side of clemency he ended by being impressed by the hints and suggestions some of them from very high quarters which he received from st petersburg and after all the gratitude of such great nobles as the princes s was something worth having from a worldly point of view he was a good russian but he was also a goodnatured man moreover the hate of poles was not at that time a cardinal article of patriotic creed as it became some thirty years later he felt well disposed at first sight towards that young man bronzed thinfaced worn out by months of hard campaigning the hardships of the siege and the rigours of captivity  the commission was composed of three officers it sat in the citadel in a bare vaulted room behind a long black table some clerks occupied the two ends and besides the gendarmes who brought in the prince there was no one else there  within those four sinister walls shutting out from him all the sights and sounds of liberty all hopes of the future all consoling illusionsalone in the face of his enemies erected for judges who can tell how much love of life there was in prince roman how much remained in that sense of duty revealed to him in sorrow how much of his awakened love for his native country that country which demands to be loved as no other country has ever been loved with the mournful affection one bears to the unforgotten dead and with the unextinguishable fire of a hopeless passion which only a living breathing warm ideal can kindle in our breasts for our pride for our weariness for our exultation for our undoing  there is something monstrous in the thought of such an exaction till it stands before us embodied in the shape of a fidelity without fear and without reproach nearing the supreme moment of his life the prince could only have had the feeling that it was about to end he answered the questions put to him clearly conciselywith the most profound indifference after all those tense months of action to talk was a weariness to him but he concealed it lest his foes should suspect in his manner the apathy of discouragement or the numbness of a crushed spirit the details of his conduct could have no importance one way or another with his thoughts these men had nothing to do he preserved a scrupulously courteous tone he had refused the permission to sit down  what happened at this preliminary examination is only known from the presiding officer pursuing the only possible course in that glaringly bad case he tried from the first to bring to the princes mind the line of defence he wished him to take he absolutely framed his questions so as to put the right answers in the culprits mouth going so far as to suggest the very words how distracted by excessive grief after his young wifes death rendered irresponsible for his conduct by his despair in a moment of blind recklessness without realizing the highly reprehensible nature of the act nor yet its danger and its dishonour he went off to join the nearest rebels on a sudden impulse and that now penitently  but prince roman was silent the military judges looked at him hopefully in silence he reached for a pen and wrote on a sheet of paper he found under his hand i joined the national rising from conviction  he pushed the paper across the table the president took it up showed it in turn to his two colleagues sitting to the right and left then looking fixedly at prince roman let it fall from his hand and the silence remained unbroken till he spoke to the gendarmes ordering them to remove the prisoner  such was the written testimony of prince roman in the supreme moment of his life i have heard that the princes of the s family in all its branches adopted the last two words from conviction for the device under the armorial bearings of their house i dont know whether the report is true my uncle could not tell me he remarked only that naturally it was not to be seen on prince romans own seal  he was condemned for life to siberian mines emperor nicholas who always took personal cognizance of all sentences on polish nobility wrote with his own hand in the margin the authorities are severely warned to take care that this convict walks in chains like any other criminal every step of the way  it was a sentence of deferred death very few survived entombment in these mines for more than three years yet as he was reported as still alive at the end of that time he was allowed on a petition of his parents and by way of exceptional grace to serve as common soldier in the caucasus all communication with him was forbidden he had no civil rights for all practical purposes except that of suffering he was a dead man the little child he had been so careful not to wake up when he kissed her in her cot inherited all the fortune after prince johns death her existence saved those immense estates from confiscation  it was twentyfive years before prince roman stone deaf his health broken was permitted to return to poland his daughter married splendidly to a polish austrian grand seigneur and moving in the cosmopolitan sphere of the highest european aristocracy lived mostly abroad in nice and vienna he settling down on one of her estates not the one with the palatial residence but another where there was a modest little house saw very little of her  but prince roman did not shut himself up as if his work were done there was hardly anything done in the private and public life of the neighbourhood in which prince romans advice and assistance were not called upon and never in vain it was well said that his days did not belong to himself but to his fellow citizens and especially he was the particular friend of all returned exiles helping them with purse and advice arranging their affairs and finding them means of livelihood  i heard from my uncle many tales of his devoted activity in which he was always guided by a simple wisdom a high sense of honour and the most scrupulous conception of private and public probity he remains a living figure for me because of that meeting in a billiard room when in my anxiety to hear about a particularly wolfish wolf i came in momentary contact with a man who was preeminently a man amongst all men capable of feeling deeply of believing steadily of loving ardently  i remember to this day the grasp of prince romans bony wrinkled hand closing on my small inky paw and my uncles halfserious halfamused way of looking down at his trespassing nephew  they moved on and forgot that little boy but i did not move i gazed after them not so much disappointed as disconcerted by this prince so utterly unlike a prince in a fairy tale they moved very slowly across the room before reaching the other door the prince stopped and i heard himi seem to hear him nowsaying i wish you would write to vienna about filling up that post hes a most deserving fellowand your recommendation would be decisive  my uncles face turned to him expressed genuine wonder it said as plainly as any speech could say what better recommendation than a fathers can be needed the prince was quick at reading expressions again he spoke with the toneless accent of a man who has not heard his own voice for years for whom the soundless world is like an abode of silent shades  and to this day i remember the very words i ask you because you see my daughter and my soninlaw dont believe me to be a good judge of men they think that i let myself be guided too much by mere sentiment      the tale 1917   outside the large single window the crepuscular light was dying out slowly in a great square gleam without colour framed rigidly in the gathering shades of the room  it was a long room the irresistible tide of the night ran into the most distant part of it where the whispering of a mans voice passionately interrupted and passionately renewed seemed to plead against the answering murmurs of infinite sadness  at last no answering murmur came his movement when he rose slowly from his knees by the side of the deep shadowy couch holding the shadowy suggestion of a reclining woman revealed him tall under the low ceiling and sombre all over except for the crude discord of the white collar under the shape of his head and the faint minute spark of a brass button here and there on his uniform  he stood over her a moment masculine and mysterious in his immobility before he sat down on a chair near by he could see only the faint oval of her upturned face and extended on her black dress her pale hands a moment before abandoned to his kisses and now as if too weary to move  he dared not make a sound shrinking as a man would do from the prosaic necessities of existence as usual it was the woman who had the courage her voice was heard firstalmost conventional while her being vibrated yet with conflicting emotions  tell me something she said  the darkness hid his surprise and then his smile had he not just said to her everything worth saying in the worldand that not for the first time  what am i to tell you he asked in a voice creditably steady he was beginning to feel grateful to her for that something final in her tone which had eased the strain  why not tell me a tale  a tale he was really amazed  yes why not  these words came with a slight petulance the hint of a loved womans capricious will which is capricious only because it feels itself to to be a law embarrassing sometimes and always difficult to elude  why not he repeated with a slightly mocking accent as though he had been asked to give her the moon but now he was feeling a little angry with her for that feminine mobility that slips out of an emotion as easily as out of a splendid gown  he heard her say a little unsteadily with a sort of fluttering intonation which made him think suddenly of a butterflys flight  you used to tellyouryour simple andand professionaltales very well at one time or well enough to interest me you had aa sort of artin the daysthe days before the war  really he said with involuntary gloom but now you see the war is going on he continued in such a dead equable tone that she felt a slight chill fall over her shoulders and yet she persisted for theres nothing more unswerving in the world than a womans caprice  it could be a tale not of this world she explained  you want a tale of the other the better world he asked with a matteroffact surprise you must evoke for that task those who have already gone there  no i dont mean that i mean anothersome otherworld in the universenot in heaven  i am relieved but you forget that i have only five days leave  yes and ive also taken a five days leave fromfrom my duties  i like that word  what word  duty  it is horriblesometimes  oh thats because you think its narrow but it isnt it contains infinities andand so  what is this jargon  he disregarded the interjected scorn an infinity of absolution for instance he continued but as to this another worldwhos going to look for it and for the tale that is in it  you she said with a strange almost rough sweetness of assertion  he made a shadowy movement of assent in his chair the irony of which not even the gathered darkness could render mysterious  as you will in that world then there was once upon a time a commanding officer and a northman put in the capitals please because they had no other names it was a world of seas and continents and islands  like the earth she murmured bitterly  yes what else could you expect from sending a man made of our common tormented clay on a voyage of discovery what else could he find what else could you understand or care for or feel the existence of even there was comedy in it and slaughter  always like the earth she murmured always and since i could find in the universe only what was deeply rooted in the fibres of my being there was love in it too but we wont talk of that  no we wont she said in a neutral tone which concealed perfectly her reliefor her disappointment then after a pause she added its going to be a comic story  well he paused too yes in a way in a very grim way it will be human and as you know comedy is but a matter of the visual angle and it wont be a noisy story all the long guns in it will be dumbas dumb as so many telescopes  ah there are guns in it then and may i askwhere  afloat you remember that the world of which we speak had its seas a war was going on in it it was a funny work and terribly in earnest its war was being carried on over the land over the water under the water up in the air and even under the ground and many young men in it mostly in wardrooms and messrooms used to say to each otherpardon the unparliamentary wordthey used to say its a damned bad war but its better than no war at all sounds flippant doesnt it  he heard a nervous impatient sigh in the depths of the couch while he went on without a pause  and yet there is more in it than meets the eye i mean more wisdom flippancy like comedy is but a matter of visual first impression that world was not very wise but there was in it a certain amount of common working sagacity that however was mostly worked by the neutrals in diverse ways public and private which had to be watched watched by acute minds and also by actual sharp eyes they had to be very sharp indeed too i assure you  i can imagine she murmured appreciatively  what is there that you cant imagine he pronounced soberly you have the world in you but let us go back to our commanding officer who of course commanded a ship of a sort my tales if often professional as you remarked just now have never been technical so ill just tell you that the ship was of a very ornamental sort once with lots of grace and elegance and luxury about her yes once she was like a pretty woman who had suddenly put on a suit of sackcloth and stuck revolvers in her belt but she floated lightly she moved nimbly she was quite good enough  that was the opinion of the commanding officer said the voice from the couch  it was he used to be sent out with her along certain coasts to seewhat he could see just that and sometimes he had some preliminary information to help him and sometimes he had not and it was all one really it was about as useful as information trying to convey the locality and intentions of a cloud of a phantom taking shape here and there and impossible to seize would have been  it was in the early days of the war what at first used to amaze the commanding officer was the unchanged face of the waters with its familiar expression neither more friendly nor more hostile on fine days the sun strikes sparks upon the blue here and there a peaceful smudge of smoke hangs in the distance and it is impossible to believe that the familiar clear horizon traces the limit of one great circular ambush  yes it is impossible to believe till some day you see a ship not your own ship that isnt so impressive but some ship in company blow up all of a sudden and plop under almost before you know what has happened to her then you begin to believe henceforth you go out for the work to seewhat you can see and you keep on at it with the conviction that some day you will die from something you have not seen one envies the soldiers at the end of the day wiping the sweat and blood from their faces counting the dead fallen to their hands looking at the devastated fields the torn earth that seems to suffer and bleed with them one does really the final brutality of itthe taste of primitive passionthe ferocious frankness of the blow struck with ones handthe direct call and the straight response well the sea gave you nothing of that and seemed to pretend that there was nothing the matter with the world  she interrupted stirring a little  oh yes sincerityfranknesspassionthree words of your gospel dont i know them  think isnt it oursbelieved in common he asked anxiously yet without expecting an answer and went on at once such were the feelings of the commanding officer when the night came trailing over the sea hiding what looked like the hypocrisy of an old friend it was a relief the night blinds you franklyand there are circumstances when the sunlight may grow as odious to one as falsehood itself night is all right  at night the commanding officer could let his thoughts get awayi wont tell you where somewhere where there was no choice but between truth and death but thick weather though it blinded one brought no such relief mist is deceitful the dead luminosity of the fog is irritating it seems that you ought to see  one gloomy nasty day the ship was steaming along her beat in sight of a rocky dangerous coast that stood out intensely black like an indiaink drawing on gray paper presently the second in command spoke to his chief he thought he saw something on the water to seaward small wreckage perhaps  but there shouldnt be any wreckage here sir he remarked  no said the commanding officer the last reported submarined ships were sunk a long way to the westward but one never knows there may have been others since then not reported nor seen gone with all hands  that was how it began the ships course was altered to pass the object close for it was necessary to have a good look at what one could see close but without touching for it was not advisable to come in contact with objects of any form whatever floating casually about close but without stopping or even diminishing speed for in those times it was not prudent to linger on any particular spot even for a moment i may tell you at once that the object was not dangerous in itself no use in describing it it may have been nothing more remarkable than say a barrel of a certain shape and colour but it was significant  the smooth bowwave hove it up as if for a closer inspection and then the ship brought again to her course turned her back on it with indifference while twenty pairs of eyes on her deck stared in all directions trying to seewhat they could see  the commanding officer and his second in command discussed the object with understanding it appeared to them to be not so much a proof of the sagacity as of the activity of certain neutrals this activity had in many cases taken the form of replenishing the stores of certain submarines at sea this was generally believed if not absolutely known but the very nature of things in those early days pointed that way the object looked at closely and turned away from with apparent indifference put it beyond doubt that something of the sort had been done somewhere in the neighbourhood  the object in itself was more than suspect but the fact of its being left in evidence roused other suspicions was it the result of some deep and devilish purpose as to that all speculation soon appeared to be a vain thing finally the two officers came to the conclusion that it wras left there most likely by accident complicated possibly by some unforeseen necessity such perhaps as the sudden need to get away quickly from the spot or something of that kind  their discussion had been carried on in curt weighty phrases separated by long thoughtful silences and all the time their eyes roamed about the horizon in an everlasting almost mechanical effort of vigilance the younger man summed up grimly  well its evidence thats what this is evidence of what we were pretty certain of before and plain too  and much good it will do to us retorted the commanding officer the parties are miles away the submarine devil only knows where ready to kill and the noble neutral slipping away to the eastward ready to lie  the second in command laughed a little at the tone but he guessed that the neutral wouldnt even have to lie very much fellows like that unless caught in the very act felt themselves pretty safe they could afford to chuckle that fellow was probably chuckling to himself its very possible he had been before at the game and didnt care a rap for the bit of evidence left behind it was a game in which practice made one bold and successful too  and again he laughed faintly but his commanding officer was in revolt against the murderous stealthiness of methods and the atrocious callousness of complicities that seemed to taint the very source of mens deep emotions and noblest activities to corrupt their imagination which builds up the final conceptions of life and death he suffered  the voice from the sofa interrupted the narrator  how well i can understand that in him  he bent forward slightly  yes i too everything should be open in love and war open as the day since both are the call of an ideal which it is so easy so terribly easy to degrade in the name of victory  he paused then went on i dont know that the commanding officer delved so deep as that into his feelings but he did suffer from thema sort of disenchanted sadness it is possible even that he suspected himself of folly man is various but he had no time for much introspection because from the southwest a wall of fog had advanced upon his ship great convolutions of vapours flew over swirling about masts and funnel which looked as if they were beginning to melt then they vanished  the ship was stopped all sounds ceased and the very fog became motionless growing denser and as if solid in its amazing dumb immobility the men at their stations lost sight of each other footsteps sounded stealthy rare voices impersonal and remote died out without resonance a blind white stillness took possession of the world  it looked too as if it would last for days i dont mean to say that the fog did not vary a little in its density now and then it would thin out mysteriously revealing to the men a more or less ghostly presentment of their ship several times the shadow of the coast itself swam darkly before their eyes through the fluctuating opaque brightness of the great white cloud clinging to the water  taking advantage of these moments the ship had been moved cautiously nearer the shore it was useless to remain out in such thick weather her officers knew every nook and cranny of the coast along their beat they thought that she would be much better in a certain cove it wasnt a large place just ample room for a ship to swing at her anchor she would have an easier time of it till the fog lifted up  slowly with infinite caution and patience they crept closer and closer seeing no more of the cliffs than an evanescent dark loom with a narrow border of angry foam at its foot at the moment of anchoring the fog was so thick that for all they could see they might have been a thousand miles out in the open sea yet the shelter of the land could be felt there was a peculiar quality in the stillness of the air very faint very elusive the wash of the ripple against the encircling land reached their ears with mysterious sudden pauses  the anchor dropped the leads were laid in the commanding officer went below into his cabin but he had not been there very long when a voice outside his door requested his presence on deck he thought to himself what is it now he felt some impatience at being called out again to face the wearisome fog  he found that it had thinned again a little and had taken on a gloomy hue from the dark cliffs which had no form no outline but asserted themselves as a curtain of shadows all round the ship except in one bright spot which was the entrance from the open sea several officers were looking that way from the bridge the second in command met him with the breathlessly whispered information that there was another ship in the cove  she had been made out by several pairs of eyes only a couple of minutes before she was lying at anchor very near the entrancea mere vague blot on the fogs brightness and the commanding officer by staring in the direction pointed out to him by eager hands ended by distinguishing it at last himself indubitably a vessel of some sort  its a wonder we didnt run slap into her when coming in observed the second in command  send a boat on board before she vanishes said the commanding officer he surmised that this was a coaster it could hardly be anything else but another thought came into his head suddenly it is a wonder he said to his second in command who had rejoined him after sending the boat away  by that time both of them had been struck by the fact that the ship so suddenly discovered had not manifested her presence by ringing her bell  we came in very quietly thats true concluded the younger officer but they must have heard our leadsmen at least we couldnt have passed her more than fifty yards off the closest shave they may even have made us out since they were aware of something coming in and the strange thing is that we never heard a sound from her the fellows on board must have been holding their breath  aye said the commanding officer thoughtfully  in due course the boardingboat returned appearing suddenly alongside as though she had burrowed her way under the fog the officer in charge came up to make his report but the commanding officer didnt give him time to begin he cried from a distance  coaster isnt she  no sir a strangera neutral was the answer  no really well tell us all about it what is she doing here  the young man stated then that he had been told a long and complicated story of engine troubles but it was plausible enough from a strictly professional point of view and it had the usual features disablement dangerous drifting along the shore weather more or less thick for days fear of a gale ultimately a resolve to go in and anchor anywhere on the coast and so on fairly plausible  engines still disabled inquired the commanding officer  no sir she has steam on them  the commanding officer took his second aside by jove he said you were right they were holding their breaths as we passed them they were  but the second in command had his doubts now  a fog like this does muffle small sounds sir he remarked and what could his object be after all  to sneak out unnoticed answered the commanding officer  then why didnt he he might have done it you know not exactly unnoticed perhaps i dont suppose he could have slipped his cable without making some noise still in a minute or so he would have been lost to viewclean gone before we had made him out fairly yet he didnt  they looked at each other the commanding officer shook his head such suspicions as the one which had entered his head are not defended easily he did not even state it openly the boarding officer finished his report the cargo of the ship was of a harmless and useful character she was bound to an english port papers and everything in perfect order nothing suspicious to be detected anywhere  then passing to the men he reported the crew on deck as the usual lot engineers of the wellknown type and very full of their achievement in repairing the engines the mate surly the master rather a fine specimen of a northman civil enough but appeared to have been drinking seemed to be recovering from a regular bout of it  i told him i couldnt give him permission to proceed he said he wouldnt dare to move his ship her own length out in such weather as this permission or no permission i left a man on board though  quite right  the commanding officer after communing with his suspicions for a time called his second aside  what if she were the very ship which had been feeding some infernal submarine or other he said in an undertone  the other started then with conviction  she would get off scotfree you couldnt prove it sir  i want to look into it myself  from the report weve heard i am afraid you couldnt even make a case for reasonable suspicion sir  ill go on board all the same  he had made up his mind curiosity is the great motive power of hatred and love what did he expect to find he could not have told anybodynot even himself  what he really expected to find there was the atmosphere the atmosphere of gratuitous treachery which in his view nothing could excuse for he thought that even a passion of unrighteousness for its own sake could not excuse that but could he detect it sniff it taste it receive some mysterious communication which would turn his invincible suspicions into a certitude strong enough to provoke action with all its risks  the master met him on the afterdeck looming up in the fog amongst the blurred shapes of the usual snips fittings he was a robust northman bearded and in the force of his age a round leather cap fitted his head closely his hands were rammed deep into the pockets of his short leather jacket he kept them there while lie explained that at sea he lived in the chartroom and led the way there striding carelessly just before reaching the door under the bridge he staggered a little recovered himself flung it open and stood aside leaning his shoulder as if involuntarily against the side of the house and staring vaguely into the fogfilled space but he followed the commanding officer at once flung the door to snapped on the electric light and hastened to thrust his hands back into his pockets as though afraid of being seized by them either in friendship or in hostility  the place was stuffy and hot the usual chartrack overhead was full and the chart on the table was kept unrolled by an empty cup standing on a saucer halffull of some spilt dark liquid a slightly nibbled biscuit reposed on the chronometercase there were two settees and one of them had been made up into a bed with a pillow and some blankets which were now very much tumbled the northman let himself fall on it his hands still in his pockets  well here i am he said with a curious air of being surprised at the sound of his own voice  the commanding officer from the other settee observed the handsome flushed face drops of fog hung on the yellow beard and moustaches of the northman the much darker eyebrows ran together in a puzzled frown and suddenly he jumped up  what i mean is that i dont know where i am i really dont he burst out with extreme earnestness hang it all i got turned around somehow the fog has been after me for a week more than a week and then my engines broke down i will tell you how it was  he burst out into loquacity it was not hurried but it was insistent it was not continuous for all that it was broken by the most queer thoughtful pauses each of these pauses lasted no more than a couple of seconds and each had the profoundity of an endless meditation when he began again nothing betrayed in him the slightest consciousness of these intervals there was the same fixed glance the same unchanged earnestness of tone he didnt know indeed more than one of these pauses occurred in the middle of a sentence  the commanding officer listened to the tale it struck him as more plausible than simple truth is in the habit of being but that perhaps was prejudice all the time the northman was speaking the commanding officer had been aware of an inward voice a grave murmur in the depth of his very own self telling another tale as if on purpose to keep alive in him his indignation and his anger with that baseness of greed or of mere outlook which lies often at the root of simple ideas  it was the story that had been already told to the boarding officer an hour or so before the commanding officer nodded slightly at the northman from time to time the latter came to an end and turned his eyes away he added as an afterthought  wasnt it enough to drive a man out of his mind with worry and its my first voyage to this part too and the ships my own your officer has seen the papers she isnt much as you can see for yourself just an old cargoboat bare living for my family  he raised a big arm to point at a row of photographs plastering the bulkhead the movement was ponderous as if the arm had been made of lead the commanding officer said carelessly  you will be making a fortune yet for your family with this old ship  yes if i dont lose her said the northman gloomily  i meanout of this war added the commanding officer  the northman stared at him in a curiously unseeing and at the same time interested manner as only eyes of a particular blue shade can stare  and you wouldnt be angry at it he said would you you are too much of a gentleman we didnt bring this on you and suppose we sat down and cried what good would that be let those cry who made the trouble he concluded with energy times money you say wellthis time is money oh isnt it  the commanding officer tried to keep under the feeling of immense disgust he said to himself that it was unreasonable men were like thatmoral cannibals feeding on each others misfortunes he said aloud  you have made it perfectly plain how it is that you are here your logbook confirms you very minutely of course a logbook may be cooked nothing easier  the northman never moved a muscle he was gazing at the floor he seemed not to have heard he raised his head after a while  but you cant suspect me of anything he muttered negligently  the commanding officer thought why should he say this  immediately afterwards the man before him added my cargo is for an english port  his voice had turned husky for the moment the commanding officer reflected thats true there can be nothing i cant suspect him yet why was he lying with steam up in this fogand then hearing us come in why didnt he give some sign of life why could it be anything else but a guilty conscience he could tell by the leadsmen that this was a manofwar  yeswhy the commanding officer went on thinking suppose i ask him and then watch his face he will betray himself in some way its perfectly plain that the fellow has been drinking yes he has been drinking but he will have a lie ready all the same the commanding officer was one of those men who are made morally and almost physically uncomfortable by the mere thought of having to beat down a lie he shrank from the act in scorn and disgust which were invincible because more temperamental than moral  so he went out on deck instead and had the crew mustered formally for his inspection he found them very much what the report of the boarding officer had led him to expect and from their answers to his questions he could discover no flaw in the logbook story  he dismissed them his impression of them wasa picked lot have been promised a fistful of money each if this came off all slightly anxious but not frightened not a single one of them likely to give the show away they dont feel in danger of their life they know england and english ways too well  he felt alarmed at catching himself thinking as if his vaguest suspicions were turning into a certitude for indeed there was no shadow of reason for his inferences there was nothing to give away  he returned to the chartroom the northman had lingered behind there and something subtly different in his bearing more bold in his blue glassy stare induced the commanding officer to conclude that the fellow had snatched at the opportunity to take another swig at the bottle he must have had concealed somewhere  he noticed too that the northman on meeting his eyes put on an elaborately surprised expression at least it seemed elaborated nothing could be trusted and the englishman felt himself with astonishing conviction faced by an enormous lie solid like a wall with no way round to get at the truth whose ugly murderous face he seemed to see peeping over at him with a cynical grin  i dare say he began suddenly you are wondering at my proceedings though i am not detaining you am i you wouldnt dare to move in this fog  i dont know where i am the northman ejaculated earnestly i really dont  he looked around as if the very chartroom fittings were strange to him the commanding officer asked him whether he had not seen any unusual objects floating about while he was at sea  objects what objects we were groping blind in the fog for days  we had a few clear intervals said the commanding officer and ill tell you what we have seen and the conclusion ive come to about it  he told him in a few words he heard the sound of a sharp breath indrawn through closed teeth the northman with his hand on the table stood absolutely motionless and dumb he stood as if thunderstruck then he produced a fatuous smile  or at least so it appeared to the commanding officer was this significant or of no meaning whatever he didnt know he couldnt tell all the truth had departed out of the world as if drawn in absorbed in this monstrous villainy this man wasor was notguilty of  shootings too good for people that conceive neutrality in this pretty way remarked the commanding officer after a silence  yes yes yes the northman assented hurriedlythen added an unexpected and dreamyvoiced perhaps  was he pretending to be drunk or only trying to appear sober his glance was straight but it was somewhat glazed his lips outlined themselves firmly under his yellow moustache but they twitched did they twitch and why was he drooping like this in his attitude  theres no perhaps about it pronounced the commanding officer sternly  the northman had straightened himself and unexpectedly he looked stern too  no but what about the tempters better kill that lot off theres about four five six million of them he said grimly but in a moment changed into a whining key but i had better hold my tongue you have some suspicions  no ive no suspicions declared the commanding officer  he never faltered at that moment he had the certitude the air of the chartroom was thick with guilt and falsehood braving the discovery defying simple right common decency all humanity of feeling every scruple of conduct  the northman drew a long breath well we know that you english are gentlemen but let us speak the truth why should we love you so very much you havent done anything to be loved we dont love the other people of course they havent done anything for that either a fellow comes along with a bag of gold i havent been in rotterdam my last voyage for nothing  you may be able to tell something interesting then to our people when you come into port interjected the officer  i might but you keep some people in your pay at rotterdam let them report i am a neutralam i not have you ever seen a poor man on one side and a bag of gold on the other of course i couldnt be tempted i havent the nerve for it really i havent its nothing to me i am just talking openly for once  yes and i am listening to you said the commanding officer quietly  the northman leaned forward over the table now that i know you have no suspicions i talk you dont know what a poor man is i do i am poor myself this old ship she isnt much and she is mortgaged too bare living no more of course i wouldnt have the nerve but a man who has nerve see the stuff he takes aboard looks like any other cargopackages barrels tins copper tubeswhat not he doesnt see it work it isnt real to him but he sees the gold thats real of course nothing could induce me i suffer from an internal disease i would either go crazy from anxietyorortake to drink or something the risk is too great whyruin  it should be death the commanding officer got up after this curt declaration which the other received with a hard stare oddly combined with an uncertain smile the officers gorge rose at the atmosphere of murderous complicity which surrounded him denser more impenetrable more acrid than the fog outside  its nothing to me murmured the northman swaying visibly  of course not assented the commanding officer with a great effort to keep his voice calm and low the certitude was strong within him but i am going to clear all you fellows off this coast at once and i will begin with you you must leave in half an hour  by that time the officer was walking along the deck with the northman at his elbow  what in this fog the latter cried out huskily  yes you will have to go in this fog  but i dont know where i am i really dont  the commanding officer turned round a sort of fury possessed him the eyes of the two men met those of the northman expressed a profound amazement  oh you dont know how to get out the commanding officer spoke with composure but his heart was beating with anger and dread i will give you your course steer southbyeasthalfeast for about four miles and then you will be clear to haul to the eastward for your port the weather will clear up before very long  must i what could induce me i havent the nerve  and yet you must go unless you want to  i dont want to panted the northman ive enough of it  the commanding officer got over the side the northman remained still as if rooted to the deck before his boat reached his ship the commanding officer heard the steamer beginning to pick up her anchor then shadowy in the fog she steamed out on the given course  yes he said to his officers i let him go  the narrator bent forward towards the couch where no movement betrayed the presence of a living person  listen he said forcibly that course would lead the northman straight on a deadly ledge of rock and the commanding officer gave it to him he steamed outran on itand went down so he had spoken the truth he did not know where he was but it proves nothing nothing either way it may have been the only truth in all his story and yet he seems to have been driven out by a menacing starenothing more  he abandoned all pretence  yes i gave that course to him it seemed to me a supreme test i believeno i dont believe i dont know at the time i was certain they all went down and i dont know whether i have done stern retributionor murder whether i have added to the corpses that litter the bed of the unreadable sea the bodies of men completely innocent or basely guilty i dont know i shall never know  he rose the woman on the couch got up and threw her arms round his neck her eyes put two gleams in the deep shadow of the room she knew his passion for truth his horror of deceit his humanity  oh my poor poor  i shall never know he repeated sternly disengaged himself pressed her hands to his lips and went out      the black mate 1884   a good many years ago there were several ships loading at the jetty london dock i am speaking here of the eighties of the last century of the time when london had plenty of fine ships in the docks though not so many fine buildings in its streets  the ships at the jetty were fine enough they lay one behind the other and the sapphire third from the end was as good as the rest of them and nothing more each ship at the jetty had of course her chief officer on board so had every other ship in dock  the policeman at the gates knew them all by sight without being able to say at once without thinking to what ship any particular man belonged as a matter of fact the mates of the ships then lying in the london dock were like the majority of officers in the merchant servicea steady hardworking staunch unromanticlooking set of men belonging to various classes of society but with the professional stamp obliterating the personal characteristics which were not very marked anyhow  this last was true of them all with the exception of the mate of the sapphire of him the policemen could not be in doubt this one had a presence  he was noticeable to them in the street from a great distance and when in the morning he strode down the jetty to his ship the lumpers and the dock labourers rolling the bales and trundling the cases of cargo on their handtrucks would remark to each other  heres the black mate coming along  that was the name they gave him being a gross lot who could have no appreciation of the mans dignified bearing and to call him black was the superficial impressionism of the ignorant  of course mr bunter the mate of the sapphire was not black he was no more black than you or i and certainly as white as any chief mate of a ship in the whole of the port of london his complexion was of the sort that did not take the tan easily and i happen to know that the poor fellow had had a months illness just before he joined the sapphire  from this you will perceive that i knew bunter of course i knew him and whats more i knew his secret at the time this secret whichnever mind just now returning to bunters personal appearance it was nothing but ignorant prejudice on the part of the foreman stevedore to say as he did in my hearing i bet hes a furriner of some sort a man may have black hair without being set down for a dago i have known a westcountry sailor boatswain of a fine ship who looked more spanish than any spaniard afloat ive ever met he looked like a spaniard in a picture  competent authorities tell us that this earth is to be finally the inheritance of men with dark hair and brown eyes it seems that already the great majority of mankind is darkhaired in various shades but it is only when you meet one that you notice how men with really black hair black as ebony are rare bunters hair was absolutely black black as a ravens wing he wore too all his beard clipped but a good length all the same and his eyebrows were thick and bushy add to this steely blue eyes which in a fairhaired man would have been nothing so extraordinary but in that sombre framing made a startling contrast and you will easily understand that bunter was noticeable enough  if it had not been for the quietness of his movements for the general soberness of his demeanour one would have given him credit for a fiercely passionate nature  of course he was not in his first youth but if the expression in the force of his age has any meaning he realized it completely he was a tall man too though rather spare seeing him from his poop indefatigably busy with his duties captain ashton of the clipper ship elsinore lying just ahead of the sapphire remarked once to a friend that johns has got somebody there to hustle his ship along for him  captain johns master of the sapphire having commanded ships for many years was well known without being much respected or liked in the company of his fellows he was either neglected or chaffed the chaffing was generally undertaken by captain ashton a cynical and teasing sort of man it was captain ashton who permitted himself the unpleasant joke of proclaiming once in company that johns is of the opinion that every sailor above forty years of age ought to be poisonedshipmasters in actual command excepted  it was in a city restaurant where several wellknown shipmasters were having lunch together there was captain ashton florid and jovial in a large white waistcoat and with a yellow rose in his buttonhole captain sellers in a sackcoat thin and palefaced with his irongray hair tucked behind his ears and but for the absence of spectacles looking like an ascetical mild man of books captain hell a bluff seadog with hairy fingers in blue serge and a black felt hat pushed far back off his crimson forehead there was also a very young shipmaster with a little fair moustache and serious eyes who said nothing and only smiled faintly from time to time  captain johns very much startled raised his perplexed and credulous glance which together with a low and horizontally wrinkled brow did not make a very intellectual ensemble this impression was by no means mended by the slightly pointed form of his bald head  everybody laughed outright and thus guided captain johns ended by smiling rather sourly and attempted to defend himself it was all very well to joke but nowadays when ships to pay anything at all had to be driven hard on the passage and in harbour the sea was no place for elderly men only young men and men in their prime were equal to modern conditions of push and hurry look at the great firms almost every single one of them was getting rid of men showing any signs of age he for one didnt want any oldsters on board his ship  and indeed in this opinion captain johns was not singular there was at that time a lot of seamen with nothing against them but that they were grizzled wearing out the soles of their last pair of boots on the pavements of the city in the heartbreaking search for a berth  captain johns added with a sort of illhumoured innocence that from holding that opinion to thinking of poisoning people was a very long step  this seemed final but captain ashton would not let go his joke  oh yes i am sure you would you said distinctly of no use whats to be done with men who are of no use you are a kindhearted fellow johns i am sure that if only you thought it over carefully you would consent to have them poisoned in some painless manner  captain sellers twitched his thin sinuous lips  make ghosts of them he suggested pointedly  at the mention of ghosts captain johns became shy in his perplexed sly and unlovely manner  captain ashton winked  yes and then perhaps you would get a chance to have a communication with the world of spirits surely the ghosts of seamen should haunt ships some of them would be sure to call on an old shipmate  captain sellers remarked drily  dont raise his hopes like this its cruel he wont see anything you know johns that nobody has ever seen a ghost  at this intolerable provocation captain johns came out of his reserve with no perplexity whatever but with a positive passion of credulity giving momentary lustre to his dull little eyes he brought up a lot of authenticated instances there were books and books full of instances it was merest ignorance to deny supernatural apparitions cases were published every month in a special newspaper professor cranks saw ghosts daily and professor cranks was no small potatoes either one of the biggest scientific men living and there was that newspaper fellowwhats his namewho had a girlghost visitor he printed in his paper things she said to him and to say there were no ghosts after that  why they have been photographed what more proof do you want  captain johns was indignant captain bells lips twitched but captain ashton protested now  for goodness sake dont keep him going with that and by the by johns whos that hairy pirate youve got for your new mate nobody in the dock seems to have seen him before  captain johns pacified by the change of subjects answered simply that willy the tobacconist at the corner of fenchurch street had sent him along  willy his shop and the very house in fenchurch street i believe are gone now in his time wearing a careworn absentminded look on his pasty face willy served with tobacco many southerngoing ships out of the port of london at certain times of the day the shop would be full of shipmasters they sat on casks they lounged against the counter  many a youngster found his first lift in life there many a man got a sorely needed berth by simply dropping in for four pennyworth of birdseye at an auspicious moment even willys assistant a redheaded uninterested delicatelooking young fellow would hand you across the counter sometimes a bit of valuable intelligence with your box of cigarettes in a whisper lips hardly moving thus the bellona south dock second officer wanted you may be in time for it if you hurry up  and didnt one just fly  oh willy sent him said captain ashton hes a very striking man if you were to put a red sash round his waist and a red handkerchief round his head he would look exactly like one of them buccaneering chaps that made men walk the plank and carried women off into captivity look out johns he dont cut your throat for you and run off with the sapphire what ship has he come out of last  captain johns after looking up credulously as usual wrinkled his brow and said placidly that the man had seen better days his name was bunter  hes had command of a liverpool ship the samaria some years ago he lost her in the indian ocean and had his certificate suspended for a year ever since then he has not been able to get another command hes been knocking about in the western ocean trade lately  that accounts for him being a stranger to everybody about the docks captain ashton concluded as they rose from table  captain johns walked down to the dock after lunch he was short of stature and slightly bandy his appearance did not inspire the generality of mankind with esteem but it must have been otherwise with his employers he had the reputation of being an uncomfortable commander meticulous in trifles always nursing a grievance of some sort and incessantly nagging he was not a man to kick up a row with you and be done with it but to say nasty things in a whining voice a man capable of making ones life a perfect misery if he took a dislike to an officer  that very evening i went to see bunter on board and sympathized with him on his prospects for the voyage he was subdued i suppose a man with a secret locked up in his breast loses his buoyancy and there was another reason why i could not expect bunter to show a great elasticity of spirits for one thing he had been very seedy lately and besidesbut of that later  captain johns had been on board that afternoon and had loitered and dodged about his chief mate in a manner which had annoyed bunter exceedingly  what could he mean he asked with calm exasperation one would think he suspected i had stolen something and tried to see in what pocket i had stowed it away or that somebody told him i had a tail and he wanted to find out how i managed to conceal it i dont like to be approached from behind several times in one afternoon in that creepy way and then to be looked up at suddenly in front from under my elbow is it a new sort of peepbo game it doesnt amuse me i am no longer a baby  i assured him that if anyone were to tell captain johns that hebunterhad a tail johns would manage to get himself to believe the story in some mysterious manner he would he was suspicious and credulous to an inconceivable degree he would believe any silly tale suspect any man of anything and crawl about with it and ruminate the stuff and turn it over and over in his mind in the most miserable inwardly whining perplexity he would take the meanest possible view in the end and discover the meanest possible course of action by a sort of natural genius for that sort of thing  bunter also told me that the mean creature had crept all over the ship on his little bandy legs taking him along to grumble and whine to about a lot of trifles crept about the decks like a wretched insectlike a cockroach only not so lively  thus did the selfpossessed bunter express himself with great disgust then going on with his usual stately deliberation made sinister by the frown of his jetblack eyebrows  and the fellow is mad too he tried to be sociable for a bit and could find nothing else but to make big eyes at me and ask me if i believed in communication beyond the grave communication beyondi didnt know what he meant at first i didnt know what to say a very solemn subject mr bunter says he ive given a great deal of study to it  had johns lived on shore he would have been the predestined prey of fraudulent mediums or even if he had had any decent opportunities between the voyages luckily for him when in england he lived somewhere far away in leytonstone with a maiden sister ten years older than himself a fearsome virago twice his size before whom he trembled it was said she bullied him terribly in general and in the particular instance of his spiritualistic leanings she had her own views  these leanings were to her simply satanic she was reported as having declared that with gods help she would prevent that fool from giving himself up to the devils it was beyond doubt that johns secret ambition was to get into personal communication with the spirits of the deadif only his sister would let him but she was adamant i was told that while in london he had to account to her for every penny of the money he took with him in the morning and for every hour of his time and she kept the bankbook too  bunter he had been a wild youngster but he was well connected had ancestors there was a family tomb somewhere in the home countiesbunter was indignant perhaps on account of his own dead those steelyblue eyes of his flashed with positive ferocity out of that blackbearded face he impressed methere was so much dark passion in his leisurely contempt  the cheek of the fellow enter into relations with a mean little cad like this it would be an impudent intrusion he wants to enter what is it a new sort of snobbishness or what  i laughed outright at this original view of spiritismor whatever the ghost craze is called even bunter himself condescended to smile but it was an austere quickly vanished smile a man in his almost i may say tragic position couldnt be expectedyou understand he was really worried he was ready eventually to put up with any dirty trick in the course of the voyage a man could not expect much consideration should he find himself at the mercy of a fellow like johns a misfortune is a misfortune and theres an end of it but to be bored by mean lowspirited inane ghost stories in the johns style all the way out to calcutta and back again was an intolerable apprehension to be under spiritism was indeed a solemn subject to think about in that light dreadful even  poor fellow little we both thought that before very long he himself however i could give him no comfort i was rather appalled myself  bunter had also another annoyance that day a confounded berthing master came on board on some pretence or other but in reality bunter thought simply impelled by an inconvenient curiosityinconvenient to bunter that is after some beating about the bush that man suddenly said  i cant help thinking ive seen you before somewhere mr mate if i heard your name perhaps bunter  thats the worst of a life with a mystery in ithe was much alarmed it was very likely that the man had seen him beforeworse luck to his excellent memory bunter himself could not be expected to remember every casual dock walloper he might have had to do with bunter brazened it out by turning upon the man making use of that impressive blackasnight sternness of expression his unusual hair furnished him with  my names bunter sir does that enlighten your inquisitive intellect and i dont ask what your name may be i dont want to know ive no use for it sir an individual who calmly tells me to my face that he is not sure if he has seen me before either means to be impudent or is no better than a worm sir yes i said a worma blind worm  brave bunter that was the line to take he fairly drove the beggar out of the ship as if every word had been a blow but the pertinacity of that brassbound paul pry was astonishing he cleared out of the ship of course before bunters ire not saying anything and only trying to cover up his retreat by a sickly smile but once on the jetty he turned deliberately round and set himself to stare in dead earnest at the ship he remained planted there like a mooringpost absolutely motionless and with his stupid eyes winking no more than a pair of cabin portholes  what could bunter do it was awkward for him you know he could not go and put his head into the breadlocker what he did was to take up a position abaft the mizzenrigging and stare back as unwinking as the other so they remained and i dont know which of them grew giddy first but the man on the jetty not having the advantage of something to hold on to got tired the soonest flung his arm giving the contest up as it were and went away at last  bunter told me he was glad the sapphire that gem amongst ships as he alluded to her sarcastically was going to sea next day he had had enough of the dock i understood his impatience he had steeled himself against any possible worry the voyage might bring though it is clear enough now that he was not prepared for the extraordinary experience that was awaiting him already and in no other part of the world than the indian ocean itself the very part of the world where the poor fellow had lost his ship and had broken his luck as it seemed for good and all at the same time  as to his remorse in regard to a certain secret action of his life well i understand that a man of bunters fine character would suffer not a little still between ourselves and without the slightest wish to be cynical it cannot be denied that with the noblest of us the fear of being found out enters for some considerable part into the composition of remorse i didnt say this in so many words to bunter but as the poor fellow harped a bit on it i told him that there were skeletons in a good many honest cupboards and that as to his own particular guilt it wasnt writ large on his face for everybody to seeso he neednt worry as to that and besides he would be gone to sea in about twelve hours from now  he said there was some comfort in that thought and went off then to spend his last evening for many months with his wife for all his wildness bunter had made no mistake in his marrying he had married a lady a perfect lady she was a dear little woman too as to her pluck i who know what times they had to go through i cannot admire her enough for it real hardwearing every day and day after day pluck that only a woman is capable of when she is of the right sortthe undismayed sort i would call it  the black mate felt this parting with his wife more than any of the previous ones in all the years of bad luck but she was of the undismayed kind and showed less trouble in her gentle face than the blackhaired buccaneerlike but dignified mate of the sapphire it may be that her conscience was less disturbed than her husbands of course his life had no secret places for her but a womans conscience is somewhat more resourceful in finding good and valid excuses it depends greatly on the person that needs them too  they had agreed that she should not come down to the dock to see him off i wonder you care to look at me at all said the sensitive man and she did not laugh  bunter was very sensitive he left her rather brusquely at the last he got on board in good time and produced the usual impression on the mudpilot in the brokendown straw hat who took the sapphire out of dock the riverman was very polite to the dignified strikinglooking chief mate the fiveinch manilla for the checkrope mrbunter thank youmr bunter please the seapilot who left the gem of ships heading comfortably down channel off dover told some of his friends that this voyage the sapphire had for chief mate a man who seemed a jolly sight too good for old johns bunters his name i wonder where hes sprung from never seen him before in any ship i piloted in or out all these years hes the sort of man you dont forget you couldnt a thorough good sailor too and wont old johns just worry his head off unless the old fool should take fright at himfor he does not seem the sort of man that would let himself be put upon without letting you know what he thinks of you and thats exactly what old johns would be more afraid of than of anything else  as this is really meant to be the record of a spiritualistic experience which came if not precisely to captain johns himself at any rate to his ship there is no use in recording the other events of the passage out it was an ordinary passage the crew was an ordinary crew the weather was of the usual kind the black mates quiet sedate method of going to work had given a sober tone to the life of the ship even in gales of wind everything went on quietly somehow  there was only one severe blow which made things fairly lively for all hands for full fourandtwenty hours that was off the coast of africa after passing the cape of good hope at the very height of it several heavy seas were shipped with no serious results but there was a considerable smashing of breakable objects in the pantry and in the staterooms mr bunter who was so greatly respected on board found himself treated scurvily by the southern ocean which bursting open the door of his room like a ruffianly burglar carried off several useful things and made all the others extremely wet  later on the same day the southern ocean caused the sapphire to lurch over in such an unrestrained fashion that the two drawers fitted under mr bunters sleepingberth flew out altogether spilling all their contents they ought of course to have been locked and mr bunter had only to thank himself for what had happened he ought to have turned the key on each before going out on deck  his consternation was very great the steward who was paddling about all the time with swabs trying to dry out the flooded cuddy heard him exclaim hallo in a startled and dismayed tone in the midst of his work the steward felt a sympathetic concern for the mates distress  captain johns was secretly glad when he heard of the damage he was indeed afraid of his chief mate as the seapilot had ventured to foretell and afraid of him for the very reason the seapilot had put forward as likely  captain johns therefore would have liked very much to hold that black mate of his at his mercy in some way or other but the man was irreproachable as near absolute perfection as could be and captain johns was much annoyed and at the same time congratulated himself on his chief officers efficiency  he made a great show of living sociably with him on the principle that the more friendly you are with a man the more easily you may catch him tripping and also for the reason that he wanted to have somebody who would listen to his stories of manifestations apparitions ghosts and all the rest of the imbecile spooklore he had it all at his fingers ends and he spun those ghostly yarns in a persistent colourless voice giving them a futile turn peculiarly his own  i like to converse with my officers he used to say there are masters that hardly ever open their mouths from beginning to end of a passage for fear of losing their dignity whats that after allthis bit of position a man holds  his sociability was most to be dreaded in the second dogwatch because he was one of those men who grow lively towards the evening and the officer on duty was unable then to find excuses for leaving the poop captain johns would pop up the companion suddenly and sidling up in his creeping way to poor bunter as he walked up and down would fire into him some spiritualistic proposition such as  spirits male and female show a good deal of refinement in a general way dont they  to which bunter holding his blackwhiskered head high would mutter  i dont know  ah thats because you dont want to you are the most obstinate prejudiced man ive ever met mr bunter i told you you may have any book out of my bookcase you may just go into my stateroom and help yourself to any volume  and if bunter protested that he was too tired in his watches below to spare any time for reading captain johns would smile nastily behind his back and remark that of course some people needed more sleep than others to keep themselves fit for their work if mr bunter was afraid of not keeping properly awake when on duty at night that was another matter  but i think you borrowed a novel to read from the second mate the other daya trashy pack of lies captain johns sighed i am afraid you are not a spiritually minded man mr bunter thats whats the matter  sometimes he would appear on deck in the middle of the night looking very grotesque and bandylegged in his sleeping suit at that sight the persecuted bunter would wring his hands stealthily and break out into moisture all over his forehead after standing sleepily by the binnacle scratching himself in an unpleasant manner captain johns was sure to start on some aspect or other of his only topic  he would for instance discourse on the improvement of morality to be expected from the establishment of general and close intercourse with the spirits of the departed the spirits captain johns thought would consent to associate familiarly with the living if it were not for the unbelief of the great mass of mankind he himself would not care to have anything to do with a crowd that would not believe in hiscaptain johnsexistence then why should a spirit this was asking too much  he went on breathing hard by the binnacle and trying to reach round his shoulderblades then with a thick drowsy severity declared  incredulity sir is the evil of the age  it rejected the evidence of professor cranks and of the journalist chap it resisted the production of photographs  for captain johns believed firmly that certain spirits had been photographed he had read something of it in the papers and the idea of it having been done had got a tremendous hold on him because his mind was not critical bunter said afterwards that nothing could be more weird than this little man swathed in a sleeping suit three sizes too large for him shuffling with excitement in the moonlight near the wheel and shaking his fist at the serene sea  photographs photographs he would repeat in a voice as creaky as a rusty hinge  the very helmsman just behind him got uneasy at that performance not being capable of understanding exactly what the old man was kicking up a row with the mate about  then johns after calming down a bit would begin again  the sensitised plate cant lie no sir  nothing could be more funny than this ridiculous little mans convictionhis dogmatic tone bunter would go on swinging up and down the poop like a deliberate dignified pendulum he said not a word but the poor fellow had not a trifle on his conscience as you know and to have imbecile ghosts rammed down his throat like this on top of his own worry nearly drove him crazy he knew that on many occasions he was on the verge of lunacy because he could not help indulging in halfdelirious visions of captain johns being picked up by the scruff of the neck and dropped over the taffrail into the ships wakethe sort of thing no sane sailorman would think of doing to a cat or any other animal anyhow he imagined him bobbing upa tiny black speck left far astern on the moonlit ocean  i dont think that even at the worst moments bunter really desired to drown captain johns i fancy that all his disordered imagination longed for was merely to stop the ghostly inanity of the skippers talk  but all the same it was a dangerous form of selfindulgence just picture to yourself that ship in the indian ocean on a clear tropical night with her sails full and still the watch on deck stowed away out of sight and on her poop flooded with moonlight the stately black mate walking up and down with measured dignified steps preserving an awful silence and that grotesquely mean little figure in striped flannelette alternately creaking and droning of personal intercourse beyond the grave  it makes me creepy all over to think of and sometimes the folly of captain johns would appear clothed in a sort of weird utilitarianism how useful it would be if the spirits of the departed could be induced to take a practical interest in the affairs of the living what a help say to the police for instance in the detection of crime the number of murders at any rate would be considerably reduced he guessed with an air of great sagacity then he would give way to grotesque discouragement  where was the use of trying to communicate with people that had no faith and more likely than not would scorn the offered information spirits had their feelings they were all feelings in a way but he was surprised at the forbearance shown towards murderers by their victims that was the sort of apparition that no guilty man would dare to poohpooh and perhaps the undiscovered murdererswhether believing or notwere haunted they wouldnt be likely to boast about it would they  for myself he pursued in a sort of vindictive malevolent whine if anybody murdered me i would not let him forget it i would wither him upi would terrify him to death  the idea of his skippers ghost terrifying anyone was so ludicrous that the black mate little disposed to mirth as he was could not help giving vent to a weary laugh  and this laugh the only acknowledgment of a long and earnest discourse offended captain johns  whats there to laugh at in this conceited manner mr bunter he snarled supernatural visitations have terrified better men than you dont you allow me enough soul to make a ghost of  i think it was the nasty tone that caused bunter to stop short and turn about  i shouldnt wonder went on the angry fanatic of spiritism if you werent one of them people that take no more account of a man than if he were a beast you would be capable i dont doubt to deny the possession of an immortal soul to your own father  and then bunter being bored beyond endurance and also exasperated by the private worry lost his selfpossession  he walked up suddenly to captain johns and stooping a little to look close into his face said in a low even tone  you dont know what a man like me is capable of  captain johns threw his head back but was too astonished to budge bunter resumed his walk and for a long time his measured footsteps and the low wash of the water alongside were the only sounds which troubled the silence brooding over the great waters then captain johns cleared his throat uneasily and after sidling away towards the companion for greater safety plucked up enough courage to retreat under an act of authority  raise the starboard clew of the mainsail and lay the yards dead square mr bunter dont you see the wind is nearly right aft  bunter at once answered ay ay sir though there was not the slightest necessity to touch the yards and the wind was well out on the quarter while he was executing the order captain johns hung on the companionsteps growling to himself walk this poop like an admiral and dont even notice when the yards want trimmingloud enough for the helmsman to overhear then he sank slowly backwards out of the mans sight and when he reached the bottom of the stairs he stood still and thought  hes an awful ruffian with all his gentlemanly airs no more gentleman mates for me  two nights afterwards he was slumbering peacefully in his berth when a heavy thumping just above his head a wellunderstood signal that he was wanted on deck made him leap out of bed broad awake in a moment  whats up he muttered running out barefooted on passing through the cabin he glanced at the clock it was the middle watch what on earth can the mate want me for he thought  bolting out of the companion he found a clear dewy moonlit night and a strong steady breeze he looked around wildly there was no one on the poop except the helmsman who addressed him at once  it was me sir i let go the wheel for a second to stamp over your head i am afraid theres something wrong with the mate  wheres he got to asked the captain sharply  the man who was obviously nervous said  the last i saw of him was as hefell down the port poopladder  fell down the poopladder what did he do that for what made him  i dont know sir he was walking the port side then just as he turned towards me to come aft  you saw him interrupted the captain  i did i was looking at him and i heard the crash toosomething awful like the mainmast going overboard it was as if something had struck him  captain johns became very uneasy and alarmed come he said sharply did anybody strike him what did you see  nothing sir so help me there was nothing to see he just gave a little sort of hallo threw his hands before him and over he wentcrash i couldnt hear anything more so i just let go the wheel for a second to call you up  youre scared said captain johns i am sir straight  captain johns stared at him the silence of his ship driving on her way seemed to contain a dangera mystery he was reluctant to go and look for his mate himself in the shadows of the maindeck so quiet so still  all he did was to advance to the break of the poop and call for the watch as the sleepy men came trooping aft he shouted to them fiercely  look at the foot of the port poopladder some of you see the mate lying there  their startled exclamations told him immediately that they did see him somebody even screeched out emotionally hes dead  mr bunter was laid in his bunk and when the lamp in his room was lit he looked indeed as if he were dead but it was obvious also that he was breathing yet the steward had been roused out the second mate called and sent on deck to look after the ship and for an hour or so captain johns devoted himself silently to the restoring of consciousness mr bunter at last opened his eyes but he could not speak he was dazed and inert the steward bandaged a nasty scalpwound while captain johns held an additional light they had to cut away a lot of mr bunters jetblack hair to make a good dressing this done and after gazing for a while at their patient the two left the cabin  a rum go this steward said captain johns in the passage  yessir  a sober man thats right in his head does not fall down a poopladder like a sack of potatoes the ships as steady as a church  yessir fit of some kind i shouldnt wonder  well i should he doesnt look as if he were subject to fits and giddiness why the mans in the prime of life i wouldnt have another kind of matenot if i knew it you dont think he has a private store of liquor do you eh he seemed to me a bit strange in his manner several times lately off his feed too a bit i noticed  well sir if he ever had a bottle or two of grog in his cabin that must have gone a long time ago i saw him throw some broken glass overboard after the last gale we had but that didnt amount to anything anyway sir you couldnt call mr bunter a drinking man  no conceded the captain reflectively and the steward locking the pantry door tried to escape out of the passage thinking he could manage to snatch another hour of sleep before it was time for him to turn out for the day  captain johns shook his head  theres some mystery there  theres special providence that he didnt crack his head like an eggshell on the quarterdeck mooringbits sir the men tell me he couldnt have missed them by more than an inch  and the steward vanished skilfully  captain johns spent the rest of the night and the whole of the ensuing day between his own room and that of the mate  in his own room he sat with his open hands reposing on his knees his lips pursed up and the horizontal furrows on his forehead marked very heavily now and then raising his arm by a slow as if cautious movement he scratched lightly the top of his bald head in the mates room he stood for long periods of time with his hand to his lips gazing at the halfconscious man  for three days mr bunter did not say a single word he looked at people sensibly enough but did not seem to be able to hear any questions put to him they cut off some more of his hair and swathed his head in wet cloths he took some nourishment and was made as comfortable as possible at dinner on the third day the second mate remarked to the captain in connection with the affair  these halfround brass plates on the steps of the poopladders are beastly dangerous things  are they retorted captain johns sourly it takes more than a brass plate to account for an ablebodied man crashing down in this fashion like a felled ox  the second mate was impressed by that view there was something in that he thought  and the weather fine everything dry and the ship going along as steady as a church pursued captain johns gruffly  as captain johns continued to look extremely sour the second mate did not open his lips any more during the dinner captain johns was annoyed and hurt by an innocent remark because the fitting of the aforesaid brass plates had been done at his suggestion only the voyage before in order to smarten up the appearance of the poopladders  on the fourth day mr bunter looked decidedly better very languid yet of course but he heard and understood what was said to him and even could say a few words in a feeble voice  captain johns coming in contemplated him attentively without much visible sympathy  well can you give us your account of this accident mr bunter  bunter moved slightly his bandaged head and fixed his cold blue stare on captain johns face as if taking stock and appraising the value of every feature the perplexed forehead the credulous eyes the inane droop of the mouth and he gazed so long that captain johns grew restive and looked over his shoulder at the door  no accident breathed out bunter in a peculiar tone  you dont mean to say youve got the falling sickness said captain johns how would you call it signing as chief mate of a clipper ship with a thing like that on you  bunter answered him only by a sinister look the skipper shuffled his feet a little  well what made you have that tumble then  bunter raised himself a little and looking straight into captain johns eyes said in a very distinct whisper  youwereright  he fell back and closed his eyes not a word more could captain johns get out of him and the steward coming into the cabin the skipper withdrew  but that very night unobserved captain johns opening the door cautiously entered again the mates cabin he could wait no longer the suppressed eagerness the excitement expressed in all his mean creeping little person did not escape the chief mate who was lying awake looking frightfully pulled down and perfectly impassive  you are coming to gloat over me i suppose said bunter without moving and yet making a palpable hit  bless my soul exclaimed captain johns with a start and assuming a sobered demeanour theres a thing to say  well gloat then you and your ghosts youve managed to get over a live man  this was said by bunter without stirring in a low voice and with not much expression  do you mean to say inquired captain johns in awestruck whisper that you had a supernatural experience that night you saw an apparition then on board my ship  reluctance shame disgust would have been visible on poor bunters countenance if the great part of it had not been swathed up in cottonwool and bandages his ebony eyebrows more sinister than ever amongst all that lot of white linen came together in a frown as he made a mighty effort to say  yes i have seen  the wretchedness in his eyes would have awakened the compassion of any other man than captain johns but captain johns was all agog with triumphant excitement he was just a little bit frightened too he looked at that unbelieving scoffer laid low and did not even dimly guess at his profound humiliating distress he was not generally capable of taking much part in the anguish of his fellowcreatures this time moreover he was excessively anxious to know what had happened fixing his credulous eyes on the bandaged head he asked trembling slightly  and did itdid it knock you down  come am i the sort of man to be knocked down by a ghost protested bunter in a little stronger tone dont you remember what you said yourself the other night better men than meha youll have to look a long time before you find a better man for a mate of your ship  captain johns pointed a solemn finger at bunters bedplace  youve been terrified he said thats whats the matter youve been terrified why even the man at the wheel was scared though he couldnt see anything he felt the supernatural you are punished for your incredulity mr bunter you were terrified  and suppose i was said bunter do you know what i had seen can you conceive the sort of ghost that would haunt a man like me do you think it was a ladyish afternoon call anothercupofteaplease apparition that visits your professor cranks and that journalist chap you are always talking about no i cant tell you what it was like every man has his own ghosts you couldnt conceive  bunter stopped out of breath and captain johns remarked with the glow of inward satisfaction reflected in his tone  ive always thought you were the sort of man that was ready for anything from pitchandtoss to wilful murder as the saying goes well well so you were terrified  i stepped back said bunter curtly i dont remember anything else  the man at the wheel told me you went backwards as if something had hit you  it was a sort of inward blow explained bunter something too deep for you captain johns to understand your life and mine havent been the same arent you satisfied to see me converted  and you cant tell me any more asked captain johns anxiously  no i cant i wouldnt it would be no use if i did that sort of experience must be gone through say i am being punished well i take my punishment but talk of it i wont  very well said captain johns you wont but mind i can draw my own conclusions from that  draw what you like but be careful what you say sir you dont terrify me you arent a ghost  one word has it any connection with what you said to me on that last night when we had a talk together on spiritualism  bunter looked weary and puzzled  what did i say  you told me that i couldnt know what a man like you was capable of  yes yes enough  very good i am fixed then remarked captain johns all i say is that i am jolly glad not to be you though i would have given almost anything for the privilege of personal communication with the world of spirits yes sir but not in that way  poor bunter moaned pitifully  it has made me feel twenty years older  captain johns retired quietly he was delighted to observe this overbearing ruffian humbled to the dust by the moralizing agency of the spirits the whole occurrence was a source of pride and gratification and he began to feel a sort of regard for his chief mate  it is true that in further interviews bunter showed himself very mild and deferential he seemed to cling to his captain for spiritual protection he used to send for him and say i feel so nervous and captain johns would stay patiently for hours in the hot little cabin and feel proud of the call  for mr bunter was ill and could not leave his berth for a good many days he became a convinced spiritualist not enthusiasticallythat could hardly have been expected from himbut in a grim unshakable way he could not be called exactly friendly to the disembodied inhabitants of our globe as captain johns was but he was now a firm if gloomy recruit of spiritualism  one afternoon as the ship was already well to the north in the gulf of bengal the steward knocked at the door of the captains cabin and said without opening it  the mate asks if you could spare him a moment sir he seems to be in a state in there  captain johns jumped up from the couch at once  yes tell him i am coming  he thought could it be possible there had been another spiritual manifestationin the daytime too  he revelled in the hope it was not exactly that however still bunter whom he saw sitting collapsed in a chairhe had been up for several days but not on deck as yetpoor bunter had something startling enough to communicate his hands covered his face his legs were stretched straight out dismally  whats the news now croaked captain johns not unkindly because in truth it always pleased him to see bunteras he expressed ittamed  news exclaimed the crushed sceptic through his iands ay news enough captain johns who will be able to deny the awfulness the genuineness another man would have dropped dead you want to know what i had seen all i can tell you is that since ive seen it my hair is turning white  bunter detached his hands from his face and they hung on each side of his chair as if dead he looked broken in the dusky cabin  you dont say stammered out captain johns turned white hold on a bit ill light the lamp  when the lamp was lit the startling phenomenon could be seen plainly enough as if the dread the horror the anguish of the supernatural were being exhaled through the pores of his skin a sort of silvery mist seemed to cling to the cheeks and the head of the mate his short beard his cropped hair were growing not black but grayalmost white  when mr bunter thinfaced and shaky came on deck for duty he was cleanshaven and his head was white the hands were awestruck another man they whispered to each other it was generally and mysteriously agreed that the mate had seen something with the exception of the man at the wheel at the time who maintained that the mate was struck by something  this distinction hardly amounted to a difference on the other hand everybody admitted that after he picked up his strength a bit he seemed even smarter in his movements than before  one day in calcutta captain johns pointing out to a visitor his whiteheaded chief mate standing by the mainhatch was heard to say oracularly  that mans in the prime of life  of course while bunter was away i called regularly on mrs bunter every saturday just to see whether she had any use for my services it was understood i would do that she had just his halfpay to live onit amounted to about a pound a week she had taken one room in a quiet little square in the east end  and this was affluence to what i had heard that the couple were reduced to for a time after bunter had to give up the western ocean tradehe used to go as mate of all sorts of hard packets after he lost his ship and his luck togetherit was affluence to that time when bunter would start at seven oclock in the morning with but a glass of hot water and a crust of dry bread it wont stand thinking about especially for those who know mrs bunter i had seen something of them too at that time and it just makes me shudder to remember what that born lady had to put up with enough  dear mrs bunter used to worry a good deal after the sapphire left for calcutta she would say to me it must be so awful for poor winstonwinston is bunters nameand i tried to comfort her the best i could afterwards she got some small children to teach in a family and was half the day with them and the occupation was good for her  in the very first letter she had from calcutta bunter told her he had had a fall down the poopladder and cut his head but no bones broken thank god that was all of course she had other letters from him but that vagabond bunter never gave me a scratch of the pen the solid eleven months i supposed naturally that everything was going on all right who could imagine what was happening  then one day dear mrs bunter got a letter from a legal firm in the city advising her that her uncle was deadher old curmudgeon of an unclea retired stockbroker a heartless petrified antiquity that had lasted on and on he was nearly ninety i believe and if i were to meet his venerable ghost this minute i would try to take him by the throat and strangle him  the old beast would never forgive his niece for marrying bunter and years afterwards when people made a point of letting him know that she was in london pretty nearly starving at forty years of age he only said serve the little fool right i believe he meant her to starve and lo and behold the old cannibal died intestate with no other relatives but that very identical little fool the bunters were wealthy people now  of course mrs bunter wept as if her heart would break in any other woman it would have been mere hypocrisy naturally too she wanted to cable the news to her winston in calcutta but i showed her gazette in hand that the ship was on the homewardbound list for more than a week already so we sat down to wait and talked meantime of dear old winston every day there were just one hundred such days before the sapphire got reported all well in the chops of the channel by an incoming mailboat  i am going to dunkirk to meet him says she the sapphire had a cargo of jute for dunkirk of course i had to escort the dear lady in the quality of her ingenious friend she calls me our ingenious friend to this day and ive observed some peoplestrangerslooking hard at me for the signs of the ingenuity i suppose  after settling mrs bunter in a good hotel in dunkirk i walked down to the dockslate afternoon it wasand what was my surprise to see the ship actually fast alongside either johns or bunter or both must have been driving her hard up channel anyway she had been in since the day before last and her crew was already paid off i met two of her apprenticed boys going off home on leave with their dunnage on a frenchmans barrow as happy as larks and i asked them if the mate was on board  there he is on the quay looking at the moorings says one of the youngsters as he skipped past me  you may imagine the shock to my feelings when i beheld his white head i could only manage to tell him that his wife was at an hotel in town he left me at once to go and get his hat on board i was mightily surprised by the smartness of his movements as he hurried up the gangway  whereas the black mate struck people as deliberate and strangely stately in his gait for a man in the prime of life this whiteheaded chap seemed the most wonderfully alert of old men i dont suppose bunter was any quicker on his pins than before it was the colour of the hair that made all the difference in ones judgment  the same with his eyes those eyes that looked at you so steely so fierce and so fascinating out of a bush of a buccaneers black hair now had an innocent almost boyish expression in their goodhumoured brightness under those white eyebrows  i led him without any delay into mrs bunters private sittingroom after she had dropped a tear over the late cannibal given a hug to her winston and told him that he must grow his moustache again the dear lady tucked her feet upon the sofa and i got out of bunters way  he started at once to pace the room waving his long arms he worked himself into a regular frenzy and tore johns limb from limb many times over that evening  fell down of course i fell down by slipping backwards on that fools patent brass plates pon my word i had been walking that poop in charge of the ship and i didnt know whether i was in the indian ocean or in the moon i was crazy my head spun round and round with sheer worry i had made my last application of your chemists wonderful stuff this to me all the store of bottles you gave me got smashed when those drawers fell out in the last gale i had been getting some dry things to change when i heard the cry all hands on deck and made one jump of it without even pushing them in properly ass when i came back and saw the broken glass and the mess i felt ready to faint  no look heredeception is bad but not to be able to keep it up after one has been forced into it you know that since ive been squeezed out of the western ocean packets by younger men just on account of my grizzled muzzleyou know how much chance i had to ever get a ship and not a soul to turn to we have been a lonely couple we twoshe threw away everything for meand to see her want a piece of dry bread  he banged with his fist fit to split the frenchmans table in two  i would have turned a sanguinary pirate for her let alone cheating my way into a berth by dyeing my hair so when you came to me with your chemists wonderful stuff  he checked himself  by the way that fellows got a fortune when he likes to pick it up it is a wonderful stuffyou tell him salt water can do nothing to it it stays on as long as your hair will  all right i said go on  thereupon he went for johns again with a fury that frightened his wife and made me laugh till i cried  just you try to think what it would have meant to be at the mercy of the meanest creature that ever commanded a ship just fancy what a life that crawling johns would have led me and i knew that in a week or so the white hair would begin to show and the crew did you ever think of that to be shown up as a low fraud before all hands what a life for me till we got to calcutta and once therekicked out of course halfpay stopped annie here alone without a pennystarving and i on the other side of the earth ditto you see  i thought of shaving twice a day but could i shave my head too no wayno way at all unless i dropped johns overboard and even then  do you wonder now that with all these things boiling in my head i didnt know where i was putting down my foot that night i just felt myself fallingthen crash and all dark  when i came to myself that bang on the head seemed to have steadied my wits somehow i was so sick of everything that for two days i wouldnt speak to anyone they thought it was a slight concussion of the brain then the idea dawned upon me as i was looking at that ghostridden wretched fool ah you love ghosts i thought well you shall have something from beyond the grave  i didnt even trouble to invent a story i couldnt imagine a ghost if i wanted to i wasnt fit to lie connectedly if i had tried i just bulled him on to it do you know he got quite by himself a notion that at some time or other i had done somebody to death in some way and that  oh the horrible man cried mrs bunter from the sofa there was a silence  and didnt he bore my head off on the home passage began bunter again in a weary voice he loved me he was proud of me i was converted i had had a manifestation do you know what he was after he wanted me and him to make a seance in his own words and to try to call up that ghost the one that had turned my hair whitethe ghost of my supposed victim and as he said talk it over with himthe ghostin a friendly way  or else bunter he says you may get another manifestation when you least expect it and tumble overboard perhaps or something you aint really safe till we pacify the spiritworld in some way  can you conceive a lunatic like that nosay  i said nothing but mrs bunter did in a very decided tone  winston i dont want you to go on board that ship again any more  my dear says he i have all my things on board yet  you dont want the things dont go near that ship at all  he stood still then dropping his eyes with a faint smile said slowly in a dreamy voice  the haunted ship  and your last i added  we carried him off as he stood by the night train he was very quiet but crossing the channel as we two had a smoke on deck he turned to me suddenly and grinding his teeth whispered  hell never know how near he was being dropped overboard  he meant captain johns i said nothing  but captain johns i understand made a great todo about the disappearance of his chief mate he set the french police scouring the country for the body in the end i fancy he got word from his owners office to drop all this fussthat it was all right i dont suppose he ever understood anything of that mysterious occurrence  to this day he tries at times hes retired now and his conversation is not very coherenthe tries to tell the story of a black mate he once had a murderous gentlemanly ruffian with ravenblack hair which turned white all at once in consequence of a manifestation from beyond the grave an avenging apparition what with reference to black and white hair to poopladders and to his own feelings and views it is difficult to make head or tail of it if his sister shes very vigorous still should be present she cuts all this shortperemptorily  dont you mind what he says hes got devils on the brain  the end
