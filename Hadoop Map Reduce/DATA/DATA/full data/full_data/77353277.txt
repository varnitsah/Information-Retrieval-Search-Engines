77353277	shifting winds by rm ballantyne    as so often with ballantynes books there are really several tales all told in parallel in this book  there is the story of the seaman gaff and his son billy there is the story of mrs  gaff there is haco barepoles there is captain bingley and his son gildart there is the stuart family  all these characters are very well drawn and their lives merge together and move apart to a surprising degree  with a fundamentally christian message this book also depicts the work of the shipwrecked mariners and fishermen institution  although there are incidents at sea most of the action takes place in the small fishing village of wreckumoft and the town of athenbury  one of the great values of ballantynes books is the insight he gives into life in britain in the nineteenth century not just the daytoday lives of the actors but the motives that propel them and the upbringing that these actors had  we are however mystified by the title which made one think that the book might be something to do with ballooning  robert michael ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894  he was educated at the edinburgh academy and in 1841 he became a clerk with the hudson bay company working at the red river settlement in northen canada until 1847 arriving back in edinburgh in 1848  the letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters  three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade the young fur traders ungava the hudson bay company and were based on his experiences with the hbc  in this period he also wrote the coral island and martin rattler both of these taking place in places never visited by ballantyne  having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about  with these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers  he researched the cornish mines the london fire brigade the postal service the railways the laying down of submarine telegraph cables the construction of lighthouses the lightship service the life boat service south africa norway the north sea fishing fleet ballooning deepsea diving algiers and many more experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time and he lived as they lived  he was a very truetolife author depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail  his young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen sometimes four in a year all very good reading  the rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life but the quality never failed  he published over ninety books under his own name and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym comus  for todays taste his books are perhaps a little too religious and what we would nowadays call pi  in part that was the way people wrote in those days but more important was the fact that in his days at the red river settlement in the wilds of canada he had been a little dissolute and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave as he felt he had been  some of his books were quite short little over 100 pages  these books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents having less pocketmoney  these books are particularly wellwritten and researched because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money  they were published as six series three books in each series  recreated as an etext by nick hodson october 2003    shifting winds by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the cottage and its inmates  the family board was spread the family kettlean unusually fat one was singing on the fire and the family chimney was roaring like a lion by reason of the wind which blew a hurricane outside and shook the family mansion a small wooden hut to its foundations  the hour was midnight  this fact was indicated by the family clocka dutch one with a face which had once been white but was now become greenish yellow probably from horror at the profanity of the artist who had painted a basket of unrecognisable fruit above it an irate cockatoo below it and a blue church with a pink steeple as near to the centre of it as the hands would admit of  the family circle consisting of a stout goodlooking woman of thirty or thereabouts and a little boy and girl were of the fisher class obviously so to the senses of sight and smell  they sat by the fire  it was an unusual hour for supper but then it was an unusually wild night and the frequent glance cast by the woman at the dutch clock with the horrified countenance showed clearly that the board was not spread for the family meal but that they waited up for some absent one  i have said that the family circle sat by the fire but this is not strictly correct  one member of it the little boy stood in the middle of the room howlinghowling so violently that his fat face had changed from its wonted bright red to deep purple  looking at himas he stood there arrayed in his uncles red nightcap his own nightshirt which was also a dayshirt and much too small and his fathers peajacket which was preposterously too largeone could not avoid the alarming surmise that there might be such a thing as juvenile apoplexy and that that boy was on the point of becoming a living if not a dead example of the terrible disease  oh it was a sweet child a charming infant altogether a delightful creature to look upon that son of stephen gaff as it stood there yelling like a hyena stamping like a mad bull washing its dirty hands in tears on its dirtier cheeks cramming its little knuckles into its swollen eyes as if it sought to burst the organs of vision in their sockets and presenting generally an appearance of rampant rage and woe that baffles all capacity of conception and therefore defies all power of description  this cherubs name was billybilly gaff more familiarly known amongst his friends as the buster owing to his tendency to explode into tears or laughter or mischief or fun as the case might be  he was about eleven years of age  my own name reader is bingley  having retired on halfpay from the royal navy i reside in a pleasant cottage in the suburbs of the wellknown and important seaport town of wreckumoft situate on the east coast of england  my front windows command a magnificent view of the sea my back windows command an equally magnificent view of landscape i have a magnificent wife and she commands the household myself included  there was a timei reflect on it with melancholy pride and subdued satisfactionwhen i commanded a british seventyfour  i command nothing now but my temper  that however is a stronghold from which nothing terrestrial can drive me  my friends style me the captain but i am not the hero of this tale no by no means  i am altogether unheroic in my nature commonplace in my character  if a novelist were to describe me he would write me down a stout little old gentleman with a bald head and a mild countenance mentally weak in expression active in habits and addicted to pipes and loose clothing  do not imagine that this is my account of myself no it is an ideal resulting from the oftrepeated assurances of my wife who is a strongminded woman a few inches taller than myself somewhat rawboned and much more powerful physically though less rotund  in fact if i were to attempt a brief comprehensive description of her i would say without the most distant feeling of disrespect of course that she is square and skinnysingularly so  mrs bingleys contempt for my intellect is excelled i might almost say redeemed by her love for myself  how she manages to separate between myself and my intellect i have never been able to understand but then she is strongminded which perhaps accounts for her seeing farther into this millstone than i can  she tells me not unfrequently that i am weakminded  she even goes the length at times of calling me imbecile but she is a dear good affectionate woman and i have no sympathy with the insolent remark i once overheard made by an acquaintance of mine to the effect that it was a pity mrs bingley had not been born with a mans hat and trousers onno none whatever  before dismissing myself descriptively at least for being an honorary agent of the shipwrecked fishermen and mariners society and an actor in some of the scenes which i am about to describe i cannot conveniently dismiss myself altogether before dismissing myself i say it may be as well to explain that my strongminded wife in concert with a number of variouslyminded women all more or less strong and a good many weak and otherwise minded men have come to form their opinion of me in consequence of my holding rather strongly a few opinions of my ownto the effect that there are a good many wrong things in this world admittedly wrong things a good many muddles a good many glaring and outrageous abuses and shameful things the continuance of which reflects discredit on the nation and the wiping out or putting right of which ought by all means to be set about earnestly and at once  now curiously enough it is the idea conveyed in the last two wordsat oncewhich sticks in the throats of my strongminded opponents  they agree with me as to the existence of the evils they honestly deplore them but they charge me with mental imbecility when i suggest that things should be put right at once  they counsel delay and when the dispute reaches a certain stage they smile at me with contempt or pity or they storm according to individual temperament and usually wind up with a rasping reiteration of their original opinions highly peppered and salted and an assurance that i have been born at least a century before my time  if the men of the next century are destined to do good as their hands find opportunity without previous delay until thousands of opportunities are lost and gone for ever if those who put their hands to a piece of work shall carry it out with vigour in their own lifetime if those who counsel delay shall mean due time for full consideration by themselves and shall not mean an extended procrastination which shall free themselves from worry and leave their work to be handed down as a legacy to their children who shall likewise hand it down to their children and so on ad infinitum until delay shall become a synonym for death and destruction to tens of thousands of better men than themselvesif this shall be the sentiment and practice of the men of next century then i confess that my sympathies are with them and i really suspect that i must have got into the wrong century by mistake  but as the position is irremediable now i suppose i must in an imbecile sort of fashion go on my way rejoicingif i can sorrowing if i cannot rejoice  mrs bingley having more than once threatened to scratch my face when i have ventured to express the last sentiment it may be perhaps as well to change the subject and return to billy gaff the charming child alias the buster  billy deserves to be somewhat particularly introduced because besides being an actor in this tale he was a boy of strong character  if i were to sum him up and reduce the total to a concentrated essence the result would be a sentence to the following effectbilly gaff had a will of his own  perhaps i should say a very strong will of his own for instance he on several different occasions willed to screw off the spout of the family teapot a pewter one and having willed to do it he did it  again he willed more than once to smash a pane of glass in the solitary window of the family mansion and he did smash a pane of glass in that window nay more in consequence of being heartily whacked for the deed he immediately willed to smash and smashed a second pane and was proceeding to will and smash a third when he was caught up by his mother beaten almost into the condition of a mummy and thrust under the clothes of the family bed which immediately creaked as if with convulsions and tossed its blankets about in apparent agony  on the present occasion the buster had awakened out of a sound sleep to the conviction that he was hungry  observing the loaf on the table he immediately willed to have a second supper and arising donned his fathers peajacket in order to enjoy the meal more thoroughly  it was the sudden removal of the said loaf by his mother to an unreachable shelf that induced the youthful billy to stand in the middle of the room and howl as already described  he was still engaged in emulating the storm and mrs gaff utterly indifferent to him had cast another glance at the horrified clock and remarked to her little girl tottie that uncle john must have found work on the shore for he was long of coming when a heavy tread was heard in the little porch outside the door  hold yer noise said mrs gaff sternly  billy obeyed not by any means in consequence of the command but because he was curious to know who was about to enter and meant to resume yelling immediately after his curiosity on this point should be satisfied  the door opened and a strongbuilt seaman stepped into the room and looked at the family with a quiet smile on his sunburnt face  his hair and garments were dripping with water as if he had just walked out of the sea  on beholding him the family rose and stood for a moment speechless billy sat down on the floor in that prompt manner which is peculiar to young children when they lose their balance simultaneously with the shock of being seated the word faither burst from his lips  mrs gaff uttered a suppressed cry and ran into the wet mans arms  tottie and the buster each ran at a leg and hugging it violently squeezed a cataract of salt water into their respective bosoms  stephen lad ist you said the wife raising her head for a moment and looking up in the mans face  ay dear lass wrecked again but safe home thank god  mrs gaff was not wont to give way to the melting mood but she could not restrain a few tears of joy  tottie observing this cried from sympathy and the buster not to be outdone willed began and carried into execution a series of true british cheers that could not have been surpassed perhaps could not have been equalled by any boy of his age in or out of the royal navy    chapter two  wrecked rescued and resuscitatedmrs niven receives a surprise also the gift of a child  on the same dark tempestuous night of which i write a little ship was wrecked on the east coast of england  she had sailed from the antipodes had weathered many a gale had crossed the great ocean in safety had sighted the lights and the cliffs of home and was dashed to pieces at last on the rocks within two hours sail of the port to which she was bound  hundreds of ships great and small were wrecked on the coasts of britain during that memorable gale  the little ship to which i refer was one of the many in regard to which the newspapers said she was dashed to pieces and all hands perished  but in this particular case all hands had not perished two lives had been spared unknown to journalists and coastguardsmen  it was the dead of night when the vessel struck  the spot was lonely at least a mile distant from human habitations  no anxious eyes on shore saw her quiver as each successive billow lifted her up and hurled her cruelly down no sorrowing ear heard the shriek of despair that rose above the yelling storm when in little more than ten minutes the vessel broke up and left the crew and passengers to perish within sight of their native land  there was one man among the number who did not shriek who did not despair  he was not a hero of romance whose soul raised him above the fear of sudden deathno he was only a truehearted british tar whose frame was very strong whose nerves were tightly strung and used to danger  he had made up his mind to save his life if he could if he should failwhat then  he never thought of what then because in regard to terrestrial matters he had not been accustomed to cast his thoughts so far in advance of present exigencies  just before the ship broke up this man was standing on the lee bulwark holding by the shrouds of the mainmast the lower part of which was still standing  a lady and gentleman clung to each other and to the rigging close beside him  they were husband and wife  both were comparatively young and up to that night had been full of hope and high spirits  the husband with his right arm encircled his wife and grasped the rigging with his left he pressed their little girl to his breast over which flowed the fair hair of the little one drenched and dishevelled  the father was a brave man and strong but his face was very pale for he felt that courage and strength could not avail to save both wife and child in such a raging sea  an occasional upward glance of his eye seemed to indicate that he sought comfort from god in his extremity  youll never manage em both sir let me have the child said the strong seaman suddenly grasping the little girl and attempting to unlock her arms which were tightly clasped round her fathers neck  the father hesitated but a terrific wave was rushing towards the doomed ship  without even the comfort of a hurried kiss he resigned the child the young mother stretched out her arms towards her uttering a piteous cry  at that moment the ship rose on the billows crest as if it were no heavier than a flake of the driving foama crash followedit was gone and the crew were left struggling in the sea  the struggle was short with most of them  previous exposure and anxiety had already quite exhausted all but the strongest among the men and even these were unable to withstand the influence of the icecold water more than a few seconds  some were struck by portions of the wreck and killed at once  others sank without an effort to save themselves  a few swam with unnatural vigour for a yard or two and then went down with a gurgling cry but in a very few minutes the work of death was complete  all were gone except the strong seaman who clasped the little child in his left arm and buffeted the billows with his right  once and again were they overwhelmed but as often did they rise above the foam to continue the battle  it was a terrible fight  a piece of wreck struck the man on his back and wellnigh broke it then a wave arched high above them fell with a crash and drove them nearly to the bottom so that the child was rendered insensible and the strong man was nearly choked before he rose again to the surface to gasp the precious air  at last a wave broke behind them caught them on its crest and hurled them on a beach of sand  to cling to this while the water retired was the fiercest part of the conflictthe turningpoint in the battle  the wave swept back and left the man on his hands and knees  he rose and staggered forward a few paces ere the next wave rushed upon him compelling him to fall again on hands and knees and drive his bleeding fingers deep down into the shingle  when the water once more retired he rose and stumbled on till he reached a point above highwater mark where he fell down in a state of utter exhaustion but still clasping the little one tightly to his breast  for some time he lay there in a state of halfconsciousness until his strength began to revive then he arose thanking god in an audible voice as he did so and carried the child to a spot which was sheltered in some degree by a mass of cliff from the blinding spray and furious gale  here he laid her with her face downwards on a grassy place and proceeded to warm his benumbed frame  vitality was strong in the sailor  it needed only a few seconds working of the human machine to call it into full play  he squeezed the water out of his jacket and trousers and then slapped his arms across his chest with extreme violence stamping his feet the while so that he was speedily in a sufficiently restored condition to devote his attention with effect to the child which still lay motionless on the grass  he wrung the water out of her clothes and chafed her feet hands and limbs rapidly yet tenderly but without success  his anxiety while thus employed was very great for he did not know the proper method to adopt in the circumstances and he felt that if the child did not revive within a few minutes all chance of her recovery would be gone  the energy of his action and the anxiety of his mind had warmed his own frame into a glow  it suddenly occurred to him that he might make use of this superabundant heat  opening the little frock in front he placed the childs breast against his own and held it there while with his right hand he continued to chafe her limbs  in a few minutes he felt a flutter of the heart then a gentle sigh escaped from the blue lips the eyelids quivered and finally the child revived  dye feel gettin better emmie said the man in a low soft voice  a faint yes was all the reply  the seaman continued his efforts to instil warmth into the little frame presently the same question was repeated and the child looking up said  is that oo gaff  ay dear tis me  where am iwheres mamma inquired emmie looking round in some degree of alarm  hush dear dont speak just now  ive just brought ee ashore fro the wreck an am goin to tak ee home  try to sleep dear  gaff wrapped his jacket round the child and hurried away in search of the highroad  he knew the place well  he had been wrecked on a reef within two miles of his native hamlet and within three of the town of wreckumoft  he soon found the road and broke from a fast walk into a run  the child lay quietly in his arms either being too much exhausted to speak or having fallen asleep  the man muttered to himself as if in perplexity  itll never do to tak er home wi me  shed remember us and that would let the secret out  no ill tak er straight there  gaff reached his native village as he came to this resolve  it was all astir  three ships had been cast on the rocks there within a hundred yards of each other  the lifeboat was out the rocket apparatus had that moment arrived from the neighbouring town and was being dragged on its waggon through the village to the scene of danger  all the men and many of the women and children of the place were on the beach while eager groups of those who could not face the storm were collected in doorways and sheltered places awaiting news from the shore  many of these had anxious faces for they knew their kinsmen the fishermen of the place to be bold daring fellows who would not hesitate to risk life and limb to save a fellowcreature from death  stopping a moment at the outskirts of the village gaff laid down his burden and tied a large blue cotton kerchief round his neck so as to cover his mouth and chin  by pulling his souwester cap well over his eyes he concealed his face so effectually that little more than the point of his nose was visible  not satisfied however with his disguise he climbed a fence and struck into a bypath which enabled him to avoid the village altogether  setting off at a quick pace he soon regained the highroad beyond the village and did not pause until he came to a large iron gate which opened into the shrubbery in front of a handsome villa  he went straight up to the front door and rang the bell  of course at such an hour the family had retired to rest and it is probable that in ordinary circumstances gaff would have had to wait a considerable time before an answer should have been given to his summons  but on this night the only son and heir of the family kenneth by name knowing that wrecks were likely to occur on the coast and being of a bold romantic restless disposition had mounted his horse and ridden away accompanied by his groom in search of adventure  the housekeeper of the family usually styled mrs niven being devotedly attached to this son and heir had resolved to sit up all night and await his return  mrs niven had prophesied confidently for the previous ten years that master kenneth was certain to be drownded sooner or later if e didnt come to die before and being fully persuaded of the truth of her prophetic powers she conscientiously waited for and expected the fulfilment of her own prophecy  at the moment when gaff rang the bell she was awaiting it in a chair in front of a good fire with her feet on the fender and sound asleep  it would be more correct to say that mrs niven was in a state of mixed sleep and suffocation for her head hung over the back of the chair and being very stout there was only just sufficient opening in the windpipe to permit of her breath passing stertorously through her wideopen mouth  the first summons passed unheard the second caused mrs niven to open her eyes and shut her mouth but she could not rise by reason of a crick in her neck  an angry shout however of why dont you answer the bell from the master of the family caused her to make a violent struggle plunge her head into her lap by way of counteracting the crick rush upstairs and fling open the door  i knowd it exclaimed mrs niven wildly on beholding a wet sailor with a bundle in his arms i always said he would begoodness me its only his trunk she added in horror on observing that the bundle was a rough jacket without head or legs  clap a stopper on your jaw woman said gaff impatiently  is this seaside villamr stuarts  it is replied mrs niven trembling violently  gaff quickly removed the jacket kissed the childs pale cheek and laid her in mrs nivens ready arms  she aint dead surely sir inquired the housekeeper  no bin saved from a wreck an half drownded  shell come to in a bittak care of er  gaff turned on his heel as he hastily uttered these words ran down the garden walk and disappeared leaving mrs niven standing at the open door in a state of speechless amazement with the unconscious emmie in her arms and pressed by reason of an irresistible impulse of motherly sympathy to her bosom    chapter three  the cottage at cove invadeddan horsey speaks toorko to russians and fails to enlighten them  retracing his steps hastily to the village of cove stephen gaff sought out his own humble cottage which during his absence on his frequent voyages was left under the charge of his fisherman brotherinlaw john furby  presenting himself at the door he created the family sensation which has been described at the end of the first chapter  the first violent demonstrations of surprise and joy over mrs gaff dragged her husband into a small closet which was regarded by the household in the light of a spare room and there compelled him to change his garments  while this change was being made the volatile buster indignant at being bolted out kicked the door with his heel until he became convinced that no good or evil could result from the process  then his active mind reverted to the forbidden loaf and he forthwith drew a chair below the shelf on which it lay  upon the chair he placed a threelegged stool and upon the stool an eightinch block which latter being an unstable foundation caused billy to lose his balance when he got upon it  the erection instantly gave way and fell with a hideous crash  tottie who stood near gazing at her brothers misdeeds as was her wont in awestricken admiration was overwhelmed in the debris  nothing daunted the buster returned to the charge and fell a second timewith the loaf however in his arms  hah exclaimed mrs gaff issuing from the spare room and rushing at her offspring with uplifted hand  stop lass said stephen arresting her and catching up the boy whom he placed on his knee as he sat down in a chair beside the fire  how are ee billy my lad  billy glaring defiance at his mother who returned the glare with interest in the shape of a united shake of the fist and head replied that he was fussrate  tottie having immediately claimed and been put in possession of the other knee divided her fathers attention and while the goodwife busied herself in preparing the supper which had been originally intended for uncle john a quick fire of question and reply of the most varied and unconnected sort was kept up by the trio at the fire in tones and accompanied by hugs and gestures which proved beyond all doubt that stephen gaff was a father of the right kind and that the little ones hailed him as an inestimable addition to their household joys  it would be unjust to mrs gaff were i to permit the reader to suppose that she was a disagreeable contrast to the father  she was truehearted and loving but she had been born and bred in the midst of a class of people whose manners are as rough as their calling and was by no means tender or considerate  a terrific scream or a knockdown slap from mrs gaff was regarded both by giver and recipient in much the same light as is a mild reproof in more polite society  wrecked again stephen said mrs gaff pausing in her occupation and recurring to the remark made by her husband when he first entered the room where have ee bin wrecked this time  amost at the door lass on the black rock  ay an was all the rest saved inquired the wife  no none of em  a lost save one a little child  a child lad exclaimed the wife in surprise what have ee done wi it  took it to its friends  as he said this the sailor gave his wife a look which induced her to refrain from further questioning on that subject  an who saved ye stephen  god saved me replied the man earnestly  true lad but was there none o the boys there to lend a hand  no none  it puzzled me a bit said stephen for the lads are wont to be on the lookout on a night like this  it neednt puzzle ye then replied the wife as she set a chair for her husband at the table and poured out a cup of tea for theres bin two sloops an a schooner on the rocks off the pierhead for three hours past an a the lads are out at themuncle john among the rest theyve made him coxswain o the new lifeboat since ye last went to sea  stephen set down the cup which he had just raised to his lips untasted and rose hastily  wrecks at the pierhead lass he exclaimed and you let me sit here idle  dont go stephen entreated mrs gaff youre not fit to do anything after sitch a night an its oer late  the man paid no attention to the remonstrance but buttoned up his coat and seized his cap  mrs gaff promptly locked the door with an air of thorough determination put the key in her bosom and crossed her arms thereon tightly  stephen smiled slightly as he turned raised the window and leaped through it into the road followed by a vociferous cheer from billy whose spirit was wildly stirred by the boldness and success of the movement and mightily rejoiced at the discomfiture of his mother  mrs gaff relieved her feelings by slapping the busters face and was about to close the window when her husband quietly stepped through it again saying  open the door lass youve no need to fear ill remain now  there was a trampling of many feet outside  the door had scarcely been unlocked when they were in the passage  next moment four fishermen entered bearing the figure of a man in their arms  he ant drownded lass only swownded said one of the men to mrs gaff with the view of relieving the good womans anxiety as they laid a seaman on the bed  look alive now old girl an git hot blankets an bottles  while mrs gaff obeyed in silent haste the room was filled with men some of whom supported or halfcarried others whose drooping heads torn garments and haggard faces showed that they had just been rescued from the angry sea  none of them were more than partially clothed some were nearly naked  with excited haste the fishermen crowded the wrecked men round the fire and spread blankets and sails or whatever came first to hand on the floor for those who were most exhausted to lie down upon while stephen gaff poured hot tea and hot grog indiscriminately into cups saucers pannikins and soupplates and urged them to drink with rough but kindly hospitality  the wrecked men there were twelve of them were russians and as a matter of course could not understand a word that was said to them although some of the fishermen asked them with as much earnestness as if their lives depended on the answer whotheywosanwhar theycomdfro  receiving for reply a stare and a shake of the head from such of the men as were able to attend one of the fishermen tried them again with great precision and slowness of speech and with much solemnity of manner whatparto the arthdye hail frolads  no answer accompanied by a stare and a shake  oh its o no use cried one let the poor lads abe  hallo  dan cried another as a man forced his way through the crowded room towards the fire youve bin in toorkey i believe i say try them fellers wi a screed o toorko  praps theyll make that out  the individual addressed was very different from the men amongst whom he stood  he was a thin slightlymade yet strong and active young man in a very short grey coat a very long striped vest and very tight corduroy trousersa sort of compound of footman and jockey  in truth daniel horsey was both being at once valet and groom to the romantic kenneth whose fate it was according to the infallible mrs niven to be drownded  dans first inquiry was as to whether any one had seen his master and the tones in which the question was put betokened him beyond all doubt a son of the green isle  being told that no one had seen his master he was about to leave the hut in quest of him when he was collared by several stout men and placed forcibly in front of a russian with a huge red beard who appeared to be the least exhausted of the party  come now dan say somethin to

and assurance and the fishermen regarded him with deepening respect as they awaited the russians answer  he replied by a stare and a shake of the head as before  hookum daddy resumed dan stooping to gaze earnestly into the mans face and placing the thumb of his right hand into the palm of his left by way of emphasising his remark hookum daddy saringo spollijaker tooraloo be japers bang falairooch he added turning away with a look of disgust he dont understand a word  i would try him wi frinch but its clear as ditch wather that hes half drownded still  convinced that dan horseys toorko was of no use the fishermen at length allowed him to retire    chapter four  the rescue  while this scene was enacting in the cottage i was hasting up from the beach where the lifeboat men had rendered good service that night  as the honorary agent for the shipwrecked mariners society i had been summoned by a special messenger as soon as it was known that vessels were on the rocks off the entrance to our harbour  i was accompanied by my niece lizzie gordon who always joined me on such occasions carrying with her a basket in which were a flask of brandy another of port wine a bottle of smelling salts and several small articles which she fancied might be of use in cases of emergency  we had called at the sailors home in passing to see that they were astir there and ready to receive shipwrecked people  we afterwards remained on the beach under the lee of a boathouse while the lifeboat men saved the crews of the wrecked vessels  the work was nobly done  john furby the coxswain with a sturdy crew of volunteerstwelve in allwere ready for action with cork lifebelts and oilskin coats on when the team of four stout horses came tearing along the sands dragging the lifeboat after them assisted and cheered on by a large crowd of men and boys  no unnecessary delay occurred  opposite the first wreck the carriage was wheeled round so that the bow of the boat pointed to the sea  the crew sprang into their seats and shipping the oars sat ready and resolute  immense breakers thundered on the beach and rushed inland in fields of gurgling foam that looked like phosphoric light in the darkness  into this the carriage was thrust as far as it could be with safety by many strong and willing hands  then the men in the surf seized the launching lines by means of which the boat could be propelled off its carriage a peculiar adaptation of the mechanism enabled them by pulling backward to force the boat forward  for a moment they stood inactive as a towering wave rolled in like a great black scroll coming out of the blacker background where the sound of the raging storm could be heard but where nothing could be seen save the pale red light which proved that the wreck still held together  the sea flew up almost overwhelming the carriage  john furby standing at his post by the steering oar with the light of the small boatlamp shining up into his rugged face gave the word in a clear strong voice  hurrah shouted the men on shore as they ran up the beach with the ends of the launching ropes  the boat sprang into the surf the crew bent to their oars with all their might and kept pace with the rush of the retreating billow while the sea drew them out as if it were hungry to swallow them  the lifeboat met the next breaker endon the men pulling vigorously cleft it and passing beyond gained the deep water and disappeared from view  the minutes that followed appeared like hours but our patience was not long tried  the boat soon reappeared coming in on the crest of a towering wave with six saved seamen in her  as she struck the beach she was seized by the crowd on shore and dragged out of danger by main force  thus far all was well  but there was stern work still to be done having ascertained that the vessel was a collier and that none of her crew were lost i sent the six men with an escort to the sailors home and followed the lifeboat which was already on its way to the second wreck not more than five hundred yards from the first  here they were equally successful three men and a boy being rescued from the vessel which also proved to be a small collier  then the boat was conveyed to the third wreck which turned out to be a brig and was nearly a mile removed from the harbour just opposite the fishing village of cove  the crew of the lifeboat being now much exhausted were obliged to give up their oars and lifebelts to fresh men who volunteered for the service in scores  nothing however would persuade john furby to resign his position although he was nearly worn out with fatigue and exposure  once more the lifeboat dashed into the sea and once again returned with a crew of rescued men who were immediately led up to the nearest hut which chanced to be that of stephen gaff  one of the saved men being insensible was carried up and laid in stephens bed as i have already described  there was still some uncertainty as to whether all those on board the wreck had been rescued so the boat put off again but soon returned having found no one  as she struck the shore a larger wave than usual overwhelmed her and washed the coxswain overboard  a loud cry burst from those who witnessed this and one or two daring fellows running into the surf up to their waists nearly perished in their brave but vain efforts to grasp the drowning man  furby did not struggle  he had been rendered insensible by the shock and although several ropes were thrown to him and one actually fell over him he could make no effort to save himself as the waves rolled him inshore and sucked him back again  at this moment the sound of horses hoofs was heard on the sands and my young friend kenneth stuart dashed past us at full gallop into the sea  kenneth was a splendid and a fearless rider  he kept the finest horses in the neighbourhood  on this occasion he was mounted on a large strong chestnut which he had trained to gallop into a foaming surf  checking his pace suddenly when about kneedeep in the foam he took up such a position that the next billow would wash the drowning man within his reach  the wave came on  when about a hundred yards from the spot where the young horseman stood it fell with a prolonged roar and the foam came sweeping in like a white wall with the dark form of furby tossing in the midst  the sea rushed furiously upon horse and rider and the terrified horse rearing almost perpendicular wheeled round towards the land  at the same instant the coxswain was hurled against them kenneth seized the mane of his steed with one hand and grasping furby with the other held on  the noble charger swept irresistibly landward made frantic efforts to regain his footing and partially succeeded before the full force of the retreating water bore back upon him  for one moment he stood quivering with the strength of his effort kenneth was very strong else he had never maintained his grasp on the collar of the coxswain  a moment more and the horse made a plunge forward then a dozen hands caught him by bridle and saddlegirth and almost dragged the trio out of the sea while a loud cheer greeted their deliverance  i ordered four stout men to carry the coxswain to gaffs cottage remaining behind for a few minutes in order to congratulate my young friend on his escape and success as well as to see that no other wrecks had occurred in the neighbourhood  having satisfied myself as best i could on this latter point i was about to proceed to the cottage when kenneth came forward leading his good horse by the bridle and offered his disengaged arm to my niece  lizzie thanked him and declined observing that after his gallant and successful rescue of furby he must himself stand in need of assistance or something to that effect  i cannot say what his reply was but i observed that she immediately afterwards took the proffered arm and we all walked up to the hut together  on reaching it we met kenneths groom coming out he having failed as has been shown to make any impression on the russians with his turkish  i found the place completely filled with men and women the latter being in a state of great excitement  heres the agent make way lads here comes capn bingley several voices exclaimed as i entered  going to the bed and seeing how matters stood with poor furby who had been placed on his back i ordered the people to leave the hut and had the halfdrowned man turned instantly on his face  the other halfdrowned man having recovered was lying on a blanket before the fire  clear the room lads said i firmly the man wants fresh air open the window and take these wrecked men up to the home in town everything is prepared for them there hot coffee and beds and a hearty welcome  away with you now carry those who cant walk  with the assistance of kenneth and his man the hut was soon cleared only a few being allowed to remain to aid me in my efforts to recover the coxswain  you see said i as i rolled furby gently and continuously from his face to his side in order to produce what i may term artificial breathing it is not good to lay a halfdrowned man on his back because his tongue will fall into his throat and prevent the very thing we want to bring about namely respiration  go to the foot of the bed kenneth put your hands under the blankets and chafe his legs with hot flannel  hold the smelling salts to his nose lizzie  thats it now mrs gaff put more hot bottles about him see he begins to breathe already  as i spoke the mysterious vital spark in the man began to revive and ere long the quivering eyelids and short fitful gasps indicated that uncle john as the coxswain of the lifeboat was styled by the household had recovered  we gave him a teaspoonful or two of hot coffee when he was able to swallow and then prepared to take our leave  i observed while i was busy with furby that my niece took mrs gaff aside and appeared to be talking to her very earnestly  lizzie was a lovely girl  she was tall and slightly formed with rich brown hair and a dark clear complexion that might have been almost styled spanish but for the roses which bloomed on her cheeks  i could not help admiring the strong contrast between her and the fair face and portly figure of worthy mrs gaff who listened to what she said with an air of deep respect  little tottie had taken lizzies hand in both of hers and was looking up in her face and the boy billy was gazing at her with openmouthed admiration  i observed too that kenneth stuart was gazing at her with such rapt attention that i had to address him several times before he heard me  this i was not surprised at for i remember to this day the feelings of pleasure with which i beheld my pretty niece when having lost her father and mother poor dear she came to find a home under my roof and it was natural she should inspire admiration in a young man like kenneth  my family and the stuarts had become acquainted only a few weeks before the events of which i am now writing and this was the first time that the young people had met  they were not altogether unknown to each other however for lizzie had heard of kenneth from the fishermen who used to speak with interest of his horsemanship and his daring feats in rescuing drowning people from the sea during the storms that so frequently visited our coast and kenneth had heard of lizzie also from the fishermen amongst whom she was a frequent visitor especially when sickness entered their cots or when the storm made their wives widows and their little ones fatherless  i had set my heart on seeing these two married  my dear wife for the first time in her life i believe thoroughly agreed with me in this wish  i mention the fact with unalloyed pleasure as being what i may term a sunny memory a bright spot in a life of subdued though true happiness  we neither of us suspected at that time what bitter opposition to our wishes we were to receive from kenneths father who although in many respects a good man was very sternunpleasantly stern  having done all that could be done for the wrecked people lizzie and i returned to our residence in wreckumoft at about four in the morning  kenneth insisted on walking with us sending his man home with his horse which lizzie patted on the neck and called a noble creature  it was quite evident that kenneth wished that he himself was his own horse on that occasionso evident that lizzie blushed and taking my arm hurriedly urged me to go home as it was very late  very early would be more correct my dear said i for it is past four  you must be tired lizzie it is wrong in me to allow you to subject yourself to such storms  give her your arm kenneth  if miss gordon will accept of it said the youth approaching her promptly i shall be  no thank you said lizzie interrupting him and clinging closer to me i am not in the least tired and your assistance is quite sufficient uncle  i must confess to being surprised at this for it was quite evident to me that kenneth admired lizzie and i was pretty certainso was my dear wifethat lizzie admired kenneth although of course she never gave us the slightest hint to that effect and it seemed to me such a good and reasonable opportunity forwell well i need not bore you reader with my wild ideas so peculiarly adapted it would seem for the twentieth centurysuffice it to say that i was surprised  but if truth must be told i have always lived in a state of surprise in regard to the thoughts and actions of women and on this particular night i was doomed to the unpleasant surprise of being received with a sharp rebuke from mrs bingley who roundly asserted that she would stand this sort of thing no longer  that she had no notion of being disturbed at such unearthly hours by the noisy advent of a disagreeably damp and cold husband and that if i intended to continue to be an agent of the shipwrecked mariners society she would insist upon a separate maintenance  i was comforted however by finding a good fire and a hot cup of coffee in the parlour for myself and lizzie provided by our invaluable housekeeper susan barepoles a girl who was worthy of a better name being an active goodlooking cheerful lass  she was the daughter of the skipper of one of our coal sloops named haco barepoles a man of excellent disposition but gifted with such a superabundance of animal spirits courage and recklessness that he was known in the port of wreckumoft as mad haco  much exhausted by one of the hardest nights of toil and exposure i ever spent i retired to my room and sought and found repose    chapter five  the breakfast party at seaside villa  the morning after the storm was bright and beautiful  the breakers indeed were still thundering on the shore but otherwise the sea was calm and the sun shone into the breakfast parlour of seaside villa with a degree of intensity that might have warmed the heart of an oyster  it certainly warmed the heart of the household cat which being an early riser was first downstairs and lay at full length on the rug enjoying at once the heat of the glowing fire which tinged its brown back with red and the blazing sun which turned its white breast yellow  presently a dark cloud entered the room  it sat on the brow of george stuart esquire of wreckumoft the head of the family  mr stuart walked up to the fire and turned his back to it as if to offer it a deliberate insult while yet he accepted all the benefit it could afford him on that cold december morning  the cat being in his way he moved it out of his way with his foot  he did it roughly but he did not exactly kick it for he was not a cruel or naturally unkind man  having disposed of the cat and looked twice at his watch and blown his nose three timesthe last twice unnecessarilymr stuart rang the bell with violence  mrs niven entered  why is breakfast not ready said the master with asperity  breakfast is ready sir replied the housekeeper with dignity  where is my sister then and the rest of them  the questioner was partly answered by the abrupt and somewhat flurried entrance of the sister referred to  whats the meaning of this peppy demanded mr stuart with a frown  my dear george said miss peppy bustling about actively i really am sorry but you know things cant always be just as one would wish and then when things do turn out occasionally as one would not wish and as one had no expectation of and so to speak without consulting one at all dear me where is that keyand when one cant help things turning out so you know its really too much totoyou know what i mean brother come now be reasonable  i do not know what you mean peppy the ladys name when unabbreviated was penelope but as she never was so named by any one she might as well not have had the name at all and continued mr stuart emphatically i would advise you to be reasonable and explain yourself  dear george how can you said miss peppy who talked with great volubility and who never for a moment ceased to bustle about the room in a series of indescribable as well as unaccountable not to say unnecessary preparations for the morning meal which had already been prepared to perfection by mrs niven you surely dont forgetthings do happen so surprisingly at timesreally you know i can not see why we should be subjected to such surprises  im quite sure that no good comes of it and then it makes one look so foolish  why human beings were made to be surprised so i never could understand  no one ever sees pigs or horses or cows surprised and they seem to get through life a great deal easier than we do at all events they have less worry and they never leave their children at their neighbours doors and run awaywhat can have got itim quite sure i put it there last night with the thimble and scissors  miss peppy thrust her right hand deep into that mysterious receptacle of household miscellanies her pocket and fingered the contents inquiringly for a few moments  what are you looking for inquired her brother impatiently  the key of the press said miss peppy with a look of weariness and disappointment  what key is that in your left hand said mr stuart  why i declare thats it exclaimed his sister with a laugh there is no accounting for things  my whole life is a series of small surprises and perplexities  i wonder what i was born for  it seems to me so ridiculous that so serious a thing as life should be taken up with such little trifles  whats that you say about trifles aunt asked kenneth who entered the room at the moment and saluted miss peppy on the cheek  nothing kennie nothing worth mentioning she seated herself at the table and began to pour out the tea it seems that you have been saving more lives last night  well yes at least i saved one said kenneth with a look of mingled pride and pleasure stout john furby the coxswain of the new lifeboat was knocked overboard and nearly drowned  bucephalus and i chanced to be near the spot at the time so we managed to pull him out between us  i dont like bucephalus observed miss peppy stirring her tea with her eggspoon by mistake  dont you auntwhy  because hes so big and strong and fierce  i wonder you can take pleasure in riding such a great carthorse kennie  miss peppy at this moment discovered her mistake in regard to the eggspoon and rectified it observing with a look of resignation that there was no accounting for the way in which things happened in this world  dont call my bucephalus a carthorse aunt said kenneth beginning to eat languidly true he is uncommonly big and strong but then i am unusually big too so were well matched and then his limbs are as delicately turned as those of a racer and you should see him taking a fivebarred gate aunthe carries me over as if i were a mere feather think of his swimming powers too  john furby is not the first man he has enabled me to drag out of the stormy sea  ah hes a noble horse worthy of higher praise than you seem inclined to give him believe me  well im sure i have no objection to the horse if you have none kennie and its a good thing for a beast to be able to save human lives though why human lives should require to be saved at all is a mystery that i never could fathom surely if men would only agree to give up going to sea altogether and never build any more ships there would be no more drowning and no need of lifeboats and cork bootsor coats i forget whichthat enable them to walk on the water or float in it i dont remember which  im sure with all that i have to remember its no wonderwhat with ridiculous little trifles to worry one such as keys and thimbles and scissors when we should be giving our minds to the solemn realities of lifeand thenas if that were not enough for any womans shouldersto have a little child left at ones door  oh by the way interrupted kenneth i had quite forgotten the child mrs niven told me about it and i looked into the crib as i went up to bed last night or rather this morning and saw that it was sleeping somewhat restlessly i fancied  who brought it here  mr stuart who had hitherto eaten his breakfast in silence looked at his sister as if the reply would interest him  before the answer could be given the door opened and a smart handsome youth of apparently eighteen years of age entered  his dress bespoke him a midshipman in the navy and the hearty familiarity of his manner showed that he was on intimate terms with the family  gildart my boy how are you cried kenneth springing up and shaking the youth warmly by both hands  hearty old fellow and happy to see my ancient chum  how dye do miss penelope  how are ye mr stuart  my son gildart had been kenneths favourite companion when they were boys at school  they had not met for many years  sit down said kenneth pressing his friend into a chair when did you arrive where did you come from what brought you homeyour appearance is so unexpectedhope youve come to stay with us  had breakfast  well now such a string of em to answer all at once replied gildart bingley laughing  suppose i try to reply in the same ordercame this morning direct from china where weve been sinking junks and peppering pirates got leave of absence for a few weeks to run down here and see the old folks at home whether i stay with you will depend on the treatment i receive i have had breakfast and came down here supposing that yours would have been overbut im capable of a second meal at any time have tried a third occasionally with reasonable success  now kennieim not afraid to call you by the old name you see although you have grown so big and manly not to say fiercehaving answered your questions will you be so good as to tell me if its all true that i hear of your having saved the life of a fisherman last night  it is true that i pulled him out of the sea aided and abetted by bucephalus but whether all that you have heard of me is true i cannot tell not knowing what you have heard  who told you of it  who why the household of the bingleys to be sureall speaking at once and each louder than the other with the exception of my pretty coz by the way who did not speak at all until the others were out of breath and then she gave me such a graphic account of the affair that i would certainly have forgotten where i was and been transported to the scene of action had not her pretty flushed face and blazing black eyes riveted me to the spot where i sat  i actually gave vent to an irresistible cheer when she concluded  dye know kennie you seem to have made an impression in that quarter  i wish i were you  the little midshipman sighed and helped himself to a second slice of buttered toast  kenneth laughed lightly glanced askance at his father and requested another cup of tea  mr stuart glanced at his son frowned at his finished egg and stuck the spoon through the bottom of the shell as he would have struck a dagger into the hopes of kenneth had he possessed the power  peppy he said pushing his cup from him before our young friend arrived you were speaking of the little boy who was left mysteriously here last night  its a girl interrupted miss peppy not but that it might have been a boy brother if it had been born so but one cannot ignore facts and to the best of my belief it was a girl last night  to be sure i was very sleepy when i saw it but it may be a boy this morning for all i know to the contrary  im sure the perplexities that do surround us in this world  here miss peppy sighed but if there is any doubt on the question we had better ring for mrs niven and send her upstairs to ascertain  at that moment mrs niven entered and handed a letter to mr stuart  niven said miss peppy who spoke so fast all in one tone that no one had a chance of interrupting herniven will you be so good as to go upstairs and inquire whether the girlno the boyii mean the young human being that  la maam exclaimed the housekeeper in surprise why do you call her a boy  shes as sweet and lovely a girl as ever my two heyes looked on i never saw nothink like er golden airits quite eavenly maam if i may use the hexpression  oh she is a girl then ah  i thought so said miss peppy with a sigh of resignation as if the fact were a perplexity too deep for investigation at least at that time  it matters nothing to me said mr stuart sternly whether she be a boy or a girl i mean to send her to the workhouse  workhouse brother exclaimed miss peppy in surprise  workhouse sir echoed mrs niven in horror  father said kenneth remonstratively  mrs niven said mr stuart breaking the seal of the letter very slowly you may leave the room  sister i do not choose to have my intentions commented on in such a manner especially before the domestics  this child i have nothing whatever to do with it has no claim on me and i shall certainly hand it over to the parochial authorities to be dealt with  according to law suggested the middy  yes according to law assented mr stuart with much severity applying himself to the letter while the rest of the party rose from table  dear me he exclaimed with an expression of annoyance as his eye fell on the first lines i find that emma and her goodfornothing husband will in all likelihood be here tonight  tonight father said kenneth with a look of gladness  probably replied mr stuart  the vessel in which they sailed from australia was seen off the lizard yesterday at least my agent writes that he thinks it was the hawk but the fog was too thick to permit of a clear sight being obtained so i suppose we shall be inflicted with them and their child tonight or tomorrow  tonight or tomorrow it may be so if they have weathered the storm muttered kenneth in a deep sad tone    chapter six  kenneth indulges in suspicions and surmises  will you walk or ride said kenneth stuart as he and gildart issued from seaside villa and sauntered down the avenue that led to the principal gate  ride by all means said gildart if you have a respectable horse  i love to ride not only on the bursting tide but on the back of a thoroughbred if hes not too tough in the mouth and dont incline to shy  kenneth replied that he had a mount to give him which although not quite thoroughbred was nevertheless a good animal and not addicted to the bad qualities objected to  as he spoke daniel horsey walked up and touching his hat asked if the horses would be required  yes dan  is bucephalus none the worse of last nights work  niver a taste sur  hes like a lark this mornin  well saddle him and also the brown horse  bring them both over to captain bingleys as soon as you can  yis sur  dan touched his cap and walked smartly away  why to my fathers asked gildart  because after your father and miss gordon were exposed to such unwonted fatigue i wish to inquire for them personally  humph youre not satisfied with my assurance that they are well  not quite my boy said kenneth with a smile i wish to have the assurance from the lips of your sweet cousin  whew in love exclaimed gildart  no not in love yet replied the other but to change the subject did you observe the manner in which my father received the news of the arrival of the hawk  well it did not require a fellow to have his weather eye very wideopen to perceive that your father has a decided objection to his soninlaw and does not seem over anxious to meet with him or his wife or child  what have they been up to kennieeloped eh  no they did not exactly elope but they married without my fathers consent or rather against his wishes and were discarded in consequence  you must not think my father is an unkind man but he was deeply disappointed at poor emmas choice for to say truth her husband was a wild harumscarum sort of fellow fond of steeplechasing  like you interpolated gildart  like me assented kenneth with a nod and also of yachting and boating like you  like me assented the middy  nevertheless resumed kenneth a goodhearted fellow in the main who i am certain would have acted his part in life well if he had been better trained  but he was spoiled by his father and mother and i must admit that poor tom graham was not over fond of work  ha ejaculated gildart  hum responded his friend do either of us i wonder perceive in ourselves any resemblance to him in this latter point  i suppose it would require a third party to answer that question truly  but to continuemy father gave emma for he would not consent to see tom a thousand pounds and dismissed her from his presence as he said for ever but i am convinced that he did not mean what he said for he paced about his bedroom the whole of the night after his last interview with poor emma and i heard him groan frequently although the partition that separates our rooms is so thick that sounds are seldom heard through it  do you know gildart i think we sometimes judge men harshly  knowing my father as i do i am convinced that he is not the cold unfeeling man that people give him credit for  he acted i believe under a strong conviction that the course he adopted was that of duty he hoped no doubt that it would result in good to his child and that in the course of time he should be reconciled to her  i cannot conceive it possible that any one would cast off his child deliberately and for ever  why the man who could do so were worse than the beasts that perish  i agree with you  but what came of tom and emma asked gildart  they went to australia  tom got into business there  i never could make out the exact nature of it but he undoubtedly succeeded for a time for emmas letters to me were cheerful  latterly however they got into difficulties and poor emmas letters were sad and came less frequently  for a year past she has scarcely written to me at all  tom has never written  he was a highspirited fellow and turned his back on us all when my father cast him and emma off  humph ejaculated gildart nevertheless his high spirit did not induce him to refuse the thousand pounds it would seem  you wrong him gildart emma knew him well and she told me that she had placed the money in a bank in her own name without telling him of it  any success that attended him at first was the result of his own unaided energy and application to business  it is many years now since they went away  some time ago we heard that they with their only daughter little emma were coming back to england whether in wealth or in poverty i cannot tell  the vessel in which they were to sail is named the hawk and that is the ship that my father has heard of as having been seen yesterday  how comes it kenneth that you have never opened your lips to me on this subject during our long acquaintance  i did not know even that you had a sister  why to say truth the subject was not one on which i felt disposed to be communicative  i dont like to talk of family squabbles even to my most intimate friends  so we may look for some family breezes and squalls ere long if not gales said gildart with a laugh  kenneth shook his head gravely  i fear much said he that the hawk was exposed to last nights gale she must have been so if she did not succeed in making some harbour before it came on but i cannot shake off the feeling that she is wrecked for i know the vessel well and practical men have told me that she was quite unseaworthy  true she was examined and passed in the usual way by the inspectors but every one knows that that does not insure the seaworthiness of vessels  well but even suppose they have been wrecked suggested gildart it does not follow that they have been drowned  i dont know replied the other in a low voicei have a strange almost a wild suspicion gildart  what may that be  that the little girl who was left so mysteriously at our door last night is my sisters child said kenneth  whew whistled the midshipman as he stopped and gazed at his friend in surprise well that is a wild idea so wild that i would advise you seriously to dismiss it kennie  but what has put it into your headfancied likeness to your sister or tom eh  no not so much that as the fact that she told niven last night that her name is emmie  thats not emma said gildart  it is what i used to call my sister however and besides that there is a seaman named stephen gaff who i find has turned up somewhat suddenly and unaccountably last night from australia  he says he has been wrecked but he is mysterious and vague in his answers and do what i will i cannot get rid of the idea that there is some connexion here  it is anxiety my boy that has made you think in this wild fashion said gildart  did i not hear mrs niven say that the child gave her name as emmie wilson  true i confess that the name goes against my idea nevertheless i cannot get rid of it so i mean to canter today down to cove where gaff stays and have a talk with him  we can go together by the road along the top of the cliffs which is an exceedingly beautiful one what say you  by all means it matters nothing to me what course you steer so long as we sail in company  but pray dont let the fascinating lizzie detain you too long  oh you need not laugh as if you were invulnerable  ill engage to say that youll not come away under an hour if you go into the house without making me a solemn promise to the contrary  why gildart it strikes me that you must be in love with your fascinating cousin from the way in which you speak  perhaps i am said the middy with a tremendous sigh but come here we are and the horses at the door before us they must have been brought round by the other road  now then promise that youll not stay longer than half an hour  kenneth smiled and promised  on entering my residence which had been named by mrs bingleys orders bingley hall the young men found my pretty niece coming down the staircase in that most fascinating of all dresses a ridinghabit which displayed her neat and beautifully rounded figure to perfection lizzie could not be said to blush as she bowed acknowledgment to kenneths salutation for a blush unless it were a very deep one usually lost itself among the blush roses that at all times bloomed on her cheek but she smiled with great sweetness upon the stalwart youth and informed him that having just been told that john furby was still suffering from the effects of his recent accident she had ordered out her pony and was about to ride down to cove to see him  kenneth began to remark on the curious coincidence that he too had come out with the intention of riding down to the same place but the volatile middy burst in with  come lizz thats jolly were bound for the same port and can set sail in company whether we keep together or not depends on circumstances not to mention wind and weather  i rather think that if we take to racing bucephalus and kenneth will be there first  bucephalus is always well behaved in the company of ladies which is more than i can say of you gildart retorted his friend as he opened the door to let lizzie gordon pass out  and we wont race good cousin said lizzie for my uncle is to ride with me and you know he is not fond of going very fast  how dye know that lass said i coming downstairs at the moment not a few of my friends think that i go much too fast for this centuryso fast indeed that they seem to wonder that i have not ridden ahead of them into the next  how dye do kenneth  gildart was not long of finding you out i see  saying this i mounted my cob and cantered down the avenue of bingley hall followed by the young people whose fresh and mettlesome steeds curvetted and pranced incessantly  it may be as well to remark here good reader that at the time of which i write i was unacquainted as a matter of course with many of the facts which i am now narrating they were made known to me piecemeal in the course of after years  i feel that this explanation is necessary in order to account for my otherwise unaccountable knowledge of things that were said and done when i was not present    chapter seven  lizzie gordon is run away with and gaff is pumped  the road to the cove lay along the top of the cliffs and was in many parts exceedingly picturesque now passing in the form of a mere bridlepath along the verge of the precipices where thousands of seagulls floated around the giddy heights or darted down into the waves which fell on shingly beach or promontory or bay of yellow sand far below anon cutting across the grassy downs on some bold headland or diverging towards the interior and descending into a woody dell in order to avoid a creek or some other arm of the sea that had cleft the rocks and intruded on the land  the day was sunny and sufficiently warm to render a slow pace agreeable to my nag which was a sedate animal inclined to corpulency like myself  my young companions and their horses were incapable of restraining themselves to my pace so they dashed on ahead at intervals and sometimes came back to me at full gallop  at other times they dismounted and stood on the cliffs looking at the view of the sea which appeared to them as it has always been to me enchanting  i think a view from a high cliff of the great blue sea dotted with the white and brown sails of ships and boats is one of the grandest as well as the most pleasant prospects under the sun  kenneth stuart thought so too for i heard him make use of that or some similar expression to lizzie as he stood beside her talking earnestly in spite of the light and jocular remarks of my son who stood at lizzies other side commenting on things in general with that easy freedom of speech which is characteristic of middies in the british navy although not entirely confined to them  the party had dismounted and kenneth held lizzies horse by the bridle while gildart held his own  bucephalus was roaming at large  his master had trained him so thoroughly that he was as obedient as a dog he followed kenneth about and would trot up to him when he whistled  i dont think i ever saw such a magnificent horse as to size beauty and spirit coupled with docility either before or since  why uncle we thought you must have gone to sleep said lizzie turning towards me with a laugh as i rode up  or fallen over the cliffs added gildart  in either case you would not have taken it much to heart apparently said i come mount and push on  lizzie placed her little foot in kenneths hand and was in the saddle like a flash of thought and with the lightness of a roseleaf gildart being a little fellow and his horse a tall one got into the saddle according to his own statement as a landsman clambers into the maintop through the lubbers hole in a squall and i think the idea was not farfetched for during the process of mounting his steed was plunging like a ship in a heavy sea  bucephalus came up at once when whistled to  you seem very fond of your horse said lizzie as kenneth vaulted into the saddle  i love him replied the youth enthusiastically  you love other creatures besides horses thought i but the thought had barely passed through my brain when lizzie went off like an arrow kenneth sprang forward like a thunderbolt and gildart followedif i may so speaklike a zigzag cracker  now it chanced that lizzies horse was in a bad humour that morning so it ran away just as the party came to a grassy slope of half a mile in extent  at the end of this slope the road made a sharp turn and descended abruptly to the beach  kenneth knew that if the horse came to this turn at a furious gallop nothing could save lizzie from destruction  he therefore took the only course open to him which was to go by a short cut close along the edge of the cliff and thus overshoot and intercept the runaway  he dashed spurs into bucephalus and was off like an arrow from a bow there was but one point of dangera place where the bridlepath was crossed by a fence beyond which the road turned sharp to the left  the risk lay in the difficulty of making the leap and the turn almost at the same instant  to fail in this would result in horse and man going over the cliff and being dashed to pieces  on they went like the wind while my son and i followed as fast as we could  bravo kenneth shouted gildart as bucephalus took the fence like a deer and disappeared  gildart did not know the dangers of the leap i did and hastened to the spot with a feeling of intense alarm  on reaching it i saw kenneth flying far down the slope  he was just in time a few seconds more and lizzie would have been lost  but the bold youth reached the road in time caught her bridle reined the horse almost on his haunches then turned him gradually aside until he galloped with him to a place of safety  this episode induced us to ride the rest of the way in a more leisurely fashion  arrived at cove we each went on our several pieces of business arranging to meet at the north end of the village in about an hour afterwards  kenneth found stephen gaff at home  leaving lizzie to make inquiry as to the health of john furby he took the seaman out and walked towards the downs  well stephen you have been wrecked again i am told said kenneth  so i have sir its the sixth time now  its quite plain i aint born to be drownded  i only hope as how i wont live to be hanged  i hope not stephen  what was the name of the ship  the fairy queen  the fairy queen echoed kenneth with a slight feeling of disappointment from australia  yes from australia  did she go to pieces  ay not an inch of her left  she was an old rotten tub not fit for sea  indeed  thats by no means an uncommon state of things said kenneth with some degree of warmth  it seems to me that until men in power take the matter up and get a more rigid system of inspection instituted hundreds of lives will continue to be sacrificed every year it is an awful thing to think that more than a thousand lives are lost annually on our shores and that because of the indifference of those who have the power to a large extent to prevent it  but that is not the point on which i want to speak to you today  was the fairy queen bound for this port  no for the port of london said gaff with a cautious glance at his questioner  then why did she make for wreckumoft inquired kenneth  thats best known to the capn whos gone to his long home said gaff gravely  were all lost except yourself pursued kenneth regarding his companions face narrowly but the said face exhibited no expression whatever as its owner replied simply  its more than i can tell mayhap some of em were carried away on bits o wreck and may turn up yet  at all events none of them came ashore to your knowledge  i believe that every mothers son o the crew wos lost but me replied gaff evasively  were none of the children saved  what childn asked the other quickly  i didnt say there was childn aboord did i  kenneth was somewhat confused at having made this slip and gaff suddenly changing his tactics stopped short and said  i tell ee wot it is young manseems to me youre pumpin of me for some ends of yer own as im not acquainted with now i tell ee wot it is i aint used to be pumped  no offence meant but i aint used to be pumped an if youve got anything to say speak it out fair and above board like a man  well well gaff said kenneth flushing and laughing at the same moment to say truth i am not used to pump as you may see nor to be otherwise than fair and aboveboard as i hope you will believe but the fact is that a very curious thing has occurred at our house and i am puzzled as well as suspicious and very anxious about it  here kenneth related all that he knew about the little girl having been left at seaside villa and candidly admitted his suspicion that the child was his niece  but said gaff whose visage was as devoid of expression as a fiddle figurehead your brotherinlaws name was graham you know  true thats what puzzles me the childs christian name is emmathe same as that of my niece and sisterbut she says her last name is wilson  well then wilson aint graham you know any more nor gaff aint snooks dye see  yes i see but im puzzled for i do see a family likeness to my sister in this child and i cannot get rid of the impression although i confess that it seems unreasonable  and the thought makes me very anxious because if i were correct in my suspicion that would prove that my beloved sister and her husband are drowned  kenneth said this with strong feeling and the seaman looked at him more earnestly than he had yet done  your father was hard on your sister and her husband if i beant misinformed said gaff  he thought it his duty to be so answered kenneth  and you agreed with him pursued gaff  no never cried the other indignantly  i regretted deeply the course my father saw fit to pursue  i sympathised very strongly with my dear sister and poor tom graham  did you said gaff  most truly i did  hum  you spoke of suspicionswot was your suspicions  to be candid with you then said kenneth when i came to see you i suspected that it was you who left that child at our house for i heard of your sudden reappearance in cove but i am convinced now that i was wrong for i know you would not tell me a falsehood gaff  no more i would sir said gaff drawing himself up and no more i did but let me tell to you sir nevertheless that your suspicions is crect  i left emmie wilson at your house and emmie wilson is emma graham  kenneth stopped and looked earnestly at his companion  my sister and brother he asked in a low suppressed voice  dead both of em said gaff  with a mighty effort kenneth restrained his feelings and after walking in silence for some time asked why gaff had concealed this from his family and how it happened that the child did not know her proper name  you see sir replied the sailor ive knowd all along of your fathers illwill to mr graham and his wife for i went out with them to australia and they tuk a fancy to me dye see an so did i to them so we made it up that wed jine company pull in the same boat so to speak though it was on the land we was goin and not the sea theres a proverb sir that says misfortin makes strange bed fellows an i spose its the same proverb as makes strange messmates anyhow poor tom graham he an me an his wife we become messmates an of course we spun no end o yarns about our kith and kin so i found out how your father had treated of em which to say truth i warnt sprised at for ive obsarved for years past that hes hard as nails altho he is your father sir an has let many a good ship go to the bottom for want o bein properly found  you need not criticise my father gaff said kenneth with a slight frown  many mens sins are not so black as they look  prevailing custom and temptation may have had more to do with his courses of action than hardness of heart  i dun know that said gaff howsever i dont mean for to krittysise him though im bound to say his sins is uncommon dark grey if they aint black  well i wos agoin to say that mr graham had some rich relations in melbourne as he didnt want for to see  he was a proud man you know sir an didnt want em to think he cared a stiver for em so he changed his name to wilson an let his beard an mowstaches grow so that when he put his cap on there was nothin of him visible except his eyes and his nose stickin out of his face an when his hair grew long an his face was tanned wi the sun his own mother would have cut him dead if shed met him in the street  well we worked a year in melbourne to raise the wind  tom he made me call him tom sir bein a clever fellow got into a store as a clerk an i got work as a porter at the quays an though his work was more gentlemanly than mine i made very near as much as him so we lived comfortable and laid by a little  that winter little emma was born she just come to poor tom and his wife like a great sunbeam  arter that we went a year to the diggins and then i got to weary to see my old missus so i left em with a promise to return  i comd home saw my wife and then went out again to jine the grahams for another spell at the diggins then i come home again for another spell wi the missus an so i kep goin and comin year by year till now  tom was a lucky digger  he resolved to quit for good and all and return to settle in england  he turned all he had into golddust and put it in a box with which he shipped aboard the fairy queen of which i was one o the crew at the time  the fairy queen you must understand had changed owners just about that time havin bin named the hawk on the voyage out  we sailed together and got safe to british waters an wos knocked all to bits on british rocks cause the compasses wasnt worth a button as no more wos our charts bein old ones an the chain o the best bower anchor had bin got cheap and wasnt fit to hold a jollyboat so that wen we drove on a leeshore and let go the anchor to keep off the reefs it parted like a bit o packthread  i took charge of emmie and by gods blessin got safe to land  all the rest went down  now sir continued gaff it came into my head that if i took the little gal to her grandfather he bein as hard as nails an desprit unforgivin would swear i wos tellin a lie and refuse to take her in so i thought id just go and put her down in the passage an leave her so that hed be obleeged to take her in dye see not bein able to see what else to do wi her  you know he couldnt throw her out and let her die in the street could he sir  not exactly replied kenneth with a sad smile nevertheless he would not find it difficult to dispose of her in some other way in fact he has already spoken of sending her to the workhouse  you dont say so sir  indeed i do but keep your mind easy gaff for without telling my father who little emmie is i will see to it that she is properly cared for  kenneth rode back to town that day with a heart so heavy that the bright eyes of lizzie gordon failed to rouse him to even the semblance of cheerfulness and the effervescing smalltalk of the volatile gildart was almost intolerable    chapter eight  dan horsey does the agreeable in the kitchen  captain bingley said kenneth entering my study somewhat hastily on the following morning i am going to carry off gildart for the day to have a ride with me and i looked in on you in passing to tell you that haco has arrived in his schooner and that he is going to sail this evening for london and will take your russians to their consul if you wish it  thank you lad many thanks said i some of them may be able to go but others i fear are too much hurt and may require to be nursed in the home for some time yet  i will consider it meanwhile will you carry a note to your father for me  with pleasure at least i will send dan horsey with it if that will do as well  quite as well if you can spare him send him into the kitchen while i write the note  adieu lad and see that you dont break gildarts neck  remember that he is not much accustomed to horses  no fear of him said kenneth looking back with a laugh as he reached the door he is well used to riding out hard gales and that is more arduous work than steeplechasing  when dan horsey was told to go to the kitchen and await further orders he received the command with a cheerful smile and attaching the bridle of his horse to a post proceeded to obey it  the kitchen of bingley hall was the abode of two females who severally owned a distinct and dissimilar character both mental and physical the first femalefirst in most senses of the wordwas bounder the cook who was fat as cooks ought to be in order to prove that their productions agree with them and selfopinionated as cooks generally are in order no doubt to prove that they know their business  the second female was susan barepoles a slim graceful housemaid apparently modest cook did not even pretend to that virtue and wonderfully sharpeyed  both females were goodlooking and young and both were desperately in love with daniel horsey  each knew the fact and so did dan  each was mortally jealous of the other and dan was dreadfully perplexed in consequence  not that he was uncertain as to which of the two he preferred for susans image was engruven as he expressed it deeply on his heart to the exclusion of all other images but he found that the jealousy of the two interfered somewhat with the course of true love causing it to run in its proverbially rough channel  its a fine mornin my darlints said dan as he entered the kitchen with a swagger and laid his hat and ridingwhip on the dresser at the same time seating himself on the edge of a small table that stood near the window  this seat he preferred to a chair partly because it enabled him to turn his back to the light and partly because it afforded him an opportunity of swinging his legs gently with an easy motion that was agreeable and at the same time in his opinion graceful  none o yer imperance said cook stirring the contents of a large pan carefully  susan tossed her head slightly but admitted that the morning was good  hes awritin of a letter to grumpy said dan pointing with his thumb towards the ceiling in order to indicate that the he referred to was myself  whos grumpy inquired cook with a look of interest  arrah now dont ye know its old stuart  susan laughed and cook observed that the name seemed to her an extremely disrespectful one  its not bad enough for him the old pair o tongs said dan taking up his whip with a gentlemanly assumption of ease and flipping the toe of his boot with it av it wasnt for the love that my master kenneth bears me id have left em long ago  but you see the young master is a firstrater and couldnt get on without me no how so im willin to stop  besides continued dan with a very small sigh i have private raisons for not carin to leave just now  he accompanied the latter remark with a sly glance at susan who chanced quite accidentally to cast a sly glance at dan so that their eyes met and the result was that susan blushed and began to rub the silver teapot which she was cleaning unmercifully and dan laughed whereupon cook looked round hastily and asked what he was laughing at to which dan responded that his own imagination which happened to be a brilliant one had just then suggested a train of comical ideas which had tickled his risible muscles so that he couldnt help it  i dont believe it said cook who observed susans confusion of face and became internally red hot with jealousy i blieve you was larfin at me  och miss bounder exclaimed dan looking at her with an expression so awfully reproachful that cook instantly repented and laughed  theres bin some strange doins up at the villa said susan by way of changing the subject while she polished the teapot yet more unmercifully  ah exclaimed cook thats true what does it all mean mr horsey  thats more nor myself can tell said dan the facts o the case is clear so far as they comed under our obsarvation  but as to the circumstances o the case specially those of em as hasnt yet transpired i dont rightly know myself wot opinions i ought to entertain  susan listened to these remarks with profound admiration chiefly because she did not understand them but cook who was more matteroffact in her nature and somewhat demonstrative in her tendencies advised dan not to talk gammon but to explain what he meant  explain what i mean coolinary sunbeam said dan isnt it explainin that i am as plain as the nose on yer face an a purty wan it is though i havent got the powers of a lawyer nor yit a praist  didnt a drippin wet sailor come to our door at the dead o night an ring the bell as bowld as brass an when mrs niven whose intellect was niver much beyond that of a poplypus  whats a poplypus interrupted cook  well now remonstrated dan i aint xactly a walkin dictionary but i blieve its a baist o the say what haint got nothin but a body an a stummik indeed im not sure but that its all stummik together with just legs enough to move about with or may be a fin or two an a hole to let in the wittles quite in your line by the way miss bounder  imperance ejaculated cook  no offence said dan but to resoom the thread o the narrative as the story books say mrs niven she opened the door and the drippin wet sailor he puts a little wet spalpeen in her arms an goes right off without so much as by your lave an thats all we know about it  an grumpy he goes ragin about the house sayin hell have nothin to do wi the poor little thingwhos not so little naither bein a tenyearold if shes an hour an a purty sweet face to bootan that hell send her to the workus or prisn or anywhere but in his house shes not to stop another day  well not havin the management o the whole of this worlds affairs fortnately else a scrubbily managed world it would be grumpy finds out that when he wants to send little emmie as she calls herself off shes knocked down by a ragin fever an the doctor he says its as much as her life is worth to move her  so grumpy has to grin and bear it and theres little emmie lyin at this minit in our best bed where mrs niven put her the moment she was took bad atossin her purty arms in the air an makin her yellow hair fly over the pillows and kickin off the close like a young angel in a passion and callin on her mama in a voice that would make a stone immage weep all the while that miss penelope is snivellin on one side o the bed an mrs niven is snortin on the other  poor dear said susan in a low voice devoting herself with intensified zeal to the teapot while sympathetic tears moistened her eyes  i interrupted the conversation at this point by entering the kitchen with my note to my friend stuart  i had to pass through the kitchen to my back garden when i wished to leave my house by the back garden gate i had coughed and made as much noise as possible in approaching the cooks domains but they had been so much engrossed with each other that they did not hear me  dan sprang hastily off the table and suddenly assumed a deeply respectful air  dan said i take this note to mr stuart as quickly as possible and bring me an answer without delay  i am going to see haco barepoles at  oh sir exclaimed susan with a start and looking at me interrogatively  oh i forgot susan your father has just arrived from aberdeen and is at this moment in the sailors home  you may run down to see him my girl if you choose  thank you sir said susan with a glow of pleasure on her goodlooking face as she pushed the teapot from her and dropt the cloth in her haste to get away to see her sire  stay susan said i you need not hurry back  in fact you may spend the day with your father if you choose and tell him that i will be down to see him in a few minutes  but i shall probably be there before you  you may take mr stuarts answer to the home i added turning to dan i shall be there when you return with it  yes sir said dan in a tone so energetic as to cause me to look at him  i observed that he was winking towards the kitchen door  casting my eyes thither i saw that susans face was much flushed as he disappeared into the passage  i also noted that the cooks face was fiery red and that she stirred a large pot over which she bent with unnecessary violenceviciously as it were  pondering on these things i crossed my garden and proceeded towards the home which stood on a conspicuous eminence near the docks at the east end of the town    chapter nine  the sailors home and the mad skipper  the sailors home in wreckumoft was a neat substantial unpretending edifice which had been built by a number of charitable people in order to provide a comfortable residence with board at moderate terms for the numerous seamen who frequented our port  it also served as a place of temporary refuge to the unfortunate crews of the numerous wrecks which occurred annually on our shores  here i found haco barepoles the skipper of a coal sloop seated on the side of his bed in one of the little berths of the home busily engaged in stuffing tobacco into the bowl of a great german pipe with the point of his little finger  susan who had outstripped me was seated beside him with her head on his shoulder  oh father  i heard susan say as i walked along the passage between the rows of sleeping berths that lined each side of the principal dormitory of our home i shall lose you some day i fear  how was it that you came so near bein wrecked  before the skipper could reply i stood in the doorway of his berth  goodday haco said i glad to see you safe back once more  thankee capn bingleysame to you sir said haco rising hastily from the bed and seizing my hand which he shook warmly and i must add painfully for the skipper was a hearty impulsive fellow apt to forget his strength of body in the strength of his feelings and given to grasp his male friends with a gripe that would i verily believe have drawn a roar from hercules  ive come back to the old bunk you see he continued while i sat down on a chest which served for a chair  i likes the home better an better every time i comes to it and ive brought all my crew with me for you see sir the coffins amost fallin to pieces and will have to go into dock for a riglar overhaul  the coffin said susan interrogatively  yes lass its only a nickname the old tub got in the north where they call the colliers coalcoffins cause its ten to one youll go to the bottom in em every time ye go to sea  are they all so bad as to deserve the name inquired susan  no not xactly all of em but theres a good lot as are not half so fit for sea as a washin tub  you see they aint worth repairin and owners sometimes just take their chance o makin a safe run by keepin the pumps goin the whole time  i informed haco that i had called for the purpose of telling him that i had applied to mr stuart who owned his little coal sloop to give a few wrecked russians a passage to london in order that they might be handed over to the care of their consul but that i would have to find a passage for them in some other vessel as the coffin was so unseaworthy  dont be in too great a hurry sir said haco with a peculiar smile and twinkle in his eye im inclined to think that mr stuart will send her back to london to be repaired there  what exclaimed susan with a flush of indignation an risk your life father  as to that lass my life has got to be risked anyhow and it aint much worth to say the truth so you neednt trouble yourself on that pint  its worth a great deal to me said susan drawing herself closer to the side of her rugged parent  i could not help smiling as i looked at this curious specimen of a british seaman shaking his head gravely and speaking so disparagingly of himself when i knew and every one in the town knew that he was one of the kindest and most useful of men  he was a very giant in size with a breadth of shoulder that would have made him quite ridiculous had it not been counterbalanced by an altitude of six feet four  he had a huge head of red hair and a huge heart full of tenderness  his only fault was utter recklessness in regard to his own life and limbsa fault which not unfrequently caused him to place the lives and limbs of others in jeopardy though he never could be brought to perceive that fact  whatever your life may be worth my friend said i it is to be hoped that mr stuart will not risk it by sending you to sea in the coffin till it is thoroughly overhauled  come in shouted the skipper in answer to a rap at the door  the invitation to enter was not accepted but the rap was repeated  go susan said i see who it is  susan obeyedwith unusual alacrity as i fancied but did not return with equal quickness  we heard her whispering with some one then there was a sound as if of a suppressed scream followed by something that was marvellously like a slap applied to a cheek with an open hand  next moment susan reappeared with a letter and a very flushed face  a letter sir said susan dropping her eyes  who brought it  i inquired  mr horsey sir  susan stammered the name and looked confused  he waits an answer sir  haco barepoles had been eyeing his daughter gravely the while  he now sprang up with the wild energy that was his peculiar characteristic and flinging the door wideopen with a crash that shook the whole framework of the berth stood face to face with dan horsey  intense gravity marked the features of the groom who stood hat in hand tapping the side of his topboot with a silvermounted ridingwhip  he met hacos steady frown with a calm and equally steady gaze of his clear grey eyes and then relaxing into a smile nodded familiarly and inquired if the weather was fine up there bekaise judgin from his hacos face he would be inclined to think it must be raither cowld  haco smiled grimly ye was to wait an answer was ye  if i may venture to make so bowld as to say so in the presence of your highness i was  then wait said haco smiling a little less grimly  thank ye sir for yer kind permission said dan in a tone and with an air of assumed meekness  the skipper returned to the bed which creaked as if taxed to its utmost when he sat down on it and drew susan close to his side  this is from mr stuart haco said i running my eye hastily over the note he consents to my sending the men in your vessel but after what you have told me  dont mind wot i told ye captain bingley  ill see mr stuart today anll call on you in the afternoon  the coffin aint quite so bad as she looks  have ee any answer to send back  no said i turning to dan who still stood at the door tapping his right boot with a jaunty air tell your master with my compliments that i will see him about this matter in the evening  and harkee lad cried haco again springing up and confronting the groom dye see this young ooman  pointing to susan  sure i do replied dan with a smile and a nod to susan an a purty cratur she is for the eye of man to rest upon  and shouted haco shaking his enormous fist within an inch of the others nose dye see them there knuckles  dan regarded them steadfastly for a moment or two without winking or flinching  theyre a purty bunch o fives he said at length drawing back his head and placing it a little on one side in order to view the bunch with the air of a connoisseur very purty but raither too fat to do much damage in the ring  i should say now that it would get puffy at the fifth round supposin that you had wind and pluck left at your time of life to survive the fourth  well now lad retorted the skipper all ive to say is that youve seed it an if you dont mind yer eye yell feel it  a nods as good as a wink to a blind horse  haco plunged the bunch of fives into his coatpocket and sat down again beside his agitated daughter  i can speak purfessionally said dan in regard to yer last obsarvation consarnin blind hosses and i belave that yere crect  it dont much matter whether ye nod or wink to a blind hoss though i cant spake from personal exparience caise i niver tried it on not havin nothin to do with blind hosses  ye wouldnt have a weed would ye skipper he added pulling out a neat leather case from which he drew a cigar  go away dan directly said i with some asperity for i was nettled at the impudence of the man in my presence and not a little alarmed lest the angry haco should kick him downstairs  dan at once obeyed bowing respectfully to me and as i observed winking to susan as he turned away  he descended the stair in silence but we heard him open the door of the public room and address the russians who were assembled there warming themselves at the fire and enjoying their pipes  hooray my hearties said dan got yer broken legs rewived i hope and yer spurrits bandaged up  heyoch  i forgot ye can swaller nothin but toorkocum squaki lorum ho po doddie jairum frango whiskie loorowhackeh  arrah ye dont need to answer for fear the effort opens up yer wounds afresh  farewell lads or may be its wishin ye fairwind would be more natral  so saying he slammed the door and we heard him switching his boots as he passed along the street under the windows whistling the air of the girls we left behind us followed before he was quite out of earshot by oh my love is like the red red rose thats newly sprung in june  immediately after dans departure i left haco and susan together and they held the following conversation when left alone  i am enabled to report it faithfully reader because susan told it word for word to her mistress who has a very reprehensible habit of listening to the gossip of her maid  of course mrs b told it to me because she tells everything to me sometimes a good deal more than i care to hear  this i think a very reprehensible habit also  i am bound to listen because when my strongminded wife begins to talk i might as well try to stop a runaway locomotive as attempt to silence her  and so it comes about that i am now making the thing public  susan said haco earnestly looking at his daughters downcast face on which the tell tale blood was mantling  are you fond o thatthat feller  yeyes father replied susan with some hesitation  humph an is he fond o you  oh isnt he just said susan with a little confused laugh  susan continued haco with increasing earnestness are ye sure hes worthy of you  yes father im quite sure of that  well then susan youre a sensible girl and you ought to know best but i dont feel easy about ye cause youre just as like as two peas to your dear mother what went to the bottom in the last coalcoffin i commanded an you would ha gone too darlin if i hadnt bin spared to swim ashore with ye on my back  it was all i could do  ah susan it was a black night for you an me that  well as i was a sayin youre as like yer mother as two peas and she was as trustful as you are an little knew wot a bad lot she got when she set her heart on me  father thats not true  aint it lass  well let it pass but then this feller this dan hursey  horsey father said susan  well well it aint much better this horsey is an irishman an i dont like irishmen  father youd get to like em if you only knew em better said susan earnestly  what bells that she added as a loud ringing echoed through the house  the dinner bell lass  come an see wot a comfrable feed they git  i can tell ee that them sailors homes is the greatest blessin that was ever got up for us seadogs  we aint xactly such soft good naturd ignorant big babies as some o your wellmeanin pheelanthropists would make us out but we are uncommon hard put to it when we git ashore for every port is alive with crimps an landsharks to swaller us up when we come off a long voyage an the wust of it is that were in a wild reckless humour for the most part when we git ashore with our pockets full o yellow boys an are too often quite willin to be swallered up so that lots of us are constantly agoin to sticks an stivers  an then before the homes was set agoin the fellers as wanted to get quiet lodgins didnt find it easy to know where to look for em an was often took in an when they wanted to send cash to their wives or mothers they didnt well know how to manage it but now wherever theres a home you can git cheap board good victuals help in the way o managin yer cash an no end of advice gratis  its only a pity there aint one or two of em in every port in the kingdom  see here continued haco warming with his subject as he led susan past the dormitories where the russians who had been maimed during the recent wrecks were being supplied with dinner in their berths see hereanother o the best o the institootions o this land looks arter them poor fellers an pays their shot for em as long as theyre here an sends them to their homes free of expensethats the shipwrecked fishermens and mariners society  youve heerd o that society susan havent ee  no father never  what never heerd o the shipwrecked mariners society with its hundreds o honorary agents all round the coast who have done more to dry the tears o orphans an comfort widders hearts than tongue can tellnever heerd o it an you a sailors daughter  i daresay im very stupid for being so ignorant father but i never heard of it  you know ive spent most o my life inland with old auntie bess an only come here this year  mayhap continued haco shaking his head gravely youve never heerd neither o the lifeboat institootion  never said susan meekly  ive seen the lifeboat we have here you know but i never heard of the institootion  well well susan i neednt be surprised for to say truth theres many in this country who think no small beer o theirselves that know precious little about either the one or the other although theyre the most valooable institootions in the country  ill tell ee about em lass some other timehow they saves hundreds o lives an relieves no end o distress annooally  its enough just now to say that the two institootions is what i calls brother an sisterthe lifeboat one bein the brother the shipwrecked mariners one bein the sister  the brother besides savin thousands o pounds worth o goods saves hundreds o lives every year  but when the brother has saved the shipwrecked sailor his work is done  he hands him over to the sister who clothes him feeds him warms himas you see bein done to them there roosiansand then sends him home  every sailor in the country should be a member o the shipwrecked mariners society say i  ive been one myself for many years an it only costs me three shillings a year  ill tell ee some other time what good it does me but just now you an i shall go an have some grub  where shall we go to get it father  to the refreshment room below lass  it wont do to take ye to the dinin hall o the home for three reasonsfirst cause yere a ooman an they aint admitted second cause it wouldnt be pleasant for ye to dine wi forty or fifty jacktars and thirdly if ye wanted it ever so much yer old father wouldnt let yeso come along lass to dinner    chapter ten  the dinner in the restauranthaco meets an old friend and becomes communicative  the room to which haco led his daughter was a small oblong one divided off into compartments similar to those with which we are familiar in eatinghouses and restaurants of the poorer class  it formed part of the home but was used by the general public as well as by seamen who wished to order a meal at any time and pay for it  haco barepoles being at the time a boarder in the home was entitled to his dinner in the general messroom but being bent on enjoying his meal in company with susan he chose to forego his rights on that occasion  being the hour at which a number of seamen labourers clerks and others were wont to experience the truth of the great fact that nature abhors a vacuum the room was pretty full and a brisk demand was going on for soup tea coffee rolls and steaks etcetera all of which were supplied on the most moderate terms in order to accommodate the capacities of the poorest purse  in this temple of luxury you could get a small bowl of good soup for one penny which with a halfpenny roll might form a dinner to any one whose imagination was so strong as to enable him to believe he had had enough  any one who was the fortunate possessor of threepence could by doubling the order really feel his appetite appeased  then for those whose poverty was extreme or appetite unusually small a little cup of tea could be supplied for one halfpennyand a good cup of tea too not particularly strong it is true but with a fair average allowance of milk and sugar  waiter cried haco barepoles in a voice that commanded instant attention  yessir  soup for two steaks an taties for ditto to foller  yessir  please father i would like a cup of coffee after the soup instead of a steak  i dont feel very hungry  all right lass  waiter knock off one o the steaks an clap a cup o coffee in its place  yessir  roll with it miss  of course said haco  butter miss  sartinly  an double allowance o milk an sugar replied the skipper  spose you hant got cream  no sir  never mind  look alive now lad  come susan heres a box with only one man int wellhallo shiver my timbers if it aintnoit cant bestephen gaff eh or his ghost  just so said stephen laying down his knife and fork and shaking warmly the hand which haco stretched across the table to him im always turnin up now an again like a bad shillin  how goes life with ee haco you dont seem to have multiplied the wrinkles since i last saw ye  thank ee im pretty comfrable  this is my darter susan said haco observing that his friend glanced inquiringly at his fair companionthe world always uses me much the same  i find it a roughish customer but it finds me a jolly one an not easily put out when did i see ye last  let me seetwo years come christmas  why ive been wrecked three times since then run down twice an drownded at least halfadozen times but by good luck they always manages to bring me roundrowsussitate me as the doctors call it  ay youve had hard times of it observed gaff finishing his last morsel of meat and proceeding to scrape up the remains of gravy and potato with his knife ive bin wrecked myself sin we last met but only once and that warnt long ago just the last gale  you coasters are worse off than we are  commend me to blue water and plenty o searoom  i believe you my boy responded the skipper  theres nothin like a good offing an a tight ship  we stand but a poor chance as we go creepin long shore in them rotten tubs that are well named coalcoffins  why if it comes on thick squally weather or a gale when yer dodgin off an on the coalcoffins go down by dozens mayhap at the first burst o the gale youre hove on your beamends an away go the masts leavin ye to drift ashore or sink or praps youre sharp enough to get in sail and have all snug when just as yere weatherin a headland away goes the sheet o the jib jibs blowed to ribbons an afore ye know where ye are breakers on the lee bow is the cry  another gust an the rotten foretopsls blowd away carryin the foretopmast by the board which of course takes the jibboom along with it if it ant gone before  then its stand by to let go the anchor  let go  ay ay sir  down it goes an the coffins brought up sharp not a moment too soon mayhap for ten to one but you see an hear the breakers roarin like mad thirty yards or so astern  it may be good holdin ground but what o thatthe anchors an old un or too small the fluke gives way and yere adrift or the cables too small and cant stand the strain so you let go both anchors an yed let go a dozen more if ye had em for dear life but its o no use  first one an then the other parts the stern is crushed in amost afore ye can think an in two minutes more if not less its all up with ye unless theres a lifeboat at hand  ah pity theres not more of em on the coast said gaff  true rejoined haco many a poor fellers saved every year by them blessed boats as would otherwise have gone to the bottom an left widder and childer to weep for him an be a burden more or less on the country  the waiter appeared at this point in the conversation with the soup so haco devoted himself to dinner while gaff ordered a plate of bread and cheese extra in order to keep him company  for some minutes they all ate in silence  then haco during the interval between the courses informed gaff that he expected to return to the port of london in a day or two whereupon gaff said that he just happened to be lookin out for a ship goin there as he had business to do in the great city and offered to work his way  the skipper readily promised to ship him as an extra hand if the owner chose to send the coffin to sea without repairs which observed haco is not unlikely for hes a closefisted customer  who is he inquired gaff  stuart of seaside villa said haco  ha he is a tough un observed gaff with a significant grin  i knows him well  he dont much care riskin fellers lives though i never heard of him riskin his own  hed very near to answer for mine this voyage said haco as well as he could through a mouthful of steak and potato  how was that  this is how it was answered the skipper bolting the mouthful you see the coffins not in a fit state for sea shes leaky all over an theres a plank under the starboard quarter just abaft the cabin skylight that has fairly struck work caulk it and pitch it how you please it wont keep out the sea no longer so when we was about to take in cargo i wrote to mr stuart tellin him of it an advisin repairs but he wrote back sayin it was very awkard at this time to delay that cargo an askin if i couldnt work the pumps as i had used to do besides hintin that he thought i must be gettin timid as i grew old  you may be sure i didnt think twice  got the cargo aboard up sail an away  well it was blowin a stiff norwester when we got away an we couldnt have beat into port again if our lives depended on it  so i calls the crew aft an told em how the matter stood  now lads says i to speak plain english the sloop is sinkin so you had as well turn to an pump for yer lives an ill show ye how  with that i off coat an set to work an took my turn the whole voyage  but it was touch an go with us  we nigh sank in the harbour here an i had to run her ashore to perwent her goin down in deep water  theyre patchin up the rotten plank at this minute an if old stuart wont go in for a general overhaul well be ready for sea in a day or two and youll have the pleasure o navigatin a lot o wrecked roosians to london  now waiter ahoy  yessir  fetch me a pannikin o tea for its dry work tellin a anikdot  you see gaff im a reglar teetotallernever go the length o coffee even without a doctors surtificate  another cup susan  no thank ee father i couldnt  werry good  now gaff whats the ticklers o your case  time abouts fair play you know  gaff feeling a gush of confidence come over him and having ascertained that in regard to secrecy susan was as safe as the bank related the circumstances of the wreck and his having left emmie at her grandfathers villa the relation of all which caused haco barepoles to give vent to a series of low grunts and whistles expressive of great surprise  now said gaff in conclusion theres a landshark by which i means a lawyer in london what writes to me that theres somethin ill hear of to my advantage if i calls on him  dont go said haco stoutly as he struck the table with his fist causing the crockery to rattle again take the advice of an old friend an dont go  if you do hell do you  thankee an id foller yer advice but i happens to know this landshark  hes an old acquaintance an i can trust him  oh that alters the casewell  well but before i go continued gaff i wants to write a letter to old stuart to warn him to look arter emmie a very partikler letter  ay how much partikler a one inquired haco  a hambigooous one replied his friend  a hamwhat said haco interrogatively  a hambigooous one  what sort of a one may that be mate  well said gaff knitting his heavy brows and assuming altogether a learned aspect its a one that you cant make head nor tail of nohow one asll read arnost as well backard as forard an yet has got a smack o somethin mysterious in it wich shows so to speak to what pint o the compass your steerin fordye see  hmrather hazy ahead answered the skipper with a deeply sagacious look a difficult letter to write in my opinion  how dye mean to do it  dont mean to do it at all  couldnt do it to save my life but ill get a clerk to do it for me a smart young clerk too you know who i mean  ay wholl it be  ill never guess never guessed a guess in my life  you know my darter tottie  what blueeyed tottie oh yer jokin  not a bit  that childs a parfec cooriosity of intelligence  she can write and read most wonderful for her age  but shell never be able to do the hamwhat dye call it suggested haco  of course not shes too young for that but the wifell do that youve no notion how powerful hambigooous she is now an again  well manage it amongst us  tottie can write like a parson my wife can read though she cant write anll see that its all crect specially the spellin an the makin of it hambigooous an ill supply the idees the notions like an superintend so to speak an well make little billy stand by wi the blottinpaper just to keep him out o mischief  haco regarded his friend with deepening admiration  the idea of producing a hambigooous letter by such an elaborate family combination in which each should supply his colabourers deficiency was quite new and exceedingly interesting to him  suddenly his countenance became grave as it occurred to him that there was no call for such a letter at all seeing that kenneth stuart was sure to do his best to induce his father to take care of the child  on observing this to his friend the latter shook his head  im not quite sure o mister kenneth said he its likely that hell do the right thing by her but like father like son is an old proverb  he may be a chip o the old block  that he is not interrupted haco warmly  i know the lad well  he takes after his poor mother and im sartin sure ye may trust him  well i must trust him said gaff but ive had no experience of him so i mean to make assurance doubly sure as the prophet says if it wasnt the poetan thats why ill write this letter  if it dont do no good it wont do no harm  im not so sure o that said haco shaking his head as they rose to depart howsever you know best  now mind susan not a word o this to any one  susan promised and in the course of the evening related the whole affair to daniel horsey in confidence her conscience being apparently relieved by the idea that having told it only in strict confidence she had not broken her word  dan made her promise solemnly that she would tell the tale to no one else on earth either in confidence or otherwise and thus he checked the stream of gossip as close to its fountainhead as possible    chapter eleven  the writing of the hambigooous letter  when stephen gaff approached his own cottage he beheld his wife belabouring the buster with both hands and tongue unmercifully  what special piece of mischief billy had been doing is not of much consequence  it is enough to state that he suddenly planted the heel of his naked foot somewhat effectively on his mothers little toe which chanced to be resting on a sharp stone at the moment burst from her grasp and rushed down the steep bank to the beach cheering weeping and laughing all at once in a sort of hysterical triumph  mrs gaff shouted at the top of her voice to the cherub to come back and get mauled but the cherub declined the invitation until he heard his fathers voice when he returned joyously and took shelter under his wing  mrs gaff who could change at a moments notice from the extreme of anger to perfect quiescence contented herself with shaking her fist at the buster and then relapsed from the condition of a fury into a quiet goodlooking dame  this appears to be the normal condition of fisherfolk who would seem to require to make use of an excessive amount of moral and physical suasion in order suitably to impress their offspring  now jess said gaff leading his son by the hand lets set to work at once wi that there letter  whats all the hurry stephen  ive just seed my old shipmate haco barepoles an its not unlikely hell be ready for sea day arter tomorrow so the sooner we turn this little job out o hands the better  come tottie youre a good girl i see youve purvided the paper and ink  get the table cleaned lass and you billy come here  the buster who had suddenly willed to have a shy at the household cat with a small crab which he had captured and which was just then endeavouring vainly to ascend the leg of a chair for a wonder did not carry out his will but went at once to his sire  whether would ye like to go play on the beach lad or stop here and hold the blottinpaper while we write a letter  billy elected to hold the blottingpaper and watch proceedings being curious to know what the letter was to be about  when all was readythe table cleared of everything except what pertained to the literary work then in handstephen gaff sat down at one end of the table his wife drew her chair to the other end tottie feeling very proud and rather nervous sat between them with a new quill in her hand and a spotless sheet of foolscap before her  the buster stood by with the blotsheet looking eager as if he rather wished for blots and was prepared to swab them up without delay  are ye ready tot asked gaff  yes quite answered the child  then said gaff with the air of a general officer who gives the word for the commencement of a great fight begin an fire away  but what am i to say daddy  ah to be sure youd better begin tottie said gaff evidently in perplexity youd better begin as they teach you to at the school where youve larnt to write so butiful  here mrs gaff advised rather abruptly that she had better write this comes hoping youre well but her husband objected on the ground that the words were untrue inasmuch as he did not care a straw whether the person to be written to was well or ill  ist to a man or a ooman were awritin daddie inquired the youthful scribe  its a gentleman  then wed better begin dear sir dont you think  but he ant dear to me said gaff  no more is he to me observed his wife  make it sir plain sir means nothin in partickler i blieve said gaff with animation so well begin it with plain sir  now then fire away tottie  very well said tottie dipping her pen in the inkbottle which was a stone one and had been borrowed from a neighbour who was supposed to have literary tendencies in consequence of his keeping such an article in his cottage  squaring her elbows and putting her head very much on one side to the admiration of her parents she prepared to write  the buster clutched the blottingpaper and looked on eagerly not to say hopefully  oh exclaimed tottie its red ink see  she held up the pen to view and no one could deny the fact not even billy who feeling that he had repressed his natural flow of spirits rather longer than he was accustomed to and regarding the incident as in some degree destructive of his mothers peace of mind hailed the discovery with an exulting cheer  mrs gaffs palm instantly exploded like a pistolshot on billys ear and he measured his lengthexactly three feet sixon the floor  to rise yelling and receive shot number two from his mother which sent him headlong into the arms of his father who gave him the red inkbottle and bade him cut away and get it changed as fast as he could scuttleto do all this i say was the work of a moment or two  presently billy returned with the same bottle and the information that the literary neighbour had a blackinkbottle but as there was no ink in it he didnt think it worth while to send it  a kind offer was made of a bottle of shoeblacking if the red ink would not do  this is awkard said gaff rubbing his nose  try some tar in it suggested mrs gaff  gaff shook his head but the suggestion led him to try a little soot which was found to answer admirably converting the red ink into a rich dark brown which might pass for black  supplied with this fluid which having been made too thick required a good deal of water to thin it tottie again squared her elbows on the table the parents sat down and the buster remounted guard with the blottingpaper this time carefully out of earshot  now then dear sir said tottie once more dipping her pen  no no didnt i say plain sir remonstrated her father  oh i forgot wellthereitisnow plane sur but ive not been taught that way at school yet  never mind what youve bin taught at school said mrs gaff somewhat sharply for her patience was gradually oozing out do you what youre bid  why it looks uncommon like two words tottie observed her father eyeing the letters narrowly  i would ha thought now that three letters or four at most would have done it an some to spare  three letters daddie exclaimed the scribe with a laugh theres eight of em no less  eight exclaimed gaff in amazement  lets hear em dear  tottie spelled them off quite glibly  plane thats plane sur thats sur  oh tot said gaff with a mingled expression of annoyance and amusement i didnt want ye to write the word plain  well well he added patting the child on the head while she blushed up to the roots of her hair and all down her neck and shoulders its not much matter just you score it out there go over it again once or twice an scribble through itthats your sort  now can ye read what it was  no daddie  are ye sure  quite sure for ive scratched it into a hole right through the paper  never mind its all the better  humph interjected mrs gaff  hell think we began dear sir and then changed our minds and scratched out the dear  to this gaff replied that what was done couldnt be undone and ordered tottie to fire away once more  what next asked the scribe a good deal flurried and nervous by this time in consequence of which she dipped the pen much too deep and brought up a globule of ink which fell on the paper just under the word that had been written down with so much pains making a blot as large as a sixpence  the buster came down on it like lightning with the blotsheet and squashed it into an irregular mass bigger than halfacrown  for this he received another openhander on the ear and was summarily dismissed to the seabeach  by this time the family teahour had arrived so mrs gaff proposed an adjournment until after tea  tottie who was now blotting the letter with an occasional tear seconded the motion which was carried by acclamation  while the meal was being prepared gaff fondled tottie until she was restored to her wonted equanimity so that after tea the task was resumed with spirit  words and ideas seemed to flow more easily and the letter was finally concluded amid many sighs of relief about bedtime  much blotted and almost unreadable though it was i think it worthy of being presented to my readers without correction  i beggs to stait that ittle bee for yoor intrest for to look arter that air gurl cald eme as was left yoor doar sum dais bak if yoo doant ittle bee wors for yer yood giv yer eer an noas too to no wot i nos abowt that gurl its not bostin nor yet threttenin i am no im in downrite arnist wen i sais as yool bee sorrie if yoo doant do it  this part was at first written if you doant look arter the gurl but by the advice of mrs gaff the latter part was cut out and doant do it substituted as being more hambigooous and alarming  the letter continued  now sur i must cloas not becaws my papers dun no nor yet my idees but becaws a nods as good as a winkyoo no the rest  wot ive said is troo as gospl its of no use tryn to find owt hoo i am caws whiyoo kant and if yoo cood it wood doo yoo no good  yoors to comand  the riter  when this letter was placed in mr stuarts hands the following morning he was in the act of concluding a conversation with haco barepoles  well haco he said regarding the illfolded and dirty epistle with suspicion as it lay on the table before him of course i have no wish that men should risk their lives in my service so you may lay up the sloop in dock and have her overhauled but i have always been under the impression until now that you were a fearless seaman  however do as you please  mr stuart knew well the character of the man with whom he had to do and spoke thus with design  haco fired at once but he displayed no temper  very likely i am gittin summat fusty an weak about the buzzum he said almost sadly  a man cant expect to keep young and strong for ever mr stuart  howsever ill look at her bottom again an if she can float ill set sail with the first o the ebb day arter tomorrow goodday sir  haco bowed and left the room quite modestly for he hated the very appearance of boasting but when he was in the passage his teeth snapped together like nutcrackers as he compressed his lips and on gaining the street he put on his hat with a bang that would have ruinously crushed it had it not been made of some glazed material that was evidently indestructible  going straight to the docks he gave orders to the carpenter to have all tight before next morningthis in a tone that the carpenter knew from experience meant fail if you dare  then he went up to the home and ordered his men and the russians to get ready for sea  thereafter he went away at full speed to cove with his red locks and his huge coattails flowing in the breeze  rapping at the door he was bid to enter  how are ee lad said haco to uncle john who was seated at the fireside smoking  thankee rather shaky  i must ha bin pretty nigh finished that night but i feel as if id be all taught and ready for sea in a few days  thats right said haco heartily  is gaff hereabouts today  the man in request entered at the moment  goodday skipper said gaff i seed ee comin  ony news  ay the coffin starts day arter tomorrow  i just run down to let you know  sink or swim fair or foul its up anchor with the first o the mornin ebb  im goin up to see capn bingley now  not a moment to spare  avast heavin said gaff pulling on a pilot coat im goin with ee  goin to jine the shipwrecked mariners society  since my last swim ive bin thinkin that three shillins a year is but a small sum and the good that theyd do to my widder and childer if i was drownded would be worth while havin  right lad right every sailor and fisherman should jine it  but come along no time for talkin here  my respects to the missus  goodbye lad  shaking hands with uncle john the restless skipper once more put on the imperishable hat with inconceivable violence and left the hut followed by his friend  returning to mr stuart we find him perusing the ambiguous letter  his first glance at the contents called forth a look of indignation which was succeeded by one of surprise and that was followed by a smile of contempt mingled with amusement  kenneth he said tossing the letter to his son who entered at the moment can you make anything of that  not much replied kenneth who at once guessed that it came from gaff the persons who left the child here would appear to be mad and anxious to get rid of their own offspring  but i came to tell you of sad forebodings that fill my breast father  dont give way to forebodings kenneth said the father gravely it is unmanly unreasonable  well suspicions if you think the word more appropriate  i fear much very much that my dear sister and poor tom graham were lost in the last storm  why do you omit the child asked mr stuart quietly almost coldly  i was thinking only of those whom i had known and loved when i spoke replied kenneth with some emotion  there is no certainty that they are lost observed mr stuart  kenneth thought there was a slight tremor in his fathers voice but on glancing at his stern features he felt that he must have been mistaken  we know that the ship was telegraphed as having been seen in the channel we have heard that they were passengers in her and nothing has been heard or seen of her since the night of the storm  there is no certainty in all that reiterated the other they may not have come in that vessel if they did some of them may have escaped  we cannot tell  mr stuart looked so cold and so sternly immovable as he said this while carelessly turning over some papers that kenneth who had come prepared to reveal all resolved to keep his secret believing that there was no pity left in his fathers breast  as he lay awake and sorrowing that night he heard his fathers step pacing to and fro incessantly during the whole night and hoped that the loss he had in all probability sustained would break up the ice but next morning at breakfast he was as cold as ever  he looked very pale indeed but he was sterner and even more irascible than usual in regard to the merest trifles so kenneths resolution not to confide in his father was confirmed    chapter twelve  the buster wills to accomplish mischief and gets into trouble  at seahow differently do human beings regard that phrase  to one it arouses feelings akin to rapture to another it is suggestive of heavings and horror  to him whose physical condition is easily and disagreeably affected by aquatic motion at sea savours of bad smells and misery  to him who sings of the intensity of his love for a ride on the fierce foaming bursting tide at sea sounds like the sweet ringing of a silver bell floating towards him as if from afar fraught with the fragrance and melody of distant climessuch as coral isles icy mountains and golden sands  let us regard the phrase in its pleasant aspect just now good reader  i have always loved the sea myself from the hour i first set foot on board a manofwar and skylarked with the middies to that sad and memorable day when under the strongi might almost say irresistible influence of my strongminded wife i bade adieu to the royal navy for ever and retired into private life  alas  but what is the use of sighing  if a man will get born in his wrong century he ought to lay his account with being obliged to suffer much from the strange i had almost said childish fallacies follies and inconsistencies peculiar to the more early period in which his lot has been cast by mistake  you see reader i have accepted my position  there is a bare possibility that those who have assigned it to me may be wrong but i have long ago ceased to dispute that point  at sea  hacos sloop is there now just out of sight of land although not far from it and resting on as glassy a sheet of water as is ever presented by the ocean in a deep dead calm  haco himself big hairy jovial ruddy is seated on the after skylight the sole occupant of the deck  to look at him one might fancy that neptune having found a deserted ship had clambered upon deck and sat him down to take a complacent view of his wide domains and enjoy a morning pipe  it is early morning and the other inhabitants of that floating house are asleep below  the coalcoffin albeit an unseaworthy vessel is a picturesque object  its dirty sails are of a fine rich colour because of their very dirtiness  its weatherworn and filthy spars and hull and rigging possess a harmony of tone which can only be acquired by age its cordage being rotten and very limp hangs on that account all the more gracefully in waving lines of beauty and elegant festoons the reef points hang quite straight and patter softly on the sailsin short the tout ensemble of the little craft is eminently picturesque draped as it were with the mellowness of antiquity and the whole hull spars sails cordage and reef pointsclearly and sharply reflected in the depths below  wot a splendid mornin said stephen gaff putting his head and shoulders out of the after hatchway and yawning violently  so tis shipmet responded the skipper amost too butiful for this world  both men spoke in subdued tones as if unwilling to disturb the delightful stillness of nature  gaff having slowly raised himself out of the hole in the deck which served as a door to the bandbox termed out of courtesy the cabin looked up at the masthead to see if the vane indicated any wind then he gazed slowly round the horizon meeting with nothing particular there to arrest his eyes he let them fall on haco who was gazing dreamily at the bowl of his german pipe  dead calm said gaff  wont last long said haco  wont it  no  glass fallin fast  this seemed to be as much mental food as gaff could comfortably digest at that time for he made no rejoinder but drawing a short black pipe from his vestpocket sat down beside his friend and filled and smoked it in silence  hows the roosians he inquired after a long pause  all square said the skipper who was addicted somewhat to figurative language and hyperbole in the form of slang another week in the doctors hands an the grub of the london home will set em up taught an trim as ever  goin to blow hard think ee asked gaff  great guns said haco puffing a cloud of smoke from his mouth which was at that time not a bad imitation of a little gun  soon inquired gaff  praps yes praps no  once more the seamen relapsed into a silence which was not again broken until two of the crew and several russians came on deck  haco gave orders to have the topsail reefed and then commencing to pace to and fro on the small deck devoted himself entirely to smoke and meditation  soon after there was a loud cheer from billy gaff  the buster had suddenly awakened from an unbroken sleep of twelve hours tumbled incontinently out of his berth rushed up the ladder thrust his head above the hatchway and feeling the sweet influences of that lovely morning vented his joy in the cheer referred to  billy had begged hard to be taken to london and his father thinking that the sooner he began the seafaring life to which he was destined the better had consented to take him  billy willed to accomplish a great number of pieces of mischief during the five minutes which he spent in gazing breathlessly round the ship and out upon the glittering sea but he was surrounded by so many distracting novelties and the opportunities for mischief were so innumerable that for the first time in his life he felt perplexed and absolutely failed to accomplish anything for a considerable time  this calm however like the calm of nature was not destined to last long  daddy said the cherub suddenly im agoin up the shrouds  very good my lad said gaff yell tumble down likely but it dont much matter  billy clambered up the side and seized the shrouds but missing his foothold at the first step he fell down sittingwise from a height of three feet  there was a sounding thud on the deck followed by a sharp gasp and the boy sat staring before him considering apparently whether it were necessary or not to cry in order to relieve his feelings  finding that it was not he swallowed his heart with an effort got up and tried it again  the second effort was more successful  thatll do lad come down said gaff when his son had got halfway up the mast and paused to look down with a halffrightened expression  contrary to all precedent billy came down and remained quiet for ten minutes  then he willed to go out on the bowsprit but being observed in a position of great danger thereon was summarily collared by a sailor and hauled inboard  he was about to hurl defiance in the teeth of the seaman and make a second effort on the bowsprit when haco barepoles thrust his red head up the afterhatch and sang outbreakfast  breakfast billy repeated gaff  to which the cherub responded by rushing aft with a cheer and descending the square hole after his father  having been horribly seasick the first day of his voyage and having now quite recovered billy was proportionably ravenous and it was a long time before he ceased to demand and redemand supplies of biscuit butter and tea  with appetite appeased at last however he returned to the deck and allowing quarter of an hour for digestion and reflection began to consider what should next be done  the opportunity for some bold stroke was a rare one for the crew consisting of five men and a boy were all forward earnestly endeavouring to pick acquaintance by means of signs with the convalescent russians while gaff and haco were still below at breakfast so that billy had the after part of the sloop all to himself  he began operations by attempting to get at the needle of the compass but finding that this was secured powerfully by means of glass and brass he changed his mind and devoted himself heart and soul to the wheel  turning it round until the helm was hard down he looked up at the sails and with some curiosity awaited the result but the vessel having no motion no result followed  failing in this he forced the wheel round with all his might and let it go suddenly so that it spun round with the recoil and narrowly missed knocking him down  this was a pleasant source of amusement uniting as it did considerable effort and some danger with the prospect of a smash in some of the steering tackle so billy prepared to indulge himself but it struck him that the frequent recurrence of the accompanying noise would bring the skipper on deck and spoil the fun so on second thoughts he desisted and glanced eagerly about for something else afraid that the golden opportunity would pass by unimproved  observing something like a handle projecting from a hole he seized it and hauled out a large wooden reel with a logline on it  with this he at once began to play dipping the log into the sea and hauling it up repeatedly as though he were fishing but there was want of variety in this  looking about him he espied a leadline near the binnacle he cut the lead from this and fastening it to the end of the logline began forthwith to take deepsea soundings  this was quite to his taste for when he stood upon the vessels side in order to let the line run more freely and held up the reel with both hands the way in which it spun round was quite refreshing to his happy spirit  there must have been a hitch in the line however for it was suddenly checked in its uncoiling and the violence of the stoppage wrenched the reel from his grasp and the whole affair disappeared beneath the calm water  the busters heart smote him  he had not meant anything so wicked as that  ha you young rascal i saw you said one of the men coming up at that moment  billy turned round with a start and in doing so fell headlong into the sea  the sailor stood aghast as if paralysed for a moment thenas billy rose to the surface with outstretched hands and staring eyes and uttered a yell which was suddenly quenched in a gurgling cryhe recovered himself and hastily threw a coil of rope towards the boy  now it is a curious and quite unaccountable fact that comparatively few sailors can swim  at all events no one can deny the fact that there are hundreds ay thousands of our seafaring men and boys who could not swim six yards to save their lives  strange to say of all the men who stood on the deck of that sloop at the time of the accident to billy russians included not one could swim a stroke  the result was that they rushed to the stern of the vessel and gazed anxiously over the side some shouting one thing and some another but not one venturing to jump overboard because it was as much as his life was worth to do so  several ropes were instantly thrown over the drowning boy but being blinded both by terror and salt water he did not see them  then one of the men hastily fastened the end of a line round his waist intending to spring over and trust to his comrades hauling him on board  at the same moment several men rushed to the stern boat intent on lowering her all this occurred in a few brief seconds  billy had risen a second time with another wild cry when his father and the skipper sprang up the afterhatch and rushed to the side  haco dashed his indestructible hat on the deck and had his coat almost off when gaff went overboard head first hat coat and all like an arrow and caught billy by the hair when he was about four feet below the surface  of course gaffs reappearance with his son in his arms was greeted with heartfelt and vociferous cheers and of course when they were hauled on board and gaff handed billy to the skipper in order that he might the more conveniently wring a little of the superabundant water from his garments another and a still more hearty cheer was given but gaff checked it rather abruptly by raising himself and saying sternly  shame on you lads for not bein able to swim  the child might ha drownded for all you could do to help him  a soldier as dont know how to shoot is not much wuss than a sailor as dont know how to swim why yer own mothersyer own sweetheartsmight be adrownin afore yer eyes an youd have to run up an down like helpless noodles not darin to take to the water which ought to be your native element any more than a bluenosed kangaroo  shame on ye i say for not bein able to swim  amen to that say i observed haco with emphasis  shame on stout hulkin fellers like you for not bein able to swim and shame on them as steers the ship o state for not teachin ye  you can put that in yer pipes and smoke it lads an if it dont smoke well ye can make a quid of it and chew it  if i could make quids o them there sentiments id set up a factory an send a inexhaustible supply to the bigwigs in parlymint for perpetooal mastication  there now dont stare but go forard an see two of you take in another reef o the mainsl  if the glass speaks true well be under my namesake barepolesbefore long look alive boys  it was something new to the crew of the coalcoffin to be thus checked in an enthusiastic cheer and to be rebuked by the object of their admiration for not being able to swim  deep and long was the discussion they had that evening around the windlass on this subject  some held that it was absurd to blame men for not being able when praps they couldnt if they wor to try  others thought that they might have tried first before saying that praps they couldnt  one admitted that it was nothing but laziness that had prevented him from learning whereupon another opined that dirtiness had something to do with it too  but all agreed in wishing earnestly that they had learned the noble and useful art and in regretting deeply that they had not been taught it when young  the boy who formed one of the crew silently congratulated himself that he was young and resolved in his own mind that he would learn as soon as possible  the sun set in the west and the evening star arose to cheer the world with her presence while the greater luminary retired  slowly the day retreated and dusky night came on  one by one the stars shone out faintly at first as if too modest to do more than glimmer but stronger and brighter and more numerous by degrees until the whole sky became like a great resplendent milky way  still there was no evidence that a doublereef in the mainsail was necessary no indication that the weatherglass had told a truthful tale    chapter thirteen  the storm and its consequences  it came at length with awful speed and fury  at first there was a stifling heat in the atmosphere then clouds began to dim the sky  mysterious and solemn changes seemed to be taking place in naturenoiselessly for a time  ere long the war began with a burst of heavens artillery  it was distant at first muttering prolonged and fitful like the rattling musketry of advancing skirmishers  soon a roar of deafening thunder rent the sky  another and another followed with blinding flashes of lightning between while rain came down in torrents  the order had been given to take in the mainsail and the little vessel was almost under bare poles when the storm burst upon it and threw it nearly on its beamends  righting from the first shock it sprang away like a living creature trying to escape from some deadly foe  ere long the waves were up and the storm was raging in all its fury  if it holds like this till tomorrow well be in port by noon said haco barepoles to gaff as they stood near the wheel holding on to the backstays and turning their backs to the seas that swept heavily over the side from time to time  you speak as if you wor sure o gettin in said gaff  well we ant sure o nothin in this world replied the skipper if providence has willed it otherwise we cant help it you know  we must submit whether we will or no  dye know rejoined gaff it has often bin in my mind that as christian men which we profess to be whether we believe our own profession or not we dont look at gods will in the right way  the devil himself is obliged to submit to god whether he will or no because he cant help it  dont ee think it would be more like christians if we was to submit because it is his will  before haco could answer an enormous wave came curling over the stern  mind your helm lad  the words were scarce uttered when a heavy mass of water fell inboard almost crushing down the deck  for some moments it seemed as if the little vessel were sinking but she cleared herself and again rushed onward  that night the wind chopped round and haco was obliged to layto until daylight as the weather was thick  before morning the gale took off and at sunrise had moderated into a stiff breeze  all that day they beat slowly and heavily against the wind which however continued to decrease  at night the wind again veered round to the northward enabling the coalcoffin to spread most of her canvass keep her course and bowl pleasantly along before the breeze  but the weather was still thick necessitating a sharp lookout  during most of this time our friend billy was confined much against his will to the bandbox cabin where he did as much mischief as he could in the circumstances  towards midnight while haco and gaff were standing by the man on the lookout who was on the heel of the bowsprit they fancied they observed something looming up against the dark sky on the weather bow  the lookout gave a shout  port port hard aport roared the skipper at the same moment bounding aft  port it is replied the man at the wheel obeying with promptitude  the sloop sheered away to leeward  at the same instant the hull of a great vessel bore right down upon them  the yell of the steamwhistle betrayed her character while the clanging of the fogbell and shouts of those on board proved that the sloop had been observed  at the same time the seething sea that flowed like milk round her bow showed that the engines had been reversed while the captains voice was heard distinctly to shout starboard starboard hard to the steersman  the promptitude with which these orders were given and obeyed prevented the steamer from running down the sloop altogether  a collision however was unavoidable  the crew of the sloop and the russians seeing this rushed to the place where they expected to be struck in order to leap if possible into the head of the steamer  even the steersman left his post and sprang into the weather shrouds in the hope of catching some of the ropes or chains below the bowsprit  on came the steamer like a great mountain  her way had been so much checked that she seemed merely to touch the side of the sloop but the touch was no light one  it sent the cutwater crashing through bulwark plank and beam until the coalcoffin was cut right down amidships within a foot of the waterline  there was a wild cry from the men as they leaped towards their destroyer  some succeeded in grasping ropes others missed and fell back bruised and stunned on the sloops deck  billy had been standing beside his father when the steamer was first observed and naturally clung to him  gaff put his left arm tight round the boy and with the others prepared for a spring believing as did all the rest that the sloop would be sunk at once  not so haco barepoles who went to the wheel of his little vessel and calmly awaited the result  gaffs spring at the chains of the cutwater was successful but in making it he received a blow on the head from one of the swinging blocks of the sloop which almost stunned him insomuch that he could only cling to the chain he had caught with the tenacity of despair  one of the sailors observed him in this position of danger and instantly descending with a rope fastened it under his chest so that he and billy were safely hauled on board and the former was led below to have his head examined by the surgeon  meanwhile the men in the bow of the steamer shouted to haco to come on board  no thankee replied the skipper shake yourself clear o my riggin as fast as ye can and let me continoo my voyage  your sloop is sinking urged the captain of the steamer  not sinkin yet ill stick to her as long as she can float  but youve none of your men left on board have you  no better without em if theyre so easy frightened  as he said this one of his own men slid quickly down a rope that hung from the steamers bowsprit and dropt on the deck of the sloop exclaiming  itll never be said o tom grattan that he forsack his ship so long as a man wos willin to stick by her  haco took tom by the hand as he went aft and shook it  any more comin he said glancing at the faces of the men that stared down upon him  there was no reply  you cant expect men to volunteer to go to the bottom said the captain of the steamer  youre mad both of you  think better of it  back your ship off sir said haco in a deep stern voice  the order was given to back off and the vessels were soon clear  haco put his sloop at once on the larboard tack and looking over the side observed that the bottom of the yawning gap was thus raised nearly three feet out of the water  tom said he resuming his place at the wheel go and nail a bit of canvas over that hole  youll find materials down below  well have to steer into port on this tack cause if we try to go on the other shell sink like a stone  i only hope the windll hold as it is  look alive now  in a few minutes the little craft was away and the captain of the steamer seeing that she did not sink continued his course  next day haco barepoles steered the coalcoffin triumphantly into the port of london with a hole in her side big enough if tom grattans report is to be believed to admit of a punt bein rowd drect from the sea into the hold    chapter fourteen  gaff and billy become the sport of fortune and see strange things  the steamer which had run down the sloop of haco barepoles was a large iron one which had just set out on a voyage to the west indies  being anxious to send on shore the men whom he had so unexpectedly picked up at sea the captain hailed the first inwardbound vessel he met with and put them on board  it was found however that the blow received by stephen gaff had been more severe than was at first imagined and the doctor advised that he should not be moved until farther down the channel  he and billy were therefore retained on board but when the steamer passed the isle of wight the weather became thick and squally and continued so for several days so that no vessel could be spoken with  in these circumstances the captain was compelled to carry gaff and his boy away to sea much to the regret of the former who was curious to know what the news could be that was to be to his advantage in london besides being grieved at the anxiety his sudden disappearance with billy would cause to his wife  the buster did not by any means share the regret or grief of his father  to that amiable cherub the whole affair was a piece of unexpected and unparalleled good fortune  it was the realisation to some extent of his rapturous dreams of travel and adventure in foreign lands and it freed him at one fell swoop from the iron yoke of his mother  billy although he congratulated himself on the deliverance did strange to say shed a few tears in memory of his mother for the boy had an affectionate disposition and really loved his mother and would have shown his love too if she would have let him  gaff feared there was but little prospect of being speedily delivered from the steamer nevertheless he begged the captain to put him on board the first homewardbound vessel they should meet with  to this request the captain agreed  an opportunity occurred sooner than had been expected  on the afternoon of the fifth day out a large barque hove in sight  on nearing this vessel the captain ran up his colours and the signal was replied to by the union jack  on being asked as to where they were bound the port of liverpool was signalled in answer  youre in luck  gaff said the captain ill put you on board of that barque if you choose  thank ee sir id like it well  i rather think that your little boy would prefer to go with us added the captain laughing  billy at once admitted that he would and begged to be allowed to stay where he was but this request could not be granted  now gaff said the captain confidentially if youre short o cash ill be happy to  thankee sir ive as much as i require  very well then youd better get ready and ill order a boat to be lowered  half an hour afterwards gaff stood on the deck of the barque waving his hat to the few friends he had made during his short stay in the steamer  the barque turned out to be a south sea whaler from new york which had suffered severely in a recent gale which had driven her far out of her course to the northward  she was obliged to run to liverpool for repairs  the captain whose name was graddy and who was one of the most illfavoured and illmannered men that gaff had ever set eyes on agreed to take the newcomer to england on condition that he should work his way besides paying for his rations  there was something about this vessel which was very offensive to the critical eye of gaff  the nature of her work might account for her being so dirty but that was no reason for the slovenliness of her rigging and general management the surliness and tyranny of her captain and the semimutinous condition of her crew  the crew was a mixed one  there seemed to be representatives of at least half a dozen nations  the captain himself was of mixed blood and no one could have told from his look or speech to what nation he belonged  he was a big powerful man much feared by the crew who hated him cordially  he was well aware of this and returned the hatred with interest  besides this being monarch of the ship he worried them in every way that lay in his power  it is awful to think of the ruinous effects of sin and how nearly men can come to resemble devils  this monster actually laid plots to entrap his men in order that he might have an excuse to vent his hatred on them  gaff soon found that he had got into a nest so to speak of evil spirits  before he had been two days with them he would have given all he possessed or ever hoped to possess in order to escape from the rattlesnake which was the vessels name  as for billy his heart sank to a depth of woe he had never hitherto conceived of  every one kicked and cuffed him and swore at him for being in the way and when he was wanted he was kicked cuffed and sworn at for being out of the way  poor boy his dreams had never presented him with this species of adventure  so bad did the state of things become that the men began to talk among themselves of deserting the moment they should reach port no matter what should be the consequences  this threat reached the captains ears and he frustrated it by telling the mate that he thought the needful repairs could be managed on board by the ships carpenters and so gave orders to alter the course for south america  deep and fierce were the counsels that went on in the forecastle that night among the men  some hinted darkly at murder  others suggested that the captain should be put on shore on a desert island and left to his fate  all agreed that something must be done that a decisive blow must be struck with the exception of gaff who remained silent while his shipmates were discussing the matter  observing this they called upon him for his opinion  lads said he in decided tones ive got no opinion to offer  i am at least i strive to bea christian man an to be plain with ye i wont go for to consult or act with murderers or mutineers or pirates which it appears you intend to become if youre not that aready  one opinion i will give ye however an one piece of advice ill offer the opinion is that if you go on as youve bin agoin on since i came aboard youll all live to be hanged  the advice is that you should face yer troubles like mentake things as ye find em an if ye cant mend em why grin and bear em  the crew received this in varied mood  some laughed others swore and one suggested that gaff should be thrown overboard  this latter who was a big strong man and a sort of bully among his mates shook his fist at gaff and said  now ill tell ye wot it is mister toogood if you go for to tell the capn wot weve bin atalkin about ill knock yer two daylights into one so see that ye keep yer tongue in order  whats past is past said gaff quietly but i tell ye plainly that if you let your tongues go the same pace again in my hearin ill go aft and report ye  ill be no spy but i give ye fair warnin  at this the bully lost command of himself  seizing an iron bar that lay on a chest close by he rushed at gaff with the evident intention of felling him  but the latter was on his guard  he was active and powerful too besides being quite cool  leaping nimbly aside he avoided the bullys onset and at the same moment laid him flat on the deck with one blow of his fist  sarves him right  so it does exclaimed several of the men who were not sorry to see one whom they disliked so roughly handled  well so it does sarve him right added one who had been a prominent speaker in the recent debates but harkee friend he said turning to gaff with a scowl you cant knock the whole crew down in that fashion  i advise ye for your own sake to mind what yere about  i means to do so said gaff ill stick to my dooty and to the capn  very good replied the other with a sneer then wotiver is the capns fate youll have the pleasure of sharin it with him  tumble up there tumble up an reef topsls roared the captain down the hatch at that moment  the men obeyed and for the time their mutinous intentions seemed to have been dismissed  for many weeks after this gaff heard nothing that could lead him to suppose that the men still harboured their dark designs  yet the state of affairs on board became worse and worse  the captain cursed and tyrannised more than ever and the men grew sulkier and more wretched but no word of a murderous nature was ever uttered in the hearing of gaff or his little son  as for billy his small mind had received such a rude shock by the sudden and terrible change in his circumstances that he seemed to have lost all his wonted vivacity as well as his mischief  in fact both qualities or tendencies had been thoroughly kicked out of him before he had been a week on board  he was protected to some extent by his father who one day quietly knocked another of the men down for giving billy an undeserved beating but some of them kicked and cuffed the poor boy when his father was not present  billy was found to be active and useful in small matters and light duties suited to his age and in the course of time was appointed to the position of stewards assistant in which capacity he became deeply learned in the matter of washing cups dishes etcetera besides acquiring a knowledge of baking puddingmaking and many other useful arts more or less allied to cookery in addition to which he had the inestimable benefit of being taught thoroughly submission and obediencea lesson which the buster found very hard to learn and thought particularly grievous but which at his age and considering his previous training was an absolute blessing  the way in which that cherub went about that ship in a little blue jacket straw hat and canvas trousers rubbing and cleaning and according prompt obedience at all times to every one would have charmed his mother as much as it gratified his father who was in consequence somewhat reconciled to his otherwise hard lot  now philosophical readerif such you bedo not suppose that i advocate kicking and cuffing as the best possible cure for general mischievousness and badness in a boy  by no means  my strongminded wife says i do but then she always forms or rather partially forms her opinions on assumptions retains them in confusion states them at haphazard according to her mood at the time being and having stated them sticks to them like a limpet to a rock  you will judge differently when i explain my ideas on this point  i maintain that billy gaff alias the buster was taught to accord obediencesimple obedience and nothing elseby means of the kicking and cuffing he received on board of that whaler and further that the method is a sure one  i do not say that it is the best one but that does not affect the fact that it is almost infallible  it was reserved for billys father however by means of wise counsels kindly given advice and otherwise affectionate treatment to save billy from being turned into an obedient but misanthropic brute and to lead him to accord his obedience not because he could not help it but because his father wished him to do it  this appeal went right home to billys heart because he loved his father fervently  he had always loved him in time past now more than ever for the poor boy regarded him much as a drowning man regards the solitary plank to which he clings as his last hope  thus did billy practically learn the great truth that love is the fulfilling of the law  weeks rolled on gales succeeded calms and calms succeeded gales  the line was passed southern seas were reached new constellations glittered overhead strange fish and luminous creatures gambolled in the sea and the whalers fishingground was entered  latterly the men had ceased to grumble at the captain although he had by no means ceased to swear at and bully the men and gaff began to hope that they had got over their bad fit and were going to settle down to work peaceably  the calm however was deceitful it preceded a storm  one sultry afternoon when gaff was standing at the helm and the captain beside him the men came aft in a body and two of their number with pistols in their hands advanced to seize the captain  he saw at once what they meant to do and springing back seized a handspike  lay that down and surrender else ill blow out yer brains said one of the two levelling his pistol  instead of obeying the captain raised the heavy handspike and the man pulled the trigger  at the same instant gaff struck up the muzzle with his hand the ball passed over the captains head and the handspike descended on the seamans crown felling him at once  upon this the entire crew made a rush and overpowered gaff and the captain  the latter who struggled with the fury of a tiger was kicked while down until he was nearly dead  gaff at once gave in knowing that any attempt at further resistance besides being hopeless would only render matters worse  he was therefore allowed to rise and his hands were tied behind his back  the captain being similarly secured was raised to his feet  now you tyrant said the ringleader of the crew with a terrible oath how would you like to have your throat cut  the man slowly opened a long claspknife as he spoke and felt its keen edge with his thumb  blood was flowing down his face and breast from the wound inflicted by the handspike and the fiendish expression of his countenance added to the terribleness of his aspect while it showed that his sarcastic question would certainly be followed by the murderous deed  but the other mutineers restrained him  its too good for him make him walk the plank and drown like a dogas he is cried one  hang him up to the yardarm said another  several voices here expressed dissent and an elderly seaman stepped forward and said that they didnt intend to become pirates so they had better not begin with murder  hear hear from several voices emphatically  whatll we do with him then inquired one in angry excitement  upon this they all began to consult noisily and they were so much engrossed that they failed to perceive the movements of billy who when his first alarm at the uproar was over began to feel deep anxiety in regard to his fathers bound and helpless condition  his active mind did not remain long paralysed pulling out the claspknife which he always carried in his pocket he quickly cut the cords that fastened gaffs wrists  before the latter could avail himself of his freedom the act was discovered and he was secured again more firmly than before while billy was favoured with a slap on the ear so tremendous that it threw all those he had ever received from his mother utterly into the shade  recovering from this he sat down on the deck at his fathers feet and wept silently  in a few minutes the mutineers agreed among themselves  one of the smallest boats in the ship was lowered and the captain and gaff having been cast loose were ordered to get into it  the former obeyed at once pronouncing a terrible curse on the crew as he went down the side  one of the men at the same time threw a bag of biscuit into the boat  come along billy said gaff as he followed the captain  the boy was about to do so when one of the men seized him and pulled him back  no no said he the lads useful and will only eat up your biscuit faster than need be  well keep him aboard  gaff listened to this with an expression of agony on his rugged features  oh have mercy on my son he cried as they cast the boat adrift then feeling that an appeal to such desperadoes was useless he clasped his hands and looking up to heaven prayed god for christs sake to deliver him from the company of sinful men  a light breeze was blowing and the ship which had been hoveto while the boat was being lowered soon gathered way and left the boat behind  all of a sudden billy broke away and rushing towards the stern sprang wildly into the sea  down with the helm heaveto shouted some of the men  no no let the whelp go cried others besides hed be able to peach on us  this last argument was allpowerful  the ship held on her course and billy was left to his fate  the moment that gaff saw him take the leap he seized the oars and applying all his strength to them succeeded in catching hold of his son before his struggles had ceased  billy was none the worse for his adventure beyond the ducking  gaff soon wrung the water out of his garments and then placing him on his knee sat down to watch the ship as it sailed slowly away  the captain who sat in the stern with his chin resting in his hand and a dark scowl on his face also watched the retreating vessel  soon it glimmered like the wing of a seamew on the horizon and then just as night began to set in it disappeared leaving the boat a solitary speck in the midst of the great wide sea    chapter fifteen  the dinner partya sudden piece of questionable good fortune befalls mrs gaff  it is a most unfortunate piece of good fortune this that has befallen mrs gaff said mr george stuart a very unfortunate thing indeed  dear me do you think so  now i dont agree with you at all brother observed miss peppy  i think that good fortune is always good fortune and never can be bad fortune  i wish it would only come to me sometimes but it never does and when it does it never remains long only think how shell flaunt about now with a coachandfour perhaps and such like  i really think that fortune made a mistake in this case for she has been used to such mean ways not that i mean anything bad by mean you know but only low and common including food and domestic habits as well as society thatthatdear me i dont exactly know how to express myself but its a puzzle to me to know how shell ever come to be able to spend it all indeed it is  i wonder why we are subjected to such surprises so constantly and then its so perplexing too because one will never be able to remember that shes not a fisherwoman as she used to be and will call her jessie in spite of onesself and how it ever came about thats another puzzle  but after all there is no accounting for the surprising way in which things do come about dear me in this altogether unaccountable world  take a little more soup captain bingley  the above observations were made by miss peppy and my friend stuart from the head and foot respectively of their dinnertable around which were assembled my wife my niece lizzie gordon an elderly spinster named miss eve flouncer a miss martha puff niece to miss flouncer a baronet named sir richard doles my son gildart and kenneth stuart  i was seated beside miss peppy opposite to sir richard doles who was one of the slowest dullest stupidest men i ever met with  he appeared to me to have been born without any intellect  when he told a story there was no end to it indeed there seldom was anything worthy the name of a beginning to it and it never by the remotest chance had any point  in virtue of his rank not his capacity of course sir richard was in great demand in wreckumoft  he was chairman at every public meeting honorary member of every society a director in the bank the insurance company the railway the poorhouse and the sailors home in all of which positions and institutions he was a positive nuisance because of his insane determination to speak as long as possible when he had not the remotest notion of what he wished to say so that business was in his presence brought almost to a dead lock  yet sir richard was tolerated nay courted and toadied because of his title  my wife was seated opposite to miss eve flouncer who was one of the strongminded women  indeed i think it is but just to say of her that she was one of the strongestminded women in the town  in her presence the strength of mrs bingleys mind dwindled down to comparative weakness  in form she was swanlike undulatory so to speak  her features were prononce nose aquiline eyes piercing hair black as night and in long ringlets  miss flouncer was as i have said an elderly spinster  sir richard was an elderly bachelor  miss flouncer thought of this and often sighed sir richard didnt think of it and never sighed except when having finished a good dinner he felt that he could eat no more  by the way he also sighed at philanthropic meetings when cases of distress were related such as sudden bereavement coupled perhaps with sickness and deep poverty  but sir richards sighs were all his contributions to the cause of suffering humanity  sometimes indeed he gave it his blessing though it would have puzzled the deepest philosopher to have said what that consisted in but he never gave it his prayers for this reason that he never prayed for himself or anybody else  he held that this world was in a sufficiently satisfactory condition and advised that men should let well alone and contended that any attempt to interfere with its arrangements in the way of prayer was quite indefensible  he did indeed read his prayers in church on sundays in a very loud and distinct voice to the great annoyance and distraction not to say irritation of all who sat within fifty yards of him but this he regarded as a commendable institution of the country  but to return to miss flouncer  this state of affairs between sir richard and herself did not augur much for her prospects but then she was a very strongminded woman and had hopes whereas sir richard was a very weakminded man and had no hopes of any kind worth mentioning being perfectly satisfiedgood easy manwith things as they then stood  miss martha puff was niece to miss flouncerage apparently sixteen  it struck me as i sat looking at her placid face that this young lady was well named  her pink round visage was puffed up with something so soft that i could scarcely venture to call it fat  her round soft arms were so puffy to look at that one could not help fearing that an accidental prick from a pin would burst the skin and let them out  she seemed so like trifle in her pink muslin dress that i could imagine a puff of wind blowing her away altogether  she could not be said to be puffed up with conceit poor girl but she dined almost exclusively on puff paste to the evident satisfaction of my gallant son gildart who paid her marked attention during dinner  miss puff never spoke except when spoken to never asked for anything never remarked upon anything did not seem to care for anything puff paste excepted and never thought of anything as far as i could judge from the expression of her countenance  gildart might as well have had a wax doll to entertain  to what unfortunate piece of good fortune does your brother refer miss stuart asked sir richard when miss peppy had concluded her observations in regard to it  is it possible that you have not heard of it exclaimed miss peppy in surprise  why the town has been ringing with it for a fortnight at least and those odious creatures the gossips who never come near me however because they know i will not tolerate them have got up all sorts of wild stories showing that the man must have got the money by foul means though i dont know im sure why he shouldnt have got a surprise as well as anybody else for the unaccountable and astonishing way in which things do happen in this world at least to human beings for i do not believe that cows or sheep or horses ever experience them the want of expression on their faces shows that at all events they never leave their offspring at peoples doors and then go away without  youd better tell sir richard what piece of news you refer to my dear interrupted mr stuart somewhat testily  ah yes i was forgettinga little more fowl captain bingley  may i trouble you again sir richard thank youa leg if you please i know that the captain prefers a legwell as i was sayinglet me see what was i saying  you had only got the length of forgetting maam observed the baronet  ah to be sure i was forgetting to tell you that mrs gaff has fallen heir to ten thousand pounds  sir richard exclaimed with an appearance of what might have been mistaken for surprise on his face indeed  miss flouncer to whom the news was also fresh exclaimed you dont say so with strong emphasis and an immensely swanlike undulation of her body  indeed i do continued miss peppy with much animation mrs gaff the fishermans wife has got a fortune left her amounting to ten thousand pounds which at five per something or other as my brother tells me yields an annual income of 500 pounds  but who left it to her and how asked sir richard  ah who left it and how echoed miss flouncer  what a jolly thing to be left five hundred a year whispered gildart wouldnt you like some one to leave that to you miss puff  yes said miss puff  have you any rich east indian uncle or aunt who is likely to do it inquired gildart with a desperate attempt at jocularity  no answered miss puff  these two wordsyes and nowere the utmost extent to which miss puff had yet ventured into the dreaded sea of conversation  i could perceive by the fagged expression of his face that the middy was beginning to lose heart  brother said miss peppy you had better tell sir richard how it happened  i have such a memoryi really dont remember the details i never could remember details of anything  indeed i have often wondered why details were sent into this world to worry one so  it is so surprising and unaccountable  surely we might have got on quite well without them  well you know observed gildart in a burst of reckless humour we could not get on very well miss stuart without some sorts of details oxtails for instance are absolutely necessary to the soup which we have just enjoyed so much  so in like manner are pigtails to chinamen  ay and coattails to puppies added kenneth slyly alluding to a bran new garment which the middy had mounted that day for the first time  perhaps interposed miss flouncer after such bright coruscations of wit mr stuart may be allowed to go on with his  wittles whispered gildart in miss puffs ear to the alarm of that young lady who being addicted to suppressed laughter was in horror lest she should have a fit  allowed to go on repeated miss flouncer blandly with his tale of this unfortunate piece of good fortune which i am sure sir richard is dying to hear  it can hardly be called a tale said mr stuart but it is a curious enough circumstance  you remember stephen gaff sir richard  perfectly  he is the man who appeared in the village of cove rather mysteriously some months ago is he not  the same returned mr stuart and it was he who accompanied haco barepoles in my sloop which he persists in naming the coffin although its proper name is the betsy jane on that memorable voyage when haco sailed her into port on the larboard tack after she had been cut down to the waters edge on the starboard side  well it seems that gaff went with him on that occasion in consequence of having received a letter from a london lawyer asking him to call and he would hear something to his advantage  you all know the way in which the people were taken out of the sloop by the steamer which ran into her and how they were all landed safely except gaff and his son william who were carried away to sea  you are aware also that the steamer has since then returned to england telling us that gaff and his boy were put on board a barque bound for liverpool and that this vessel has never made its appearance so that we have reason to believe that it has perished in one of the great storms which occurred about that time  well continued mr stuart helping mrs bingley to a glass of sherry not long ago i had occasion to send haco barepoles to london and he bethought him of the lawyer who had written to gaff so he called on him and told him of his friends disappearance  the lawyer then asked if gaffs wife was alive and on being informed that she was he told haco that gaff had had a brother in australia who had been a very successful gold digger but whose health had broken down owing to the severity of the work and he had left the diggings and gone to melbourne where he died  before his death this brother made a will leaving the whole of his fortune to stephen  the will stated that in the event of stephen being dead or at sea on a long voyage the money should be handed over unconditionally to his wife  about three weeks ago the lawyer came here to see mrs gaff and make arrangements and inquiries and in the course of a short time this poor woman will be in possession of ten thousand pounds  it will be the ruin of her i fear said sir richard  no doubt of it observed miss flouncer emphatically  it is always the way said my wife  dye think it would ruin you whispered gildart  this being an impertinent question miss puff blushed and made no reply  you need not be at all afraid of mrs gaff being ruined by prosperity said lizzie gordon with sudden animation  i have seen a good deal of her during her recent sorrows and i am quite sure that she is a good sensible woman  what sorrows do you refer to miss gordon asked sir richard  to her husband and sons sudden disappearance and the death of her brotherinlaw john furby replied lizzie  uncle you can tell more about the matter than i can  yes said i it has been my lot to witness a good many cases of distress in my capacity of agent for the shipwrecked mariners society and i can answer for it that this has been a very severe one and the poor woman has borne up against it with christian fortitude  how did it happen  pray do tell us about it cried miss flouncer with an undulating smile  how does it happen miss flouncer that you are not already acquainted with these things  because i have been absent from home for more than two months and if i mistake not sir richards ignorance rests on somewhat similar foundation  miss flouncer smiled and undulated towards the baronet who being thus pointedly appealed to smiled and bowed in return and begged that i would relate the facts of the case  i observed that my son gildart pressed miss puff to attempt another tart and whispered something impertinent in her ear for the poor things pink round face suddenly became scarlet and she puffed out in a dangerously explosive manner with suppressed laughter  well then said i addressing myself to miss flouncer a month or so before the lawyer brought mrs gaff tidings of her good fortune her brotherinlaw john furby was drowned  the brave fellow who you are aware was coxswain of our lifeboat and has helped to save many a life since he was appointed to that post of danger went off in his own fishingboat one day  a squall upset the boat and although the accident was seen from the shore and several boats put off at once to the rescue four of the crew perished and furby was one of these  the scene in gaffs cottage when the body was carried in and laid on the bed was heartrending for the woe occasioned to poor mrs gaff by the recent loss of her husband and little boy was as it were poured upon her head afresh and for some time she was inconsolable  my good niece went frequently to read the bible and pray with her and i believe it was the blessed influence of gods word that brought her at length to a state of calm resignation  what made her case worse was the fact that both husband and brotherinlaw being taken away she was left in a state of absolute destitution  now at this point she began to feel the value of the noble institution of which i have the happiness of being an honorary agenti mean the shipwrecked fishermen and mariners society  poor furby had been a member for several years and regularly paid his annual sum of three shillings  stephen gaff had also become a member just before starting on his last voyage having been persuaded thereto by haco barepoles who is a stanch adherent and advocate of our cause  many a sailor has haco brought to me to enrol as a member and many a widow and fatherless child has had occasion to thank god that he did so  although gaff had only paid his first years contribution of three shillings i took upon me to give the sum of 5 pounds to mrs gaff and her little girl and the further sum of 3 pounds because of furbys membership  this sum was quite sufficient to relieve her from want at the time so that in the midst of her deep affliction she was spared the additional pains and anxieties of destitution  the society is a most noble one said miss flouncer with a burst of enthusiasm  it is said i much pleased with her warmth of manner i thinkat least if my memory does not play me falseyou are a contributor to its funds are you not  well ano  i have not the pleasurea  miss flouncer was evidently a little put out  then i trust my dear madam said i hasting to her relief by affording her an opportunity of being generous that you will allow me to put down your name as an annual subscriber  miss flouncer being a very strongminded woman had recovered herself very suddenly and replied with calm deliberation accompanied by an undulation  no captain bingley i have made it a rule never to give charity from impulse i always give when i do give  ahem coughed gildart slightly  when i do give repeated miss flouncer from principle and after a careful examination of the merits of each particular case  indeed said sir richard with an appearance of faint surprise what a bore you must find the examination of the cases  by no means sir richard  very little time suffices for each case for many of them i find almost intuitively merit dismissal on the spot and i assure you it saves a great deal of money  you would be surprised if you knew how little i find it necessary to give away in charity in the course of the year  miss flouncer undulated at sir richard as she gave utterance to this noble sentiment and mrs bingley applauded it to mr stuart who took no notice of the applause and indicated no opinion on the point whatever  now continued miss flouncer firmly before i become a subscriber to your society captain bingley  i must be quite certain that it accomplishes much good that it is worthy of support  being somewhat fired by the doubt that was implied in this speech i replied with warmth  my dear madam nothing will gratify me more than to enlighten you  hereupon i began an address the substance of which is set down in the following chapter    chapter sixteen  jack tar before and after the institution of the sfms  one beautiful evening in autumn many years ago a sailor was observed to approach an english village which lay embosomed among trees near the margin of a small stream whose waters gleamed in the rays of the setting sun  the village was an inland one far removed alike from the roar and the influences of the briny ocean  it must have cost the sailor some pain to reach it for he walked with a crutch and one of his bare feet was bandaged and scarcely touched the ground at each step  he looked dusty and fatigued yet he was a stout wellfavoured robust young fellow so that his hapless condition was evidently the result of recent misfortune and accidentnot of prolonged sickness or want  he wore the picturesque blue jacket wide trousers and straw hat of a manofwars man and exposed a large amount of brown chest beneath his blue flannel shirt the broad collar of which was turned well over  going straight to the inn of the village he begged for a nights food and lodging  told a sad story in offhand fashion of how he had been shipwrecked on the western isles of scotland where he had lost all he possessed and had wellnigh lost his life too but a brave fisherman had pulled him out of the surf by the hair of the head and so he was saved alive though with a broken leg which took many weeks to mend when he was able to travel he had set out with his crutch and had walked two hundred miles on his way to liverpool where his poor wife and two helpless children were living in painful ignorance of his sad fate  of course this was enough to arouse all the sympathies of the villagers few of whom had ever seen a real sailor of any kind in their livesmuch less a shipwrecked one  so the poor fellow was received with open arms entreated hospitably lodged and fed at the public expense and in the morning sent on his way rejoicing  all the forenoon of that day the shipwrecked sailor limped on his way through a populous district of old england in the midst of picturesque scenery gathering pence and victuals ay and silver and even gold too from the pitying inhabitants as he went along  towards the afternoon he came to a more thinly peopled district and after leaving a small hamlet in which he had reaped a rich harvest he limped to the brow of the hill at the foot of which it lay and gazed for a few minutes at the prospect before him  it was a wide stretch of moorland across which the road went in almost a straight line  there were slight undulations in the land but no houses or signs of the presence of man  having limped on until the village was quite hidden from view the sailor quietly put his crutch across his broad shoulder and brightening up wonderfully walked across the moor at the rate of full five miles an hour whistling gaily in concert with the larks as he sped along  an hour and a half of such walking brought him to a small patch of scrubby underwood from the neighbourhood of which a large town could be seen looming against the evening sky in the far distance  the sailor entered the underwood with the air of a man who had aimed at the spot as a goal and who meant to rest there a while  he reached an open space in the centre of which grew a stunted tree  here he sat down and taking off his wallet ate a hearty supper of scraps of excellent bread cheese and meat which he washed down with a draught of gin afterwards he lit his pipe and while enjoying himself thus reclining at the foot of the tree proceeded to increase his enjoyment by counting out his gains  while thus agreeably engaged a rustling of the bushes caused him to bundle the gains hastily up in a handkerchief which he thrust into his pocket while he leaped nimbly to his feet and seized his crutch  oh its only you bill why i declare i thought it waswell well never mind  how have ye got on  the individual addressed entered the enclosure and sat down at the foot of the tree with a sigh which might without much exaggeration have been termed a growl  bill was also strange to say a sailor and a wounded one doubtless a shipwrecked one because his left arm was in a sling  its tough work jim an little pay said the newcomer  why ive walked twenty mile good an only realised two pun ten  if it dont improve ill take to a better trade  youre a discontented dog replied jim spreading out his treasures here have i limped the same distance an bin an got five pun two  whew whistled the other  you dont say that  wellwe go alves so im betterere pass that bottle  ill drink to your good ealth ow did you ever come by it bill  to this bill replied that he had fallen in with several ladies whose hearts were so touched by his pitiful tale that most of them gave him crown pieces while two who actually shed tears while he spoke gave him half a sovereign each  i drink to them ere two ladies exclaimed bill applying the gin bottle to his mouth which was already full of bread and beef  so does i said jim snatching the bottle from his comrade not so much for the sake of them there ladies owever as to get my fair share o the tipple afore you  the remainder of the sentence was drowned by gin and after they had finished the bottle which was only a pint one however these two men sat down together to count their illgotten gains for both of them were vile impostors who had never been on the salt water in the whole course of their worthless lives  now madam said i pointedly addressing miss flouncer who had listened with rapt attention this circumstance happened before the existence of the shipwrecked mariners society and similar cases happened frequently  in fact the interior of our land was at that time constantly visited by shipwrecked sailors of this kind  indeed said miss flouncer undulating to me with a benignant smile  yes madam said i  now observe another side of this picture  hereupon i resumed my address the substance of which was as follows  it chanced that when impostor jim started away over the moor at the slapping pace i have already referred to he was observed by two of the village boys who were lying in a hollow by the roadside amusing themselves  these urchins immediately ran home and told what they had seen  the gossips of the place congregated round the inn door and commented on the conduct of the pretended seaman in no measured terms at the same time expressing a wish that they only had him there and they would let him smell the peculiar odour of their horsepond  at this point the courage and the ire of three stout young ploughmen who had been drinking deeply was stirred up so much that they vowed to be revenged and set off in pursuit of the offender  as they ran nearly all the way they soon came to the spot where jim and bill had been enjoying themselves and met these villains just as they were issuing from the underwood to continue their journey  a fight immediately ensued but jim made such play with his crutch that the ploughmen were driven back  bill too who had been a london prizefighter unslung his left arm and used it so vigorously that the rustics after having had all their eyes blackened and all their noses bled were fain to turn round and fly  this event as you may suppose made a considerable sensation in the neighbourhood travellers and carriers conveyed the news of it along the road from village to village and the thing was thoroughly canvassed and the impostors duly condemned  well about three weeks afterwards a great storm arose a ship was wrecked on the coast and all the crew and passengers drowned except one mana powerful seaman who chanced to be a good swimmer and who nearly lost his own life in his gallant efforts to save the life of the only female who was on board  this man swam to the shore with one arm while with the other he supported the woman  he could barely crawl up the beach through the heavy surf dragging his burden after him  but he succeeded and then lay for some time insensible  when he recovered he found that the woman appeared to be dead  anxious however to do all in his power to restore her he tried to chafe her limbs but seeing that he could make no impression he hastened away to search for human dwellings and send help  four miles did he stagger along before he came to a fishing village  here he told his tale the men of the place hurried away to the scene of the wreck but arrived too late to be of any use  the sailor remained some days with the fishermen who received him kindly and gave him a few pence to help him on his way to the nearest town where he received a few shillings from some charitable persons and then set off to walk on foot to his native place which happened to be on the opposite coast of england  the poor fellow got on very well until he came to the road which led to the village where jim had been so successful  all along this road he was scouted as an impostor and but for his imposing size and physical strength would doubtless have received more kicks than halfpence  as it was he was wellnigh starved  arriving one afternoon famishing and almost knocked up at the village he went in despair to the inn door and began to tell his sorrowful tale  he told it to unsympathetic ears  among his auditors were the three ploughmen who had been so roughly handled by jim and bill  these only heard the first two or three sentences when they rushed upon the sailor calling on their comrades who were numerous to help them to duck the rascal in the horsepond  the stout tar although taken by surprise and overpowered was not disposed to submit without a struggle  he was a very samson in strength  rising up by main force with two of his foes on his back he threw them off drove his right fist into the eye of one his foot into the stomach of a second flattened the nose of a third on his face with a lefthander and then wheeling round at random plunged his elbow into the chest of another who was coming on behind and caused him to measure his length on the ground  before the rustics recovered from their surprise at the suddenness of these movements two more of their number were sprawling in the dust and the rest stood off aghast  now then shouted the indignant tar as he clapped his back to the side of the inn come on the whole of ee  i hope yer wills is made what yere afeard are ye  well if ye wont come on ill bid ye good afternoon ye low minded cowardly landlubbers  and with that he made a rush at them  they tumbled over each other in heaps trying to get out of his way so that he could only get a passing dig at one or two of them and cleared away as fast as he could run  they did not follow him far so jack soon stopped and sat down on the roadside in a very savage state of mind to wipe the blood from his face and knuckles  while he was thus engaged an elderly gentleman in the garb of a clergyman approached him  what has happened to you my man he asked  thats none o your business answered jack with angry emphasis  ax no questions an youll be told no lies  excuse me friend replied the clergyman gently i did not mean to annoy you but you seem to have been badly wounded and i would assist you if you will allow me  i ax yer parding sir said jack a little softened though by no means restored to his wonted goodhumour no offence meant but ive been shamefully abused by the scoundrels in yonder village an i am riled a bit  its only a scratch sir you dont need to consarn yerself  it is more than a scratch if i may judge from the flow of blood permit me to examine  oh itll be all right drectly said jack but as he said so he fell back on the grass fainting from loss of blood which flowed from a large wound on his head  when the sailors senses were restored he found himself in a bed in the clergymans dwelling with his head bandaged up and his body a good deal weaker than he had ever before felt it  the clergyman took care of him until he recovered and you may be sure that he did not miss the opportunity to urge the sailor to think of his soul and to come to jesus christ the saviour of the world whose name is love and whose teaching is all summed up in this do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you  when jack was quite recovered the clergyman gave him some money to enable him to reach his home without begging his way  now this case also occurred before the shipwrecked mariners society was instituted  i cannot say that such cases of rough handling were frequent but cases in which trueblue shipwrecked tars were treated as impostors were numerous so that in those days knaves and rascals often throve as wrecked seamen while the genuine and unfortunate men were often turned rudely from door to door  this state of things does not exist now  it cannot exist now for honorary agents of the society are to be found on every part of our coasts so that the moment a wrecked man touches the land no matter whether he be a briton or a foreigner he is at once taken care of clothed housed fed supplied with a little money and forwarded to his home or to the nearest consul of his nation  the society has therefore accomplished two great and good objects for which the entire nation owes it a debt of gratitude it has rid the land of begging impostors clad in sailors clothes and it has provided relief and assistance to the shipwrecked among our brave and hardy seamen who are in every sense the bulwarks of our island and without whose labours in the most perilous of all callings great britain would be one of the poorest and most uninfluential kingdoms on the face of the earth  but the society does a great deal more than that for it comforts and assists with money and advice hundreds and thousands of widows and orphans whose husbands fathers or brothers have been drowned and this it does from year to year regularlyas regularly as the storms come and scatter death and destruction on our shores  it cannot be too earnestly impressed on the people of england and especially on those who dwell inland that at least a thousand lives are lost two thousand ships are wrecked and two millions sterling are thrown away upon the coasts of this country every year  it is owing to the untiring energy of the national lifeboat institution that those figures are not much very much higher and it is the shipwrecked mariners society that alleviates much very much of the woe resulting from storms and wrecks upon our shores  sailors and fishermen know this well and support both institutions largely  i would that ladies and gentlemen knew this better and felt that they have a positive duty incumbent on them in regard to these societies for they are not local but national  now madam said i again addressing myself pointedly to miss flouncer would you like to hear a few interesting facts in reference to the objects of this society  miss flouncer smiled and undulated in order to express her readiness to listen at the same time she glanced at sir richard who i observed was sound asleep  i also noticed that mrs bingley sniffed impatiently but i felt that i had a duty to perform so with unalterable resolution i prepared to continue my address when miss peppy who had been nearly asleep during the greater part of the time i was speaking suddenly said to miss flouncer  well it is a most surprising state of things that people will go to sea and get wrecked just to let societies like these spring up like mushrooms all over the land  for my part i think i would rather do without the things that ships bring to us from foreign lands than always hear of those dreadful wrecks andbut really one cannot expect the world to alter just to please one so i suppose people must go on being drowned and saved by rocketboats and lifeboats so we had better retire to the drawingroom my dear  the last observation was addressed to mrs bingley who responded to it with a bow of assent as she drew on her gloves  immediately after the ladies rose and i was thus constrained to postpone my narration of interesting facts until another opportunity should offer    chapter seventeen  mrs gaff endeavours fruitlessly to understand the nature of cash principal and interest  at first as i have said poor mrs gaff was quite inconsolable at the bereavements she had sustained in the loss of her husband and son and brother  for a long time she refused to be comforted or to allow her spirit to be soothed by the visits the angel visits as she styled them of lizzie gordon and the entrance of gods word into her heart  much of the violence of the good womans character was the result of training and example on an impulsive and sanguine yet kindly spirit she had loved stephen and billy with a true and ardent love and she could not forgive herself for what she styled her cruelty to the dear boy  neither could she prevail on herself to enjoy or touch a single penny of the money which ought she said to have been her husbands  night after night would mrs gaff sit down by the cottage fireside to rest after her day of hard toll and making tottie sit down on a stool at her feet would take her head into her lap and stroke the hair and the soft cheek gently with her big rough hand while she discoursed of the good qualities of stephen and the bravery of her darling boy to whom she had been such a cruel monster in days gone by  poor tottie being of a sympathetic nature would pat her mothers knee and weep  one evening while they were sitting thus she suddenly seemed to be struck with a new idea  maybe mother said she daddy an billy will come back  weve never hearn that theys been drownded  tottie replied mrs gaff earnestly ive thoughten o that afore now  little more was said but from that night mrs gaff changed her manner and her practice  she set herself earnestly and doggedly to prepare for the return of her husband and child  on the day that followed this radical change in her feelings and plans mrs gaff received a visit from haco barepoles  how dye find yerself today mrs gaff said the big skipper seating himself carefully on a chair at which he cast an earnest glance before sitting down  this little touch of anxiety in reference to the chair was the result of many years of experience which told him that his weight was too much for most ordinary chairs unless they were in sound condition  well and hearty replied mrs gaff sitting down and seizing totties head which she began to smooth  she always smoothed tottie if she were at hand when she had nothing better to do  heh exclaimed haco with a slight look of surprise  glad to hear it lass  nothin turned up has there  no nothin but ive bin busy preparin for stephen and billy comin home an that puts one in good spirits you know  a shade of anxiety crossed hacos brow as he looked earnestly into the womans face under the impression that grief had shaken her reason but she returned his glance with such a calm selfpossessed look that he felt reassured  i hope theyll come lass he said sadly what makes ye think they will  i feel sure on it  i feel it here replied the woman placing her hand on her breast  sweet miss lizzie gordon and me prayed together that the lord would send em home if it was his will an ever since then the loads bin off my heart  haco shook his head for a moment then nodded it and said cheerily well i hope it may be so for your sake lass  an what sort o preparations are ye goin to make  mrs gaff smiled as she rose and silently went to a cupboard which stood close to the dutch clock with the horrified countenance and took therefrom a teacaddy which she set on the table with peculiar emphasis  tottie watched her with an expression of awe for she had seen her mother weeping frequently over that teacaddy and believed that it must certainly contain something very dreadful  the preparations said mrs gaff as she searched her pocket for the key of the box will depend on what im able to afford  youll be able to afford a good deal then if all thats reported be true for im told yeve got ten thousand pounds  is that the sum asked mrs gaff still searching for the key which like all other keys in like circumstances seemed to have gone in for a game of hideandseek im sure i ought to know for the lawyer took great pains to teach me that ay there ye are to the key found ye at last  now then haco well have a look at the book and see  to totties surprise and no small disappointment the only object that came out of the mysterious teacaddy was a small book which mrs gaff however seemed to look upon with respect and to handle as if she halfexpected it would bite  there thats my bankers book  you read off the figures haco for i cant  to be sure if i had wanted to know tottie could have told me but i havent had the heart to look at it till today  ten thousand an no mistake said haco looking at the figures with intense gravity  now then the question is said mrs gaff sitting down and again seizing totties head for stroking purposes while she put the question with deep solemnitythe question is how long will that last  haco was a good deal puzzled  he bit his thumb nail and knit his shaggy brows for some time and then said  well you know that depends on how much you spend at a time  if you go for to spend a thousand pounds a day now itll just last ten days if you spend a thousand pounds a year itll last ten years  if you spend a thousand pounds in ten years itll last a hundred yearsdye see  it all depends on the spendin  but then mrs gaff said the skipper remonstratively you mustnt go for to live on the principal you know  whats the principal demanded mrs gaff  why the whole sum the money itself you know  dye suppose that im a born fool mr barepoles that i should try to live on the money itself  i never heerd on anybody bilin up money in a kettle an suppin goold soup and im not agoin for to try  with infinite difficulty and much futile effort at illustration did haco explain to mrs gaff the difference between principal and interest telling her to live on the latter and never on any account to touch the former unless she wished to end her days in a workus  i wonder what its like said mrs gaff  what whats like inquired the skipper  ten thousand pounds  well that depends too you know on what its made ofwhether copper silver goold or paper  what is it ever made o paper  in attempting to explain this point haco became unintelligible even to himself and mrs gaff became wildly confused  well well said the latter never mind but try to tell me how much ill have a year  that depends too  everything seems to depend cried mrs gaff somewhat testily  of course it does said haco everything does depend on somethin else and everything will go on dependin to the end of time it depends on how you invest it and what interest ye git for it  oh dearie me sighed mrs gaff beginning for the first time to realise in a small degree the anxieties and troubles inseparable from wealth cant ye tell me what its likely to be about  couldnt say observed haco drawing out his pipe as if he were about to appeal to it for information its too deep for me  well but pursued mrs gaff becoming confidential tell me now dye think it would be enough to let me make some grand improvements on the cottage against stephen and billys return  why that depends on what the improvements is to be returned haco with a profound look  ay just so  well here are some on em  first of all i wants to get a noo grate an a brass teakettle  theres nothing like a cheery fire of a cold night and my stephen liked a cheery firean so did billy for the matter o that but the trouble i had wi that there grate is past belief  now a noo grates indispensble  well said haco puffing his smoke up the chimney and regarding the woman earnestly  well then i want to get a noo clock  that one in the corner is a perfit fright  a noo table too for the leg o that one has bin mended so often that it wont never stand another splice  then a noo teapot an a fender and fireirons would be a comfort  but my great wish is to get a big mahogany fourpost bed with curtains  stephen says he never did sleep in a fourposter and often wondered what it would be likeno more did i so i would like to take him by surprise you see  then i want to git  well said haco when she paused  im awful keen to git a carpit but i doubt im thinkin o too many things  dye think the first yearswhat dye call it  interest said haco  ay interestwould pay for all that  yes an more said the skipper confidently  if i only knew how much it is to be said mrs gaff thoughtfully  at that moment the door opened and kenneth stuart entered followed by his friend gildart bingley  after inquiring as to her welfare kenneth said  ive come to pay you the monthly sum which is allowed you by the shipwrecked mariners society  mr bingley asked me to call as he could not do so but from all accounts i believe you wont need it  may i congratulate you on your good fortune mrs gaff  kenneth took out his purse as he spoke to pay the sum due to her  mrs gaff seemed to be struck with a sudden thought  she thanked kenneth for his congratulations and then said  as to my not needin the money youve brought me young man i take leave to say that i do need it so youll obleege me by handin it over  kenneth obeyed in surprise not unmingled with disappointment in finding such a grasping spirit in one whom he had hitherto thought well of  he paid the money however in silence and was about to take his leave when mrs gaff stopped him  this sum has bin paid to me riglarly for the last three months  i believe it has said kenneth  and continued mrs gaff its been the means o keepin me and my tottie from starvation  im glad to hear it returned kenneth who began to wonder what was to follow but he was left to wonder for mrs gaff abruptly asked him and gildart to be seated as she was anxious to find out a fact or two in regard to principal and interest  gildart could scarce avoid laughing as he glanced at his companion  now began mrs gaff seating herself opposite kenneth with a hand on each knee i wants to know what a principal of ten thousand pounds comes to in the way of interest in a twelmonth  well mrs gaff said kenneth that depends  dear me cried mrs gaff petulantly every mortial thing that has to do with money seeps to depend  could ye not tell me somethin about it now that doesnt depend  not easily replied kenneth with a laugh but i was going to say that if you get it invested at five per cent that would give you an income of five hundred pounds a year  how much inquired mrs gaff in a high key while her eyes widened with astonishment  kenneth repeated the sum  young man youre jokin  indeed i am not said kenneth earnestly with an appealing glance at gildart  trueas johnsons dictionary said the middy  mrs gaff spent a few moments in silent and solemn reflection  the independent clergyman she said in a low meditative tone has only two hundred a yearso im told an the doctor at the west end has got four hundred and he keeps a fine house an servants an sam balls the rich hosier has got six hundredso they say and mrs gaff the poor critter has only got five hundred  thatll do she continued with a sudden burst of animation shake out the reefs in yer topsls lass slack off yer sheets ease the helm an make the most on it while the fair wind lasts  having thus spoken mrs gaff hastily folded up in a napkin the sum just given her and put it along with the bankbook into the teacaddy which she locked and deposited safely in the corner cupboard immediately after her visitors much surprised at her eccentric conduct rose and took their leave    chapter eighteen  mrs gaff becomes a woman of business and finds it awfully hard work  soon after the conversation narrated in the last chapter the clerks in the bank of wreckumoft were not a little interested by the entrance of a portly woman of comely appearance and large proportions  she was dressed in a gaudy cotton gown and an enormously large bonnet which fluttered a good deal owing as much to its own magnitude and instability as to the quantity of pink ribbons and bows wherewith it was adorned  the woman led by the hand a very pretty little girl whose dress was much the same in pattern though smaller in proportion  both woman and child looked about them with that air of uncertainty peculiar to females of the lower order when placed in circumstances in which they know not exactly how to act  taking pity upon them a clerk left his perch and going forward asked the woman what she wanted  to this she replied promptly that she wanted money  she was much flushed and very warm and appeared to have come some distance on foot as well as to be in a state of considerable agitation which however she determinedly subdued by the force of a strong will  if you go to yonder rail and present your cheque replied the clerk kindly youll get the money  present what young man  your cheque replied the clerk  whats that  have you not a chequebookor a slip of paper to  oh ay a book  of course ive got a book young man  saying this mrs gaff for it was she produced from a huge bag the bankbook that had erstwhile reposed in the mysterious teacaddy  have you no other book than this  no young man replied mrs gaff feeling but not exhibiting slight alarm  the clerk after glancing at the book and with some curiosity at its owner then explained that a chequebook was desirable although not absolutely necessary and went and got one and showed her the use of ithow the sum to be drawn should be entered with the date etcetera on the margin in figures and then the cheque itself drawn out in words not in figures and signed after which he advised mrs gaff to draw out a cheque on the spot for what she wanted  but young man said mrs gaff who had listened to it all with an expression of imbecility on her goodlooking face i never wrote a stroke in my life xcept once when i tried to show my billy how to do it and only made a big blot on his copy for which i gave him a slap on the face poor illused boy  well then tell me how much you want and i will write it out for you said the clerk sitting down at a table and taking up a pen  mrs gaff pondered for a few seconds then she drew tottie aside and carried on an earnest and animated conversation with her in hoarse whispers accompanied by much nodding and quivering of both bonnets leading to the conclusion that what the one propounded the other heartily agreed to  returning to the table mrs gaff said that she wanted a hundred pounds  how much demanded the clerk in surprise  a hundred pound young man repeated mrs gaff somewhat sternly for she had made up her mind to go through with it come what might if ye have as much in the shop just nowif not ill take the half and call back for the other half tomorrythough it be raither a longish walk fro cove and back for a woman o my size  the clerk smiled wrote out the cheque and bade her sign it with a cross  she did so not only with a cross but with two large and irregular blots  the clerk then pointed to a partition about five feet six in height where she was to present it  going to the partition she looked about for a door by which to enter but found none  looking back to the clerk for information she perceived that he was gone pickpockets and thieves instantly occurred to her but on searching for the bankbook and finding that it was safe she felt relieved  just as she was beginning to wonder whether she was not being made game of she heard a voice above her and looking up observed a mans head stretched over the top of the partition and looking down at her  now then good woman what do you want said the head  i wants a hundred pound said mrs gaff presenting her cheque in a somewhat defiant manner for she began to feel badgered  the head put over a hand took the cheque and then both disappeared  mrs gaff stood for some time waiting anxiously for the result and as no result followed she began again to think of thieves and pickpockets and even meditated as to the propriety of setting up a sudden cry of thieves murder and fire in order to make sure of the clerk being arrested before he should get quite clear of the building when she became aware of a fluttering of some sort just above her  looking up she observed her cheque quivering on the top of the partition wondering what this could mean she gazed at it with an expression of solemn interest  twice the cheque fluttered with increasing violence each time as though it were impatient and then the head reappeared suddenly  why dont you take your cheque it demanded with some asperity  because i dont want it young man i wants my money retorted mrs gaff whose ire was beginning to rise  the head smiled dropped the cheque on the floor and pointing with its nose to a gentleman who stood behind a long counter in a sort of stall surrounded with brass rails told her to present it to the teller and shed get the money  having said which the head disappeared but it might have been noted by a selfpossessed observer that as soon as mrs gaff had picked up the cheque bursting two buttons off her gown in the act the head reappeared grinning in company with several other heads all of which grinned and watched the further movements of mrs gaff with interest  there were four gentlemen standing behind the long counter in brazen stalls  three of these mrs gaff passed on her way to the one to whom she had been directed by the heads nose  now sir said mrs gaff she could not say young man this time for the teller was an elderly gentleman i hope yell pay me the money without any more worrittin of me  im sure ye might ha done it at once without shovin about a poor ignorant woman like me  having appealed to the tellers feelings in this last observation mrs gaffs own feelings were slightly affected and she whimpered a little tottie being violently sympathetic at once began to weep silently  how would you like to have it my good woman asked the teller kindly  eh exclaimed mrs gaff  would you like to have it in notes or gold said the teller  in goold of course sir  tottie here glanced upwards through her tears  observing that her mother had ceased to whimper and was gazing in undisguised admiration at the proceedings of the teller she turned her eyes in his direction and forgot to cry any more  the teller was shovelling golden sovereigns into a pair of scales with a brass shovel as coolly as if he were a grocers boy scooping out raw sugar  having weighed the glittering pile he threw them carelessly out of the scale into the brass shovel and shot them at mrs gaff who suddenly thrust her ample bosom against the counter under the impression that the coins were about to be scattered on the floor  she was mistaken  they were checked in their career by a ledge and lay before her unbelieving eyes in a glittering mass  suddenly she looked at the teller with an expression of severe reproof  youve forgot to count em sir  youll find them all right replied the teller with a laugh  thereupon mrs gaff in an extremely unbelieving state of mind began to count the gold pieces one by one into a little cotton bag which had been prepared by her for this very purpose and which tottie held open with both hands  in ten minutes after much care and many sighs she counted it all and found that there were two sovereigns too many which she offered to return to the teller with a triumphant air but that incredulous man smiled benignantly and advised her to count it again she did count it again and found that there were four pieces too few whereupon she retired with the bag to a side table and in a state of profuse perspiration began to count it over a third time with deliberate care  tottie watched and checked each piece like a lynx and the sum was at last found to be correct  mrs gaff quitted the bank with a feeling of intense relief and met lizzie gordon walking with emmie wilson just outside the door  my dear miss gordon exclaimed the poor woman kissing lizzies hand in the fulness of her heart youve no ideer what agonies ive bin asufferin in that there bank  if theyre agoin to treat me in this way always ill draw out the whole o my ten hundred thousand poundif thats the suman stow it away in my stephens seachest what hes left behind him  dear mrs gaff what have they done to you asked lizzie in some concern  oh its too long a story to tell ye here my dear  come with me  im agoin straight to yer uncles captain bingley  be he to home  but stop did ye ever see a hundred golden pounds  mrs gaff cautiously opened the mouth of her bag and allowed lizzie to peep in but refused to answer any questions regarding her future intentions  meanwhile emmie and tottie had flown into each others arms  the former had often seen my niece both at the house of mr stuart and at my own as our respective ladies interchanged frequent visits and miss peppy always brought emmie when she came to see us  lizzie had taken such a fancy to the orphan that she begged miss peppy to allow her to go with her and me sometimes on our visits to the houses of distressed sailors and fishermen  in this way emmie and tottie had become acquainted and they were soon bosom friends for the gentle darkeyed daughter of mrs gaff seemed to have been formed by nature as a harmonious counterpart to the volatile fairhaired orphan  emmie i may here remark in passing had by this time become a recognised inmate of mr stuarts house  what his intentions in regard to her were no one knew  he had at first vowed that the foundling should be cast upon the parish but when the illness that attacked the child after the shipwreck had passed away he allowed her to remain without further remark than that she must be kept carefully out of his way  kenneth therefore held to his first intention of not letting his father or any one else know that the poor girl was indeed related to him by the closest tie  meanwhile he determined that emmies education should not be neglected  immediately on arriving at my residence mrs gaff was at her own request ushered into my study accompanied by tottie  i bade her goodday and after a few words of inquiry as to her health asked if i could be of any service to her  no capting thank ee she said fumbling with her bag as if in search of something  no news of stephen or billy i suppose said i in a sad tone  not yet capting but i expect em one o these days an im agettin things ready for em  indeed what

capting has saved me an tottie fro starvation an so ive come for to give ye back the money ye sent me by mr stuart for theres many a poor widder asll need it more nor i do  so saying she placed the money on the table and i thanked her heartily adding that i was glad to be able to congratulate her on her recent good fortune  moreover continued mrs gaff taking a small bag from the large one which hung on her arm and laying it also on the table i feel so thankful to the almighty as well as to you sir that ive come to give ye a small matter o goold for the benefit o the society ye blongs to an there it be  how much is here said i lifting up the bag  a hundred pound  ye neednt count it capting for its all crekt though it was shovelled out to me as if it war no better than coals or sugar  goodday capting  mrs gaff turning hastily round as if to avoid my thanks or my remonstrances at so poor a woman giving so large a sum seized tottie by the wrist and dragged her towards the door  stop stop my good woman said i at least let me give you a receipt  please capting i doesnt want one  surely i can trust ye an ive had my heart nigh broke with bits o paper this good day  well but i am required by the rules of the society to give a receipt for all sums received  mrs gaff was prevailed on to wait for the receipt but the instant it was handed to her she got up bounced out of the room and out of the house into the street  i hastened to the window and saw her and tottie walking smartly away in the direction of cove with their enormous bonnets quivering violently and their ribbons streaming in the breeze  half an hour afterwards dan horsey who had been sent to me with a note from my friend stuart went down into my kitchen and finding susan barepoles there alone put his arm round her waist  dont said susan struggling unsuccessfully to get free  what dye think mrs gaff has bin an done  dont know my jewel no more nor a pig as has niver seen the light o day said dan  shes

susans lips to the dismay of bounder who chanced to be in the back scullery and heard the smack  cook rushed to the kitchen but when she reached it dan was gone and a few minutes later that worthy was cantering toward seaside villa muttering to himself  tin thousand pound  its a purty little bit o cash  i only wish as a brother o mine if i had wan would leave me half as much an id buy a coach and six an put purty susan inside and mount the box meself an drive her to africay or noo zealand not to mintion ottyheity and kangaroo by way of a marriage trip  hey  bucephalus be aisy now  it isnt master kenneth thats on yer back just now so mind what yer about or itll be wus for ye old boy    chapter nineteen  the open boat on the pacificgaff and billy in dreadful circumstances a message from the sea and a madmans death  while these events are taking place in the busy seaport of wreckumoft let us return to the little boat which we left floating a solitary speck upon the breast of the great pacific ocean  as long as the whaleship continued visible the three occupants of the boat sat immovable gazing intently upon her in deep silence as if each felt that when she disappeared his last hold upon earth was gone  billy was the first to break silence  shes gone father he whispered  both men started and looked round at the boy  ay shes gone observed gaff with a sigh and now well have to pull for it night an day as we are able  he began slowly to get out one of the oars as he spoke  it would have been better if they had cut our throats growled captain graddy with a fierce oath  youd have been worse off just now if they had captain said gaff shaking off his depression of spirits by a strong effort of will come capn graddy you an i are in the same fix lets be friends and do our best to face the worst like men  it makes little matter how we face it said the captain itll come to the same thing in the long run if we dont manage to make it a short run by taking strong measures  he touched the hilt of a knife which he wore at all times in his belt  however we may as well pull as not  he rose and sulkily took an oar while gaff took another  now captain said gaff you know better than me how far we be fro land an which is the way to pull  i should think were five hundred miles from the nearest land said graddy in a noreast direction an theres no islands that i know of between us an south america so we may just pull about for exercise till the grubs done an then pull till were dead  the captain burst into a loud fierce laugh as if he thought the last remark uncommonly witty  presently he said you may as well see how much weve got to eat an drink before beginnin our work  all right my hearty cried gaff rising with alacrity to examine their store of provisions heres a small bag o biscuit asll last us three days mayhap on half allowance so well be able to do with quarter allowance for the first few days an then reduce to an eighth whichll make it spin out a few days longer  by that time we may fall in with a sail who knows  were far beyond the track o ships said the captain bitterly  is there never a drop o water in the boat  not a drop replied gaff ive searched all round an only found a empty bottle  ay meant for to smuggle brandy aboard when they got the chance the brutes said the captain referring to his recent crew  well it dont matter  weve now the prospect of dyin o thirst before we die of starvation  for my part i prefer to die o starvation so ye may put yourself an your brat on full allowance as long as it lasts  poor billys horror at the prospect before him was much aggravated by the fierce and brutal manner of graddy and he would fain have gone and hid his face in his fathers bosom but he had been placed at the helm while the two were pulling so he could not forsake his post  it was a calm evening when they were thus cast adrift on the boundless sea and as night advanced the calm deepened so that the ocean became like a sea of ink in which the glorious host of stars were faithfully mirrored  hour after hour the two men pulled at the oars with a slowmeasured steady stroke while billy sat at the helm and kept the boats head in the direction of a certain star which the captain pointed out to him at length the star became like a moon to billys gazing eyes then it doubled itself and then it went out altogether as the poor boy fell forward  hallo billy mind your helm cried his father  i felled asleep daddy said the buster apologetically as he resumed his place  well well boy lie down and take a sleep  its too hard on you  eat a biscuit first though before you lie down and ill keep the boats head right with the oar  the captain made no remark but the moon which had just arisen shone on his hard features and showed that they were more fierce and lowering than at the beginning of the night  billy gladly availed himself of the permission and took a biscuit out of the bag  before he had eaten half of it he fell back in the sternsheets of the boat dropt into a sound sleep and dreamed of home and his mother and tottie  hour after hour the men pulled at the oars  they were strong men both of them inured to protracted exertion and fatigue  still the night seemed as if it would never come to an end for in those high southern latitudes at that time of the year the days were very short and the nights were long  at last both men stopped rowing as if by mutual consent  its a pity said gaff to knock ourselves up together  youd better lie down capn an ill pull both oars for a spell  no no gaff replied graddy with sudden and unaccountable urbanity im not a bit tired and im a bigger man than youmaybe a little stronger  so do you lie down beside the boy an ill call ye when i want a rest  gaff remonstrated protesting that he was game to pull for hours yet but the captain would take no denial so he agreed to rest yet there was an uneasy feeling in his breast which rendered rest almost impossible  he lay for a long time with his eyes fixed on the captain who now pulled the two oars slowly and in measured time as before  at last in desperation gaff gave billy a poke in the ribs which roused him  come boy said his father almost sternly youve slept long enough now get up an steer  dont you see the capns pullin all alone  all right daddy said billy uttering a loud yawn and stretching himself  where am i  oh oh  the question was put before he had quite recovered consciousness the terminal oh was something like a groan of despair as his eye fell on the forbidding countenance of the captain  billy took the tiller in silence  after a little while gaff drew his sons ear near to his mouth and said in a low whisper  billy my lad i must have a sleep but i dursnt do it unless you keep a sharp eye on the captain  hes after mischief im quite sure o that so give me a tremendous dig in the ribs if he offers to rise from his seat  mind what i say now lad  our lives may depend on it  billy promised to be watchful and in less than two minutes afterwards gaff was sunk in deep repose  the boy was faithful to his trust  without appearing to be watching him he never for one moment removed his eyes so far from where the captain sat labouring at the oars as to give him a chance of moving without being seen  as time passed by however billy found it difficult to keep awake and in proportion as this difficulty increased his staring at the captain became more direct and intense of course graddy perceived this and the sneering smile that crossed his visage showed that he had made a shrewd guess at the cause of the lads attentions  by degrees billys eyes began to droop and he roused himself frequently with a strong effort feeling desperately alarmed lest he should be overcome  but nature was not to be denied  again and again did his head fall forward again and again did he look up with a startled expression to perceive that graddy was regarding him with a cold sardonic smile  gradually billys eyes refused to convey a correct impression of what they rested on  the rowers head suddenly became twice as large as his body a sight which so alarmed the boy that he started up and could scarce restrain a cry but the head had shrunk into its ordinary proportions and the sardonic smile was there as before  oh what would not billy have given at that time to have been thoroughly wideawake and fresh  he thought for a moment of awaking his father but the thought was only half formed ere sleep again weighed down his spirit causing his eyelids to blink despite his utmost efforts to keep them open  presently he saw graddy draw the right oar quietly into the boat without ceasing to row with the left one and slowly draw the knife which hung at his belt  the boy tried to shout and arouse his father but he was paralysed with horror  his blood seemed to curdle in his veins  no sound would issue from his lips neither could he move hand or foot while the cold glassy eye of the captain rested on him  suddenly graddy sprang up and billys voice found vent in a shrill cry at the same moment stephen gaff awoke and instinctively his hand grasped the tiller  he had no time to rise but with the same force that drew the tiller from its socket in the helm he brought it forward with crashing violence on the forehead of graddy who was stooping to plunge the knife into his breast  he staggered beneath the blow before he could recover himself it was repeated and he fell heavily back into the bottom of the boat  thank the lord murmured gaff as he leaned over his fallen foe the villains hand has bin stopped short this time  come billy help me to lift him up  gaffs blows had been delivered with such vigour that graddys head was much damaged and it was a long time before the two could get him restored sufficiently to sit up  at length however he roused himself and looked with a bewildered air at the sun which had just risen in a flood of golden light  presently his eyes fell on gaff and a dark scowl covered his face but being or pretending to be unable to continue long in a sitting posture he muttered that he would lie down and rest in the bow of the boat  he got up and staggered to the spot where he lay down and soon fell fast asleep  now billy lad well let him rest an ill take the oars  you will lie down and sleep for youve much need of it my poor boy and while im pullin ill consider whats best for to be done in the circumstances  better let me take one o the oars daddy  im wideawake now and not a bit tired  no boy no  lay down  the next time i require to sleep i must have you in a more wakeful conditionso turn in  gaff said this in a tone of command that did not admit of remonstrance so billy lay down and soon fell into a deep slumber  for a long time gaff rowed in silence gazing wistfully up into the sky which was covered with gorgeous piles of snowy clouds as if he sought to forget his terrible position in contemplating the glories of heaven but earth claimed the chief share of his thoughts  while he rowed with slow unflagging strokes during these calm morning hours he did indeed think of eternity of the time he had misspent on earth of the sins he had committed and of the salvation through jesus christ he had for so many years neglected or refused to accept  but invariably these thoughts diverged into other channels he thought of the immediate danger that menaced himself and his son of death from thirst and its terrible agoniesthe beginning of which even at that moment were affecting him in the old familiar way of a slight desire to drink  he thought too of the fierce man in the bow of the boat who evidently sought his lifewhy he could not tell but he surmised that it must either be because he had become deranged or because he wished to get all the food in the boat to himself and so prolong for a few days his miserable existence  finally his thoughts reverted to his cottage home and he fancied himself sitting in the old chimneycorner smoking his pipe and gazing at his wife and tottie and his household goods  ill maybe never see them agin he murmured sadly  for some minutes he did not speak then he again muttered while a grieved look overspread his face an theyll never know whats come o me  theyll go on thinkin an thinkin an hopin an hopin year after year an their sick heartsll find no rest  god help them  he looked up into the bright heavens and his thoughts became prayer  ah reader this is no fancy sketch  it is drawn after the pattern of things that happen every yearevery monthalmost every week during the stormy seasons of the year  known only to him who is omniscient are the multitudes of heartrending scenes of protracted agony and dreary death that are enacted year by year all unknown to man upon the lonely sea now and then the curtain of this dread theatre is slightly raised to us by the emaciated hand of a survivor and the sight if we be thoughtful may enable us to form a faint conception of those events that we never see  we might meditate on those things with advantage surely christians ought not to require strong appeals to induce them to consider the case of those who go down into the sea in ships who do business in the great waters  and here let me whisper a word to you ere i pass on good readermeditation unless it results in action is worse than useless because it deepens condemnation  while gaff was gazing upward a bright look beamed in his eyes  thats not a bad notion he muttered drawing in both oars and rising  ill do it  itll give em a chance an thats better than nothin  so saying he put his hand into the breastpocket of his jacket and drew out a letter which he unfolded and tore off a portion of the last leaf which was free from writing  spreading this upon the thwart he sought for and found a pencil which he was in the habit of carrying in his vestpocket and prepared to write  i have shown elsewhere that gaff could neither read nor write  yet it does not follow that he had no knowledge whatever of these subjects  on the contrary he understood the signification of capital letters when printed large and distinct and could with inconceivable pains and difficulty no doubt string a few simple words together when occasion required  he could also sign his name  after much deep thought he concocted the following sentence    at see in pasifik  no land for 5000 miles  opn boet  the skiper   billy and mees kast adrift by krew  skiper mad or else a vilin   foar or five dais biskit no watter  jess dear las my last thoats   are of yoo    stephen gaff  he meant to put down 500 and thought that he was right  having completed his task he folded up the letter carefully and addressed it to mrs gaff sailors wife the cove england  then he inserted it into the empty bottle to which reference has been made and corking it up tight committed it to the waves with an earnest prayer for its safe arrival at its destination  he then resumed his oars with a feeling of great relief as if a heavy weight had been taken off his mind and watched the precious bottle until it was out of sight astern  by this time the face of nature had changed somewhat  with the advancing day the wind arose and before noon it was blowing a stiff breeze  the rolling of the boat awoke billy who looked up anxiously  ay itll be all over sooner than i thought on murmured gaff as he glanced to windward  whatll be all over daddy inquired the boy who being accustomed to boating in rough weather thought nothing of the threatening appearance of things  nothin lad nothin i was only thinkin aloud the winds freshenin billy an as you may have to sit a long spell at the tiller soon try to go to sleep agin  youll need it my boy  in spite of himself gaffs tone contained so much pathos that billy was roused by it and would not again try to sleep  do let me pull an oar daddy he said earnestly  not yet lad not yet  in a short time i will if the breeze dont get stiffer  why dont he pull a bit daddy inquired billy pointing with a frown at the figure that lay crouched up in the bow of the boat  just then a wave sent a wash of spray inboard and drenched the skipper who rose up and cursed the sea  youd better bale it out than curse it said gaff sternly for he felt that if there was to be anything attempted he must conquer his desperate companion  the man drew his knife  gaff noticing the movement leaped up and catching hold of the tiller which billy handed to him with alacrity faced his opponent  now graddy he said in the tone of a man who has thoroughly made up his mind well settle this question right off  one of us must submit if fair means wont do foul shall be used  you may be bigger than me but i dont think yere stronger leastwise yell ha to prove it now then pitch that knife overboard  instead of obeying graddy hurled it with all his force into gaffs chest  fortunately the handle and not the point struck him else had the struggle been brief and decisive  as it was the captain followed up his assault with a rush at his opponent who met him with a heavy blow from the tiller which the other received on his left arm and both men closed in a deadly struggle  the little boat swayed about violently and the curling seas came over her edge so frequently that billy began to fear they would swamp in a few moments  he therefore seized the balingdish and began to bale for his life while the men fought  gaff soon proved to be the better man for he finally flung the captain over the middle thwart and almost broke his back  now do ye give in he shouted fiercely as he compressed the others throat with both hands  graddy gasped that he did so gaff allowed him to rise and bade him take the balingdish from the boy and set to work without delay  the wretched man was so thoroughly cowed that he thereafter yielded instant obedience to his companion  the wind was blowing furiously by this time and the waves were running high so that it required constant baling and the utmost care in steering to keep the boat from being swamped  fortunately the storm was accompanied by heavy rain so that by catching a little of this in their jackets and caps they succeeded in quenching their thirst hunger they had scarcely felt up to this time but soon the cravings of nature began to be imperious and gaff served out the first ration on the short allowance scale which was so small that it served only to whet their appetites  there was no need to row now  it was absolutely necessary to run before the wind which was so strong that a single oar set up in the place where the mast should have been was sufficient to cause the light craft to fly over the waves  each took the helm for a couple of hours by turns  thus employed they spent the day and still thus employed the dark night found them  bad though things looked when there was light enough to enable them to see the rush of the black clouds overhead the bursts of the driving spray and the tumultuous heavings of the wild sea it was inconceivably worse when the darkness settled down so thick that they could barely see each others faces and the steering had to be done more by feeling as it were than sight  gaff took the helm during the greater part of the night and the other two baled incessantly but the gale increased so much that the water at last came in faster than it could be thrown out and they expected to be swamped every instant  were goin down daddy said billy while a strong inclination to burst into tears almost choked him  here lad shouted gaff in a loud voice for the noise of the wind and waves rendered any other sound almost inaudible take the helm and keep her right before the wind  ye used to steer well do yer best now my boy  while he spoke billy obeyed and his father sprang into the middle of the boat and grasped the three oars and boathook with which the boat was supplied  there were two small sails which he wrapped hastily round these and then tied them all together tightly with a piece of rope  in this operation he was assisted by graddy who seemed to understand what his comrade meant to do  the boat was now half full of water  down the helmhard down roared gaff  ay ay sir responded billy with the ready promptitude of a seaman  the boat flew round at the same moment gaff hurled the bundle of sails and spars overboard and eased off the coil of rope to the end of which it was attached  in a few seconds it was about forty yards away to windward and formed a sort of floating breakwater which slight though it was proved to be sufficient to check the full force of the seas so that the little boat found partial shelter to leeward  the shelter was terribly slight however only just sufficient to save them from absolute destruction and it was still necessary for one of their number to be constantly employed in baling out the water  during the night the clouds cleared away but there was no abatement of the wind and having no water they were obliged to eat their allowance of biscuit either in a dry state or moistened in the sea  next day the sun rose in a cloudless sky and all day it shone upon them fiercely and the wind moderated enough to render baling unnecessary but still they did not dare to haul in their floating bulwark  extreme thirst now assailed them and graddy began in an excited state to drink copiously of salt water  dont go for to do that capn remonstrated gaff  a derisive laugh was the only reply  presently graddy arose and going into the head of the boat took up the balingdish and again drank deeply of the seawater  ha ha he laughed tossing his arms wildly in the air and gazing at gaff with the glaring eyes of a maniac thats the nectar for me  come boys ill sing you a ditty  with that he burst into a roaring bacchanalian song and continued to shout and yell and drink the brine until he was hoarse  but he did not seem to get exhausted on the contrary his eyes glared more and more brightly and his face became scarlet as the fires that were raging within him increased in intensity  billy clung to his father and looked at the captain in speechless horror  even gaff himself felt an overpowering sense of dread creep over him for he now knew that he had to deal with a raving maniac  not knowing what to do he sat still and silent in the stern of the boat with the tiller in his hand and his eyes fixed immovably on those of the madman who seemed to feel that it was a trial as to which should stare the other down for he soon gave up singing and drinking and devoted all his energies of body and soul to glaring at his enemy  thus they continued until the sun began to set  then gaffs heart sank within him for he felt sure that whenever it was too dark for each to see the other the madman would summon up courage to make a sudden attack  the attack however was precipitated by gaff inadvertently glancing over his shoulder to observe how far the sun had yet to descend  instantly with the leap of a panther graddy was upon him with both hands grasping tightly at his throat  down down he pressed him until gaff lay on his back with his head over the gunwale  his strength now availed him nothing for unnatural energy nerved the madmans arm  billy sprang up and tried to disengage him from his grasp  as well might the rabbit try to unlock the boas deadly coil  wrenching the tiller from his fathers grasp he hit the madman on the head with all his might but the poor boys might was small  the blow seemed to have no effect at all  again and again he brought it down in an agony of haste lest his father should be strangled before the other was felled at last he hit him with all his force behind the ear and graddys grasp relaxed as he fell prone on the body of his insensible victim  to pull him off and haul his father into a more convenient position was the work of a few seconds  o daddy daddy speak to me he cried loosening his fathers neckcloth and unbuttoning his shirt  oh quick get better before he does cried billy wildly as he shook his father and laved water on his face oh hell get well first and kill you  in order to do all that lay in his power to prevent this billy suddenly sprang up and seizing the tiller dealt the prostrate graddy several powerful blows on the head  it is not improbable that the frightened boy would have settled the question of his recovery then and there had not his father revived and told him to stop  for some minutes gaff sat swaying about in a confused manner but he was roused to renewed action by seeing graddy move  we must hold him now billy  is there a bit of rope about  not a inch you tied it all round the oars  its awkward  however heres my necktie  it ant strong but its better than nothin  gaff was about to take it off when graddy recovered suddenly and attempted to rise  the others sprang on him and held him down but they did so with difficulty for he was still very strong  all that night did they sit and hold him while he raved and sang or struggled as the humour seized him  they did not dare to relax their hold for a moment because although he lay sometimes quite still for a lengthened period he would burst forth again without warning and with increased fury  and still while they sat thus holding down the maniac the wind blew fiercely over the raging sea and the waves curled over and burst upon their tiny breakwater sending clouds of spray over their head insomuch that ere morning the boat was nearly half full of water  when morning at last broke father and son were so much exhausted that they could scarcely sit up and their cramped fingers clung more by necessity than by voluntary effort to the garments of the now dying man  graddy was still active and watchful however  his face was awful to look upon and the fire of his restless eyes was unabated  when the sun rose above the horizon both gaff and billy turned their weary eyes to look at it  the madman noted the action and seized the opportunity he sprang with an unearthly yell overturned them both and plunged head foremost into the sea  twice he rose and gave vent to a loud gurgling cry while gaff and his son seized the rope attached to the oars intending to pull them in and row to his assistance for he had leaped so far out that he was beyond their reach  but before they had pulled in half of the cable the wretched man had disappeared from their view for ever  slacking off the rope they let the boat drift astern again to its full extent  then without a word without even a look father and son lay down together in the sternsheets and were instantly buried in a profound deathlike slumber    chapter twenty  the voyage of the bottle  the little fragile craft which stephen gaff sent adrift upon the world of waters freighted with its precious document began its long voyage with no uncertainty as to its course although to the eye of man it might have appeared to be the sport of uncertain waves and breezes  when the bottle fell upon the broad bosom of the south pacific it sank as if its career were to end at the beginning but immediately it reappeared with a leap as if the imprisoned spirit of the atmosphere were anxious to get out  then it settled down in its watery bed until nothing but the neck and an inch of the shoulder was visible above the surface  thus it remained thus it floated in the deep in storm and calm in heat and cold thus it voyaged more safely though not more swiftly than all the proud ships that spread their lofty canvas to the breeze night and day for weeks and months ay and years togethernot irregularly not at haphazard but steadily perseveringly in strict obedience to the undeviating laws which regulate the currents in the ocean and the air as truly and unchangeably as they do the circulation of the blood in the human frame  the bottle started from that part of the south pacific which is known to mariners as the desolate regionso called from the circumstance of that part of the sea being almost entirely destitute of animal life  here it floated slowly calmly but surely to the eastward with the great oceanic current which flowing from the regions of the antarctic sea in that part sweeps round the southern continent of america and makes for the equator by way of the southern atlantic ocean  now reader allow me to screw up a little philosophy here and try to show you the why and the wherefore of the particular direction of our bottles voyage  man has been defined by some lexicographer as a cooking animal  i think it would be more appropriate to call him a learning animal for man does not always cook but he never ceases to learnalso to unlearn  one of the great errors which we have been called on of recent years to unlearn is the supposed irregularity and uncertainty of the winds and waves  nothing is more regular nothing more certainnot even the rising and setting of the sun himselfthan the circulation of the waters and the winds of earth  the apparent irregularity and uncertainty lies in our limited power and range of perception  the laws by which god regulates the winds and waves are as fixed as is the law of gravitation and every atom of air every drop of water moves in its appointed course in strict obedience to those laws just as surely as the apple when severed from the bough obeys the law of gravitation and falls to the ground  one grand and important fact has been ascertained namely that all the waters of the sea flow from the equator to the poles and back again  disturbed equilibrium is the great cause of oceanic currents  heat and cold are the chief agents in creating this disturbance  it is obvious that when a portion of water in any vessel sinks another portion must of necessity flow into the space which it has left and if the cause which induced the sinking continue so the flow to fill up will continue and thus a current will be established  heat at the equator warms the seawater and makes it light cold at the poles chills it and makes it heavy  hot water being light rises cold water being heavy sinks  here then is a sufficient cause to produce the effect of currents in the sea  but there are other causes at work  excessive evaporation at the equator carries off the water of the sea but leaves the salt behind thus rendering it denser and heavier while excessive influx of fresh water at the poles from rain and snow and melting ice renders the sea lightin addition to which corallines and shellfish everywhere abstract the lime that is in the sea by secreting it on their bodies in the form of shells and thus increase the lightness of those particles of water from which the lime has been abstracted  the other particles of water being generous in their nature hasten to impart of their lime and salt to those that have little or none  here then we have perpetual motion rendered absolutely certain both as to continuance and direction  but the latter causes which i have named are modifying causes which tend to counteract or rather to deflect and direct currents in their flow besides which the rotation of the earth the action of the winds and the conformation of continents and islands have a powerful influence on currents so that some flow at the bottom of ocean some on the surface some from east to west or west to east or aslant in various directions while where currents meet there is deflection modification or stagnation but there is no confusion all goes on with a regularity and harmony which inconceivably excels that of the most complex and beautiful mechanism of mans constructing although man cannot perceive this order and harmony by reason of his limited powers  now these are facts not theories founded on speculation  they have been arrived at by the slow but sure method of induction  hundreds of thousands of practical men have for many years been observing and recording phenomena of every kind in connexion with the sea  these observations have been gathered together collated examined and deeply studied by philosophers who have drawn their conclusions therefrom ignorance of these facts rendered the navigation of the sea in days of old a matter of uncertainty and great danger  the knowledge of them and of other cognate facts enables man in these days to map out the socalled trackless ocean into districts and follow its wellknown highways with precision and comparative safety  our bottle moved along with the slow but majestic flow of one of those mighty currents which are begotten among the hot isles of the pacific where the corallines love to build their tiny dwellings and rear their reefs and groves  in process of time it left the warm regions of the sun and entered those stormy seas which hold perpetual war around cape horn  it passed the straits where magellan spread his adventurous sails in days of old and doubled the cape which byron bougainville and cook had doubled long before it  ah well would it be for man if the bottle had never doubled anything but that cape  and alas for man when his sight is doubled and his crimes and woes are doubled and his life is halved instead of doubled bythe bottle  off cape horn our adventurous little craft met with the rough usage from winds and waves that marked the passage of its predecessors  stormy petrels hovered over it and pecked its neck and cork  albatrosses stooped inquiringly and flapped their gigantic wings above it  south sea seals came up from oceans caves and rubbed their furred sides against it  sealions poked it with their grizzly snouts and penguins sat bolt upright in rows on the sterile islands near the cape and gazed at it in wonder  onward it moved with the northwestern drift and sighted on its left on its port bow to speak nautically the land of patagonia where the early discoverers reported the men to be from six to ten feet high and the ladies six feet the latter being addicted to staining their eyelids black and the former to painting a red circle round their left eyes these early discoverers failed however to tell us why the right eyes of the men were neglected so we are forced to the conclusion that they were left thus untouched in order that they might wink facetiously with the more freedom  modern travellers it would seem contradict as they usually do many of the statements of ancient voyagers and there is now reason to believe that the patagonians are not much more outrageous in any respect than ordinary savages elsewhere  not long after doubling the cape the bottle sailed slowly past the falkland islands whose rugged cliffs and sterile aspect seemed in accordance with their character of penal settlement  sealions penguins and seals were more numerous than ever here as if they were the guardians of the place ready to devour all hapless criminals who should recklessly attempt to swim away from durance vile  indeed it was owing to the curiosity of a sealion that at this point in its long voyage the bottle was saved from destruction  a storm had recently swept the southern seas and the bottle making bad weather of it in passing the falklands was unexpectedly driven on a leeshore in attempting to double a promontory  whether promontories are more capable of resisting the bottle than human beings i know not but certain it is that the promontory arrested its progress  it began to clink along the foot of the cliffs at the outermost point with alarming violence and there can be no reasonable doubt that it would have become a miserable wreck there if it had not chanced to clink right under the nose of a sealion which was basking in the sunshine and sound asleep on a flat rock  opening its eyes and ears at the unwonted sound the lion gazed inquiringly at the bottle and raised its shaggy front the better to inspect it  apparently the sight stimulated its curiosity for with a roar and a gush of ardent spirit it plunged into the sea and drove the bottle far down into the deep  finding apparently that nothing came of this terrific onslaught the lion did not reappear  it sneaked away no doubt into some coral cave but the force of the push sent the bottle a few yards out to sea and so it doubled the promontory and continued its voyage  shortly after this however a check was put to its progress which threatened to be permanent  in a few places of the ocean there are pools of almost stagnant tracts of various sizes which are a sort of eddies caused by the conflicting currents  they are full of seaweed and other drift which is shoved into them by the currents and are named sargasso seas  some of these are hundreds of miles in extent others are comparatively small  they bothered the navigators of old did those sargasso seas uncommonly  they are permanent spots which shift their position so little with the very slight changes in the currents of the sea that they may be said to be always in the same place  columbus got into one of these sargassosthe great atlantic one that lies between africa and the west indiesand his men were alarmed lest this strange weedy sea should turn out to be the end of the world columbus was long detained in this region of stagnation and calm and so were most of the early navigators who styled it the doldrums nowadays however our knowledge of the currents of ocean and atmosphere enables us to avoid the sargasso seas and sail round them thereby preventing delay facilitating trade saving time and greatly improving the condition of mankind  now our bottle happened to get entangled in the weed of the sargasso that exists in the neighbourhood of the falkland islands and stuck fast there for many months  it was heaved up and down by the undulations blown about a little by occasional breezes embraced constantly by seaweed and sometimes tossed by waves when the outskirts of a passing gale broke in upon the stagnant spot but beyond this it did not move or advance a mile on its voyage  at last a hurricane burst over the sea its whirling edge tore up the weed and swept the waters and set the bottle free at the same time urging it into a northeasterly current which flowed towards the coast of africa  on its way it narrowly missed entanglement in another sargassoa little one that lies between the two continentsbut fortunately passed it in safety and at last made the cape of good hope and sighted the majestic table mountain which terminates the lofty promontory of that celebrated headland  here the bottle met with the wild stormy weather that induced its portuguese discoverer bartholomew diaz to name it the cape of tempests and which cost him his life for on a succeeding voyage he perished there  king john the second of portugal changed its name into the cape of good hope and not inappropriately so as it turned out for a few years after its discovery in 1486 vasco de gama doubled the cape of good hope and discovered the shores of india whence he brought the first instalment of that wealth which has flowed from east to west ever since in such copious perennial streams  there was a perplexing conflict of currents here which seemed to indicate a dispute as to which of them should bear off the bottle  the great mozambique current which born in the huge caldron of the indian ocean flows down the eastern coast of africa and meets and wars with the currents coming from the west almost got the mastery and wellnigh swept it into an extensive sargasso sea which lies in that region in which case the voyage might have been inconceivably delayed but an eccentric typhoon or some such turbulent character struck in from the eastward swept the bottle utterly beyond mozambique influence and left it in the embrace of a current which flowed northward toward the equator  thus the bottle narrowly missed being flung on indias coral strand and voyaged slowly northward in a line parallel with that coast where africs sunny fountains roll down their golden sandswhere slavers too carried off the blacks in days happily gone by to toil in slavery among the fields of cotton and sugarcane and where british cruisers did their best but that wasnt much to prevent the brutal traffic  the chief point of interest in this part of the voyage was touching at saint helena touching so sharply on the western promontory of that dreary islet that the bottle again nearly made shipwreck  admirably well chosen was this prominent barren isolated rock to be the prison of napoleon the great for he was a conspicuous isolated specimen of humanity barren of those qualities that constitute real greatness  great he undoubtedly was in the art of shedding human blood and desolating myriads of hearths and hearts without any object whatever beyond personal ambition for the first napoleon being a corsican could not even urge the shallow plea of patriotism in justification of his murderous career  so let the bottle pass  its career has not been more deadly perchance than was his during the time that the earth was scourged with his presence  on reaching the hot region of the equator our little craft was again sadly knocked about by conflicting currents and performed one or two deepsea voyages in company with currents which dived a good deal in consequence of their superior density and inferior heat  at one time it seemed as if it would be caught by the drift which flows down the east coast of south america and thus get back into the seas from which it set out  but this was not to be  owing to some cause which is utterly beyond the ken of mortals the bottle at last got fairly into the great equatorial current which flows westward from the gulf of guinea  it reached the northwest corner of south america and progressing now at a more rapid and steady rate progressed along the northern shore of that continent passed the mouth of the mighty amazon and the orinoco and pushing its way among the west india islands crossed the carribean sea sighted the isthmus of darien coasted the bay of honduras and swept round the gulf of mexico  here the great current is diverted from its westward course and passing through the gulf of florida rushes across the atlantic in a northeasterly direction under the wellknown name of the gulf stream men of old fancied that this great current had its origin in the gulf of mexico hence its name but we now know that like many another stream it has many heads or sources the streams flowing from which converge in the gulf of mexico and receive new and united direction there  with the gulf stream the bottle pursued its voyage until it was finally cast ashore on the west of ireland  many a waif of the sea has been cast there before it by the same cause and doubtless many another shall be cast there in time to come  an irishman with a jovial countenance chanced to be walking on the beach at the moment when after a voyage of two years our bottle touched the strand  he picked it up and eyed it curiously  musha but its potheen  a more careful inspection caused him to shake his head  ah then its impty  getting the bottle between his eyes and the morning sun he screwed his visage up into myriads of wrinkles and exclaimed  sure there is something in it  straightway the irishman hurried up to his own cabin where his own wife a stout pretty woman in a red cloak assisted him to reach the conclusion that there was something mysterious in the bottle which was at all events not drinkable  oh then ill smash it  do darlint  no sooner said than done for pat brought it down on the hearthstone with such force that it was shivered to atoms  of course his wife seized the bit of paper and tried to read it unsuccessfully  then pat tried to read it also unsuccessfully  then they both tried to read it turning it in every conceivable direction and holding it at every possible distance from their eyes but still without success  then they came to the conclusion that they could make nothing of it at all at all which was not surprising for neither of them could read a word  they wisely resolved at length to take it to their priest who not only read it but had it inserted in the times on the week following and also in the local papers of wreckumoft  thus did mrs gaff at long last come to learn something of her husband and son  her friends kindly told her she need not entertain any hope whatever but she heeded them not and only regarding the message from the sea as in some degree a confirmation of her hopes and expectations she continued her preparations for the reception of the long absent ones with more energy than ever    chapter twenty one  the fortunes of gaff and billy continued  now while the bottle was making its long voyage stephen gaff and his son billy were exposed to the vicissitudes of strange and varied fortune  we left them sound asleep in the stern of the little boat tossed on the troubled breast of the pacific  they never knew how long they slept on that occasion but when they awoke the sun was high in the heavens and the breeze had considerably abated  gaff was the first to shake off the lethargy that had oppressed him gazing round for some time he seemed to hesitate whether he should lie down again and looked earnestly once or twice in the face of his slumbering boy  tis pity to rouse him he muttered but i think we must ha had a long sleep for i feel rested like  hallo billy boy how are ee  billy did not respond to the greeting  indeed he refused to be moved by means of shouts of any kind and only consented to wake up when his father took him by the coatcollar with both hands and shook him so violently that it seemed as if his head were about to fall off  hallo faither he cried in a sleepy voice wots up  ha youre roused at last lad come its time to have a bit breakfast  it aint a heavy un youll git poor boy but tis better than nothin and bigger men have throve upon less at times  billy was awake and fully alive to his position by this time  he was much depressed  he would have been more than mortal had he been otherwise but he resolved to shake off the feeling and face his fortune like a man  come along daddy lets have a spell at the oars before breakfast  no lad take a bit first said gaff opening the sack which contained the biscuit and carefully measuring out two small portions of the crumbs  one of the portions was rather larger than the other  billy observed this and stoutly refused to take his share when stephen pushed the larger portion towards him  no daddy said he youre not a fair divider  am i not lad said stephen meekly  i thought id done it pretty eekal  no my half is the biggest so youll have to take some of it back  gaff refused but billy insisted and a small piece of the precious biscuit was finally put back into the bag  the meal was then eaten with much display of satisfaction by father and son a blessing having been first asked on it and it was prolonged as much as possible in order to encourage the idea that it was not such a small one after all  billy had not been particular as to his crusts and fragments of victuals in days of yore but it was wonderful how sharp his eye was on this occasion to note and pick up every minute crumb and transfer it to his hungry mouth  now daddy im ready  he swelled out his little chest and gave it a sounding thump as he rose and rolling up his shirtsleeves to the shoulder seized an oar gaff took the other and both sat down to the slow dreary monotonous toil of another day  at first the buster was chatty but by degrees his tongue flagged and ere long it became quite silent  for six or eight hours they pulled without intermission except for a few minutes at a time every hour or so and gaff directed the boats head in the direction to which the captain had pointed when he said the land might be about five hundred miles off  when the sun was getting low on the horizon billy stopped with a sigh  aint it time for dinner daddy dye think  hold on a bit lad im goin to let ye tak a sleep soon an itll be best to eat just afore lyin down  no more was said and the rowing was continued until the sun had set and the shades of night were beginning to descend on the sea  now lad well sup said stephen with a hearty air as he pulled in his oar  hooray cried billy faintly as he jumped up and went to the stern where his father soon produced the biscuitbag and measured out the two small portions  cheatin again daddy cried the buster with a remonstrative tone and look  no i aint said gaff sharply eat yer supper you scamp  billy obeyed with alacrity and disposed of his portion in three mouthfuls  there was a small quantity of rainwaterabout half a pintwhich had been collected and carefully husbanded in the balingdish  it was mingled with a little spray and was altogether a brackish and dirty mixture nevertheless they drank it with as much relish as if it had been clear spring water  now boy turn in said gaff earnestly youll need all the sleep ye can git for if i know the signs of the sky well have more wind afore long  poor billy was too tired to make any objection to this order so he laid his head on a fold of the wet sail and almost immediately fell asleep  gaff was right in his expectation of more wind  about two hours after sunset it came on to blow so stiffly that he was obliged to awaken billy and set him to bale out the sprays that kept constantly washing over the gunwale  towards midnight a gale was blowing and gaff put the boat before the wind and drove with it  hour after hour passed away still there was no abatement in the violence of the storm and no relaxation from baling and steering which the father and son took alternately every half hour  at last billys strength was fairly exhausted  he flung down the balingdish and sitting down beside his father laid his head on his breast and burst into tears  the weakness for such billy deemed it only lasted a few moments however  he soon repressed his sobs  my poor boy said gaff patting his sons head itll be soon over wi us i fear  may the good lord help us  the boat cant float long wi such sprays washin over her  billy said nothing but clung closer to his father while his heart was filled with solemn rather than fearful thoughts of death  their danger of swamping now became so imminent that gaff endeavoured to prepare his mind to face the last struggle manfully  he was naturally courageous and in the heat of action or of battle could have faced death with a smile and an unblanched cheek but he found it much more difficult to sit calmly in the stern of that little boat hour after hour and await the blow that seemed inevitable  he felt a wild almost irresistible desire to leap up and vent his feelings in action of some kind but this was not possible for it required careful attention to the helm to prevent the little craft from broachingto and upsetting in his extremity he raised his heart to god in prayer  while he was thus engaged the roar of the storm increased to such a degree that both father and son started up in expectation of instantaneous destruction  a vivid flash of lightning glared over the angry sea at the moment and revealed to their horrified gaze a reef of rocks close ahead on which the waves were breaking with the utmost fury  instant darkness followed the flash and a deafening peal of thunder joined in the roar of breakers intensifying if possible the terrors of the situation  gaff knew now that the crisis had certainly arrived and for the next few moments he exerted every power of eye and ear in order to guide the boat into a channel between the breakersif such existed  jump forard lad he shouted and keep yer eye sharp ahead  billy obeyed at once with the seamanlike ay ay sir which he had acquired on board the whaler  port port hardaport shouted the boy a moment after taking his place in the bow  port it is answered gaff  before the boat had time however to answer the helm she was caught on the crest of a breaker whirled round like a piece of cork and balancing for one moment on the foam capsized  the moment of hesitation was enough to enable gaff to spring to his sons side and seize him  next instant they were buffeting the waves together  it is not necessary to remind the reader that gaff was an expert swimmer  billy was also firstrate  he was known among his companions as the cork because of his floating powers and these stood him in good stead at this time enabling him to cling to his father much more lightly than would have been the case had he not been able to swim  at first they found it impossible to do more than endeavour to keep afloat for the surging of the breakers was so great and the darkness so intense that they could not give direction to their energies  but the increasing roar of the surf soon told them that they were near the rocks and in a few seconds they were launched with tremendous force amongst them  well was it for them at that moment that the wave which bore them on its crest swept them through a gap in the reef else had they been inevitably dashed to pieces  as it was they were nearly torn asunder and gaffs shoulder just grazed a rock as he was whirled past it but in a few seconds they found themselves in comparatively still water and felt assured that they had been swept through an opening in the reef presently gaff touched a rock and grasped it  hold on billy my lad he exclaimed breathlessly well be safe ashore please god in a short bit  all right daddy gasped the boy for to say truth the whirling in the foam had wellnigh exhausted him  soon the two were out of the reach of the waves clinging to what appeared to be the face of a precipice  here although safe from the actual billows they were constantly drenched by spray and exposed to the full fury of the gale  at first they attempted to scale the cliff supposing that if once at the top they should find shelter but this proved to be impossible  equally impossible was it to get round the promontory on which they had been cast  they were therefore compelled to shelter themselves as they best might in the crevices of the exposed point and cling to each other for warmth  it was a long long night to those castaways  minutes appeared to pass like hours and it seemed to them as if night had finally and for ever settled down on the dreary world  the wind too although not very cold was sufficiently so to chill them and long before day began to break they were so much benumbed as to be scarcely able to maintain their position  during all this time they were harassed by uncertainty as to the nature of the rock on which they were cast  it might be a mere barren islet perhaps one which the sea covered at highwater in which case there was the possibility of their being swept away before morning  when morning came however it revealed to them the fact that they were upon a small promontory which was connected by a narrow neck of sand with the land  as soon as the light rendered this apparent gaff put his hand on billys head and spoke softly to him  now then lad look upye ant sleepin sure are ye  no daddy only dozin and dreamin said billy rousing himself  well we must stop dreamin and git ashore as fast as we can  i think theres dry land all the way to the beach if not itll only be a short swim  whether its an island or what i dont know but lets be thankful boy that it looks big enough to hold us  come cheer up  to this billy replied that he was quite jolly and ready for anything and by way of proving his fitness for exertion began to crawl over the rocks like a snail  thatll never do said gaff with a short laugh come wrestle with me youngster  the buster accepted the challenge at once by throwing his arms round his fathers waist and endeavouring to throw him  gaff resisted and the result was that in ten minutes or so they were comparatively warm and capable of active exertion  then they clambered over the rocks traversed the neck of sand and quickly gained the shore  ascending the cliffs with eager haste they reached the summit just as the sun rose and tinged the topmost pinnacles with a golden hue pushing on towards an elevated ridge of rock they climbed to the top of a mound from which they could obtain a view of the surrounding country and then they discovered that their place of refuge was a small solitary island in the midst of the boundless sea    chapter twenty two  the islandhome examined  for a long time father and son stood on the elevated rock gazing in silence on the little spot of earth that was to be their home it might be for months or even years  the island as i have said was a solitary one and very smallnot more than a mile broad by about three miles long but it was covered from summit to shore with the richest tropical verdure and the trees and underwood were so thick that the cliffs could only be seen in places where gaps in the foliage occurred or where an aspiring peak of rock shot up above the trees  in order to reach the ridge on which they stood the castaways had passed beneath the shade of mangrove banana cocoanut and a variety of other trees and plants  the land on which these grew was undulating and varied in form presenting in one direction dense foliage which not only filled the little valleys but clung in heavy masses to rocks and ridges while in other places there were meadows of rich grass with here and there a reedy pond whose surface was alive with wild ducks and other waterfowl  only near the top of the islandwhich might almost be styled a mountain ridgewas there any appearance of uncovered rock  there were two principal peaks one of which from its appearance was a volcano but whether an active one or not gaff could not at that time determine  unlike the most of the south sea islands this one was destitute of a surrounding coral reef so that the great waves caused by the recent storm burst with thunderous roar on the beach  at one point only was there a projecting point or low promontory which formed a natural harbour and it was on the outer rocks of this point that the father and son had been providentially cast  the whole scene was preeminently beautiful and as the wind had gone quite down it was with the exception of the solemn regular intermittent roar of the breakers on the weather side quiet and peaceful  as he sat down on a rock and raised his heart to god in gratitude for his deliverance gaff felt the spot to be a sweet haven of rest after the toils and horrors of the storm  a single glance was sufficient to show that the island was uninhabited  the silence was first broken by billy who in his wonted sudden and bursting manner gave vent to a resonant cheer  hallo ho hooray he shouted while a blaze of delight lit up his face theres the boat daddy  where away lad demanded gaff rising and shading his eyes from the sun as he looked in the direction indicated  there down i the cove bottom up among the rocks stove in i daresay  dont ee seed faither  ay lad and mayhap it beant stove in leastwise well go see  as the two hastened down to the beach to ascertain this important point gaff took a more leisurely survey of things on the island and billy commented freely on things in general  now daddy said the buster with a face of beaming joy this is the very jolliest thing that ever could have happened to usaint it  well im not so sure o that lad  to be cast away on a lone desert island in the middle o the pacific with little or no chance o gittin away for a long bit aint quite the jolliest thing in the world to my mind  wots a desert island daddy  one as aint peopled or cultivated  then thats no objection to it said billy because we two are people enough and well cultivate it up to the masthead afore long  but what shall we do for victuals lad inquired gaff with a smile  the buster was posed  he had never thought of food so his countenance fell  and drink added gaff  the buster was not posed at this for he remembered and reminded his father of the pond which they had seen from the ridge  aha he added an there was lots o ducks on it too  we can eat them you know daddy even though we hant got green peas or taties to em  we can have other things to em though said gaff pointing to a tall palmtree for there are cocoanuts and farther on to this side o the hollow there i see bananatrees and here are yams which are nearly as good as taties  i told ye it would be jolly cried billy recovering his delight an no doubt well find lots of other things and then well have it all to ourselvesyou and me  youll be king daddy or emperor and ill be prince  wont that be grandprince of a south sea island  what would tottie and mother say  and then the boat you knoweven if it do be stove in we can patch it up somehow and go fishin  without hooks or lines said gaff  billy was posed again and his father laughed at the perplexed expression on his countenance as he said never mind boy well find somethin or other that will do instead o hooks an lines  to be sure we will assented the other encouragingly an thatll be one of the jolliest bits of it all that well spend lots of our time in tryin to find out things thatll do instead o other things wont we and thenhallo was that a grump  it sounded uncommon like one  an thats a squeal said billy  in another moment both grump and squeal were repeated in full chorus by a drove of wild pigs that burst suddenly out of a thick bush and rushing in mad haste past the intruders on their domain disappeared yelling into a neighbouring thicket  pork for our ducks daddy shouted billy when the first burst of his surprise was over well have plenty of grub now but how are we to catch them  ha we must find that out replied gaff cheerfully itll give us summat to think about dye see  now then here we are at the beach an as far as i can see we have bright prospects in regard to victuals of another sort for here be crabs an oysters an no end o cockles come well not be badly off if we only had a hut o some sort to sleep in but after all we can manage to be comfortable enough under a tree it will be better than the housin weve had for the last few nights anyhow  to their great delight they found that the boat had been cast ashore on a sandy place and that it was uninjured  a short way beyond it too the oars were found stranded between two rocks  this was a piece of great good fortune because it placed within their reach the means of an immediate circumnavigation of their island  but before entering on this voyage of discovery they resolved to explore the woods near the place where they had landed in search of a cavern or some suitable place in which to fix their home  acting on this resolve they pulled the boat up the beach placed the oars within it and returned to the woods  as they went they picked up a few shellfish and ate them raw  thus they breakfasted but although the meal was a poor one it was unusually pleasant because of the hunger which had previously oppressed them and which billy in a fit of confidential talk with his father compared to having his interior gnawed out by rats  passing through the woods they found a quantity of ripe berries of various kinds of which they ate heartily and then came to a spring of clear cold water  gaff also climbed a cocoanut tree and brought down two nuts which were clothed in such thick hard shells that they wellnigh broke their hearts before they succeeded in getting at the kernels  however they got at them in course of time and feasted sumptuously on them  it was half an hour or perhaps threequarters of an hour after the gathering of the cocoanuts that they came suddenly on a spring of water above which there was a cloud of vapour resembling steam  its bilin exclaimed billy as he ran forward and eagerly thrust his hand into the water  billy had said this in joke for he had never conceived of such a thing as a spring of hot water but he found that his jest might have been said in earnest for the spring was almost bilin and caused the buster to pull his hand out again with a roar of surprise and pain  just beyond the hot spring they found a small cavern in the face of a cliff which appeared to them to be quite dry  heres the very thing we want daddy cried billy in gleeful surprise  dont be too sure lad praps its damp  no its dry as bone said the boy running in and placing his hands on the floor its wide inside too and the entrance is small so we can put a door to it and look there seeant that a hole leadin to some other place  billy was right  a small hole not much larger than was sufficient to admit of a man passing through conducted them into a larger cave than the first one and here they found another hole leading into a third which was so large and dark that they dared not venture to explore it without a light  they saw enough however to be convinced that the caverns were well ventilated and free from damp so they returned to the entrance cave and examined it carefully with a view to making it their home  billys romantic spirit was filled to overflowing with joy while thus engaged insomuch that gaff himself became excited as well as interested in the investigation  they little knew at the time how familiar each rock and crevice of that cave was to become and how long it was destined to be their islandhome    chapter twenty three  relating to improvements in the hut and mrs gaffs perplexities  while stephen gaff and his son were busy preparing their residence in the south sea island mrs gaff was equally busy in preparing her residence for their reception on their return to cove  the little cottage had undergone so many changes during the past few months that it is doubtful whether its rightful owner would have recognised his own propertyinternally at least externally it remained unaltered  having with much pains ascertained that she might venture to launch out pretty freely in the way of expenditure without becoming absolutely bankrupt mrs gaff had supplied herself with a handsome new grate a large proportion of which was of polished brass that cost herself and tottie much of their time to keep clean and brilliant there were also fender and fireirons to match adorned with brass knobs and points which latter were the special admiration of tottie  there was a carpet too straight from the looms of turkeyas the man who sold it informed mrs gaffwhich was the admiration of all cove for it was divided into squares of brilliant colours with huge red roses in the centre of each it was positively a superb a resplendent carpet and rejoiced the hearts and eyes of mrs gaff and her child every time they looked at it which you may be sure was pretty often  it kept them indeed in a constant state of nervous dread lest they should spill or capsize anything upon it and in this respect might almost be said to have rendered their lives a burden but they bore up under it with surprising cheerfulness  there was also a new eightday clock with a polished mahogany case and a really white face which by contrast made the old dutch clock more yellow and bilious than ever and if possible more horrified in its expression  mrs gaff had allowed the old clock to retain its corner wisely concluding that it would be a pleasantly familiar sight and sound to her husband and son when they returned  it was quite apparent to the meanest capacity that there was a rivalry between the two timepieces for being both rather good timekeepers they invariably struck the hours at the same time but the new clock struck with such a loud overbearing ring that the old one was quite overpowered  the latter had the advantage however of getting the first two strokes before the other began besides which it prefaced its remarks every hour with a mysterious hissing and whirring sound that the new clock could not have got up to save its life  there were also halfadozen new cane chairs  the shopman who had sold mrs gaff the carpet told her that they would look more elegant and drawingroomlike than the six heavy secondhand mahogany ones with the haircloth seats on which she had set her heart  mrs gaff would not at first agree to take the cane chairs observing truly that they was too slim but she was shaken in her mind when the shopman said they were quite the thing for a ladys boudoir  she immediately demanded to know what a boodwar was  the shopman told her that it was an elegant apartment in which young ladies were wont to sit and read poetry and think of their absent lovers  on hearing this she retired into a corner of the shop taking refuge behind a chest of drawers and held a long whispered conversation with tottie after which she came forth and asked the shopman if married ladies ever used boodwars where they might sit and think of their absent husbands  the shopman smiled and said he had no doubt they didindeed he was sure of it for said he there was a certain apartment in his own house in which his own wife was wont to sit up at night when he chanced to be absent and think of him  the uncandid man did not add that in the same apartment he was in the habit of being taken pretty sharply to task as to what had kept him out so late but after all what had mrs gaff to do with that  the result was that the six cane chairs were ordered by mrs gaff who remarked that she never read poitry but that that wouldnt matter much thenceforth she styled the cottage at cove the boodwar  it is worthy of remark that mrs gaff being a heavy woman went through the bottom of the first of the cane chairs she sat down on after they were placed in the boudoir and that her fisherfriends being all more or less heavy went successively through the bottoms of all the rest until none were left and they were finally replaced by the six heavy mahogany chairs with the hair seats which ever afterwards stood every test to which they were subjected that of haco barepoles weight included  but the chief ornament of the cottage was a magnificent old mahogany fourposter which was so large that it took up at least a third of the apartment and so solidly dark and heavy that visitors were invariably on their first entrance impressed with the belief that a hearse had been set up in a corner of the boudoir  the posts of this bed were richly carved and the top of each was ornamented with an imposing ball the whole was tastefully draped with red damask so dark with age as to be almost black  altogether this piece of furniture was so grand that words cannot fully describe it and it stood so high on its carved legs that mrs gaff and tottie were obliged to climb into it each night by a flight of three steps which were richly carpeted and which folded into a square box which was extremely convenient as a seat or ottoman during the day and quite in keeping with the rest of the furniture of the boodwar  in addition to all these beautiful and expensive articles mrs gaff displayed her love for the fine arts in the selection and purchase of four engravings in black frames with gold slips one for each wall of the cottage  the largest of these was the portrait of a firstrate lineofbattle ship in full sail with the yards manned and dressed from deck to trucks with all the flags of the navy  another was a head of lord nelson said to be a speaking likeness  this head had the astonishing property of always looking at you no matter what part of the room you looked at it from  tottie had expressed a wish that it might be hung opposite the new clock in order that it might have something as it were to look at but although the eyes looked straight out of the picture they refused to look at the clock and pertinaciously looked at living beings instead  mrs gaff asserted that it had a squint and that it was really looking at the dutch clock and on going to the corner where that timepiece stood she found that lord nelson was gazing in that direction  but tottie who went to the opposite corner of the room roundly asseverated that the head looked at her  there was no getting over this difficulty so mrs gaff gave it up as an unsolvable riddle but tottie who was fond of riddles pondered the matter and at length came to the conclusion that as lord nelson was a great man it must be because of his greatness that he could look in two directions at the same moment  mrs gaff furthermore displayed her taste for articles of vertu in her selection of chimneypiece ornaments  she had completely covered every inch of available space with shells of a brilliant and foreign aspect and articles of chinaware such as parrots and shepherds besides various creatures which the designer had evidently failed to represent correctly as they resembled none of the known animals of modern times  from this abode of elegance and luxury mrs gaff issued one forenoon in her gay cotton visiting dress and the huge bonnet with the pink bows and ribbons  tottie accompanied her for the two were seldom apart for any lengthened period since the time when stephen and billy went away mother and daughter seemed from that date to have been united by a new and stronger bond than heretofore they walked worked ate slept and almost thought together  on the present occasion they meant to pay a business visit at the house of mr stuart  while they were on their way thither miss penelope stuart was engaged in the difficult and harassing work of preparing for a journey  she was assisted by mrs niven who was particularly anxious to know the cause of the intended journey to the great annoyance of miss peppy who did not wish to reveal the cause but who was so incapable of concealing anything that she found it absolutely necessary to take the housekeeper into her confidence  niven she said sitting down on a portmanteau which was packed beside one which was packing  yes maam  i may as well tell you why it is that i am going to visit my brotherinlaw  oh its to your brotherinlaw youre goin is it  yes i forgot that you did not know but to be sure i might have known that you could not know unless you were told although its difficult to understand why people shouldnt know what others are thinking of as well as what they are looking at  we can see them looking but we cant hear them thinkingreally it is very perplexingdear me where can they be  what maam  my thick walkingshoes  im quite sure that i had them in my hand a minute ago  ho maam exclaimed mrs niven suddenly if you arent bin an put em into your bonnetbox among the caps  well now that is odd  put them into the bag niven  well as i was sayingwhere was i  you was goin to tell me why you are goin to your brother maam observed the housekeeper  ah to be sure well then  but you must never mention it niven  miss peppy said this with much solemnity as if she were administering an oath  on my honour maam trust me  i never mentions hanythink  mrs niven said this as though she wondered that the supposition could have entered into miss peppys head for a moment that she mrs niven could would or should tell anything to anybody  well then you must know resumed miss peppy with a cautious glance round the room my brotherinlaw colonel crusty who lives in the town of athenbury is a military man  so i should suppose maam observed mrs niven he being called kurnel wich is an army name  ah yes to be sure i forgot that well it is two hours by train to athenbury which is a dirty place as all seaports arefull of fishy and sailory smells though ive never heard that such smells are bad for the health at least the sanitary commissioners say that if all the filth were cleaned away the effluvia would be less offensive and and  but as i was saying for those reasons i mean to pay my brotherinlaw a short visit  beg parding maam said mrs niven but if i may remark so you ave not mentioned your reasons as yet  oh to be sure said the baffled miss peppy who had weakly hoped that she could escape with an indefinite explanation i meant to say and youll be sure not to tell niven that the colonel has a remarkably pretty daughter with such a sweet temper and heiress to all her fathers property though i never knew rightly how much it was for the crustys are very close and since their mother died  whose mother maam the colonels or his daughters  his daughters of coursebella she is called  since she died not bella but her mother since then ive never heard anything about the family but now that bella is grown up i mean to get her and kenneth to see each other and i have no doubt that they will fall in love which would be very nice for you know kenneth will have a good income one of those days and its as well that the young people should bebe married if they can and indeed i see nothing in the way though after all they would probably be happier if they were not to marry for i dont believe the state to be a happy one and thats the reason niven that i never entered into it myself but its too late now though i cannot conceive why it should ever be too late for if people can be happy at all any time whats to hinder  miss peppy paused abruptly here and mrs niven supposing that she awaited a reply said  nothing whatever maam  exactly so niven thats just what i think  kenneth is young and tall and handsome bella is young and small and pretty and thats the reason the match is so suitable though to be sure there are many people similarly situated whose union would not be suitable dear me this world of perplexities  no one can read the riddle for this world is no better than a big round riddle flattened a little at the poles to be sure like an orange though to my eyes it seems as flat as a pancake except in the scotch highlands where its very irregular and the people wear kilts still upon the whole i think the match will be a good one so i am going to try to bring it about  but are you sure maam that master kenneth will go to visit colonel crusty  o yes he has promised to escort me there and then hell see bella and of course he wont wish to leave after that  mrs niven shook her head and observed that she rather feared miss lizzie gordons image was already indelibly impressed on master kenneths heart but miss peppy replied that that was all nonsense and that at all events her brother mr stuart would never permit it she did not find it difficult to gain over mrs niven to her views for that worthy woman like many other worthy women in this world held the opinion that a good match meant a match where money existed on one or both sides and that love was a mere boyish and girlish idea which should not be taken into consideration at all  the two were still discussing this important subject when mrs gaff laid violent hands on the doorbell  on being admitted to the presence of miss peppy mrs gaff sat down on the packed trunk and all but stove in the lid whereupon she rose hastily with many apologies and afterwards in her confusion sat down on the bonnetbox which she stove in so completely as to render it horsdecombat for all future time  im awful sorry she began  oh no harm at least no matter said miss peppy its quite a useless sort of thing this was literally true and i mean to get a new one immediately  mrs gaff became suddenly comforted and said with a bland smile that having heard only that morning of her intention to visit the town of athenbury she had called to ask her to do her a great favour  with the greatest pleasure what can i do for you said miss peppy who was the essence of goodnature  thank ee maam its to take charge o a bit parcel about the size of my head or thereaway and give it to a poor relation o mine as lives there when he ant afloat  a seaman said miss peppy  yes maam  very well but continued miss peppy you say the parcel is the size of your head do you mean your head with or without the bonnet  excuse me for  la maam without the bonnet of course  it may perhaps be rather heavy but i ant quite sure yet  ill let you know in an hour or so  mrs gaff rose abruptly left the house with tottie precipitately and made her way to the bank where she presented herself with a defiant air to the teller who had originally supplied her with a hundred pounds in gold  she always became and looked defiant worthy woman on entering the bank having become unalterably impressed with the idea that all the clerks tellers and directors had entered into an agreement to throw every possible difficulty in the way of her drawing out money and having resolved in her own determined way that she wouldnt give in as long as to borrow one of her husbands phrases there was a shot in the locker  now sir she said to the elderly teller i wants twenty pounds if theres as much in the shop  the elderly teller smiled and bade her sit down while he should write out the cheque for her  she sat down gazing defiance all round her and becoming painfully aware that there were a number of young men behind various screened rails whose noses were acting as safetyvalves to their suppressed feelings  when the cheque was drawn out and duly signed mrs gaff went to the rails and shook it as she might have shaken in the face of her enemies the flag under which she meant to conquer or to die  on receiving it back she returned and presented it to the elderly teller with a look that said plainlythere refuse to cash that at your peril but she said nothing she only snorted  how will you have it inquired the teller blandly  in coppers said mrs gaff stoutly  coppers exclaimed the teller in amazement  yes coppers  my good woman are you aware that you could scarcely lift such a sum in coppers  how many would it make she inquired with an air of indecision  four thousand eight hundred pence  mrs gaffs resolution was shaken after a few moments consideration she said she would take it in silver and begged to have it mixedwith a good number of sixpences amongst it  you see my lamb she whispered to tottie while the teller was getting the money my poor cousin george is amost too old to go to sea now and he hant got a penny to live on an so i wants to gladden his heart and astonish his eyes wi a sight o such a heap o silver  mix it all together sir she said to the teller  he obeyed and pushed the pile towards mrs gaff who surveyed it first with unmixed delight but gradually her face was clouded with a look of concern as she thought of the counting of it  if the counting of the gold was terrible to her the counting of the silver was absolutely appalling for the latter consisting as it did of halfcrowns shillings and sixpences numbered nearly five hundred pieces  the poor woman applied herself to the task with commendable energy but in ten minutes she perceived that the thing was utterly beyond her powers so she suddenly exclaimed to tottie who stood looking on with tears in her eyessurely the elderly teller must be an honest man and would never cheat me having come to which conclusion she swept the silver into the bag previously prepared for it and consigned that to the basket which was the inseparable companion of her left arm thereafter she left the bank and hastened to a grocer in the town with whom she was acquainted and from whom she obtained brown paper and twine with which she made the money up into a parcel  her next act was to purchase a new bonnetbox which she presented to miss peppy with many earnest protestations that she would have got a better if she could but a better was not to be had in town for love or money  having executed all her commissions mrs gaff returned to cove and spent an hour or two with tottie in the fourposternot by any means because she was lazy but because it afforded her peculiar and inexpressible pleasure to stare at the damask curtains and wonder how gaff would like it and think of the surprise that he would receive on first beholding such a bed  so anxious did the good woman become in her desire to make the most of the new bed that she once or twice contemplated the propriety of stephen and herself and the buster and tottie spending the first night after their return all together in it but on mature consideration she dismissed the idea as untenable    chapter twenty four  miss peppy undertakes a journey  the scene is changed now to the railway station at wreckumoft where there is the usual amount of bustle and noise  the engines are shrieking and snorting as if nothing on earth could relieve their feelings but bursting  bells are ringing porters are hurrying to and fro with luggage on trucks to the risk of passengers shins and toes men women and children young and old high and low rich and poor are mixed in confusion on the platform some insanely attempting to force their way into a train that is moving off under the impression that it is their train and they are too late after all  others are wildly searching for lost luggage  many are endeavouring to calm their own spirits some are attempting to calm the spirits of others  timid old ladies who cannot get reconciled to railways at all are convinced that something is going to happen and testy old gentlemen are stumping about in search of wives and daughters wishing that railways had never been invented while a good many selfpossessed individuals of both sexes are regarding the scene with serene composure  when miss peppy made her appearance she was evidently not among the latter class  she was accompanied by kenneth and attended by mrs niven  neither mistress nor maid had ever been in a railway station before they belonged to that class of females who are not addicted to travelling and who prefer stagecoaches of the olden times to railways they entered the station therefore with some curiosity and much trepidationfor it chanced to be an excursion day and several of the trades of athenbury were besieging the ticketwindows  it is very good of you to go with me kennie said miss peppy hugging her nephews arm  my dear aunt it is a pleasure i assure you replied kenneth i am quite anxious to make the acquaintance of colonel crusty and his pretty daughter  o dear what a shriek  is anything wrong kennie  nothing dear aunt it is only a train about to start  whats the matter with you niven inquired miss peppy with some anxiety on observing that the housekeepers face was ashy pale  nothink maam only i feels assured that everythink is agoin to bust maam  she looked round hastily as if in search of some way of escape but no such way presented itself  lookout for your legs maam shouted a porter as he tried to stop his truck of luggage  mrs niven of course did not hear him and if she had heard him she would not have believed it possible that he referred to her legs for she wore a very long dress and was always scrupulously particular in the matter of concealing her ankles  fortunately kenneth observed her danger and pulled her out of the way with unavoidable violence  it cant old on much longer observed niven with a sigh referring to an engine which stood directly opposite to her in tremulous and apparently tremendous anxiety to start  the driver vented his impatience just then by causing the whistle to give three sharp yelps which produced three agonising leaps in the bosoms of miss peppy and mrs niven  couldnt it all be done with a little less noise said miss peppy to kenneth it seems to me so awoh look surely that old gentleman has gone mad  not he said kenneth with a smile he has only lost his wife in the crowd and thinks the train will start before he finds her see she is under the same impression dont you see her rushing wildly about looking for her husband theyll meet in a moment or two if they keep going in the same direction unless that luggagetruck should interfere  lookout sir shouted the porter at that moment  the old gentleman started back and all but knocked over his wife who screamed recognised him and clung to his arm with thankful tenacity  a bell rang  the crowd swayed to and fro agitated people became apparently insane timid people collapsed strong people pushed and weak folk gave way if any man should be sceptical in regard to the doctrine of the thorough depravity of the human heart he can have his unbelief removed by going into and observing the conduct of an eager crowd  what a hinfamous state of things observed mrs niven  yellshriek went the engine whistle drowning miss peppys reply  take your seats roared the guard  the engine gave a sudden snort as if to say youd better else im off without you  now aunt said kenneth come along  in another moment miss peppy was seated in a carriage with her head out of the window talking earnestly and rapidly to mrs niven  it seemed as if she had reserved all the household directions which she had to give to that last inopportune moment  now take good care of emmie niven and dont forget to get her  the remainder was drowned by that irritating whistle  get her what maam  get her shoes mended before sunday and remember that her petticoat was torn when shebless me has that thing burst at last  no maam not yet said niven  now then keep back show your tickets please said the inspector pushing niven aside  imperence muttered the offended housekeeper again advancing to the window when the man had passed  as the train was evidently about to start miss peppys memory became suddenly very acute and a rush of forgotten directions almost choked her as she leaned out of the window  oh  niven i forgotthethedear me what is it  i know it so well when im not in a flurry  its awful to be subjected so constantly to the childs history of england thats iton the top of mymywhich trunk can it be  i know oh yes the leather one  emmie is to read well now that is too bad  as miss peppy stopped and fumbled in her pocket inquiringly mrs niven asked in some concern if it was her purse  no its my thimble ah here it is theres a corner in that pocket where everything seems towell shriek from the whistle oh and andthe bakers bookit must beby the bye thats well remembered you must get money from mr stuart  what now maam inquired mrs niven as miss peppy again paused and grew pale  the key  of the press inquired niven  yesno that is its the key of the press and not the key of my trunk  here take it she thrust the key into the housekeepers hand just as the engine gave a violent snort what shall i do  my trunk wont open without at least i suppose it wont and its a new lock what shall  make a parcel of the key niven said kenneth coming to the rescue and send it by the guard of next train  and oh shrieked miss peppy as the train began to move i forgot thethe  yes yes quick maam cried niven eagerly as she followed  oh cant they stop the train for a moment  its theitsdear me the piepie  what pie maam  theres three of themfor my brothers dinneri forgot to tell cook itll put him out sotheres three of em  its not thethetwo but thetheother one the whatdyecallit pie  miss peppy fell back on her seat and gave it up with a groan  suddenly she sprang up and thrust out her headthe deer pie she yelled  the dear pie echoed the astonished mrs niven interrogatively  another moment and miss peppy vanished from the scene leaving the housekeeper to return home in despair from which condition she was relieved by the cook who at once concluded that the dear pie must mean the venison pasty and forthwith prepared the dish for dinner    chapter twenty five  perplexities and musical charms  my son gildart with his hands in his pockets and his cap very much on one side of his head entered my drawingroom one morning with a perplexed air  what troubles you today asked lizzie gordon who was seated at the window winding up a ball of worsted the skein of which was being held by miss puff who was at that time residing with us  what troubles meeverything troubles me said the middy with a stern air as he turned his back to the fire the world troubles me circumstances trouble me my heart troubles me my pocket troubles me my friends and relations trouble me and so do my enemies in fact it would be difficult to name the sublunary creature or thing that does not trouble me  it blows trouble from every point of the compass a peculiarity in moral gales that is never observed in physical breezes  how philosophically you talk this morning observed lizzie with a laugh  may it not be just possible that the trouble instead of flowing from all points to you as a centre wells up within and flows out in all directions and that a warped mind inverts the process  perhaps you are right sweet cousin  anyhow we cant be both wrong which is a comfort  may i ask what is the hearttrouble you complain of said lizzie  love and hatred replied gildart with a sigh and a frown  indeed  is the name of the beloved object a secret  of course said the middy with a pointed glance at miss puff who blushed scarlet from the roots of her hair to the edge of her dress perhaps to the points of her toesi am inclined to think so of course it is but the hated objects name is no secret  it is haco barepoles  the mad skipper exclaimed lizzie in surprise  i thought he was the most amiable man in existence  every one speaks well of him  it may be so but i hate him  the hatred is peculiar though i believe not incurable but at present it is powerful  that preposterous giant that fathom and four inches of conceit that insufferable disgrace to his cloth that huge mass of human bones in a pigskinhehe bothers me  but how does he bother you  well in the first place he positively refuses to let his daughter susan marry dan horsey and i have set my heart on that match for susan is a favourite of mine and dan is a capital fellow though he is a groom and a scoundreland nothing would delight me more than to bother our cook who is a perfect vixen and would naturally die of vexation if these two were spliced besides i want a dance at a wedding or a shindy of some sort before setting sail for the land of spices and niggers  haco puts a stop to all that but worse still when i was down at the sailors home the other day i heard him telling some wonderful stories to the men there in one of which he boasted that he had never been taken by surprise nor got a start in his life that a twentyfour pounder had once burst at his side and cut the head clean off a comrade without causing his nerves to shake or his pulse to increase a bit  i laid him a bet of ten pounds on the spot that i could give him a fright and he took it at once  now i cant for the life of me think how to give him a fright yet i must do it somehow for it will never do to be beat  couldnt you shoot off a pistol at his ear suggested lizzie  miss puff sniggered and gildart said he might as well try to startle him with a sneeze  get up a ghost then said lizzie i have known a ghost act with great effect on a dark night in an outoftheway place  no use returned gildart shaking his head  haco has seen ghosts enough to frighten a squadron of horsemarines  miss puff sniggered again and continued to do so until her puffy face and neck became extremely pink and dangerously inflated insomuch that gildart asked her somewhat abruptly what in the world she was laughing at  miss puff said she wouldnt tell and gildart insisted that she would but she positively declined until gildart dragged her forcibly from her chair into a windowrecess where she was prevailed on to whisper the ideas that made her laugh  capital exclaimed the middy chuckling as he issued from the recess ill try it  youre a charming creature puff with an imagination worthy the owner of a better name  there dont pout  you know my sentiments  adieu fair cousin  puff goodbye  so saying the volatile youth left the room  that afternoon gildart sauntered down to the sailors home and entered the public hall in which a dozen or two of sailors were engaged in playing draughts or chatting together  he glanced round but not finding the object of his search was about to leave when dan horsey came up and touching his hat asked if he were looking for haco barepoles  i am said gildart  so is meself said dan but the mad skipper ant aisy to git howld of an not aisy to kape howld of when yeve got him  hes goin to cove this afternoon i believe anll be here before startin so im towld so im waitin for him  as he spoke haco entered and dan delivered a letter to him  who from inquired the skipper sternly  mr stuart alias the guvnor replied dan with extreme affability an as no answer is required ill take my leave with your highnesss permission  haco deigned no reply but turned to gildart and held out his hand  youve not gone to stay at cove yet i see said gildart  not yet lad but i go tonight at nine oclock  you see mrs gaff is agoin to visit a relation for a week an wants me to take care o the house the boodwar as she calls it though why she calls it by that name is more than i can tell  however ill be here for a week yet as the coffin wants a few repairs i wonder if it ever didnt want repairs an i may as well be there as in the home though im bound to say the home is as good a lodgin as ever i was in at home or abroad and cheap too an they looks arter you so well  the only thing i ant sure of is whether the repairs is to be done here or in athenbury  the letter from mr stuart may bear on that point suggested gildart  true replied the skipper opening the letter  ha sure enough the repairs is to be done there so ill have to cut my visit to cove short by four days  but youll sleep there tonight i suppose asked gildart with more anxiety than the subject seemed to warrant  ay no doubt o that for mrs g and tottie left this mornin trustin to my comin down in the evenin but i cant get before nine oclock  well goodday to you said gildart i hope youll enjoy yourself at cove  the middy hastened away from the sailors home with the air of a man who had business on hand  turning the corner of a street he came upon a brass band the tones of which were rendering all the bilious people within hearing almost unable to support existence  there was one irascible old gentleman a lawyer under whose window it was braying who sat at his desk with a finger in each ear trying to make sense out of a legal document  this was a difficult task at any time for the legal document was compounded chiefly of nonsense with the smallest possible modicum of sense scattered through it  in the circumstances the thing was impossible so the lawyer rose and stamped about the floor and wished he were the emperor of russia with a cannon charged with grapeshot loaded to the muzzle and pointed at the centre of that brass band in which case he would  well the old gentleman never thought out the sentence but he stamped on and raved a little as the band brayed below his window  there was a sick man in a room not far from the old lawyers office  he had spent two days and two nights in the delirium of fever  at last the doctor succeeded in getting him to fall into a slumber  it was not a very sound one but such as it was it was of inestimable value to the sick man  the brass band however brayed the slumber away to the strains of rule britannia and effectually restored the delirium with god save the queen  there were many other interesting little scenes enacted in that street in consequence of the harmonious music of that brass band but i shall refrain from entering into farther particulars  suffice it to say that gildart stood listening to it for some time with evident delight  splendid he muttered as an absolutely appalling burst of discord rent the surrounding air and left it in tatters  magnificent  i think that will do  you seem fond of bad music sir observed an elderly gentleman who had been standing near a doorway looking at the middy with a quiet smile  yes on the present occasion i am replied gildart discord suits my taste just now and noise is pleasant to my ear  the band ceased to play at that moment and gildart stepping up to the man who appeared to be the leader inasmuch as he performed on the clarionet asked him to turn aside with him for a few minutes  the man obeyed with a look of surprise not unmingled with suspicion  you are leader of this band  yes sir i ham  have you any objection to earn a sovereign or two  no sir i hant  its a goodish band observed gildart  a fusrater replied the clarionet  no doubt the trombone is a little cracked and brassy so to speak because of a hinfluenza as has wonted him for some weeks but theres good stuff in im sir and plenty o lungs  the keybugle is a noo and but es capital ticklerly in the igh notes an flats besides bein young ell improve  as to the french orn there aint his ekal in the country wen he does the pathetic it would make a banker weep  you like pathetic music sir  not much replied the middy  no now thats hodd  i do  it armonises so with the usual state o my feelins  my feelins is amost always pathetic sir  indeed  yes cept at mealtimes wen i do manage to git a little jolly  ah sir music aint wot it used to be  theres a general flatness about it now sir an people dont seem to admire it alf so much as wen i first began  but if you dont like the pathetic praps you like the bravoory style  i doat on it said gildart  come lets have a touch of the bravoory  ive got a piece said the clarionet slowly looking at the sky with a pathetic air a piece as i composed myself  i dont often play it cause you know sir one doesnt xactly like to shove onesself too prominently afore the public  i calls it the bangingsmash polka but i generally charge hextra for it for its dreadful hard on the lungs and the trombone he gets cross when i mention it for it nearly busts the hinstrument besides it kicks up sich a row that it puts the french orns nose out o jintyou cant ear a note of him  i flatter myself that the keybugle plays his part to parfection but the piece was written chiefly for the trombone and clarionet the one being deep and crashing the other shrill and high  i had the battle o waterloo in my mind wen i wrote it  will that do said gildart putting halfacrown into the mans hand  the clarionet nodded and turning to his comrades winked gravely as he pronounced the magic wordbangingsmash  next moment there was a burst as if a bombshell had torn up the street and this was followed up by a series of crashes so rapid violent and wildly intermingled that the middys heart almost leapt out of him with delight  in a few seconds three doors burst open and three servantgirls rushed at the band with three sixpences to beseech it to go away  couldnt go under a shillin a head said the clarionet gravely  a word from gildart however induced him to accept of the bribe and depart  as they went along the street gildart walked with the clarionet and held earnest converse with himapparently of a persuasive nature for the clarionet frequently shook his head and appeared to remonstrate presently he called on his comrades to stop and held with them a long palaver in which the french horn seemed to be an objector and the trombone an assenter while the keybugle didnt seem to care  at last they all came to an agreement  now said the middy taking out his purse thats all fixed here is five shillings in advance and twenty shillings will follow when the performance is over  dont forget the time and place the village of cove the rear of stephen gaffs cottageeverybody knows itand eight oclock precisely    chapter twenty six  mad haco startled at last  that evening haco barepoles was seen on the road to cove with his coatskirts his cravatends and his hair streaming in the breeze  an hour previously however a brass band was seen walking towards the same place and half an hour after that a young midshipman was observed posting rapidly in the same direction  it was dark when gildart entered the village and all the inhabitants were in their dwellings so that he reached gaffs cottage unperceived  the village was a primitive one  locks were deemed unnecessary in most of the cottages probably because there was nothing worth stealing within them  gildart lifted the latch and entered  a fire nearly out with a large piece of coal on it burned in the grate  the flicker of this was sufficient to illuminate the boudoir faintly  having surveyed the apartment examined the closet and looked under the bed he went out and going to the back of the cottage found the band waiting in some anxiety  now lads come this way said gildart and theres only one piece of advice ive got to give you dont stir hand or foot after haco enters the cottage  hes as big as an elephant and strong as a lion  if you stir and he finds you out he wont spare you  but you promise to come to the rescue master said the french horn in some alarm  ay that will i but hell have two of you floored another strangled and the fourth halfskinned before i can get him to stop  i dont half like it said the clarionet anxiously  pooh pooh exclaimed the keybugle well be more than a match for him come on its worth riskin for twentyfive bob  hear hear cried the trombone  well then enter said gildart pushing open the door and holding it while the band filed into the passage  he followed them and closed the door  in a short time haco barepoles made his appearance  he also passed through the village unobserved and entering the cottage closed the door  thereafter he proceeded to make himself comfortable  the boodwar was emptyat least of human beings though there was the dutch clock with the horrified countenance in the corner and the new clock near it and the portraits and the great fourposter and all the other articles of elegance and luxury with which mrs gaff had filled her humble dwelling  a queer place muttered the mad skipper in a soft voice to himself as he moved about the room poked up the fire and made preparations for spending the night  gaff wouldnt know the old cabinhumph but its all done out o kindness well well theres no accountin for women theyre paridoxies  hallo this here closet didnt use to be bolted but its bolted now  howsever heres the loaf and the teapot an the kettle  now mrs gaff youre an attentive creetur nevertheless youve forgot bilin water an moreover there ant no water in the house  ah heres a bucket thatll do ill go to the well an help myself its well that i can do it said haco chuckling at his own pun with great satisfaction as he went out to the back of the house  there was a sudden though not loud sound of hollow brass chinking under the fourpost bed  now then cant you keep still said the clarionet in a hoarse whisper  its cramp in my leg growled the trombone  id have had to come out if he hadnt guv me this chance  wont you hold your tongues whispered gildart from the closet the door of which he opened slightly  he shut it with a sudden clap and there was another clanking of brass as hacos footsteps were heard outside but dead silence reigned within the hut when the skipper reentered and set down on the floor a large bucket full of water  now then for tea said haco rubbing his hands as he set about the preparation of that meal  being acquainted with the ways and localities of the cottage he speedily had the board spread and the tea smoking thereon while the fire flared cheerfully on the walls casting fine effects of light and shade on the pictures and sprinkling the prominences of the clocks bed and furniture with ruddy gleams  having devoured his meal with an appetite and gusto worthy of his size haco filled his muchloved german pipe and selecting the strongest chair in the room sat cautiously down on it beside the fire to enjoy a smoke  meanwhile the brass band endured agonies unutterable  the trombone afterwards vowed that he wouldnt for fifty sovs again go through what he had suffered during the hour that the mad skipper sat by that fire enjoying his evening pipe  at last the pipe was smoked out and haco began to divest himself of his upper garments  being an active man he was soon undressed and in bed where he lay for a long time perfectly still  presently he gave vent to a deep sigh and turned on his back in which position he lay quite still for at least five minutes  at last he gave a soft puff with his lips and followed it up with a mild snort from his nose  this was immediately followed by a light single tap at the closet door  instantly the first bar of the bangingsmash polka burst from beneath the bed with such startling suddenness and energy that gildart was himself rendered almost breathless  haco awoke with a yell so dreadful that the brass band stopped for a single instant but it burst forth again with a degree of fury that almost rent the trombone in twain  the appalled skipper uttered another yell and sprang up into the air the fourposter could not stand the test  haco went crashing through the bottom of the bed flattened the french horn and almost killed the trombone while the broken ends of the planking of the bed pinned them to the floor  escape was impossible  haco perceived the joke and instantly recovered his selfpossession springing from the bed he seized the bucket of water which he had recently drawn and dashed its contents on the struggling band thereafter he hauled the trombone out of the debris by the neck flattened his instrument on his head and twisted it round his neck the keybugle who had struggled to his feet fell before a wellaimed backhander and the french horn was about to perish when gildart succeeded in restraining and pacifying the giant by stoutly asserting that he had won his bet and insisted on having payment on the spot  haco burst into a loud laugh flung the keybugle from his grasp and pulled on his nether garments  i confess that youve won it lad so now ill have another pipe  he proceeded to fill the german pipe and stirred up the fire while the band made good its retreat  gildart paid the clarionet the stipulated sum of twenty shillings outside the door after which he returned and seated himself beside the mad skipper  hacos laugh had changed into a goodhumoured smile as he gazed into the fire and puffed volumes of smoke from his lips  it was a risky thing to do lad he observed as gildart sat down its well for that feller wi the long trumpet that the brass was so thin and his head so hard for my blood was up bein taken by surprise you see an i didnt measure my blows  howsever its all well that ends well as i once heard a playactor say  but its not ended yet said gildart with decision  how so lad  youve got to pay up your bet  hacos brow became a little clouded  the bet had been taken more than half in joke for he was not given to betting in earnest but he was too proud to admit this on finding that gildart took it in earnest  youll not want it for a short while i daresay he asked  captain barepoles  skipper lad i dont like to be capned  well skipper barepoles said the middy with much solemnity i always pay my debts of honour on the spot and i expect gentlemen who bet with me to do the same  haco grinned  but i ant a gentleman said he an i dont set up for one  still as a man of honour you must feel bound  no lad not as a man of honour interrupted the skipper but as a british seaman ill hold the debt due only not bein in the habit o carrying the bank of england in my weskitpocket you see i must ask you to wait till tomorrow mornin  haco said this with a slightly disappointed look for he thought the middy rather sharp and had formed a better opinion of him than his conduct on this occasion seemed to bear out  now skipper ill tell you what it is  i am not fond of betting and this bet of mine was taken in jest in fact my usual bet is ten thousand pounds sometimes a million  nevertheless you have admitted the debt as due and although i do not mean to claim payment in the usual way i dont intend to forego my rights altogether  ill only ask you to do me a favour  what may it be lad  will you grant it  well that depends  no it doesnt say yes or ill claim the ten pounds  well yes if its right and proper for me to do it  now what dye want  humph  well then said gildart i want you to let your daughter susan get spliced to dan horsey  haco frowned and said unpossible  come now dont be hard on them skipper dan is a good fellow and a firstrate groom  hes an irish blackguard said haco and not worth a pinch of his namesake  youre quite mistaken said gildart who went on to speak so highly of the groom that haco if not made to change his opinion was so much impressed as to agree at least to take the whole subject once again into consideration  another thing i wish you to do skipper which is to give me a passage in your sloop to athenbury  you spoke of running round there for repairs soon and i would rather go by sea than by that snorting railway  will you do it  with pleasure lad  thankee now ill bid you goodnight  you may depend upon it that you wont be disturbed again by a band said gildart laughing  i know that replied haco with a grin its my opinion theyve had enough of me for one night  but wont ye stop an share the fourposter lad  its big enough an well soon repair the damage to its bottomtimbers  theres a knuckle o ham too an a flask o claret  i brought it with me cause i never drink nothin stronger than claretvang ordinair they calls it in france  what say you youll stop  no thankee skipper much obliged but ive business on hand elsewhere  goodnight old boy    chapter twenty seven  plot and counterplot ending in a long chase  one day not long after his arrival at athenbury kenneth stuart was seated in colonel crustys drawingroom awaiting the summons to dinner  pretty bella sat beside him endeavouring to get up a flirtationfor bella was an inveterate flirt  besides being pretty she was sprightly and full of lifea giddy gay thing much addicted to that dangerous practice of fluttering round improprieties with cheerful recklessness she was one of those human moths whose wings alas are being constantly singed sometimes burned off altogether  kenneth was not so stern as to object to a little of what the world calls innocent flirtation but he did not like bellas style of procedure for that charming piece of wickedness made it her aim in life to bring as many lovers to her feet as she could and keep them there she never had too many of them never tired of conquering them  in the language of pugilists one down another come on was her motto  she had just floored a captain of dragoons who was expected that day to dinner and was now engaged at her fortieth round with kenneth but he was too strong for herat least she began to suspect so and felt nettled  i never met with such a provoking man as you said bella pouting you promised to go round by simpsons and bring me a bouquet and now you tell me you had not time  that is not what i would have expected of you  sir kenneth  bella had knighted him with the poker the evening before  well really i am sorry said kenneth in a deprecating tone but im sure you will forgive me when i tell you that  i wont forgive you interrupted bella pettishly  you are a false man  nothing should have prevented you from walking round by simpsons as you said you would do  indeed said kenneth smiling suppose i had broken my leg now would that not have  no it wouldnt have been any excuse at all  you would have hopped there if you had been a good and true man like the knights of the olden time  oh how i love that olden time and wish that i had been born in it  captain bowels was announced at this moment  he was a tall handsome man with a heavy dark moustache and a set of brilliant teeth  bella instantly put the question to him whether in the event of his being interrupted in the fulfilment of a promise to a lady by the accident of having his leg broken he would not deem it his duty as a man of honour to hop out the engagement  the captain expressed his earnest belief that that would be his duty and added that if both legs happened to be broken he would deem it his duty to walk out the engagement on his hands and knees always assuming that the lady to whom the promise was made should be young and beautiful and that the engagement did not involve dancing  from this point bella and the captain of dragoons cantered off into a region of smalltalk whither it is not necessary that we should follow them  they were interrupted by the entrance of colonel crusty and miss peppy  the former shook hands with the captain somewhat stiffly and introduced him to miss peppy  dinner late as usual bella said the colonel taking out his watch  now papa dont begin cried bella running up to her father and kissing his cheek because when you do begin to scold you never stop and it takes away your appetite  dinners were meant to be lateits the nature of such meals  no dinner that is ready at the appointed time can be good it must be underdone  the colonel was prevented from replying by the entrance of the footman with a letter which he presented to kenneth  no letters for me cried miss peppy with a slight look of disappointment but to be sure im not at home though after all letters might come to me when im away if they were only rightly addressed but letters are never legible on the back it is a perfect mystery to me how the postmen ever find out where to go to with letters and they are such illiterate men too  but what can one expect in a world of inconsistencies where things are all topsyturvy so to speak though i dont like slang and never use it except when there is a want of a proper whatdyecallit to express ones thingumyjigs  dont you think so captain bowels  certainly i think your observations are very just and much to the point  kenneth stuart retired to a window and read his letter which ran as follows  wreckumoft etcetera  my dear kennethsince you left i have been thinking over your affairs and our last conversation which you must allow me to style disagreeable in regard to miss gordon  i trust that you have now seen the impropriety of thinking of that portionless girl as your wife  at all events you may rest assured that on the day you marry her you shall be disinherited  you know me well enough to be aware that this is not an idle threat  in the hope and expectation that you will agree with me in this matter i venture to suggest to you the propriety of trying to win the affections of miss crusty  you already know that her fortune will be a large one  i recommend this subject to your earnest consideration  your affectionate father george stuart  deary me kennie said miss peppy in some alarm i hope that nothing has happened  you seem so troubled that  oh nothing of any consequence said kenneth with a laugh as he folded the letter and put it in his pocket  ha your ladylove is unkind cried bella i know it is from her  the writing is not ladylike replied kenneth holding up the back of the letter for inspection  it is a gentlemans hand you see  ladies sometimes write what i may call a masculine hand observed the captain  you are quite right captain bowels said miss peppy some write all angles and some all rounds  one never knows how one is to expect ones correspondents to write  not that i have many but one of them writes square a most extraordinary hand and quite illegible  most people seem to be proud of not being able to write except schoolboys and girls  there is no accounting for the surprising things that are scratched on paper with a pen and called writing  but in a world of things of that sort what is one to expect  it is just like all the rest and i have given up thinking about it altogether  i hope you have captain bowels  not quite but very nearly replied the gallant captain  dinner at last said colonel crusty as the gong sounded its hideous though welcome alarm  captain bowels will you take my daughter  miss stuart allow me  sorry weve got no one for you mr stuart  kenneth fancied there was a touch of irony in the last observation but he did not feel jealous for two reasonsfirst he knew from miss peppy that the captain was no favourite with colonel crusty and was only tolerated because of having been introduced by an intimate friend and old school companion of the former and second being already in love with another he did not wish to have the honour of handing bella down to dinner at all  during dinner miss peppy reminded kenneth that he had promised to go to the sailors home that evening with the parcel which mrs gaff wished to be delivered to her cousin george dollins  bella remarked in a sweet voice that sir kenneths promises were not to be relied on and that it would be wiser to transfer the trust to captain bowels a proposal which the gallant captain received with a laugh and a sotto voce remark to bella that his fidelity to promises depended on the youth and beauty of the lady to whom they were made  soon after the ladies retired kenneth rose and apologising for leaving the table so early set forth on his mission  the night was calm and pleasant but darka few stars alone rendering the darkness visible  kenneth had to pass through the garden of the colonels house before reaching the road that led to the heart of the town where the sailors home was situated  he felt sad that evening unusually so and wandered in the grounds for some time in a meditative mood  there was a bower at the extremity of the garden to which during the few days of his visit he had frequently repaired with the volatile bella  he entered it now and sat down  presently there was a rustle among the leaves behind him and a light hand was laid on his shoulder  faithless man said bella in a tremulous voice i have been expecting you for halfanhour at least  my portmanteau is packed and i only await the word from you dearest charles  charles exclaimed kenneth starting up  bella uttered a suppressed scream  oh  mr stuart you wont tell my father  i mistook you for capt  hold miss crusty do not speak hastily  i know nothing of that of which you seem desirous that i should not speak  pray be calm  of course i know that you dont know cried bella passionately but you are capable of guessing andand  the poor girl burst into a flood of tears and rushed from the bower leaving kenneth in a most unenviable state of perplexity  the words that she had uttered coupled with what he had seen of the intimacy subsisting between her and captain bowels and the fact that the name of the captain was charles were quite sufficient to convince him that an immediate elopement was intended  he entertained a strong dislike to the captain and therefore somewhat hastily concluded that he was a villain  impressed with this conviction his first impulse was to return to the house and warn the colonel of his daughters danger but then he felt that he might be mistaken and that instead of doing good he might lay himself open to severe rebuke for interfering in matters with which he had nothing to do  after vacillating therefore a few minutes he at last made up his mind first to execute his errand to the cousin of mrs gaff and then consider what should next be done  he resolved on this course all the more readily that he was sure the mistake bella had made would frustrate the elopement at least on that night  kenneth carried the parcel which mrs gaff had put up with so much care and anxiety under his arm and a thick stick in his right hand  he was so passionately fond of the sea and all connected with it that he liked to dress in semisailor costume and mingle with seamen  consequently he went out on this occasion clad in a rough peajacket and a sailors cap  he looked more like a respectable skipper or firstmate than a country gentleman  passing rapidly through the streets of athenbury he soon reached the docks where he made inquiry for the sailors home  he found it in a retired street near the principal wharf  a group of seamen were collected round the door smoking their pipes and spinning yarns  the glare of a streetlamp shone full upon them enabling kenneth to observe their faces  he went up to one and asked if a sailor of the name of dollins was in the home at the time  the man said dollins had been there that day but he was not within at the present time  he was usually to be found at the tavern of the two bottles  kenneth being directed to the two bottles made his way thither without delay  it was a low publichouse in one of the dirtiest localities of the towna place to which seamen were usually tempted when they came off a voyage and where they were soon fleeced of all their hardlyearned money  sounds of dancing fiddling and drinking were heard to issue from the doorway as kenneth approached and as he descended the stair he could not help wondering that any man should prefer such a place of entertainment to the comfortable clean and respectable home he had just left  he was met by the landlord a large powerful and somewhat jovial man whose countenance betrayed the fact that he indulged freely in his own beverages  is there a sailor here of the name of dollins inquired kenneth  the landlord surveyed the questioner with a look of suspicion  being apparently satisfied that he might be trusted he replied that dollins was not in the house at that moment but he was expected in a few minutes  meanwhile he advised that the visitor should wait and enjoy himself over a pot o beer or a glass o brandy and water ot  kenneth said he would wait and for this purpose entered one of the numerous drinkingstalls and ordered a pot of porter which he had no intention whatever of drinking  seated in the dirty stall of that disreputable publichouse he leaned his head on his hand and began to meditate how he should act in regard to bella crusty on his return to the colonels house  his meditations were interrupted by the entrance of three men into the adjoining stall  two of them belonged to the class of men who are styled roughs one being redhaired the other bearded the third was a gentlemanly sort of man about forty years of age with a dissipated aspect  they did not observe kenneth who had placed himself in the darkest corner of his stall  now lads well talk it over here and settle whats to be done for whatever we do it must be done tonight  this much he heard of the conversation and then his mind wandered away to its former channel  how long he might have meditated is uncertain but he was suddenly aroused by the sound of his own name  well have to do it tonight said a voice which kenneth knew belonged to the gentlemanly man of dissipated aspect the young fellow wont likely go back for a day or two and the old un ant over stout theres only one man in the house besides him and he aint much worth speakin of a groom not very big sleeps in the lower part o the house  old stuart himself sleeps in a wing a good bit off from the servants  in fact theres nothing easier than to get into the house and theres no end of silver plate  now what say you to start by the nine oclock train tonight  well get there by eleven and have supper before goin to work  you see i think its always well to feed before goin at this sort o thing  it dont pay on an empty stomach  shall we go  kenneths heart beat fast as he listened for the reply  wall i doant much loik it said one of the roughs in a coarse yorkshire dialect but im hard oop for tin so i says yes  agreed said the other rough who was evidently not a man of many words  for some time kenneth sat listening to the plans of the burglars and considering how he should best frustrate their designs  he at length made up his mind to return the parcel to his aunt say that unexpected and pressing business called him home and start by the same train with the burglars for wreckumoft  his intentions however were interfered with by the abrupt entrance of dollins who was drunk and who on being told that a friend wanted to see him within came forward to kenneth and asked wot it wos e wanted  kenneth explained that he had been sent by a lady to deliver a parcel which he presented and having fulfilled his mission was about to return when the man caught him by the sleeve  wot are you mister stuart  jess gaff wrote me a letter a day or two ago tellin me you and yer aunt miss peppy as they calls her wos acomin here and would send me a parcel  never mind my good fellow who i am said kenneth sharply ive delivered the parcel so now ill bid ye goodnight  its just him said one of the burglars in a hoarse whisper as kenneth reached the door  the latter could not avoid turning round at this  yes he cried sternly and ill spoil your game for you tonight  will you shouted the gentlemanly housebreaker as kenneth sprang into the street closely followed by the three men  kenneth regretted deeply that he had so hastily uttered the threat for it showed that he knew all and set the men upon their guard  he looked over his shoulder and observed that they had stopped as if to consult so he pushed on and soon reaching one of the principal thoroughfares walked at a more leisurely pace  as he went along he was deeply perplexed as to what course he ought to pursue and while meditating on the subject he stopped almost unintentionally in front of a brilliantly lighted window in which were hanging a rich assortment of watches gold chains and specimens of jewellery  the gentlemanly housebreaker who had followed him up observed this a sudden thought flashed across his mind and he at once acted upon it stepping quickly up to kenneths side he stumbled violently against him at the same time smashed a pane of glass in the shopwindow with his gloved hand turned quickly round seized kenneth by the collar and shouted thief help at the full pitch of his voice  the redhaired and bearded accomplices at once responded to the call came up behind and also collared him while a policeman who chanced to be passing at the moment seized him in front  the shopman ran out in a frantic state and at once swore that he was the man for he had seen him looking through the window a moment before  the whole scene passed in a few seconds and kenneth thoroughly taken by surprise stood in motionless and speechless amazement  it is said and apparently with truth that thought flashes through the mind more rapidly than lightning darts through the sky  kenneth had only a few moments to think for the policeman was applying that gentle force to his collar which was meant as a polite hint to come along quietly else stronger force should be applied yet before he had taken the first step towards the policeoffice the extreme awkwardness of his position was fully impressed on him  he perceived that he should certainly be locked up for the night and brought before a magistrate next morning and that although his accusers would of course not appear against him and his friends would be there to testify to his character and get him off the consequence would be that the burglars would be able to start by the nine oclock train and accomplish their purpose while he was in jail  it did occur to him that he could warn the authorities but he feared that they might refuse to believe or act upon the statements of a supposed thief  the occasion was not a favourable one to correct or clear reasoning however and as the policeman had applied a second persuasive pull to his collar he suddenly made up his mind what he would do  grasping the gentlemanly housebreaker by the waist he suddenly hurled that unfortunate heels over head into the kennel tripped up the policeman knocked the bearded accomplice into the arms of the jeweller the redhaired one into the broken window and bolted  instantly a wild chase began  the crowd that had assembled on the first sound of the smash ran yelling after him headed by the gentlemanly housebreaker whose fall had been partially broken by a little boy the accomplices were too much damaged to do more than keep up with the tail of the crowd  at first kenneth ran without regard to direction and with the simple view of escaping but as he neared the head of the main street he determined to make for the house of colonel crusty  being fleet of foot he soon left behind the mass of the crowd that followed in full cry with the exception of a few young men who were more of a match for him ahead of all these ran the gentlemanly housebreaker and the policeman both of whom were strong and supple  the roar of the augmenting crowd however soon became so great that people in advance of him heard it and some of these made demonstrations of a wish to try to stop him as he passed but most of them wisely concluded that it would be nearly as safe to place themselves in the way of a runaway locomotive engine  one man proved an exception  he was a butcher of great size and strength who being accustomed to knock down horned cattle with a hammer naturally enough thought it not impossible to knock down a man with his fist so he tried it  standing in the doorway of his own shop when kenneth came tearing along he waited until he was within four yards of him and darted out kenneth had fortunately observed the man  he stooped without slackening his pace to let the blow delivered by his opponent pass over his head and drove his right shoulder into the butchers broad chest the shock was so great as to completely check his career while it sent the butcher back into his shop over his own bench and prostrated him on the carcase of a slaughtered ox which had been carried in just two minutes before as if to form a bloody and congenial bed for its owner  kenneth instantly started off again and doubled suddenly down a bystreet which led to the colonels residence  here he was smitten with a feeling of shame at the idea of appearing before his friends in such a plight so changing his mind he doubled again into another bystreet  this chanced to be an unfortunate turn for the policeman saw him take it and knowing every intricacy of the town he was enabled to take a cross cut by a lane accompanied by several of his brother constables who had joined him by this time and by such of the crowd as were good runners  the worst runners now came in for an unexpected share of the sport in consequence of this new turn of affairs for the byroad conducted kenneth back to the main street and when he debouched into it he ran into and overturned a number of those who had just made up their minds that it was useless for them to run any farther  the tide was now turned  the head of the crowd came rushing back led by the policeman and the gentlemanly burglar  kenneth thus found himself between two fires so like a wise general he made a flank movement crossed the street and darted down a dark lane  here the crowd gave in but the policeman and the burglar continued the pursuit  the lane led to the suburbs of the town and the fugitive soon gained the open country which in that part was a sort of uncultivated moorland  the excitement of the chase and the suddenness of it had told upon the youth at first so much that he had been somewhat distressed while running but this feeling now began to wear off  like a true thoroughbred he improved in condition the longer he ran and when at last the perspiration began to pour over his cheeks he felt as if he could have run on for ever  to some extent this feeling was also experienced by a few of his pursuers who kept him well in view  on passing over a rising ground which for some minutes concealed him kenneth suddenly resolved to strike aside from the high road and cross the moor  it was sufficiently light he thought to enable him to do this with safety  he was wrong however for he had not run a hundred yards when he went splashing into a boggy place and his pursuers who had again caught sight of him instantly followed  the running now became very severe and tested kenneths powers to the utmost  of course it also proved as hard on the others and he had at least the satisfaction of hearing them shout and gasp as they tumbled over stones and into hollows  still they held on with unflagging vigour until they were almost exhausted and quite covered with mud  to kenneths relief he unexpectedly stumbled on the high road again here he sat down for a few seconds to recover breath on one of the grey boulder stones with which the whole country was covered and while wiping the perspiration from his brow his thoughts were busy  having left his pursuers far behind he felt sure that he could afford to rest for a few moments  it occurred to him that even although he should succeed in escaping there was no chance of his being able to get away by the train from athenbury for the burglars and police would certainly be at the station on the lookout for him  he remembered suddenly that there was a station twenty miles from athenbury at which the ten oclock train usually stopped  it was two hours yet to the starting of the train so that he might count on nearly three to get to the station  ill do it he exclaimed starting up with animation and looking in the direction of the moor  the pursuers were now pretty close to him they panted much and ran very heavily  a quiet smile lit up kenneths countenance for he felt his strength recruited even with the few minutes rest he had obtained  now then let the memory of eton days come over me he muttered as he tied his pockethandkerchief tightly round his waist  pulling his hat firmly down over his brows he prepared to start just as the policemen and the gentlemanly burglar stumbled on to the road in a state of complete exhaustion and covered from head to foot with mud  kenneth could not repress a cheer as he waved his hat to them and shouted farewell  he then turned and stooping low sped over the country like a greyhound  he had not gone above four miles when he overtook a stout countryman in a smockfrock and slouchhat plodding heavily along the road  a new idea flashed into kenneths mind  he resolved to change costumes with this man but felt that he had no time to waste in talking over the subject or explaining why he wanted to do so  he therefore stopped abruptly when close to him and said  my man ive a fancy for your clothes  youll ha to foight for em then  very well begin at once said kenneth buttoning his coat and suddenly seizing the countryman by the throat with a grip that made his eyes almost start out of their sockets  how shall it be wrestling or fisticuffs  but let me advise you to do it at once without fighting for i dont want to hurt you and i do mean to have your clothes besides ill give you mine in exchange  there now strip  there was a fiery vehemence about kenneths manner and look and a tone of command in his voice that there was no resisting especially when it was coupled with such physical strength so the countryman heaved a sigh and took off his smockfrock and hobnailed boots while the supposed highwayman took off his coat and shoes  thatll do you neednt mind the stockings said kenneth as he pulled on his new garments  youll find that you gain considerably by the exchange  thats it now heres a sovereign for you my fine fellow and many thanks  he finished by lifting the slouchhat off the countrymans head and placing his own thereon in its stead  now goodnight  goodnoight replied the man from the sheer force of innate politeness for he stood in such a condition of openmouthed amazement that it was quite plain he did not very well know what he said or did  in another minute kenneth was again coursing along the road at full speed    chapter twenty eight  plotters counterplotted  meanwhile the gentlemanly housebreaker returning to athenbury rejoined his rude colleagues and these three choice spirits after partaking of some refreshment and treating the policeman who first came to their aid to a glass of gin betook themselves to the railway station  he wont come here you may depend ont observed the policeman to the gentlemanly burglar when he had taken his ticket hes too wideawake for that  perhaps not but its as well to watch  yes its as well to watch assented the policeman  besides wideawake fellows overreach themselves sometimes continued the other  i shouldnt wonder now if he had the impudence to come straight here and denounce me as a thief just by way o stoppin me from goin by the train and so having some sort o revenge  ha exclaimed the policeman in a tone and with a slight but peculiar look that made the gentlemanly man feel a little uneasy  the fugitive did not appear however  every face that came on the platform was carefully scrutinised without any result and at length the bell rang  goodnight friend said the burglar slipping a halfcrown into the policemans hand as he was about to jump into the carriage  it was no fault of yours that we didnt catch him  you did your best  yes i did my best  hallo are you going by this train exclaimed the burglar  yes ive got business in wreckumoft so well have the pleasure o travellin together  the gentlemanly man felt that the pleasure would be entirely confined to one side  however he expressed much joy at the prospect of such good company as the policeman sat down beside him  the train gave a pant then a snort then an impatient whistle  then the bell rang a second time the whistle sounded a single note and the carriages moved slowly away  a moment more and they were sweeping out of the station a moment more and they were rushing over the moor another moment and they were dashing through space setting all terrestrial things at naught until a station came in view then the whistle uttered a prolonged shriek and the train began to slow  up to this point the policeman and his friends had sat together in comparative silence  the former put his head out of the window and remarked that there was a feller as would be too late for the train  the moonlight enabled him to perceive that the late man was a labourer of some sort  the train ran into the station and stopped  tickets ready shouted the guard  thatll give him a chance observed the gentlemanly burglar  all right inquired the guard  all right replied the ticketinspector  the bell rang the guard whistled so did the engine it puffed too and the train began to move  look sharp now cried the stationmaster eagerly to some one outside the office  athenbury  here you arefour shillings run  the guard knew that it was a late passenger and being a goodhearted fellow held the door of a carriage open even although the train was on the move  a man in a smockfrock and slouchhat rushed across the platform at this moment and made for the door which the guard held open  jump said the guard  the gentlemanly burglar and the policeman lent their aid to pull the man into the train the door banged and they were away  youve all but missed it said the burglar  the man in the smockfrock pulled his slouchhat well over his eyes and admitted that it was a close shave  then he laid his head on the side of the carriage and breathed hard  take a drop o gin said the burglar in a patronising way itll bring you to in a minute  kenneth knew by his manner that he did not guess who it was that sat beside him so he resolved to accept the offer  thankee i loik gin  it waarms the cockles o yer art it do said kenneth  goin far inquired the policeman  to wreckumoft  you seems to have got on yer sunday trousers observed the policeman  wall there ant no sin in that replied the supposed labourer somewhat sharply  certainly not said the policeman  its a fine night ant it  it is a foine night responded the labourer putting his head out of the window  yes a very fine night repeated the policeman also thrusting his head out at the same window and holding a sotto voce conversation with kenneth the result of which was that he became very merry and confidential and was particularly polite to the burglars insomuch that they thought him one of the jolliest policemen they had ever had to do withand this was not the first they had had to do with by any means  in course of time the train ran into the station at wreckumoft and the occupants poured out on the platform and took their several ways  the three friends kept together and observed that the policeman after bidding them goodbye went away alone as if he had urgent business on hand and was soon lost to view  this was a great relief to them because they could not feel quite at ease in his presence and his going off so promptly showed so they thought that he had not the remotest suspicion of their errand  as for the country fellow in the smockfrock they took no further notice of him after quitting the carriage  had they known his business in wreckumoft that night they might perchance have bestowed upon him very earnest attention  as it was they went off to the blue boar tavern and ordered three welsh rabbits and three pots of porter  meanwhile kenneth took the road to seaside villa  on the way he had to pass bingley hall and rang the bell  the door was opened by susan barepoles  is maister gildart to hoam  susan said he was and kenneth was delighted to find that his change of voice and costume disguised him so completely that susan did not recognise him  i wants to see him  susan bade him wait in the lobby  in a few minutes gildart came down and the country fellow asked to have a word with him in private  the result of this word was that the two sallied forth immediately after and went towards seaside villa  here strange to say they found the policeman standing at the outer gate  kenneth accosted him as if he had expected to meet him  they aint abed yet observed the policeman  no i see that my groom is up and there is a light in my fathers study  ill tap at the grooms window  come in av yer feets clean was dans response to the tap as he opened the shutters and flattened his nose against a pane of glass in order to observe the intruder  dan open the back door and let me in  hallo  mister kenneth  dan vanished at once and opened the door  hush dan is my father at home  he is sur  come in gildart  take care of that constable dan give him his supper  theres work both for him and you tonight  he will explain it to you  saying this kenneth took gildart to the drawingroom and left him there while he went to his fathers study  at first mr stuart was alarmed by the abrupt entrance of the big labourer then he was nettled and disgusted at what he deemed a silly practical joke of his son  ultimately he was astonished and somewhat incredulous in regard to the prospects of housebreaking which his son held out to him  he was so far convinced however as to allow kenneth to make what preparations he pleased and then retired to rest coolly observing that if the burglars did come it was evident they would be well taken care of without his aid and that if they did not come there was no occasion for his losing a nights rest  between two and three oclock that morning three men climbed over the garden wall of seaside villa and having deposited their shoes in a convenient spot went on tiptoe to the diningroom window  here they paused to consult in low whispers  while they were thus engaged three other men watched their movements with earnest solicitude from a neighbouring bush behind which they lay concealed  after a few moments one of the first three went to the window and began to cut out part of a pane of glass with a glaziers diamond  at the same time one of the second threea tall stout man in a smockfrock advanced on tiptoe to watch the operation  when the piece of glass was cut out the first three put their heads together for farther consultation  immediately their respective throats were seized and compressed by three strong pair of hands and the heads were knocked violently together  gildart addressed himself to the redhaired man the policeman devoted himself to the one with the beard and kenneth paid particular attention to the gentlemanly burglar whose expression of countenance on beholding into whose hands he had fallen may be conceived but cannot be described  dan horsey who had also been on the watch suddenly appeared with three pair of handcuffs and applied them with a degree of prompt facility that surprised himself and quite charmed the policeman  thereafter the three astounded burglars were led in triumph into mr stuarts study where that sceptical individual received them in his dressinggown and slippers and had his unbelieving mind convinced then they were conveyed to the lockup where we shall now leave them in peacesatisfied that they are safely in the hands of justice    chapter twenty nine  dreadful suspicions aroused in anxious bosoms  when miss peppy came down to breakfast next morning she found that she was the first of the household to make her appearance  this however was the natural consequence of her commendable desire to be always in good timea desire which resulted in her being at least a quarter of an hour too soon for everything except on those occasions of course when she overslept or was detained by unavoidable circumstances  on the present occasion miss peppy having had a remarkably good nights rest felt placid and looked serene  she passed the spare quarter of an hour in perambulating the room looking at the books and pictures smoothing her cuffs arranging her cap and paying marked attention to a beautiful little dog which was bellas own particular pet and the colonels particular abhorrence because of its tendency to bark suddenly sharply and continuously at every visitor who entered the house  rosebud for thus was it misnamed seemed to be however in no mood to receive attentions that morning  it was evidently ill at ease without apparently knowing why  did it growl then said miss peppy in a reproachful tone as she stooped to pat the head of the spoiled creature  ah it mustnt growl for that is naughty you know darling rosebud  eh doing it again oh bad little snarleywarley growlywowly  doesnt it know that the poet says dogs delight to bark and bite and thatthathe means that they shouldnt delight to do such naughtinesses although after all why they shouldnt when its natural to them i dont know and besides how does he know that they delight to do it  i never saw them look delighted in my life on the contrary theyre very fierce are they not rosebud especially the big ones that sometimes try to worry you  how they can ever want to worry such a pittyitty dear naughty growlywowly snarleywarley as you is quite beyond my comprehension but then you see we live in a world of puzzles you and i rosebud and so its of no use being puzzled because that does no good and only worries one  dont it deary sweety petty  well you cant answer of course though i know that you understand every word i say  miss peppy suddenly shrieked for the sweety petty bit her with sufficient force to show that he was not in a mood to be played with and would do it harder next time  just then the colonel entered and rosebud at once received him with a tornado of maddening yelps so that for at least five minutes it had the entire monopoly of the conversation and miss peppy was obliged to say goodmorning in dumb show  at the same time the colonel frowned fiercely at rosebud and said something which miss peppy could not hear because of the noise but which from the abrupt motion of the lips she suspected must be something very wicked indeed  when the darling creature at last consented to hold its tongue the colonel said  are you aware miss stuart that your nephew has been out all night  no colonel i was not aware of it said miss peppy with a slight elevation of her eyebrows i wonder at it for although he often goes out all night to ride wild horses into the sea and save drowned people and things of that sort he never goes out without telling niven and saying whether or not hes likely to be back soon  besides he always has the doorkey in his pocket when he doesnt forget it which is pretty often  perhaps he had your doorkey in his pocket but after all even if he had that wouldnt alter the fact that hes been out all night  but maybe hes in beddid you look  yes i looked and he has evidently not lain on the bed at all last night  under it suggested miss peppy  the colonel smiled slightly and said that it had not occurred to him to look under the bed  at that moment the door burst open and bellas maid rushing in flung herself on her knees at the colonels feet and clasping her hands cried in piteous tones  oh sir please mercy please  are you mad girl said the colonel with a look of mingled displeasure and anxiety  oh sir no sir butsobshes gone  whos gone girl speak  miss bella sir oh sir run away sir with mr stuart  colonel crusty turned pale and miss peppy fell flat down on the rug in a dead faint crushing rosebud almost to death in her fall  instantly the entire house was in confusion  every one rushed into every room up and down every stair looked into every closet and cupboard and under every bed as well as into every hole and crevice that was not large enough to conceal a rabbit much less a young lady but without avail  there could be no doubt whatever on the subject bella and kenneth were both goneutterly and absolutely  miss peppy alone did not participate in the wild search  that worthy lady lay in a state of insensibility for about five minutes then she suddenly recovered and arose to a sitting posture in which position she remained for a few minutes more and became aware of the fact that her cap was inside the fender and that her hair was dishevelled  wondering what could have caused such an unwonted state of things she gazed pensively round the room and suddenly remembered all about it  up she leaped at once pulled on her cap with the back to the front and rushed up to her own room  on her way and once or twice afterwards she met various members of the household but they were much too wild and reckless to pay any regard to her  she was therefore left unmolested in her farther proceedings  having tied on her bonnet very much awry and put on her shawl exceedingly askew miss peppy went out into the street and going straight up to the first man she saw asked the way to the railway station  being directed she ran thither with a degree of speed that any schoolgirl might have envied  a train was on the point of starting  ticket to wreckumoft she almost screamed into the face of the ticketclerk  which class demanded the clerk with the amiable slowness of a man whose interests are not at stake  first exclaimed miss peppy laying down her purse and telling the calmspirited clerk to help himself  he did so returned the purse and miss peppy rushed to the train and leaped into the first open door  it happened to be that of a third class which was full of navvies and mechanics  you seems to be in a urry maam said one of the former making way for her and wiping the seat beside him with the sleeve of his coat  miss peppy could only exclaim ho yes and cover her face with her handkerchief in which position she remained immovable until the train arrived at wreckumoft despite the kindly efforts at consolation made by the navvy who arranged her shawl and offered her a glass of gin from his own private bottle and finally seeing that all his efforts were fruitless wound up by patting her on the shoulder and advising her to cheer up for wotever it was that ailed her there was sure to be better luck next time  arrived at wreckumoft miss peppy hastened to her brothers residence on the way she had to pass bingley hall and feeling that it would be an unutterable relief to her feelings to tell somebody something or more correctly to tell anybody anything she darted in and met my niece lizzie to whom she stated wildly that bella crusty had run off with kenneth stuart and that in all probability the colonel was mad or dead by that time  having thus let off a little steam the worthy lady rushed out of my house entered the diningroom of seaside villa where she found kenneth and his father seated at breakfast and related to them in wild surprise how that bella and kenneth had run away together the night before and that she had come in hot haste to tell them so but how it happened that kenneth was there and bella not there she could not understand at all and concluding that the incomprehensibilities of the world were culminating and that the sooner she prepared for the final winding up of all terrestrial things the better she ran to her own room embraced the wondering emmie burst into a flood of tears rummaged her pocket for her thimble scissors and key and not finding them there fell into the arms of mrs niven and fainted dead away for the second time that morning    chapter thirty  strange scenes and doings far away  let us turn now to a very different region of the world from that in which the events just narrated took place  it is an island of the sea  nature has been bountiful to that island for there is redundant verdure on every side  paradise of old may have been something like itcould not have been much better physically although it was so in a moral point of view  yet even in that aspect our island is superior to many others for there are only two human beings upon it and these are less sinful specimens of humanity than one usually meets with  they are peculiar too  one is an athletic middleaged man whose clothing is goatskin evidently homemade and cut in sailor fashion  magnificent shaggy locks fall in heavy masses from his head lip and chin  robinson crusoe himself could not have looked grander or more savage in outward aspect  the other is a boya lad  he is a stout wellgrown fellow neither so tall nor so muscular as his companion but giving promise that he will excel him in due time  in the matter of hair his head exhibited locks if possible more curly and redundant while the chin and lip are not yet clothed with young manhoods downy shadow  both the middleaged man and the youth have a pensive expression of countenance but there is a gleam of fire in the eye of the latter and a spice of fun about the corners of his mouth which are wanting in his companion  faither said the lad rising from the rock on which they were seated what are ee thinkin on  ive bin thinkin billy that its nigh five years sin we come here  thats an old thought daddy  may be so lad but its ever with me and never seems to grow old  there was such a tone of melancholy in the remark of our old friend gaff that billy forbore to pursue the subject  my heart is set upon pork today daddy said the buster with a knowing smile  weve had none for three weeks and im gettin tired o yams and cocoanuts and crabs  i shall go huntin again  youve tried it pretty often of late without much luck  so i have but ive tried it often before now with pretty fair luck an what has happened once may happen again so ill try  my motto is never say die  a good one billy stick to it lad said gaff rising  and now well go home to supper  tomorrow well have to mend the fence to keep these same wild pigs youre so anxious to eat out of our garden  the nets need mendin too so youll have to spin a lot more o the cocoanut fibre an ill have to make a fishhook or two for the bones out o which i made the last were too small  father and son wended their way down the steep cliffs of the mountain at the foot of which was their cavern home  whats that exclaimed gaff in a low whisper as they passed along the top of a precipice  pigs said billy with glee hold on now daddy and let me go at em  the buster was no longer the little boy whom i introduced to the reader at the commencement of this narrative  five years residence in the desert island had made him such a strapping young fellow that he seemed much more fitted to cope with a lion than a wild pig  he was not indeed tall but he was unusually strong  gaff sat down on a ledge of rock while billy crept cautiously to the edge of the precipice and looked down  a smile of satisfaction lit up the lads countenance as he beheld a big sow and six young pigs busily engaged in digging up roots directly below him  to seize a large stone and drop it into the centre of the group was the work of a moment  the result was in truth deadly for the heavy stone hit one of the little pigs on the nape of the neck and it sank to the ground with a melancholy squeak which proved to be its last  the crash of the stone and the squeak of the pig caused the rest of the family to turn and fly from the fatal spot with porcine haste filling the air as they ran with shrieks and yells such as only pigsand bad babiesknow how to utter  got him daddyhooray shouted the buster as he leaped up and ran by a circuitous route to the foot of the precipice whence he speedily returned with the pig under his arm  a fat un daddy he observed holding it up by the tail  capital said gaff pinching the pigs sides we shall grub well for some days to come  i should think so daddy why weve more than we know what to do wi for what with the crabpies you made this mornin and the cocoanut soup and yams and dovehash left fro yesterdays dinner an this little grumpy we stand a good chance o aperplexy or somethin o that sort  was there many more o em lad  ay five moloncholly brothers and sisters an a hideously fat mother left to mourn the loss o this chap  ill be after them tomorrow they wont go far for ive noticed that when pigs take a fancy to a spot they dont leave it for a good while  here we are at home an now for a splendid roast  theres nothin like grub when yere hungry  xcept drink when yere dry observed gaff  of coorse an a snooze when yere sleepy but dont lets git too pheelosophical daddy it ant good for digestion to argufy on a empty stummik  an i see ye wants me to argue but i wont do it there now  it was one of billys devices to keep himself and his father cheery in their prolonged exile to pretend that he didnt like to argue and to stoutly assert that he would not do it while at the same time he led his parent into all sorts of discussions  on the present occasion while he was engaged in preparing the pig for the spit and his father was mending the handle of a fishspear of his own fabrication the discussion or rather the conversation turned upon the possibility of two people living happily all their days on a desert island  billy thought it was quite possible if the grub did not fail but gaff shook his head and said it would be a blue lookout if one of them should get ill or break his leg  billy did not agree with this at all he held that if one should get ill it would be great fun for the other to act the part of nurse and doctor while the sick one would learn to value his health more when he got it back  as to breaking a leg why it was no use speculating how things would feel if that should occur as well speak of the condition of things if both of them should break their necks  the discussion diverged as such discussions usually did to home and its inmates long before any satisfactory conclusion was come to and it was brought to a close in consequence of billy having to go out of the cave for firewood to roast the pig  the cavern home had assumed a very different aspect from that which it presented when gaff and his son took possession of it five years before it now bore externally and internally the appearance of an old muchused dwelling  the entrance which was an irregular archway of about ten feet in diameter had been neatly closed up with small trees over which strong banana leaves were fastened so as to make it weathertight  in this screen two holes were lefta small one for a door and a still smaller one for a window  both were fastened with a goatskin curtain which could be let down and fastened at night  in the daytime both door and window were always left wideopen for the island on which our friends had been cast was one of a group of uninhabited islets the climate around which is warm and delightful during the greater part of the year  the ground outside of the cave was trodden by long use to the hardness of stone  the small vegetable garden close to the right of the door was enclosed by a fence which bore evidence of having been more than once renewed and frequently repaired  some of the trees that had been cut downwith stone hatchets made by themselveswhen they first arrived had several tall and sturdy shoots rising from the roots there was a flat stone deeply hollowed out by constant sharpening of the said hatchet  there was a rustic seat the handiwork of billy that bore symptoms of having been much sat upon  there were sundry footpaths radiating into the woods that were beginning to assume the hardness and dimensions of respectable roads while all round the place there were signs and symptoms of the busy hand of man having been at work there for years  high up on a mighty cliff that overlooked and almost overhung the sea a rude flagstaff had been raised  this was among the first pieces of work that gaff and his son had engaged in after landing  it stood on what they termed signal cliff and was meant to attract the attention of any vessel that might chance to pass  to signal cliff did gaff and billy repair each morning at daylight as regularly as clockwork to hoist their flag made from cocoanut fibre and with equal regularity did billy go each night at sunset to haul the ensign down  many an anxious hour did they spend there together gazing wistfully at the horizon and thinking if not talking of home  but ships seldom visited that sea  twice only during their exile did they at long intervals descry a sail but on both occasions their flag failed to attract attention and the hopes which had suddenly burst up with a fierce flame in their breasts were doomed to sink again in disappointment  at first they had many false alarms and frequently mistook a seagull in the distance for a sail but such mistakes became less frequent as their hopes became less sanguine and their perceptions from practice more acute  sometimes they sat there for hours together  sometimes when busy with household arrangements or equipped for fishing and hunting they merely ran to hoist the flag but never once did they fail to pay signal cliff a daily visit  on sundays in particular they were wont to spend the greater part of their time there reading the new testament  it happened that just before gaff left cove in the sloop of haco barepoles lizzie gordon had presented him with a testament  being a seriouslyminded man he had received the gift with gratitude and carried it to sea with him  afterwards when he and poor billy were enduring the miseries of the voyage in the whaleship gaff got out the testament and aided by billy tried to spell it out and seek for consolation in it  he thus got into a habit of carrying it in his coatpocket and it was there when he was cast on the desert island  although of course much damaged with water it was not destroyed for its clasp happened to be a very tight one and tended greatly to preserve it  when father and son finally took up their abode in the cavern the former resolved to devote some time night and morning to reading the testament  he could spell out the capital letters and billy had before quitting home got the length of reading words of one syllable  their united knowledge was thus very slight but it was quite sufficient to enable them to overcome all difficulties and in time they became excellent readers  the story of christs redeeming love wrought its legitimate work on father and son and ere long the former added prayer to the morning and evening reading of the word  gradually the broken sentences of prayer for the holy spirit that light might be shed upon what they read were followed by earnest confessions of sin and petitions for pardon for christs sake  friends too were remembered for it is one of the peculiar consequences of the renewal of the human heart that the subjects of this renewal begin to think of the souls of others as well as of their own  unbelievers deem this presumptuous and hypocritical forgetting that if they were called upon to act in similar circumstances they would be necessarily and inevitably quite as presumptuous and that the insulting manner in which the efforts of believers are often received puts hypocrisy out of the question  be this as it may gaff prayed for his wife and child at first and when his heart began to warm and expand for his relatives and friends also  he became more earnest perhaps when he prayed that a ship might be sent to take them from the island and in making this and his other petitions he might have given an instructive lesson to many divines of the present day showing how wonderfully eloquent a man may be if he will only strive after nothing in the way of eloquence and simply use the tones and language that god has given him but all his prayers were wound up with thy will be done and all were put up in the name of jesus christ  to return from this digression  the inside of the cavern bore not less evidence of longcontinued occupation than the outside  there was a block of wood which served father and son for a seat which had two distinct and highlypolished marks on it  there was a rude table whose cut scratched and hacked surface suggested the idea of many a culinary essay and many a good meal  there was a very simple grate composed of several stones which were blackened and whitened with soot and fire there was no chimney however for the roof of the cave was so high that all smoke dissipated itself there and found an exit no one knew how in a recess there was a sort of small raised platform covered with soft herbage and blankets of cocoanut fibre on which every night father and son lay down together  the entrance to the inner cave which formed a storeroom and pantry was covered with a curtain so that the habitation with its rocky walls earthen floor and stalactite roof had quite a snug and cosy appearance  soon billy returned with an armful of dry wood  have ye got a light yet daddy  gaff who had been endeavouring to produce a light by using his knife on a bit of flint for five or ten minutes said he had just got it and proved the truth of his assertion by handing his son a mass of smoking material  billy blew this into a flame and applied it to the wood which soon kindled into a roaring fire  now then cried the buster wheres the spit  ah thats it here you go oh dear how you would yell just now mister grumpy if you were alive  its a cruel thought but i cant help it  there now frizzle away and ill go clean up my dishes while you are roasting  no sooner had the pig been put on the spit and the first fumes arisen than there was a loud yell in the forest followed immediately by the pattering of small feet as if in tremendous haste  aha  squeaky i knew you would smell out the supper double quick cried billy with a laugh as he looked towards the door  he never misses it said gaff with a quiet smile  next moment a small pig came scampering into the cave and rushed up to the fire where it sat down promptly as if the sole object it had in view were to warm itself  and this was indeed its only object for that pig was passionately ludicrously fond of the fire  it was a pet pig  one day when billy was out hunting he had caught it in a somewhat singular fashion  he usually went out hunting with a bow and arrow of his own making and was very successful in bringing down white doves parroquets and such creatures but could make nothing of the pigs whose skins were too tough for his wooden and unshod arrows  he let fly at them nevertheless when he got a chance  well on the day referred to billy had shot nothing and was returning home in a somewhat pensive mood when he heard a squeak and at once fitted an arrow to his bow  a rush followed the squeak and dreadful yells accompanied the rushyells which were intensified if possible when billys arrow went into an old sows ear after glancing off the back of one of her little ones  billy ran after them in wild despair for he knew that the shot was thrown away  one of the pigs had sprained its ankle apparently for it could only run on three legs  this pig fell behind billy ran after it overtook it fell upon it and almost crushed it to deatha fact which was announced by an appalling shriek  the mother turned and ran to the rescue  billy gathered up the pig and ran for his and its life  it was a hard run and would certainly have terminated in favour of the sow had not the greater part of the chase been kept up among loose stones over which the lad had the advantage  in a few minutes he descended a steep cliff over which the bereaved mother did not dare to run  thus did billy become possessed of a live pig which in a few weeks became a remarkably familiar and fearless inmate of the cavern home  billy also had a pet parroquet which soon became tame enough to be allowed to move about at will with a cropped wing and which was named shrieky  this creature was a mere bundle of impudent feathers and a source of infinite annoyance to the pig for being possessed of considerable powers of mimicry it sometimes uttered a porcine shriek exciting poor squeaky with the vain hope that some of its relations had arrived and what was far worse frequently imitated the sounds of crackling fire and roasting food which had the effect of causing squeaky to rush into the cave to meet with bitter disappointment  now squeaky said the buster hitting the pig on its snout with a bit of firewood keep your dirty nose away from yer cousin  squeaky obeyed meekly and removed to another spot  isnt it a strange thing daddy that you and i should come to feel so homelike here  ay it is strange responded gaff with a sigh as he laid down the hook he was working at and glanced round the cavern  your mother would be astonished to see us now lad  shell hear all about it some day said billy  youve no notion what a splendid story ill make out of all this when we get back to cove  it was evident that the buster inherited much of his mothers sanguine disposition  praps well never git back to cove said gaff sadly howsever weve no reason to complain  things might ha bin worse  youd better go and haul down the flag lad  ill look arter the roast till ye come back  the roastll look after itself daddy said the buster you look after squeaky however for that sly critters always up to mischief  billy hastened to the top of signal cliff just as the sun was beginning to descend into the sea and had commenced to pull down the flag when his eye caught sight of a sailnot on the faroff horizon like a seagulls wing but close in upon the land  the shout that he gave was so tremendous that gaff heard it in the cave and rushed out in great alarm  he saw billy waving a shred of cocoanut cloth frantically above his head and his heart bounded wildly as he sprang up the hill like a stag  on reaching the flagstaff he beheld the vessel a large fullrigged ship sailing calmly and to his eye majestically not far from the signal cliff  his first impulse was to wave his hand and shout  then he laid hands on the halliards of the flag and gave it an extra pull to see that it was well up while billy continued to stamp cheer yell and wave his arms like a madman  only those who have been long separated from their fellowmen can know the wild excitement that is roused in the breast by the prospect of meeting with new faces  gaff and billy found it difficult to restrain themselves and indeed they did not try to do so for at least ten minutes after the discovery of the ship  then a feeling of dread came suddenly upon the former  surely theyll never pass without takin notice of us  never exclaimed billy whose sudden fall of countenance belied the word  gaff shook his head  im not so sure o that said he if shes a whaler like the one we came south in lad shell not trouble herself with us  billy looked very grave and his heart sank  my only consolation is that she looks more like a manowar than a whaler  i wish we had a big gun to fire exclaimed billy looking round in perplexity as if he half hoped that a carronade would spring up out of the ground  could we not make a row somehow  i fear not said gaff despondingly  shoutin is of no use  shes too faroff for that  our only chance is the flag  both father and son stood silent for some moments earnestly gazing at the ship which was by this time nearly opposite to their flagstaff and seemed to be passing by without recognising the signal  this was not to be wondered at for although the flag was visible enough from landward being well defined against the bright sky it was scarce perceptible from seaward owing to the hills which formed a background to it  i know whatll do it exclaimed billy as he leaped suddenly to one side  come along daddy  a few yards to one side of the spot on which the flagstaff was reared there was a part of the precipice which sloped with a steep descent into the sea  here there had been a landslip and the entire face of the cliff was laid bare  at the top of this slope there was a great collection of stones and masses of rock of considerable size  at various points too down the face of the steep masses of rock and debris had collected in hollows  billy now went to work to roll big stones over the edge of this cliff and he did it with such goodwill that in a few minutes masses of a hundred weight were rolling bounding and crashing down the steep these in many cases plunged into the collections of debris and dislodged masses of rock that no efforts of which billy was capable could have otherwise moved  the rattling roar of the avalanche was far more effective than a salvo of artillery because besides being tremendous it was unceasing and the result was that the vessel ran up a flag in reply to the strange salute  then a white puff of smoke from her side preceded the roar of a heavy gun  immediately after the vessels head came round and she layto  its a manowar cried billy excitedly  ay and a british one too exclaimed gaff lets give him a cheer lad  billy complied with a will  again and again did they raise their strong voices until the woods and cliffs became alive with full true ringing british cheers    chapter thirty one  delivered wrecked and rescued  it is unnecessary indeed impossible to describe the feelings with which gaff and billy descended from signal cliff to the beach to meet the boat which put off from the manofwar and made for the little creek just below the cave  as the boats keel grated on the sand the midshipman in command leaped ashore  he was a particularly small and pert midshipman a smart conceited vigorous little fellow who delighted to order his big men about in the voice of a giant and it was quite interesting to observe how quietly and meekly those big men obeyed him just as one sometimes sees a huge newfoundland dog or mastiff obey the orders of a child  why where on earth did you come from and what are you doing here demanded the little middy as he approached gaff and looked up in that mans rugged and unshorn countenance  poor gaff could scarce command himself sufficiently to reply  were englishmenbin cast awayfive years now  he could go no farther but seizing the boys hand shook it warmly the buster being equally incapable of speaking seized the hand of the sailor next him and also shook it violently  then he uttered a cheer and turning suddenly round ran along the beach for half a mile like a greyhound after which he returned and asserted that his feelings were somewhat relieved  meanwhile the middy continued to question gaff  what dye mean to say youve been five years hereall alone  ay all but a few days said gaff looking round on the men with a bewildered air  how strange yer voices sound  seems as if id amost forgotten what men are like  well you are a queer fish said the boy with a laugh  are there no more here but you two  no more just billy and mealso squeaky and shrieky  gaff said this quite gravely for nothing was farther from his thoughts at that time than jesting  and pray who may squeaky and shrieky be  squeakys a pig and shriekys a little parrot  well observed the middy with a laugh thats better than no company at all  yours is an english manowar i think said gaff  youre right old fellow shes the blazer 74 captain evans bound for england  took a run farther south than usual after a piraticallooking craft but missed her  gave up the chase and came to this island to get water  little thought we should find you on it astonish the captain rather when we go back  of course youll want us to take you home  will you go off with me at once  gaff and billy hesitated and both looked back with a strange mixture of feelings at their islandhome  oh we wont hurry you said the boy with a kindly and patronising air if there are any traps you want to pack up well wait for you itll take us some time to get the breakers filled  can you show me a good spring  ay an we can show you a hot one cried billy with a smile  but come up to the cave with us and have some grub  the midshipman expressed his readiness to comply and ordered one of the men to stay and watch the boat  you neednt leave any one with the boat said gaff theres nobody here to touch it  nevertheless i will leave a guard  now then show us the way  it is needless to describe the surprise of the sailors at everything they saw and heard and the mixed feelings that agitated the breasts of gaff and his sonanxiety to return to england with regret to quit the cavern home where they had spent so many quiet and comparatively happy years  suffice it to say that they and the few things they possessed were speedily transferred to the blazer on board of which they received the most considerate attention and kindness  and you may be sure reader that billy did not forget to take the pig and the parroquet along with him  fair winds sprang up and for many weeks the blazer bowled along steadily on her course  it seemed as if the elements had agreed to be favourable and expedite the return of the exiles  but this state of things did not last  towards the end of the voyage fogs and gales prevailed and the blazer was driven considerably out of her course to the northward insomuch that she finally made the land on the northwestern coast of scotland this induced the captain to run through the pentland firth after passing through which they were beset by calms  one day a small steamer passed close alongside the blazer  thats an aberdeen steamer said the captain would you like to be put on board gaff  gaff said that he would as it was probable he should reach home sooner by her than if he were to accompany the blazer to london  accordingly the steamer was signalled and gaff and billy were put on board  scarcely had this been done when a stiff easterly gale set in and before morning a heavy sea was running before which the steamer rolled heavily  it seemed as if gaff and his son were doomed to be drowned for disaster by sea followed them wherever they went  at last however the morning broke bright and clear and the wind abated though the sea was still running very high  that forenoon the steamer sighted the coast of aberdeenshire and the tall column of the girdleness lighthouse came into view  well be home soon now daddy said billy as they walked the quarterdeck together  praps but we ant there yet said gaff an i never count my chickens before they are hatched  gaff and his son no longer wore the rough skin garments which had clothed them while in their islandhome  they had been rigged out in manowar habiliments by the kindness of those on board the blazer but they had steadily refused to permit the barber to operate upon them and still wore their locks shaggy and long  they were perhaps as fine specimens of a hardy and powerful man and boy as could be found anywhere for gaff although past his prime was not a whit less vigorous and athletic than he had been in days of yore though a little less supple and billy owing probably to his hardy and healthy style of life on the island was unusually broad and manly for his age  in a few hours the steamer made the harbour of aberdeen  the passengers who had been very busy all the morning in packing up the things they had used on the voyage were now assembled in groups along the side of the vessel trying to make out objects on shore  the captain stood on the bridge between the paddles giving directions to the steersman and everything gave promise of a speedy and happy landing  a heavy sea however was still running filling the bay to the northward of the harbour with foaming breakers while the pierhead was engulfed in clouds of spray as each billow rolled past it and fell in thunder on the bar  every one on board looked on with interest but on that clear bright day no one thought of danger  just as the steamer came close up to the bar a heavy sea struck her on the port bow driving her a little too near the pier  the captain shouted to the steersman but the man either did not understand him or did not act with sufficient promptitude for the next wave sent them crashing on the portion of bulwark or breakwater that juts out from the head of the aberdeen pier  the consternation and confusion that ensued is beyond description  the women screamed the men shouted  the captain ordered the engines to be reversed and this was done at once but the force of the next billow was too great  it lifted the vessel up and let her fall heavily again on the pier where she lay hard and fast with her back broken  another wave lifted her the two halves of the vessel separated and sank on each side of the pier leaving the passengers and crew in the waves  it would be difficult to say whether the shouts of the multitudes who stood on the pierhead or the shrieks of the wrecked people were loudest  instantly every exertion was made to save them  boats were launched ropes were thrown buoys were cast into the sea and many of the people were saved but many were also drowned before assistance reached them  gaff and billy being expert swimmers seized the persons nearest to them and took them safe to the pier where ready hands were stretched out to grasp them  the former saved a lady the latter a little girl then they plunged back into the sea and saved two more lives  while this was going on several of the passengers were swept round into the bay where they would have perished but for the prompt and able assistance of a man who was known as the rescue  this man was so named because he undertook the dangerous and trying duty of watching the bathers during the summer months and rescuing such of them as got out of their depth  in this arduous work that heroic man had during five years of service saved with his own hands between thirty and forty livesin some cases with a boat but in most cases by simply swimming out and seizing the drowning persons and without using corks or floats of any kind  when asked why he did not use a lifebelt he said that it would only impede his motions and prevent him from diving which he was often compelled to do when the drowning persons had sunk  his usual method was to swim off when there was a shout for help and make for the struggling man or boy so as to come up behind him  he then seized him under the armpits and thus effectually prevented him from grasping him in any way  drawing him gently upon his breast while he lay over on his back he then made for the shore swimming on his back and using his feet only  on the present occasion the rescue saved four or five of those who were washed into the bay and then ran out to the end of the pier to render assistance there  in height he was not above the middle size but he had a very muscular and wellknit frame  just as he drew near gaff who was bearing a little boy through the surf in his arms was hurled against the stones of the pier rendered insensible and sucked back by the retreating water  billy was farther out at the moment and did not see what had occurred  the shout of alarm from those in front of the crowd was almost immediately answered by a cry from behind of  the rescue  the rescue  this way  without checking his speed the rescue sprang into the sea caught gaff by the hair of the head and was next moment hurled on the breakwater he was prepared for the shock and caught the hands of two men who with ropes round their waists waded into the water as far as they dared  billy was washed ashore at the same moment almost in a state of helpless exhaustion and all were hauled out of the sea amid the wild cheers of the excited crowd  gaff being laid under the lee of the pierwall soon recovered and then he and billy were led tenderly up to the town where they were kindly entertained and cared for during several days by the hospitable rescue in whose house they lodged during their stay in the fair city of aberdeen  most of the cattle that happened to be on board the illfated steamer were saved and among them was squeaky  shrieky too managed to escape  his cage having been smashed in the general confusion he was set free and flew wildly towards the pier where he took refuge in the bosom of a sailor who took care of him  ultimately he and his companion in distress were restored to their friends    chapter thirty two  home again  a few days after the events narrated in the last chapter gaff and his son arrived by stagecoach in the town of wreckumoft and at once started off for the village of cove  it was night  there was no moon but the stars shone brightly in a clear sky affording sufficient light to show them their road  neither of them spoke  their minds were filled with anxiety for the thought that was uppermost and everpresent in each was are they well are they alive  they did not utter the thought however  its a long bit since you an i was here billy observed gaff in a low voice  ay very long replied the lad  they walked on again at a smart pace but in silence  presently they heard footsteps approaching and a man soon came up from the direction of cove  foine noight said the man  fine night it is responded gaff and billy in the same breath  gaff suddenly turned and accosted the stranger just as he had passed them  dye belong to cove  no i doant only stoppin there a bit  ye dont happen to know a ooman o the name o gaff do ye  gaffgaff repeated the man meditating no i niver heern on her  hm thought praps ye mightgoodnight  goodnoight  and the man went his way  ah  billy my heart misgives me boy said gaff after a pause  it was evident that billys heart misgave him too for he made no reply  the distance to cove being only three miles they were not long in reaching the cottage although their pace had become slower and slower as they approached the village and they stopped altogether when they first came in sight of their old home  a light shone brightly in the little window  they glanced at each other on observing this but no word escaped them  silently they approached the cottagewindow and looked in  gaff started back with a slight exclamation of surprise for his eye fell on the new and strange furniture of the boodwar  billy looked round with a searching eye  theres nobody in he said at length but look daddy the old clocks there yet  gaff did not know whether this was a good or a bad omen for any one who had taken and refurnished the cottage might have bought the old clock and kept it as a sort of curiosity  while they were gazing the door of the closet opened and mrs gaff came out  she was a little stouter perhaps than she had been five years before but not a whit less hale or goodlooking  mothergod bless her murmured billy in a deep earnest voice  where can tottie be whispered gaff anxiously  maybe shes out said billy  the lads voice trembled while he spoke for he could not but reflect that five years was a long long time and tottie might be dead  before gaff spoke again the closet door once more opened and a slender sprightly girl just budding into womanhood tripped across the room  hallo exclaimed billy who can thatsurely impossible yes it is it must be tot for i could never mistake her mouth  dye see any sign ofofa man said gaff in a voice so deep and peculiar that his son turned and looked at him in surprise  no daddywhy what dye ask that for  cause its not the first time a sailor has comed home after bein many years away and found that his wife had guv him up for dead an married again  gaff had often thought of the possibility of such a thing during his prolonged residence on the island and the thought had cost him many a bitter pang but he had never mentioned it to billy on whom the idea fell for the first time like a thunderbolt  he almost staggered and put his hand quickly on the windowsill  but come lad lets bear up like men  ill go in first  dont let on see if theyll remember us  so saying gaff lifted the latch of the door and stood before his wife and child  billy also entered and stood a pace behind him  mrs gaff and tottie who were both engaged about the fireplace at the time in the preparation of supper turned and looked at the intruders in surprise and for a few seconds in silence  the light that fell upon father and son was not very strong and the opening of the door had caused it to flicker  come in if ye wants a word wi me said mrs gaff who was somewhat uneasy at the rugged appearance of her visitors but was too proud to show it  hast forgotten me jess  mrs gaff rushed at once into his arms  bless the lord o my soul murmured gaff as he smoothed the head that lay on his shoulder  tottie recognised her brother the instant he advanced into the full light of the fire and exclaiming the single word billy leaped into his open arms  not lost after all thank god said gaff with a deep prolonged sigh as he led his wife to a chair and sat down beside her  lost stephen what mean ye  not married again said gaff with a quiet smile  married again an you alive oh stephen  nay lass not believin me alive but yeve had good reason to think me dead this many a year  an dye think id ha married agin even though ye was dead lad asked the wife with a look of reproach  well i believe ye wouldnt but its common enough ye must admit for folk to marry a second time an so many and many a long day i used to think praps jessll ha found it hard to keep herself an tottie an mayhap shell have married agin arter givin me up for dead  never exclaimed mrs gaff energetically  well forgive me for thinkin it lass  ive been punished enough for its cost me many a bitter hour when i was on the island  on the island exclaimed tottie in surprise  ay tot but its an old story that an a long one  then youll have to tell it to me daddy and begin at once said tottie leaving the busterwho was more entitled to his nickname on that evening than he had ever been in all his lifeand sitting down beside her father on the floor  come lets have fair exchange said gaff pushing his wife towards billy who grasped his mother round her ample waist and pulled her down upon his knee  youre so big and strong an handsome said mrs gaff running her fingers through her sons voluminous locks while a few tears tumbled over her cheeks  mother said billy with a gleeful look give me a slap on the face do theres a good old woman i want to feel what its like now to see if i remember it  there cried mrs gaff giving him a slap and no light onea slap that would have floored him in days of yore you deserve it for calling me an old woman  mrs gaff followed up the slap with a hug that almost choked her son  make less noise wont you cried tottie  dont you see that daddys going to begin his story  silence being with difficulty obtained gaff did begin his story intending to run over a few of the leading facts regarding his life since he disappeared but having begun he found it impossible to stop all the more so that no one wanted to stop him  he became so excited too that he forgot to take note of time and his audience were so interested that they paid no attention whatever to the dutch clock with the horrified countenance which by the way looked if possible more horrified than it used to do in the busters early days  its preliminary hissing and frequent ringings were unheeded so were the more dignified admonitions of the new clock so was the teakettle which hissed with the utmost fury at being boiled so long but hissed in vain for it was allowed to hiss its entire contents into thin air and then to burn its bottom red hot  in like manner the large pot of potatoes evaporated its water redheated its bottom and burned its contents to charcoal  this last event it was that aroused mrs gaff  lauks the taties is done for  she sprang up and tore the pot off the fire  tottie did the same to the kettle while gaff and billy looked on and laughed  never mind heres another kettle fill it tot fro the pitcher said mrs gaff itll bile in a few minutes an we can do without taties for one night  on examination however it was found that a sufficient quantity of eatable potatoes remained in the heart of the burned mass so the misfortune did not prove to be so great as at first sight it appeared to be  but now jess let me pump you a bit  how comes it that yeve made such a xtraornary affair o the cottage  mrs gaff instead of answering hugged herself and looked unutterably sly  then she hugged billy and laughed  tottie laughed too much more energetically than there was any apparent reason for  this caused billy to laugh from sympathy which made mrs gaff break out afresh and gaff himself laughed because he couldnt help it  so they all laughed heartily for at least two minutesall the more heartily that half of them did not know what they were laughing at and the other half knew particularly well what they were laughing at  well now said gaff after a time this may be uncommonly funny but id like to know what its all about  mrs gaff still looked unutterably sly and giggled  at length she said  you must know stephen that im a lady  well lass you ant xactly a lady but youre an uncommon good woman which many a lady never wos an never will be  ay but i am a lady said mrs gaff firmly at least im rich an thats the same thing ant it  im not so sure o that replied gaff shaking his head seems to me that it takes more than money to make a lady  but what are ye drivin at jess  mrs gaff now condescended on explanation  first of all she made gaff and billy go round the apartment with her and expounded to them the signification of the various items after the manner of a showman  here you see said the good woman pointing to the floor is a splendid carpit strait fro the looms o turkey so the man said as sold it to me but ive reason to believe he told lies  howsever there it is an its a fussrater as ye may see  the roses is as fresh as the day it was put down xceptin that one where tottie capsized a saucepan o melted butter an eggs last christmas day  this pointing to the bed is a fourposter  youve often said to me stephen that youd like to sleep in a fourposter to see how it felt  well youll git the chance now my man  this here is a noo grate an fireirons as cost fi pun ten  the man i got it fro said it wos a bargain at that but some knowin friends o mine holds a different opinion  here is a noo clock as goes eight days of his own accord an strikes the halves an quarters but hes not so good as he looks like many other showy critters in this world  that old farmiliar face in the corner does his dooty better an makes less fuss about it  then this here is a noo set o chimbley ornaments  i dont think much o them myself but tot says theyre better than nothing  them six cheers is the best i ever sat on nothin can smash em  mad haco even cant  ah is haco alive still interrupted gaff  alive i should think so  nothin ll kill that man  i dont believe buryin him alive would do it  hes up at the sailors home just now but im not done yet  heres a portrait o lord nelson as can look all round the room  see now git into that corner  now ant he lookin at ye  that he is an no mistake replied gaff  well git into this other corner now ant he lookin at ye still  to be sure he is  well well dont go for to puzzle yer brains over it  that pictur has nearly druv all the thinkin men o cove mad so well let it alone just now  heres a manowar ye see an this is the steps for mountin into the fourposter  it serves for aasome sort o man i forgettot you know  an ottoman said tottie  ay a ottyman by day an stepsanstairs at night  look there  mrs gaff opened up the steps and said what dye think o that  gaff said wonderful and billy exclaimed hallo  yes stephen resumed mrs gaff going to the cupboard and fetching the teacaddy from which she extracted her bankers book all them things was bought for you with your own fortin which is ten thousand pound an more for ive not lived up to the interest by no manner o means an that there bookll show ye its all true  having reached this point mrs gaff was seized with a fit of laughter which she stifled on her husbands breast and then flinging herself into the fourposter she burst into a flood of tears  this was the first time in her life that she had given way to such weakness and she afterwards said to tottie in reference to it that she couldnt help it and had made up her mind to have a good cry once for all and be done with it  gaff and his son examined the bankbook and listened with wonder to totties account of the manner in which their wealth had come to them before the recital was completed mrs gaff had had her cry out and dried her eyes  what think ye of that stephen she said pointing to the book  gaff shook his head slowly and looked very grave  i dont much like it jess  what dont like money  too much of it is dangerous  i hope it wont harm us lass  its done no harm to me yet as i knows of said mrs gaff firmly  what says the bible tot about that asked gaff  moneys the root o all evil ant it  no daddy its the love o money thats the root of all evil  ah to be sure  well theres a difference there  howsever we cant help it so we must larn to bear it  come along now jess and let us have supper  to supper they sat down and long they sat over it and a hearty one they ate  it was not till they began to think of retiring for the night that it was remembered that there was no possibility of putting up billy in the cottage for tottie occupied the closet of the boodwar  the buster relieved his parents from their difficulty however by asserting that he had taken a wild desire to see mad haco that night so declining the offer of a shakedown made up under the fourposter he started for wreckumoft and took up his quarters in the sailors home    chapter thirty three  the sailors home and the new secretary  great changes had taken place in the sailors home at wreckumoft since billy gaff last saw it  a new wing had been added to it and the original building had been altered and repaired while every convenience in the way of ventilating and heating had been introduced so that the sailors who frequented this admirable home found themselves surrounded by comforts and luxuries such as in former days they had never dreamed of  fortunately for this valuable institution sir richard doles bart had not been made a director consequently the business of the home was not impeded  fortunately also the secretary who had been recently appointed to the home was a man of ability and energy being none other than our friend kenneth stuart  that incorrigible young man had ventured one day to say to his father that he could not make up his mind to give up the portionless girl lizzie gordon that he considered her anything but portionless seeing that she possessed an earnest loving christian heart and a wise thoughtful mind qualities which wealth could not purchase and compared with which a fortune was not worth a straw  mr stuart senior thereupon dismissed mr stuart junior from his presence for ever and told him to go and beg his bread where he chose  curiously enough mr stuart senior happened to dine that day with colonel crusty at the club where the latter put up when in town and the valiant colonel told him that he had that morning dismissed his daughter from his presence for ever she having returned to the parental home as mrs bowels  the two therefore felt a peculiar sort of sympathy being as it were in the same boat and cracked an additional bottle of claret on the strength of the coincidence  when they had finished the extra bottle they ordered another and became exceedingly jocose insomuch that one vowed he would leave his fortune to the church but the other preferred to leave his to a lunatic asylum  on receiving his dismissal kenneth left his fathers house with words of regret and goodwill on his lips and then went to tell lizzie and seek his fortune  he had not to seek long or far  being a director of the sailors home i chanced to be in search of a secretary  a better man than kenneth could not be found so i proposed him and he was at once appointed  the salary being a good one he was enabled to retain dan horsey and bucephalus  he also obtained permission to remove emmie to his house having told his father who the child was and having been told in return that he the father had become aware of the fact long ago and that he was welcome to her  kenneth then set himself earnestly to work to promote the interests of the sailors home and to prepare his house for the reception of lizzie who had agreed to marry him whenever he felt himself in a position to ask her  lizzie was a peculiar girl  she had indeed permitted kenneth to visit her as a lover but she resolutely refused to accept him as long as his father continued adverse to the union  the moment however that she heard of his being cast off and disinherited she agreed with tears in her eyes to marry him whenever he pleased  but to return from this digression the new secretary of the sailors home of wreckumoft became the guardian spirit of the place  he advised all the arrangements which the board made  he drew up all the rules that the board fixed  an address which he issued to officers and seamen frequenting the port of wreckumoft wound up with the following words  the directors of the sailors home are anxious that seamen should clearly understand that the institution was designed for their sole benefit and established with the view of protecting them from the systematic extortion of crimps and other snares to which their circumstances and calling render them peculiarly liable and above all to promote their moral elevation social improvement and religious instruction  the rules by which the institution is governed are as far as practicable adapted to meet the habits of all who participate in its benefits and to further their best interests  it is conducted on principles of order comfort and liberality and no restraint is exercised beyond that which common prudence and mutual interest require in the home thus provided which embraces security freedom of action and social enjoyment the directors desire to create and sustain mutual sympathy trust and goodwill and to employ those agencies which tend most to mature habits of frugality selfrespect and the love of god  immediately after the appearance of this address seamen flocked to the home for lodgings and those who did so found the place so uncommonly pleasant that they brought their messmates so that for months afterwards not only was every bed taken but the very stairs and landings of the building were occupied by men who preferred to sleep there and enjoy the advantages of the institution rather than go back to the dens which they had frequented in former days  on the night when billy went to the home it was very full and he stumbled over more than one recumbent seaman on the landings before he reached the hall where late though it was a number of men were playing chess draughts and bagatelle or reading books and papers here he found haco barepoles as rugged as ever seated by the fire and deeply engaged in a copy of the pilgrims progress  wonderful book wonderful book exclaimed haco laying the volume on the table and scratching his head as if to stir up the brain inside just then billy came up  hallo haco  hallo stranger  youve the advantage of me lad for i dont know ye  yes ye do  eh do i  let me see  here the mad skipper scrutinised the lads face earnestly  well i have seen ye afore now but youve scaped from me youngster  im billy alias the buster alias the cork alias gaff  what billy gaff  dead and come alive again cried haco springing up and seizing the youngsters hand  having wrung billys arm almost off his shoulder haco took him up to his berth where he made him sit down on the bed and recount all his and his fathers adventures from beginning to end  when billy had concluded the narrative which of course he gave only in brief outline haco said  now lad you and i shall go have a pipe outside and then well turn in  very good but i have not yet asked you about your daughter susan  is she still with captain bingley  ay still with him and well replied haco with a look that did not convey the idea of satisfaction  not goin to get married inquired billy with caution  haco snorted then he grunted and then he said  yes she was goin to get married and he wished she wasnt that was all  who to inquired the other  why to that irish scoundrel dan horsey to be sure said haco with a huge sigh of resignation which coming from any other man would have been regarded as a groan  the fact is lad that poor susans heart is set upon that fellow an so its no use resistin them no longer besides the blackguard is well spoken of by his master whos a trump moreover i made a kind o half promise long ago that id not oppose them to that scapegrace young lieutenant bingley whos on his way home from china just now  an so its agoin to be an theyve set their hearts on havin the weddin same week as the weddin o master kenneth and lizzie gordon so the fact is they may all marry each other through other down the middle and up again for all i care cause im agoin on a whalin voyage to novy zembly or kumskatchkieanywheres to git peace o mindthere  saying this haco dashed the ashes out of his big german pipe into his left palm and scattered them to the winds  now lad he said in conclusion well go turn in and youll sleep with me tonight for ye couldnt get a bed in the home for love or money seein that its choke full already  come along    chapter thirty four  failures and hopes deferred and consequences  now it chanced that about the time of which i write a noted bank failed and a considerable sum of money which had been temporarily deposited in it by the committee of the sailors home at wreckumoft was lost  this necessitated retrenchment  all the salaries of officials were loweredamong them kenneths although the directors assured him that it would be again raised as soon as the institution recovered from the shock of this loss  meanwhile however the secretary was compelled to postpone his marriage indefinitely  perhaps the shortest way to convey a correct idea of the dire effects of this failure to my reader will be to detail several conversations that took place in regard to it by various parties  conversation first was held between the head cook and head waiter of the sailors home  these worthies were seated on one of the dressers in the kitchen of the establishmentand a wonderful kitchen it was with culinary implements so huge as to suggest the idea of giant operators there was a grate that might have roasted an ox whole  there were pots big enough to have boiled entire sheep caldrons of soup that a little boy might have swum in rolls and loaves that would apparently have made sandwiches for an army and cups and saucers plates and dishes that might have set up any reasonable man for life in the crockery line but the most astounding vessels in that amazing place were the teapot and coffeepot of the establishment  they stood side by side like giant twins each being five feet high by a yard in diameter and the pounds of tea and gallons of water put into these pots night and morning for tea and breakfast seemed almost fabulous  see note 1  its werry unfortinet werry said the presiding spirit of this region  so tis observed the head waiter  werry hard too said the cook on a man like me with a wife and six childer to have his wages docked  so tiseven for a man with a wife and four childn like me said the head waiter but it comes hardest on the secretary poor feller  he was just agoin to get spliced an there hes bliged to put it off hes such a good feller too  ahits werry hard said the cook  werry said the head waiter  having shaken their heads in concert these worthies dropped the subject as being an unpleasant one  in mr stuarts drawingroom referring to the same subject miss penelope stuart said to mr george stuart  well im sure george it seems to me that it would be only right and proper to forgive poor kenneth not that hes done anything exactly wrong but forgiveness is a christian duty whether its an enemy youve hurt or a friend who has hurt you thatthat how could he help it you know brother now do be reasonable and only think of the poor boy having to part with that great carthorsethough itll be the death of him some day whether he parts with it or not for its a dreadful creature and dan tooim sure the perplexities people are put to by banks failing  why dont people prevent them from failing  but the worst is his marriage being put off and it so near  i do think brother you might take him back and  pray hold your tongue peppy said mr stuart who was attempting to read the times im not listening to you and if you are pleading for my son kenneth let me say to you once for all that i have done with him for ever  i would not give him a sixpence if he were starving  well but persevered the earnest miss peppy if he were to repent you know and come and ask pardon dear me where are those scissors ah here they are surely you would not refuse the thimble nextwhat a world of worries toto give him  peppy i have stated my sentiments pray do not trouble me further in regard to this matter  nothing can move me  miss peppy sighed and retired to pour her regrets into the sympathetic ear of mrs niven  gaff sat in the chimneycorner of the boodwar smoking his pipe and staring at shrieky which having survived the voyage home had been hung up in a cage in the little window and was at that time engaged in calling loudly for squeaky who having also survived the voyage was grubbing up stones and mud at the front door  mrs gaff was seated opposite to him with totties head in her lap for she still solaced herself by smoothing her hair  billy was sitting on one of the six chairs whittling a piece of wood  its a bad business said gaff bad for everybody consarned but wust for mr stuart  an his man said billy  and susan said tottie  gaff said mrs gaff its my advice to you to go up to the bank ask them for a thousand pounds if they have as much in the shop at the time if not ye can take what they have and call again for the rest give it all to miss lizzie gordon and tell her to go and get married right off  we wont miss it gaff  in fact it seems to me that the more we give away the more we have to give  its an awful big fortin weve comed into  but thats what i advise  i doubt she wouldnt take it said gaff  oh yes she would cried his better half  billy and tottie being of the same opinion gaff laid aside his pipe got out the teacaddy from which he took his chequebook and made tottie write out a cheque for 1000 pounds payable to miss lizzie gordon  she deserves it well o me observed gaff as he slowly printed his signature on the cheque for she gave me the noo testament thats bin o more valley to me than thousands o gold an silvergod bless her  the cheque was taken up and presented by gaff on the following morning but to the honest mans dismay lizzie declined it positively though she accompanied her refusal with many earnest expressions of gratitude and kissed the seamans hard hand at parting  gaff returned to the boodwar lit his german pipe with the cheque and said i knowed she wouldnt tak itdear girl  kenneth was standing in the bower at the foot of my garden looking pensively on the distant landscape which was bathed in the rich glow of the setting sun  his right arm embraced the slender waist of lizzie his left encircled the shoulder of emmie graham  we must have patience darling said kenneth with an effort at cheerfulness  our hopes were as bright as that lovely sky some days ago said lizzie  while she was speaking the sun descended behind a bank of heavy clouds  and thus have our hopes gone down murmured kenneth sadly  but uncle observed emmie the sun is still shining behind the clouds  thank you emmie for the comforting word said lizzie and our sun is indeed shining still  the trio left off contemplating the sky and returned in improved spirits to bingley hall where my strongminded wife had just delivered herself of the following oration  its of no use talking to me she was right i never found it to be of the least use to talk to her old stuart is a monsternobody will convince me to the contrary  i only wish i had the making of the laws and i would have powerful cures got up for such as he  and his brotherinlaw is no bettercrusty indeed bad though it is the name is too good for him  dont interrupt me  he is not like many of his neighbours for he has had no provocation  the captain of dragoons has turned out a very good husband and poor bella is as happy with him as such a flirt could expect to be  i ventured to remark at this point that my wife was wandering from the subject from which she started but she became extremely angry and finally put me down and snuffed me out by assuring me that i had been born at least a generation before my time  dan horsey sat on the dresser of my kitchen switching his boot with a ridingwhip and looking at susan with an extremely melancholy expression of countenance  susan was cleaning a silver teapother usual occupation when dan was present  cooknow resigned to her fate was sighing and peeling potatoes in the scullery  och darlint me hearts heavier than a cart o coals said dan bucephalus is to be sowld next week and im to quit in a month  susan sighed  to be sure id aisy git another place but in the meantime thatll put off our weddin jewel till i don know when  susan sighed again and dan hit his boot somewhat smartly as if he were indignant with fate  but its wus continued dan for masther an miss gordon than for us darlintthere now dont toss yer head mavourneen ye know we can git spliced av we like whenever i git a noo sitiwation but masther cant well throw up the wan hes got an yit it wont kape him an his wife och worse luck  av we could only diskiver a goold mine now or somethin o that sort  well i am sorry for them said susan with another sigh an im sure i hope that well get over our troubles all of us though i dont see very well how  arrah now dont look so blue me angel said dan rising and putting his arm round susan  me heart is lighter since i comed here and saw yer sweet face  sure theres midcine in the glance o yer purty blue eye  come now cheer up an ill ventur a prophecy  what may that be asked susan with a smile  that you and i shall be spliced before two months is out  see if we wont  susan laughed but dan stoutly asserted that his prophecies always came true and then saying that he was the bearer of a letter to miss peppy he bade susan adieu and took himself off  i turn now to miss puff who happened about this time to be on a visit to us  she was seated one forenoon alone in the diningroom of bingley hall when a loud ring came to the doorbell a quick step was heard on the stair and next moment the diningroom door burst open and my son gildart rushed into the room  gildart was wonderfully changed since the day he had sailed for china he had grown tall and stout  moreover he had whiskersnot very bushy perhaps but undeniable whiskers  hallo  puff he exclaimed rushing towards his old friend with the intention of kissing her but when miss puff rose to receive him he felt constrained to check himself  why how you are grown and so changed he said shaking her hand warmly  miss puff was indeed changed so much so that her old friends who had not seen her for some time could scarcely have known her  she was no longer fat and inane  her figure had become slim and graceful her face had become expressive and remarkably pretty and her manners were those of a wellbred and selfpossessed lady  gildart felt that he could no more have taken the liberties he had ventured on in former years than he could have flown  he soon became very chatty however and speedily began to question her in regard to his father and mother who she told him were not at home and old friends  and what of my friend kenneth stuart said he  he is well poor fellow replied miss puff but he is in unhappy circumstances just now  here she related the circumstances of the bank failure and the evil consequences that followed and were still pending over kenneth and many of their other friends in wreckumoft  thats a sad business said gildart but i dont see how it can be mended  i fear me it is a case of grin and bear it  and your aunt miss puff what of the adorable miss flouncer  she is now lady doles  you dont say so  well i had given sir richard credit for more sense  how long is it since they married  about two years  is sir richard dead  no why should you think so  because if it had been me i should have succumbed in three months its an awful thing to think of being married to a shegriffin  she is my aunt mr bingley said miss puff  ah to be sure forgive me  but now i must go and search for my father  adieu  miss puffau revoir  gildart left the room with a strange sensation of emptiness in his breast  why surelyit cannot be that iiam in love with that girl that stupid fatbut shes not stupid and not fat now  shes graceful and intelligent and prettyabsolutely beautiful why botheration i am in love or insane perhaps both  thus soliloquising my son entered my study  the last conversation that i shall record took place between mr stuart senior and colonel crusty  it occurred about two weeks after those conversations that have just been narrated  the colonel had been suddenly summoned to see his brotherinlaw on his deathbedso the epistle that summoned him had been worded by miss peppy  that dinner at which these two friends had enjoyed themselves so much happened to disagree with mr george stuart insomuch that he was thrown into a bilious feverturned as yellow as a guinea and as thin as a skeleton  he grew worse and worse  wealth was at his commandso was everything that wealth can purchase but although wealth procured the best of doctors in any number that the patient chose to order them it could not purchase health  so mr stuart pined away  the doctors shook their heads and gave him up recommending him to send for his clergyman  mr stuart scorned the recommendation at first but as he grew worse he became filled with an undefinable dread and at last did send for his pastor  as a big cowardly boy at school tyrannises over little boys and scoffs at fear until a bigger than he comes and causes his cheek to blanch so mr stuart bullied and scorned the small troubles of life and scoffed at the anxieties of religious folk until death came and shook his fist in his face then he succumbed and trembled and confessed himself to himself to be a coward  one result of the clergymans visit was that mr stuart sent for colonel crusty  my dear stuart said the colonel entering the sick mans room and gently taking his wasted hand which lay outside the counterpane i am distressed to find you so ill bless me how thin you are  but dont lose heart  i am quite sure you have no reason to despond  a man with a constitution like yours can pull through a worse illness than this come cheer up and look at the bright side of things  i have seen men in hospital ten times worse than you are and get better  mr stuart shook or rather rolled his head slowly on the pillow and said in a weak voice  no colonel i am dyingat least the doctors say so and i think they are right  nonsense my dear fellow returned the colonel kindly doctors are often mistaken and many a man recovers after they have given him up  well that may be or it may not be said mr stuart with a sudden access of energy nevertheless i believe that i am a dying man and i have sent for you on purpose to tell you that i am an assa consummate ass  my dear stuart remonstrated the colonel really you are taking a very warped view of  iamanass repeated the sick man interrupting his friend more than that you are an ass too colonel  the colonel was a very pompous and stately man  he had not been honoured with his true title since he left school and was therefore a good deal taken aback by the plainspeaking of his friend  he attributed the words however to the weak condition of mr stuarts mind and attempted to quiet him but he would not be quieted  no no colonel its of no use trying to shut our eyes to the fact you and i have set our hearts on the things of this world and i have now come to see that the man who does that is a fool  my dear fellow said the colonel soothingly it is bodily weakness that induces you to think so  most people speak thus when they are seriously ill but they invariably change their opinion when they get well again  you are wrong colonel  i am now convinced that they do not change their opinions  they may change their wills but their opinions must remain the same  the conclusion which i have now come to has been forced upon me by cool logical reasoning and moreover it has more than once flashed upon me in the course of my life but i shut my eyes to it  the approach of death has only opened them to see very clearly what i was more than half aware of before  do not suppose that i make this confession of my folly to you in order to propitiate the deity  i do not for a moment expect that the god whom i have neglected all my life can be humbugged in this way  no i have deliberately cast him off in time past and i recognise it as my due that he should cast me off now  it is too late to repent so i suppose that there is no hope for me  mr stuart paused here a few minutes  the shade of doubt expressed in his last words was occasioned by the recollection of the clergymans assurance that it was never too late to repent that the finished work of jesus christ which leaves nothing for a man to do but to believe and live would avail the sinner at the latest hour  the colonel sat gazing at his friend in silence  presently the sick man resumed as though he had not paused  therefore what i say to you now is not intended as a propitiatory offering but is the result of clear and calm conviction  now listen to me for i feel getting weak  let me entreat you to forgive your daughter  will you take that entreaty into earnest consideration  i do not ask you to promise  it is folly to make men promise what they dont want to do  the chances are that theyll break the promise  i only ask you to take this subject into your serious consideration  it is the request of a dying man  will you grant it  the colonel coughed and looked troubled  colonel said mr stuart i have forgiven kenneththat is to say we are reconciled for i can scarcely be said to forgive one who never offended me  the gladness that has ensued on that reconciliation is worth more to me than all the gold i ever made  stuart said the colonel somewhat suddenly ill do what you ask  thank you youre a good fellow  squeeze my handthere now go away ill sleep for a little  stay perhaps i may never waken if so farewell  youll find a fire in the library if you choose to wait till its over  god bless you  the sick man turned on his side with a sigh and fell into a sleep so deep and quiet that the colonel left the room with some uncertainty as to whether his friend were still in the land of the living    note 1  if the reader would see a somewhat similar kitchen let him visit the sailors home well street london docks    chapter thirty five  conclusion  gladness is a source of life  it is probable that the joy which filled mr stuarts heart in consequence of being reconciled to kenneth and having induced his brotherinlaw to promise to consider the possibility of forgiving bella was the cause of a favourable turn in his malady at all events he did recover to the surprise of every one and the utter discomfiture of the doctors who had given him up  the sentiments which mr stuart had expressed when as was supposed in a dying state did not forsake him when he was restored to health for whereas in former days all his time health and wealth were dedicated to himself now they were all devoted to god  mr stuarts face so to speak had been turned south before his illness after his illness it was turned north  there was no other change than this  he did not change his nature nor did he change his pursuits  even those of them which were sinful were not changedthey were given up  he did not cease to be an irascible man but he fought against his temper which he had never done before and so became less irascible  he did not give up his profession but he gave up the evils which he had before permitted to cling to it  he did not cease to make money but he ceased to hoard it and devoted the money made to higher ends than heretofore he did not think of the world and its affairs less but he thought of his maker more and in so doing became a better man of the world than ever  gloom and asceticism began to forsake him because the bible told him to rejoice evermore  philanthropy began to grow because the bible told him to look not upon his own things but upon the things of others  he had always been an energetic man but he became more so now because the bible told him that whatever his hand found to do he ought to do it with his might  in short mr stuart became a converted man and there was no mystery whatever in his conversion  great though its effects were it was simply thisthat the holy spirit had enabled him to believe on the lord jesus christ  many results followed from this change in the old man  one of the first was that kenneth and lizzie gordon were married bucephalus was not sold and dan horsey was retained in the service of his young master  miss peppy came out very strong on that occasion of kenneths marriage she laughed and then she wept and then by way of variety she did both at once  she kissed everybody that came within armslength of her partly because her heart was very full partly because her tears blinded her so that she could not easily distinguish who was who  she made an effort once or twice to skip and really considering her age and infirmities the efforts were wonderfully successful  she also sang a little attempted to whistle but failed and talked straight on for several days without cessation except when asleep and at meals the most extraordinary amount of nonsense that ever came from the lips of woman  true to their resolve dan horsey and susan barepoles were married at the end of the same week  and it is worthy of remark that mad haco danced at their wedding and by so doing shook to its foundation the building in which it occurred  strange to say my son lieutenant bingley arrived from china on the morning of the wedding so that he had the unexpected pleasure of dancing at it too and of chaffing haco on being done out of his daughter  the boodwar was the scene of the festivities at dans wedding  it was more it was also the locality in which the honeymoon was spent  mrs gaff had insisted on taking a little jaunt to ramsgate with her husband son and daughter in order that she might give up her abode to dan and susan who were favourites with her  thus it came to pass that when the festivities of the wedding drew to a close the bride and bridegroom instead of leaving their friends were left by their friends in possession of the boodwar  it now remains for me reader to draw this veracious narrative to a close  my son gildart married miss puff and ultimately became a commander in the navy  my wifes strength of mind gave way before increasing years and she finally became as gentle as she was when i first paid my addresses to her  emmie graham became a permanent inmate of kenneths home  the shock that she had sustained when gaff saved her life told upon her constitution so severely that she fell into bad health but there was a sunny cheerfulness of disposition about her which induced those with whom she came in contact to regard her as a sunbeam  lady doles became strongerminded day by day and finally reduced sir richard to the condition of a mere human machine with just enough spirit left to enable him to live and do her bidding  colonel crusty forgave bella and as is not infrequently the case in similar circumstances he and his soninlaw the major for he rose to that rank became bosom friends  when the latter retired on halfpay they all took up their abode in wreckumoft  kenneth retained his old post for although independent of its salary he would not eat the bread of idleness  as secretary to the sailors home he frequently met me while i was going about in my capacity of honorary agent of the shipwrecked mariners society  billy gaff went to sea and ultimately became captain of an east indiaman to his mothers unspeakable delight  gaff and his wife and tottie remained in the boodwar for many years they did not find their fortune too much for them being guided in the use thereof by the bible  in regard to the state of things that had come about miss peppy used to say confidentially to mrs niven that she never knew anything like it it beat all the novels she had ever read not that she had read novels much although some of them were good as well as bad but she felt that too many of them were hurtful of course she meant if taken immoderately but people were always taking things so immoderately how could it be otherwise in a world where surprise was the chronic condition of the mind and events were always happening in a way that led one to expect that everything would likely turn out in a manner that was most improbable if not impossible which she wouldnt wonder at for it was enough to fill the lower animals themselves with amazement to see the way in which scissors and thimbles and keys worried people whose whole beings ought to be bent on far higher mattersnot to mention people being left at other peoples doors by people whom one didnt know at the time but came to know afterwards as well asdear dear it was of no use talking for things had gone on so no doubt ever since adam and eve walked about in eden and doubtless things would continue to go on so more or less to the end of time  the end
