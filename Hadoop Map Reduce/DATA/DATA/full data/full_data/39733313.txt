39733313	ayesha  the return of she  by h rider haggard        here ends this history so far as it concerns science and the      outside world what its end will be as regards leo and myself is      more than i can guess but we feel that it is not reached         often i sit alone at night staring with the eyes of my mind into      the blackness of unborn time and wondering in what shape and form      the great drama will be finally developed and where the scene of      its next act will be laid and when ultimately that final      development occurs as i have no doubt it must and will occur in      obedience to a fate that never swerves and a purpose which cannot      be altered what will be the part played therein by that beautiful      egyptian amenartas the princess of the royal house of the      pharaohs for the love of whom the priest kallikrates broke his      vows to isis and pursued by the vengeance of the outraged      goddess fled down the coast of lybia to meet his doom at kor      she silver library edition p 277   dedication  my dear lang  the appointed yearsalas how many of themare gone by leaving ayesha lovely and loving and ourselves alive as it was promised in the caves of kor she has returned again  to you therefore who accepted the first i offer this further history of one of the various incarnations of that immortal  my hope is that after you have read her record notwithstanding her subtleties and sins and the shortcomings of her chronicler no easy office you may continue to wear your chain of loyalty to our lady ayesha such i confess is still the fate of your old friend  h rider haggard  ditchingham 1905     authors note  not with a view of conciliating those readers who on principle object to sequels but as a matter of fact the author wishes to say that he does not so regard this book  rather does he venture to ask that it should be considered as the conclusion of an imaginative tragedy if he may so call it whereof one half has been already published  this conclusion it was always his desire to write should he be destined to live through those many years which in obedience to his original design must be allowed to lapse between the events of the first and second parts of the romance  in response to many enquiries he may add that the name ayesha which since the days of the prophet mahomet who had a wife so called and perhaps before them has been common in the east should be pronounced assha     introduction  verily and indeed it is the unexpected that happens probably if there was one person upon the earth from whom the editor of this and of a certain previous history did not expect to hear again that person was ludwig horace holly this too for a good reason he believed him to have taken his departure from the earth  when mr holly last wrote many many years ago it was to transmit the manuscript of she and to announce that he and his ward leo vincey the beloved of the divine ayesha were about to travel to central asia in the hope i suppose that there she would fulfil her promise and appear to them again  often i have wondered idly enough what happened to them there whether they were dead or perhaps droning their lives away as monks in some thibetan lamasery or studying magic and practising asceticism under the tuition of the eastern masters trusting that thus they would build a bridge by which they might pass to the side of their adored immortal  now at length when i had not thought of them for months without a single warning sign out of the blue as it were comes the answer to these wonderings  to thinkonly to thinkthat i the editor aforesaid from its appearance suspecting something quite familiar and without interest pushed aside that dingy unregistered brownpaper parcel directed in an unknown hand and for two whole days let it lie forgotten indeed there it might be lying now had not another person been moved to curiosity and opening it found within a bundle of manuscript badly burned upon the back and with this two letters addressed to myself  although so great a time had passed since i saw it and it was shaky now because of the authors age or sickness i knew the writing at oncenobody ever made an h with that peculiar twirl under it except mr holly i tore open the sealed envelope and sure enough the first thing my eye fell upon was the signature l h holly it is long since i read anything so eagerly as i did that letter here it is  my dear siri have ascertained that you still live and strange to say i still live alsofor a little while  as soon as i came into touch with civilization again i found a copy of your book she or rather of my book and read itfirst of all in a hindostani translation my hosthe was a minister of some religious body a man of worthy but prosaic mindexpressed surprise that a wild romance should absorb me so much i answered that those who have wide experience of the hard facts of life often find interest in romance had he known what were the hard facts to which i alluded i wonder what that excellent person would have said  i see that you carried out your part of the business well and faithfully every instruction has been obeyed nothing has been added or taken away therefore to you to whom some twenty years ago i entrusted the beginning of the history i wish to entrust its end also you were the first to learn of shewhomustbeobeyed who from century to century sat alone clothed with unchanging loveliness in the sepulchres of kor waiting till her lost love was born again and destiny brought him back to her  it is right therefore that you should be the first to learn also of ayesha hesea and spirit of the mountain the priestess of that oracle which since the time of alexander the great has reigned between the flaming pillars in the sanctuary the last holder of the sceptre of hes or isis upon the earth it is right also that to you first among men i should reveal the mystic consummation of the wondrous tragedy which began at kor or perchance far earlier in egypt and elsewhere  i am very ill i have struggled back to this old house of mine to die and my end is at hand i have asked the doctor here after all is over to send you the record that is unless i change my mind and burn it first you will also receive if you receive anything at all a case containing several rough sketches which may be of use to you and a sistrum the instrument that has been always used in the worship of the nature goddesses of the old egyptians isis and hathor which you will see is as beautiful as it is ancient i give it to you for two reasons as a token of my gratitude and regard and as the only piece of evidence that is left to me of the literal truth of what i have written in the accompanying manuscript where you will find it often mentioned perhaps also you will value it as a souvenir of i suppose the strangest and loveliest being who ever was or rather is it was her sceptre the rod of her power with which i saw her salute the shadows in the sanctuary and her gift to me  it has virtues also some part of ayeshas might yet haunts the symbol to which even spirits bowed but if you should discover them beware how they are used  i have neither the strength nor the will to write more the record must speak for itself do with it what you like and believe it or not as you like i care nothing who know that it is true  who and what was ayesha nay what is ayesha an incarnate essence a materialised spirit of nature the unforeseeing the lovely the cruel and the immortal ensouled alone redeemable only by humanity and its piteous sacrifice say you i have done with speculations who depart to solve these mysteries  i wish you happiness and good fortune farewell to you and to all  l horace holly   i laid the letter down and filled with sensations that it is useless to attempt to analyse or describe opened the second envelope of which i also print the contents omitting only certain irrelevant portions and the name of the writer as it will be noted he requests me to do  this epistle that was dated from a remote place upon the shores of cumberland ran as follows  dear siras the doctor who attended mr holly in his last illness i am obliged in obedience to a promise that i made to him to become an intermediary in a some what strange business although in truth it is one of which i know very little however much it may have interested me still i do so only on the strict understanding that no mention is to be made of my name in connexion with the matter or of the locality in which i practise  about ten days ago i was called in to see mr holly at an old house upon the cliff that for many years remained untenanted except by the caretakers which house was his property and had been in his family for generations the housekeeper who summoned me told me that her master had but just returned from abroad somewhere in asia she said and that he was very ill with his heartdying she believed both of which suppositions proved to be accurate  i found the patient sitting up in bed to ease his heart and a strangelooking old man he was he had dark eyes small but full of fire and intelligence a magnificent and snowywhite beard that covered a chest of extraordinary breadth and hair also white which encroached upon his forehead and face so much that it met the whiskers upon his cheeks his arms were remarkable for their length and strength though one of them seemed to have been much torn by some animal he told me that a dog had done this but if so it must have been a dog of unusual power he was a very ugly man and yet forgive the bull beautiful i cannot describe what i mean better than by saying that his face was not like the face of any ordinary mortal whom i have met in my limited experience were i an artist who wished to portray a wise and benevolent but rather grotesque spirit i should take that countenance as a model  mr holly was somewhat vexed at my being called in which had been done without his knowledge soon we became friendly enough however and he expressed gratitude for the relief that i was able to give him though i could not hope to do more at different times he talked a good deal of the various countries in which he had travelled apparently for very many years upon some strange quest that he never clearly denned to me twice also he became lightheaded and spoke for the most part in languages that i identified as greek and arabic occasionally in english also when he appeared to be addressing himself to a being who was the object of his veneration i might almost say of his worship what he said then however i prefer not to repeat for i heard it in my professional capacity  one day he pointed to a rough box made of some foreign wood the same that i have now duly despatched to you by train and giving me your name and address said that without fail it was to be forwarded to you after his death also he asked me to do up a manuscript which like the box was to be sent to you  he saw me looking at the last sheets which had been burned away and said i repeat his exact words  yes yes that cant be helped now it must go as it is you see i made up my mind to destroy it after all and it was already on the fire when the command camethe clear unmistakable commandand i snatched it off again  what mr holly meant by this command i do not know for he would speak no more of the matter  i pass on to the last scene one night about eleven oclock knowing that my patients end was near i went up to see him proposing to inject some strychnine to keep the heart going a little longer before i reached the house i met the caretaker coming to seek me in a great fright and asked her if her master was dead she answered no but he was gonehad got out of bed and just as he was barefooted left the house and was last seen by her grandson among the very scotch firs where we were talking the lad who was terrified out of his wits for he thought that he beheld a ghost had told her so  the moonlight was very brilliant that night especially as fresh snow had fallen which reflected its rays i was on foot and began to search among the firs till presently just outside of them i found the track of naked feet in the snow of course i followed calling to the housekeeper to go and wake her husband for no one else lives near by the spoor proved very easy to trace across the clean sheet of snow it ran up the slope of a hill behind the house  now on the crest of this hill is an ancient monument of upright monoliths set there by some primeval people known locally as the devils ringa sort of miniature stonehenge in fact i had seen it several times and happened to have been present not long ago at a meeting of an archaeological society when its origin and purpose were discussed i remember that one learned but somewhat eccentric gentleman read a short paper upon a rude hooded bust and head that are cut within the chamber of a tall flattopped cromlech or dolmen which stands alone in the centre of the ring  he said that it was a representation of the egyptian goddess isis and that this place had once been sacred to some form of her worship or at any rate to that of a nature goddess with like attributes a suggestion which the other learned gentlemen treated as absurd they declared that isis had never travelled into britain though for my part i do not see why the phoenicians or even the romans who adopted her cult more or less should not have brought it here but i know nothing of such matters and will not discuss them  i remembered also that mr holly was acquainted with this place for he had mentioned it to me on the previous day asking if the stones were still uninjured as they used to be when he was young he added also and the remark struck me that yonder was where he would wish to die when i answered that i feared he would never take so long a walk again i noted that he smiled a little  well this conversation gave me a clue and without troubling more about the footprints i went on as fast as i could to the ring half a mile or so away presently i reached it and thereyes therestanding by the cromlech bareheaded and clothed in his nightthings only stood mr holly in the snow the strangest figure i think that ever i beheld  indeed never shall i forget that wild scene the circle of rough single stones pointing upwards to the starstrewn sky intensely lonely and intensely solemn the tall trilithon towering above them in the centre its shadow thrown by the bright moon behind it lying long and black upon the dazzling sheet of snow and standing clear of this shadow so that i could distinguish his every motion and even the rapt look upon his dying face the whitedraped figure of mr holly he appeared to be uttering some invocationin arabic i thinkfor long before i reached him i could catch the tones of his full sonorous voice and see his waving outstretched arms in his right hand he held the looped sceptre which by his express wish i send to you with the drawings i could see the flash of the jewels strung upon the wires and in the great stillness hear the tinkling of its golden bells  presently too i seemed to become aware of another presence and now you will understand why i desire and must ask that my identity should be suppressed naturally enough i do not wish to be mixed up with a superstitious tale which is on the face of it impossible and absurd yet under all the circumstances i think it right to tell you that i saw or thought i saw something gather in the shadow of the central dolmen or emerge from its rude chamberi know not which for certainsomething bright and glorious which gradually took the form of a woman upon whose forehead burned a starlike fire  at any rate the vision or reflection or whatever it was startled me so much that i came to a halt under the lee of one of the monoliths and found myself unable even to call to the distraught man whom i pursued  whilst i stood thus it became clear to me that mr holly also saw something at least he turned towards the radiance in the shadow uttered one cry a wild glad cry and stepped forward then seemed to fall through it on to his face  when i reached the spot the light had vanished and all i found was mr holly his arms still outstretched and the sceptre gripped tightly in his hand lying quite dead in the shadow of the trilithon   the rest of the doctors letter need not be quoted as it deals only with certain very improbable explanations of the origin of this figure of light the details of the removal of hollys body and of how he managed to satisfy the coroner that no inquest was necessary  the box of which he speaks arrived safely of the drawings in it i need say nothing and of the sistrum or sceptre only a few words it was fashioned of crystal to the wellknown shape of the cruxansata or the emblem of life of the egyptians the rod the cross and the loop combined in one from side to side of this loop ran golden wires and on these were strung gems of three colours glittering diamonds seablue sapphires and bloodred rubies while to the fourth wire that at the top hung four little golden bells  when i took hold of it first my arm shook slightly with excitement and those bells began to sound a sweet faint music like to that of chimes heard far away at night in the silence of the sea i thought too but perhaps this was fancy that a thrill passed from the hallowed and beautiful thing into my body  on the mystery itself as it is recorded in the manuscript i make no comment of it and its inner significations every reader must form his or her own judgment one thing alone is clear to meon the hypothesis that mr holly tells the truth as to what he and leo vincey saw and experienced which i at least believethat though sundry interpretations of this mystery were advanced by ayesha and others none of them are quite satisfactory  indeed like mr holly i incline to the theory that she if i may still call her by that name although it is seldom given to her in these pages put forward some of them such as the vague isismyth and the wondrous picturestory of the mountainfire as mere veils to hide the truth which it was her purpose to reveal at last in that song she never sang  the editor      ayesha  the further history of shewhomustbeobeyed    chapter i  the double sign  hard on twenty years have gone by since that night of leos visionthe most awful years perhaps which were ever endured by mentwenty years of search and hardship ending in soulshaking wonder and amazement  my death is very near to me and of this i am glad for i desire to pursue the quest in other realms as it has been promised to me that i shall do i desire to learn the beginning and the end of the spiritual drama of which it has been my strange lot to read some pages upon earth  i ludwig horace holly have been very ill they carried me more dead than alive down those mountains whose lowest slopes i can see from my window for i write this on the northern frontiers of india indeed any other man had long since perished but destiny kept my breath in me perhaps that a record might remain i must bide here a month or two till i am strong enough to travel homewards for i have a fancy to die in the place where i was born so while i have strength i will put the story down or at least those parts of it that are most essential for much can or at any rate must be omitted i shrink from attempting too long a book though my notes and memory would furnish me with sufficient material for volumes  i will begin with the vision  after leo vincey and i came back from africa in 1885 desiring solitude which indeed we needed sorely to recover from the fearful shock we had experienced and to give us time and opportunity to think we went to an old house upon the shores of cumberland that has belonged to my family for many generations this house unless somebody has taken it believing me to be dead is still my property and thither i travel to die  those whose eyes read the words i write if any should ever read them may askwhat shock  well i am horace holly and my companion my beloved friend my son in the spirit whom i reared from infancy wasnay isleo vincey  we are those men who following an ancient clue travelled to the caves of kor in central africa and there discovered her whom we sought the immortal shewhomustbeobeyed in leo she found her love that reborn kallikrates the grecian priest of isis whom some two thousand years before she had slain in her jealous rage thus executing on him the judgment of the angry goddess in her also i found the divinity whom i was doomed to worship from afar not with the flesh for that is all lost and gone from me but what is sorer still because its burden is undying with the will and soul which animate a man throughout the countless eons of his being the flesh dies or at least it changes and its passions pass but that other passion of the spiritthat longing for onenessis undying as itself  what crime have i committed that this sore punishment should be laid upon me yet in truth is it a punishment may it not prove to be but that black and terrible gate which leads to the joyous palace of rewards she swore that i should ever be her friend and his and dwell with them eternally and i believe her  for how many winters did we wander among the icy hills and deserts still at length the messenger came and led us to the mountain and on the mountain we found the shrine and in the shrine the spirit may not these things be an allegory prepared for our instruction i will take comfort i will hope that it is so nay i am sure that it is so  it will be remembered that in kor we found the immortal woman there before the flashing rays and vapours of the pillar of life she declared her mystic love and then in our very sight was swept to a doom so horrible that even now after all which has been and gone i shiver at its recollection yet what were ayeshas last words forget me not    have pity on my shame i die not i shall come again and shall once more be beautiful i swear itit is true  well i cannot set out that history afresh moreover it is written the man whom i trusted in the matter did not fail me and the book he made of it seems to be known throughout the world for i have found it here in english yes and read it first translated into hindostani to it then i refer the curious  in that house upon the desolate seashore of cumberland we dwelt a year mourning the lost seeking an avenue by which it might be found again and discovering none here our strength came back to us and leos hair that had been whitened in the horror of the caves grew again from grey to golden his beauty returned to him also so that his face was as it had been only purified and saddened  well i remember that nightand the hour of illumination we were heartbroken we were in despair we sought signs and could find none the dead remained dead to us and no answer came to all our crying  it was a sullen august evening and after we had dined we walked upon the shore listening to the slow surge of the waves and watching the lightning flicker from the bosom of a distant cloud in silence we walked till at last leo groanedit was more of a sob than a groanand clasped my arm  i can bear it no longer horace he saidfor so he called me nowi am in torment the desire to see ayesha once more saps my brain without hope i shall go quite mad and i am strong i may live another fifty years  what then can you do i asked  i can take a short road to knowledgeor to peace he answered solemnly i can die and die i willyes tonight  i turned upon him angrily for his words filled me with fear  leo you are a coward i said cannot you bear your part of pain asothers do  you mean as you do horace he answered with a dreary laugh for on you also the curse lieswith less cause well you are stronger than i am and more tough perhaps because you have lived longer no i cannot bear it i will die  it is a crime i said the greatest insult you can offer to the power that made you to cast back its gift of life as a thing outworn contemptible and despised a crime i say which will bring with it worse punishment than any you can dream perhaps even the punishment of everlasting separation  does a man stretched in some tortureden commit a crime if he snatches a knife and kills himself horace perhaps but surely that sin should find forgivenessif torn flesh and quivering nerves may plead for mercy i am such a man and i will use that knife and take my chance she is dead and in death at least i shall be nearer her  why so leo for aught you know ayesha may be living  no for then she would have given me some sign my mind is made up so talk no more or if talk we must let it be of other things  then i pleaded with him though with little hope for i saw that what i had feared for long was come to pass leo was mad shock and sorrow had destroyed his reason were it not so he in his own way a very religious man one who held as i knew strict opinions on such matters would never have purposed to commit the wickedness of suicide  leo i said are you so heartless that you would leave me here alone do you pay me thus for all my love and care and wish to drive me to my death do so if you will and my blood be on your head  your blood why your blood horace  because that road is broad and two can travel it we have lived long years together and together endured much i am sure that we shall not be long parted  then the tables were turned and he grew afraid for me but i only answered if you die i tell you that i shall die also it will certainly kill me  so leo gave way well he exclaimed suddenly i promise you it shall not be tonight let us give life another chance  good i answered but i went to my bed full of fear for i was certain that this desire of death having once taken hold of him would grow and grow until at length it became too strong and thenthen i should wither and die who could not live on alone in my despair i threw out my soul towards that of her who was departed  ayesha i cried if you have any power if in any way it is permitted show that you still live and save your lover from this sin and me from a broken heart have pity on his sorrow and breathe hope into his spirit for without hope leo cannot live and without him i shall not live  then worn out i slept  i was aroused by the voice of leo speaking to me in low excited tones through the darkness  horace he said horace my friend my father listen  in an instant i was wide awake every nerve and fibre of me for the tones of his voice told me that something had happened which bore upon our destinies  let me light a candle first i said  never mind the candle horace i would rather speak in the dark i went to sleep and i dreamed the most vivid dream that ever came to me i seemed to stand under the vault of heaven it was black black not a star shone in it and a great loneliness possessed me then suddenly high up in the vault miles and miles away i saw a little light and thought that a planet had appeared to keep me company the light began to descend slowly like a floating flake of fire down it sank and down and down till it was but just above me and i perceived that it was shaped like a tongue or fan of flame at the height of my head from the ground it stopped and stood steady and by its ghostly radiance i saw that beneath was the shape of a woman and that the flame burned upon her forehead the radiance gathered strength and now i saw the woman  horace it was ayesha herself her eyes her lovely face her cloudy hair and she looked at me sadly reproachfully i thought as one might who says why did you doubt  i tried to speak to her but my lips were dumb i tried to advance and to embrace her my arms would not move there was a barrier between us she lifted her hand and beckoned as though bidding me to follow her  then she glided away and horace my spirit seemed to loose itself from the body and to be given the power to follow we passed swiftly eastward over lands and seas andi knew the road at one point she paused and i looked downwards beneath shining in the moonlight appeared the ruined palaces of kor and there not far away was the gulf we trod together  onward above the marshes and now we stood upon the ethiopians head and gathered round watching us earnestly were the faces of the arabs our companions who drowned in the sea beneath job was among them also and he smiled at me sadly and shook his head as though he wished to accompany us and could not  across the sea again across the sandy deserts across more sea and the shores of india lay beneath us then northward ever northward above the plains till we reached a place of mountains capped with eternal snow we passed them and stayed for an instant above a building set upon the brow of a plateau it was a monastery for old monks droned prayers upon its terrace i shall know it again for it is built in the shape of a halfmoon and in front of it sits the gigantic ruined statue of a god who gazes everlastingly across the desert i knew how i cannot say that now we were far past the furthest borders of thibet and that in front of us lay untrodden lands more mountains stretched beyond that desert a sea of snowy peaks hundreds and hundreds of them  near to the monastery jutting out into the plain like some rocky headland rose a solitary hill higher than all behind we stood upon its snowy crest and waited till presently above the mountains and the desert at our feet shot a sudden beam of light that beat upon us like some signal flashed across the sea on we went floating down the beamon over the desert and the mountains across a great flat land beyond in which were many villages and a city on a mound till we lit upon a towering peak then i saw that this peak was loopshaped like the symbol of life of the egyptiansthe cruxansataand supported by a lava stem hundreds of feet in height also i saw that the fire which shone through it rose from the crater of a volcano beyond upon the very crest of this loop we rested a while till the shadow of ayesha pointed downward with its hand smiled and vanished then i awoke  horace i tell you that the sign has come to us  his voice died away in the darkness but i sat still brooding over what i had heard leo groped his way to me and seizing my arm shook it  are you asleep he asked angrily speak man speak  no i answered never was i more awake give me time  then i rose and going to the open window drew up the blind and stood there staring at the sky which grew pearlhued with the first faint tinge of dawn leo came also and leant upon the windowsill and i could feel that his body was trembling as though with cold clearly he was much moved  you talk of a sign i said to him but in your sign i see nothing but a wild dream  it was no dream he broke in fiercely it was a vision  a vision then if you will but there are visions true and false and how can we know that this is true listen leo what is there in all that wonderful tale which could not have been fashioned in your own brain distraught as it is almost to madness with your sorrow and your longings you dreamed that you were alone in the vast universe well is not every living creature thus alone you dreamed that the shadowy shape of ayesha came to you has it ever left your side you dreamed that she led you over sea and land past places haunted by your memory above the mysterious mountains of the unknown to an undiscovered peak does she not thus lead you through life to that peak which lies beyond the gates of death you dreamed  oh no more of it he exclaimed what i saw i saw and that i shall follow think as you will horace and do what you will tomorrow i start for india with you if you choose to come if not without you  you speak roughly leo i said you forget that i have had no sign and that the nightmare of a man so near to insanity that but a few hours ago he was determined upon suicide will be a poor staff to lean on when we are perishing in the snows of central asia a mixed vision this of yours leo with its mountain peak shaped like a cruxansata and the rest do you suggest that ayesha is reincarnated in central asiaas a female grand lama or something of that sort  i never thought of it but why not asked leo quietly do you remember a certain scene in the caves of kor yonder when the living looked upon the dead and dead and living were the same and do you remember what ayesha swore that she would come againyes to this world and how could that be except by rebirth or what is the same thing by the transmigration of the spirit  i did not answer this argument i was struggling with myself  no sign has come to me i said and yet i have had a part in the play humble enough i admit and i believe that i have still a part  no he said no sign has come to you i wish that it had oh how i wish you could be convinced as i am horace  then we were silent for a long while silent with our eyes fixed upon the sky  it was a stormy dawn clouds in fantastic masses hung upon the ocean one of them was like a great mountain and we watched it idly it changed its shape the crest of it grew hollow like a crater from this crater sprang a projecting cloud a rough pillar with a knob or lump resting on its top suddenly the rays of the risen sun struck upon this mountain and the column and they turned white like snow then as though melted by those fiery arrows the centre of the excrescence above the pillar thinned out and vanished leaving an enormous loop of inky cloud  look said leo in a low frightened voice that is the shape of the mountain which i saw in my vision there upon it is the black loop and there through it shines the fire it would seem that the sign is for both of us horace  i looked and looked again till presently the vast loop vanished into the blue of heaven then i turned and saidi will come with you to central asia leo    chapter ii  the lamasery  sixteen years had passed since that night vigil in the old cumberland house and behold we two leo and i were still travelling still searching for that mountain peak shaped like the symbol of life which never never could be found  our adventures would fill volumes but of what use is it to record them many of a similar nature are already written of in books those that we endured were more prolonged that is all five years we spent in thibet for the most part as guests of various monasteries where we studied the law and traditions of the lamas here we were once sentenced to death in punishment for having visited a forbidden city but escaped through the kindness of a chinese official  leaving thibet we wandered east and west and north thousands and thousands of miles sojourning amongst many tribes in chinese territory and elsewhere learning many tongues enduring much hardship thus we would hear a legend of a place say nine hundred miles away and spend two years in reaching it to find when we came there nothing  and so the time went on yet never once did we think of giving up the quest and returning since before we started we had sworn an oath that we would achieve or die indeed we ought to have died a score of times yet always were preserved most mysteriously preserved  now we were in country where so far as i could learn no european had ever set a foot in a part of the vast land called turkestan there is a great lake named balhkash of which we visited the shores two hundred miles or so to the westward is a range of mighty mountains marked on the maps as arkartytau on which we spent a year and five hundred or so to the eastward are other mountains called cherga whither we journeyed at last having explored the triple ranges of the tau  here it was that at last our true adventures began on one of the spurs of these awful cherga mountainsit is unmarked on any mapwe wellnigh perished of starvation the winter was coming on and we could find no game the last traveller we had met hundreds of miles south told us that on that range was a monastery inhabited by lamas of surpassing holiness he said that they dwelt in this wild land over which no power claimed dominion and where no tribes lived to acquire merit with no other company than that of their own pious contemplations we did not believe in its existence still we were searching for that monastery driven onward by the blind fatalism which was our only guide through all these endless wanderings as we were starving and could find no argals that is fuel with which to make a fire we walked all night by the light of the moon driving between us a single yakfor now we had no attendant the last having died a year before  he was a noble beast that yak and had the best constitution of any animal i ever knew though now like his masters he was near his end not that he was overladen for a few rifle cartridges about a hundred and fifty the remnant of a store which we had fortunately been able to buy from a caravan two years before some money in gold and silver a little tea and a bundle of skin rugs and sheepskin garments were his burden on on we trudged across a plateau of snow having the great mountains on our right till at length the yak gave a sigh and stopped so we stopped also because we must and wrapping ourselves in the skin rugs sat down in the snow to wait for daylight  we shall have to kill him and eat his flesh raw i said patting the poor yak that lay patiently at our side  perhaps we may find game in the morning answered leo still hopeful  and perhaps we may not in which case we must die  very good he replied then let us die it is the last resource of failure we shall have done our best  certainly leo we shall have done our best if sixteen years of tramping over mountains and through eternal snows in pursuit of a dream of the night can be called best  you know what i believe he answered stubbornly and there was silence between us for here arguments did not avail also even then i could not think that all our toils and sufferings would be in vain  the dawn came and by its light we looked at one another anxiously each of us desiring to see what strength was left to his companion wild creatures we should have seemed to the eyes of any civilized person leo was now over forty years of age and certainly his maturity had fulfilled the promise of his youth for a more magnificent man i never knew very tall although he seemed spare to the eye his girth matched his height and those many years of desert life had turned his muscles to steel his hair had grown long like my own for it was a protection from sun and cold and hung upon his neck a curling golden mane as his great beard hung upon his breast spreading outwards almost to the massive shoulders the face toowhat could be seen of itwas beautiful though burnt brown with weather refined and full of thought sombre almost and in it clear as crystal steady as stars shone his large grey eyes  and ii was what i have always beenugly and hirsute irongrey now also but in spite of my sixty odd years still wonderfully strong for my strength seemed to increase with time and my health was perfect in fact during all this period of rough travels although now and again we had met with accidents which laid us up for awhile neither of us had known a day of sickness hardship seemed to have turned our constitutions to iron and made them impervious to every human ailment or was this because we alone amongst living men had once inhaled the breath of the essence of life  our fears relievedfor notwithstanding our foodless night as yet neither of us showed any signs of exhaustionwe turned to contemplate the landscape at our feet beyond a little belt of fertile soil began a great desert of the sort with which we were familiarsandy saltencrusted treeless waterless and here and there streaked with the first snows of winter beyond it eighty or a hundred miles awayin that lucent atmosphere it was impossible to say how far exactlyrose more mountains a veritable sea of them of which the white peaks soared upwards by scores  as the golden rays of the rising sun touched their snows to splendour i saw leos eyes become troubled swiftly he turned and looked along the edge of the desert  see there he said pointing to something dim and enormous presently the light reached it also it was a mighty mountain not more than ten miles away that stood out by itself among the sands then he turned once more and with his back to the desert stared at the slope of the hills along the base of which we had been travelling as yet they were in gloom for the sun was behind them but presently light began to flow over their crests like a flood down it crept lower and yet lower till it reached a little plateau not three hundred yards above us there on the edge of the plateau looking out solemnly across the waste sat a great ruined idol a colossal buddha while to the rear of the idol built of yellow stone appeared the low crescentshaped mass of a monastery  at last cried leo oh heaven at last and flinging himself down he buried his face in the snow as though to hide it there lest i should read something written on it which he did not desire that even i should see  i let him lie a space understanding what was passing in his heart and indeed in mine also then going to the yak that poor brute had no share in these joyous emotions but only lowed and looked round with hungry eyes i piled the sheepskin rugs on to its back this done i laid my hand on leos shoulder saying in the most matteroffact voice i could commandcome if that place is not deserted we may find food and shelter there and it is beginning to storm again  he rose without a word brushed the snow from his beard and garments and came to help me to lift the yak to its feet for the wornout beast was too stiff and weak to rise of itself glancing at him covertly i saw on leos face a very strange and happy look a great peace appeared to possess him  we plunged upwards through the snow slope dragging the yak with us to the terrace whereon the monastery was built nobody seemed to be about there nor could i discern any footprints was the place but a ruin we had found many such indeed this ancient land is full of buildings that had once served as the homes of men learned and pious enough after their own fashion who lived and died hundreds or even thousands of years ago long before our western civilization came into being  my heart also my stomach which was starving sank at the thought but while i gazed doubtfully a little coil of blue smoke sprang from a chimney and never i think did i see a more joyful sight in the centre of the edifice was a large building evidently the temple but nearer to us i saw a small door almost above which the smoke appeared to this door i went and knocked calling aloudopen open holy lamas strangers seek your charity after awhile there was a sound of shuffling feet and the door creaked upon its hinges revealing an old old man clad in tattered yellow garments  who is it who is it he exclaimed blinking at me through a pair of horn spectacles who comes to disturb our solitude the solitude of the holy lamas of the mountains  travellers sacred one who have had enough of solitude i answered in his own dialect with which i was well acquainted travellers who are starving and who ask your charity which i added by the rule you cannot refuse  he stared at us through his horn spectacles and able to make nothing of our faces let his glance fall to our garments which were as ragged as his own and of much the same pattern indeed they were those of thibetan monks including a kind of quilted petticoat and an outer vestment not unlike an eastern burnous we had adopted them because we had no others also they protected us from the rigours of the climate and from remark had there been any to remark upon them  are you lamas he asked doubtfully and if so of what monastery  lamas sure enough i answered who belong to a monastery called the world where alas one grows hungry  the reply seemed to please him for he chuckled a little then shook his head sayingit is against our custom to admit strangers unless they be of our own faith which i am sure you are not  and much more is it against your rule holy khubilghan for so these abbots are entitled to suffer strangers to starve and i quoted a wellknown passage from the sayings of buddha which fitted the point precisely  i perceive that you are instructed in the books he exclaimed with wonder on his yellow wrinkled face and to such we cannot refuse shelter come in brethren of the monastery called the world but stay there is the yak who also has claims upon our charity and turning he struck upon a gong or bell which hung within the door  at the sound another man appeared more wrinkled and to all appearance older than the first who stared at us openmouthed  brother said the abbot shut that great mouth of yours lest an evil spirit should fly down it take this poor yak and give it fodder with the other cattle  so we unstrapped our belongings from the back of the beast and the old fellow whose grandiloquent title was master of the herds led it away  when it had gone not too willinglyfor our faithful friend disliked parting from us and distrusted this new guidethe abbot who was named kouen led us into the living room or rather the kitchen of the monastery for it served both purposes here we found the rest of the monks about twelve in all gathered round the fire of which we had seen the smoke and engaged one of them in preparing the morning meal and the rest in warming themselves  they were all old men the youngest could not have been less than sixtyfive to these we were solemnly introduced as brethren of the monastery called the world where folk grow hungry for the abbot kouen could not make up his mind to part from this little joke  they stared at us they rubbed their thin hands they bowed and wished us well and evidently were delighted at our arrival this was not strange however seeing that ours were the first new faces which they had seen for four long years  nor did they stop at words for while they made water hot for us to wash in two of them went to prepare a roomand others drew off our rough hide boots and thick outer garments and brought us slippers for our feet then they led us to the guest chamber which they informed us was a propitious place for once it had been slept in by a noted saint here a fire was lit and wonder of wonders clean garments including linen all of them ancient and faded but of good quality were brought for us to put on  so we washedyes actually washed all overand having arrayed ourselves in the robes which were somewhat small for leo struck the bell that hung in the room and were conducted by a monk who answered it back to the kitchen where the meal was now served it consisted of a kind of porridge to which was added new milk brought in by the master of the herds dried fish from a lake and buttered tea the last two luxuries produced in our special honour never had food tasted more delicious to us and i may add never did we eat more indeed at last i was obliged to request leo to stop for i saw the monks staring at him and heard the old abbot chuckling to himself  oho the monastery of the world where folk grow hungry to which another monk who was called the master of the provisions replied uneasily that if we went on like this their store of food would scarcely last the winter so we finished at length feeling as some book of maxims which i can remember in my youth said all polite people should dothat we could eat more and much impressed our hosts by chanting a long buddhist grace  their feet are in the path their feet are in the path they said astonished  yes replied leo they have been in it for sixteen years of our present incarnation but we are only beginners for you holy ones know how starhigh how oceanwide and how desertlong is that path indeed it is to be instructed as to the right way of walking therein that we have been miraculously directed by a dream to seek you out as the most pious the most saintly and the most learned of all the lamas in these parts  yes certainly we are that answered the abbot kouen seeing that there is no other monastery within five months journey and again he chuckled though alas he added with a pathetic little sigh our numbers grow few  after this we asked leave to retire to our chamber in order to rest and there upon very good imitations of beds we slept solidly for four and twenty hours rising at last perfectly refreshed and well  such was our introduction to the monastery of the mountainsfor it had no other namewhere we were destined to spend the next six months of our lives within a few daysfor they were not long in giving us their complete confidencethose goodhearted and simple old monks told us all their history  it seemed that of old time there was a lamasery here in which dwelt several hundred brethren this indeed was obviously true for the place was enormous although for the most part ruined and as the weatherworn statue of buddha showed very ancient the story ran according to the old abbot that two centuries or so before the monks had been killed out by some fierce tribe who lived beyond the desert and across the distant mountains which tribe were heretics and worshippers of fire only a few of them escaped to bring the sad news to other communities and for five generations no attempt was made to reoccupy the place  at length it was revealed to him our friend kouen when a young man that he was a reincarnation of one of the old monks of this monastery who also was named kouen and that it was his duty during his present life to return thither as by so doing he would win much merit and receive many wonderful revelations so he gathered a band of zealots and with the blessing and consent of his superiors they started out and after many hardships and losses found and took possession of the place repairing it sufficiently for their needs  this happened about fifty years before and here they had dwelt ever since only communicating occasionally with the outside world at first their numbers were recruited from time to time by new brethren but at length these ceased to come with the result that the community was dying out  and what then i asked  and then the abbot answered nothing we have acquired much merit we have been blest with many revelations and after the repose we have earned in devachan our lots in future existences will be easier what more can we ask or desire removed as we are from all the temptations of the world  for the rest in the intervals of their endless prayers and still more endless contemplations they were husbandmen cultivating the soil which was fertile at the foot of the mountain and tending their herd of yaks thus they wore away their blameless lives until at last they died of old age and as they believedand who shall say that they were wrongthe eternal round repeated itself elsewhere  immediately after indeed on the very day of our arrival at the monastery the winter began in earnest with bitter cold and snowstorms so heavy and frequent that all the desert was covered deep very soon it became obvious to us that here we must stay until the spring since to attempt to move in any direction would be to perish with some misgivings we explained this to the abbot kouen offering to remove to one of the empty rooms in the ruined part of the building supporting ourselves with fish that we could catch by cutting a hole in the ice of the lake above the monastery and if we were able to find any on game which we might trap or shoot in the scrublike forest of stunted pines and junipers that grew around its border but he would listen to no such thing we had been sent to be their guests he said and their guests we should remain for so long as might be convenient to us would we lay upon them the burden of the sin of inhospitality besides he remarked with his chucklewe who dwell alone like to hear about that other great monastery called the world where the monks are not so favoured as we who are set in this blessed situation and where folk even go hungry in body and he added in soul  indeed as we soon found out the dear old mans object was to keep our feet in the path until we reached the goal of truth or in other words became excellent lamas like himself and his flock  so we walked in the path as we had done in many another lamasery and assisted at the long prayers in the ruined temple and studied the kandjur or translation of the words of buddha which is their bible and a very long one and generally showed that our minds were open also we expounded to them the doctrines of our own faith and greatly delighted were they to find so many points of similarity between it and theirs indeed i am not certain but that if we could have stopped there long enough say ten years we might have persuaded some of them to accept a new revelation of which we were the prophets further in spare hours we told them many tales of the monastery called the world and it was really delightful and in a sense piteous to see the joy with which they listened to these stories of wondrous countries and new races of men they who knew only of russia and china and some semisavage tribes inhabitants of the mountains and the deserts  it is right for us to learn all this they declared for who knows perhaps in future incarnations we may become inhabitants of these places  but though the time passed thus in comfort and indeed compared to many of our experiences in luxury oh our hearts were hungry for in them burned the consuming fire of our quest we felt that we were on the thresholdyes we knew it we knew it and yet our wretched physical limitations made it impossible for us to advance by a single step on the desert beneath fell the snow moreover great winds arose suddenly that drove those snows like dust piling them in heaps as high as trees beneath which any unfortunate traveller would be buried here we must wait there was nothing else to be done  one alleviation we found and only one in a ruined room of the monastery was a library of many volumes placed there doubtless by the monks who were massacred in times bygone these had been more or less cared for and rearranged by their successors who gave us liberty to examine them as often as we pleased truly it was a strange collection and i should imagine of priceless value for among them were to be found buddhistic sivaistic and shamanistic writings that we had never before seen or heard of together with the lives of a multitude of bodhisatvas or distinguished saints written in various tongues some of which we did not understand  what proved more interesting to us however was a diary in many tomes that for generations had been kept by the khubilghans or abbots of the old lamasery in which every event of importance was recorded in great detail turning over the pages of one of the last volumes of this diary written apparently about two hundred and fifty years earlier and shortly before the destruction of the monastery we came upon an entry of which the followingfor i can only quote from memoryis the substance  in the summer of this year after a very great sandstorm a brother the name was given but i forget it found in the desert a man of the people who dwell beyond the far mountains of whom rumours have reached this lamasery from time to time he was living but beside him were the bodies of two of his companions who had been overwhelmed by sand and thirst he was very fierce looking he refused to say how he came into the desert telling us only that he had followed the road known to the ancients before communication between his people and the outer world ceased we gathered however that his brethren with whom he fled had committed some crime for which they had been condemned to die and that he had accompanied them in their flight he told us that there was a fine country beyond the mountains fertile but plagued with droughts and earthquakes which latter indeed we often feel here  the people of that country were he said warlike and very numerous but followed agriculture they had always lived there though ruled by khans who were descendants of the greek king called alexander who conquered much country to the southwest of us this may be true as our records tell us that about two thousand years ago an army sent by that invader penetrated to these parts though of his being with them nothing is said  the strangerman told us also that his people worship a priestess called hes or the hesea who is said to reign from generation to generation she lives in a great mountain apart and is feared and adored by all but is not the queen of the country in the government of which she seldom interferes to her however sacrifices are offered and he who incurs her vengeance dies so that even the chiefs of that land are afraid of her still their subjects often fight for they hate each other  we answered that he lied when he said that this woman was immortalfor that was what we supposed he meantsince nothing is immortal also we laughed at his tale of her power this made the man very angry indeed he declared that our buddha was not so strong as this priestess and that she would show it by being avenged upon us  after this we gave him food and turned him out of the lamasery and he went saying that when he returned we should learn who spoke the truth we do not know what became of him and he refused to reveal to us the road to his country which lies beyond the desert and the far mountains we think that perhaps he was an evil spirit sent to frighten us in which he did not succeed   such is a precis of this strange entry the discovery of which vague as it was thrilled us with hope and excitement nothing more appeared about the man or his country but within a little over a year from that date the diary of the abbot came to a sudden end without any indication that unusual events had occured or were expected  indeed the last item written in the parchment book mentioned the preparation of certain new lands to be used for the sowing of grain in future seasons which suggested that the brethren neither feared nor expected disturbance we wondered whether the man from beyond the mountains was as good as his word and had brought down the vengeance of that priestess called the hesea upon the community which sheltered him also we wonderedah how we wonderedwho and what this hesea might be  on the day following this discovery we prayed the abbot kouen to accompany us to the library and having read him the passage asked if he knew anything of the matter he swayed his wise old head which always reminded me of that of a tortoise and answereda little very little and that mostly about the army of the greek king who is mentioned in the writing  we inquired what he could possibly know of this matter whereon kouen replied calmlyin those days when the faith of the holy one was still young i dwelt as a humble brother in this very monastery which was one of the first built and i saw the army pass that is all that he added meditatively was in my fiftieth incarnation of this present roundno i am thinking of another armyin my seventythird        as students of their lives and literature will be aware      it is common for buddhist priests to state positively that      they remember events which occurred during their previous      incarnationsed  here leo began a great laugh but i managed to kick him beneath the table and he turned it into a sneeze this was fortunate as such ribald merriment would have hurt the old mans feelings terribly after all also as leo himself had once said surely we were not the people to mock at the theory of reincarnation which by the way is the first article of faith among nearly one quarter of the human race and this not the most foolish quarter  how can that bei ask for instruction learned oneseeing that memory perishes with death  ah he answered brother holly it may seem to do so but oftentimes it comes back again especially to those who are far advanced upon the path for instance until you read this passage i had forgotten all about that army but now i see it passing passing and myself with other monks standing by the statue of the big buddha in front yonder and watching it go by it was not a very large army for most of the soldiers had died or been killed and it was being pursued by the wild people who lived south of us in those days so that it was in a great hurry to put the desert between it and them the general of the army was a swarthy mani wish that i could remember his name but i cannot  well he went on that general came up to the lamasery and demanded a sleeping place for his wife and children also provisions and medicines and guides across the desert the abbot of that day told him it was against our law to admit a woman under our roof to which he answered that if we did not we should have no roof left for he would burn the place and kill every one of us with the sword now as you know to be killed by violence means that we must pass sundry incarnations in the forms of animals a horrible thing so we chose the lesser evil and gave way and afterwards obtained absolution for our sins from the great lama myself i did not see this queen but i saw the priestess of their worshipalas alas and kouen beat his breast  why alas i asked as unconcernedly as i could for this story interested me strangely  why oh because i may have forgotten the army but i have never forgotten that priestess and she has been a great hindrance to me through many ages delaying me upon my journey to the other side to the shore of salvation i as a humble lama was engaged in preparing her apartment when she entered and threw aside her veil yes and perceiving a young man spoke to me asking many questions and even if i was not glad to look again upon a woman  whatwhat was she like said leo anxiously  what was she like oh she was all loveliness in one shape she was like the dawn upon the snows she was like the evening star above the mountains she was like the first flower of the spring brother ask me not what she was like nay i will say no more oh my sin my sin i am slipping backward and you draw my black shame out into the light of day nay i will confess it that you may know how vile a thing i ami whom perhaps you have thought holylike yourselves that woman if woman she were lit a fire in my heart which will not burn out oh and more more and kouen rocked himself to and fro upon his stool while tears of contrition trickled from beneath his horn spectacles she made me worship her for first she asked me of my faith and listened eagerly as i expounded it hoping that the light would come into her heart then after i had finished she saidso your path is renunciation and your nirvana a most excellent nothingness which some would think it scarce worth while to strive so hard to reach now i will show you a more joyous way and a goddess more worthy of your worship  what way and what goddess i asked of her  the way of love and life she answered that makes all the world to be that made you o seeker of nirvana and the goddess called nature  again i asked where is that goddess and behold she drew herself up looking most royal and touching her ivory breast she said i am she now kneel you down and do me homage  my brethren i knelt yes i kissed her foot and then i fled away shamed and brokenhearted and as i went she laughed and cried remember me when you reach devachan o servant of the buddasaint for though i change i do not die and even there i shall be with you who once gave me worship  and it is so my brethren it is so for though i obtained absolution for my sin and have suffered much for it through this my next incarnation yet i cannot be rid of her and for me the utter peace is far far away and kouen placed his withered hands before his face and sobbed outright  a ridiculous sight truly to see a holy khublighan well on the wrong side of eighty weeping like a child over a dream of a beautiful woman which he imagined he had once dreamt in his last life more than two thousand years ago so the reader will say but i holly for reasons of my own felt deep sympathy with that poor old man and leo was also sympathetic we patted him on the back we assured him that he was the victim of some evil hallucination which could never be brought up against him in this or any future existence since if sin there were it must have been forgiven long ago and so forth when his calm was somewhat restored we tried also to extract further information from him but with poor results so far as the priestess was concerned  he said that he did not know to what religion she belonged and did not care but thought that it must be an evil one she went away the next morning with the army and he never saw or heard of her any more though it came into his mind that he was obliged to be locked in his cell for eight days to prevent himself from following her yes he had heard one thing for the abbot of that day had told the brethren this priestess was the real general of the army not the king or the queen the latter of whom hated her it was by her will that they pushed on northwards across the desert to some country beyond the mountains where she desired to establish herself and her worship  we asked if there really was any country beyond the mountains and kouen answered wearily that he believed so either in this or in a previous life he had heard that people lived there who worshipped fire certainly also it was true that about thirty years ago a brother who had climbed the great peak yonder to spend some days in solitary meditation returned and reported that he had seen a marvellous thing namely a shaft of fire burning in the heavens beyond those same mountains though whether this were a vision or what he could not say he recalled however that about that time they had felt a great earthquake  then the memory of that fancied transgression again began to afflict kouens innocent old heart and he crept away lamenting and was seen no more for a week nor would he ever speak again to us of this matter  but we spoke of it much with hope and wonder and made up our minds that we would at once ascend this mountain    chapter iii  the beacon light  a week later came our opportunity of making this ascent of the mountain for now in midwinter it ceased storming and hard frost set in which made it possible to walk upon the surface of the snow learning from the monks that at this season ovis poli and other kinds of bighorned sheep and game descended from the hills to take refuge in certain valleys where they scraped away the snow to find food we announced that we were going out to hunt the excuse we gave was that we were suffering from confinement and needed exercise having by the teaching of our religion no scruples about killing game  our hosts replied that the adventure was dangerous as the weather might change at any moment they told us however that on the slopes of this very mountain which we desired to climb there was a large natural cave where if need be we could take shelter and to this cave one of them somewhat younger and more active than the rest offered to guide us so having manufactured a rougri tent from skins and laden our old yak now in the best of condition with food and garments on one still morning we started as soon as it was light under the guidance of the monk who notwithstanding his years walked very well we reached the northern slope of the peak before midday here as he had said we found a great cave of which the opening was protected by an overhanging ledge of rock evidently this cave was the favourite place of shelter for game at certain seasons of the year since in it were heaped vast accumulations of their droppings which removed any fear of a lack of fuel  the rest of that short day we spent in setting up our tent in the cave in front of which we lit a large fire and in a survey of the slopes of the mountain for we told the monk that we were searching for the tracks of wild sheep indeed as it happened on our way back to the cave we came across a small herd of ewes feeding upon the mosses in a sheltered spot where in summer a streamlet ran of these we were so fortunate as to kill two for no sportsman had ever come here and they were tame enough poor things as meat would keep for ever in that temperature we had now sufficient food to last us for a fortnight and dragging the animals down the snow slopes to the cave we skinned them by the dying light  that evening we supped upon fresh mutton a great luxury which the monk enjoyed as much as we did since whatever might be his views as to taking life he liked mutton then we turned into the tent and huddled ourselves together for warmth as the temperature must have been some degrees below zero the old monk rested well enough but neither leo nor i slept over much for wonder as to what we might see from the top of that mountain banished sleep  next morning at the dawn the weather being still favourable our companion returned to the monastery whither we said we would follow him in a day or two  now at last we were alone and without wasting an instant began our ascent of the peak it was many thousand feet high and in certain places steep enough but the deep frozen snow made climbing easy so that by midday we reached the top hence the view was magnificent beneath us stretched the desert and beyond it a broad belt of fantastically shaped snowclad mountains hundreds and hundreds of them in front to the right to the left as far as the eye could reach  they are just as i saw them in my dream so many years ago muttered leo the same the very same  and where was the fiery light i asked  yonder i think and he pointed north by east  well it is not there now i answered and this place is cold  so since it was dangerous to linger lest the darkness should overtake us on our return journey we descended the peak again reaching the cave about sunset the next four days we spent in the same way every morning we crawled up those wearisome banks of snow and every afternoon we slid and tobogganed down them again till i grew heartily tired of the exercise  on the fourth night instead of coming to sleep in the tent leo sat himself down at the entrance to the cave i asked him why he did this but he answered impatiently because he wished it so i left him alone i could see indeed that he was in a strange and irritable mood for the failure of our search oppressed him moreover we knew both of us that it could not be much prolonged since the weather might break at any moment when ascents of the mountain would become impossible  in the middle of the night i was awakened by leo shaking me and sayingcome here horace i have something to show you  reluctantly enough i crept from between the rugs and out of the tent to dress there was no need for we slept in all our garments he led me to the mouth of the cave and pointed northward i looked the night was very dark but far far away appeared a faint patch of light upon the sky such as might be caused by the reflection of a distant fire  what do you make of it he asked anxiously  nothing in particular i answered it may be anything the moonno there is none dawnno it is too northerly and it does not break for three hours something burning a house or a funeral pyre but how can there be such things here i give it up  i think it is a reflection and that if we were on the peak we should see the light which throws it said leo slowly  yes but we are not and cannot get there in the dark  then horace we must spend a night there  it will be our last in this incarnation i answered with a laugh that is if it comes on to snow  we must risk it or i will risk it look the light has faded and there at least he was right for undoubtedly it had the night was as black as pitch  lets talk it over tomorrow i said and went back to the tent for i was sleepy and incredulous but leo sat on by the mouth of the cave  at dawn i awoke and found breakfast already cooked  i must start early leo explained  are you mad i asked how can we camp on that place  i dont know but i am going i must go horace  which means that we both must go but how about the yak  where we can climb it can follow he answered  so we strapped the tent and other baggage including a good supply of cooked meat upon the beasts back and started the tramp was long since we were obliged to make some detours to avoid slopes of frozen snow in which on our previous ascents we had cut footholds with an axe for up these the laden animal could not clamber reaching the summit at length we dug a hole and there pitched the tent piling the excavated snow about its sides by this time it began to grow dark and having descended into the tent yak and all we ate our food and waited  oh what cold was that the frost was fearful and at this height a wind blew whose icy breath passed through all our wrappings and seemed to burn our flesh beneath as though with hot irons it was fortunate that we had brought the yak for without the warmth from its shaggy body i believe that we should have perished even in our tent for some hours we watched as indeed we must since to sleep might mean to die yet saw nothing save the lonely stars and heard nothing in that awful silence for here even the wind made no noise as it slid across the snows accustomed as i was to such exposure my faculties began to grow numb and my eyes to shut when suddenly leo saidlook below the red star  i looked and there high in the sky was the same curious glow which we had seen upon the previous night there was more than this indeed for beneath it almost on a line with us and just above the crests of the intervening peaks appeared a faint sheet of fire and revealed against it something black whilst we watched the fire widened spread upwards and grew in power and intensity now against its flaming background the black object became clearly visible and lo it was the top of a soaring pillar surmounted by a loop yes we could see its every outline it was the crux ansata the symbol of life itself  the symbol vanished the fire sank again it blazed up more fiercely than before and the loop appeared afresh then once more disappeared a third time the fire shone and with such intensity that no lightning could surpass its brilliance all around the heavens were lit up and through the black needleshaped eye of the symbol as from the flare of a beacon or the searchlight of a ship one fierce ray shot across the sea of mountain tops and the spaces of the desert straight as an arrow to the lofty peak on which we lay yes it lit upon the snow staining it red and upon the wild white faces of us who watched though to the right and left of us spread thick darkness my compass lay before me on the snow and i could even see its needle and beyond us the shape of a white fox that had crept near scenting food then it was gone as swiftly as it came gone too were the symbol and the veil of flame behind it only the glow lingered a little on the distant sky  for awhile there was silence between us then leo saiddo you remember horace when we lay upon the rocking stone where her cloak fell upon me as he said the words the breath caught in his throathow the ray of light was sent to us in farewell and to show us a path of escape from the place of death now i think that it has been sent again in greeting to point out the path to the place of life where ayesha dwells whom we have lost awhile  it may be so i answered shortly for the matter was beyond speech or argument beyond wonder even but i knew then as i know now that we were players in some mighty predestined drama that our parts were written and we must speak them as our path was prepared and we must tread it to the end unknown fear and doubt were left behind hope was sunk in certainty the foreshadowing visions of the night had found an actual fulfilment and the pitiful seed of the promise of her who died growing unseen through all the cruel empty years had come to harvest  no we feared no more not even when with the dawn rose the roaring wind through which we struggled down the mountain slopes as it would seem in peril of our lives at every step not even as hour by hour we fought our way onwards through the whirling snowstorm that made us deaf and blind for we knew that those lives were charmed we could not see or hear yet we were led clinging to the yak we struggled downward and homewards till at length out of the turmoil and the gloom its instinct brought us unharmed to the door of the monastery where the old abbot embraced us in his joy and the monks put up prayers of thanks for they were sure that we must be dead through such a storm they said no man had ever lived before  it was still midwinter and oh the awful weariness of those months of waiting in our hands was the key yonder amongst those mountains lay the door but not yet might we set that key within its lock for between us and these stretched the great desert where the snow rolled like billows and until that snow melted we dared not attempt its passage so we sat in the monastery and schooled our hearts to patience  still even to these frozen wilds of central asia spring comes at last one evening the air felt warm and that night there were only a few degrees of frost the next the clouds banked up and in the morning not snow was falling from them but rain and we found the old monks preparing their instruments of husbandry as they said that the season of sowing was at hand for three days it rained while the snows melted before our eyes on the fourth torrents of water were rushing down the mountain and the desert was once more brown and bare though not for long for within another week it was carpeted with flowers then we knew that the time had come to start  but whither go you whither go you asked the old abbot in dismay are you not happy here do you not make great strides along the path as may be known by your pious conversation is not everything that we have your own oh why would you leave us  we are wanderers we answered and when we see mountains in front of us we must cross them  kouen looked at us shrewdly then askedwhat do you seek beyond the mountains and my brethren what merit is gathered by hiding the truth from an old man for such concealments are separated from falsehoods but by the length of a single barleycorn tell me that at least my prayers may accompany you  holy abbot i said awhile ago yonder in the library you made a certain confession to us  oh remind me not of it he said holding up his hands why do you wish to torment me  far be the thought from us most kind friend and virtuous man i answered but as it chances your story is very much our own and we think that we have experience of this same priestess  speak on he said much interested  so i told him the outlines of our tale for an hour or more i told it while he sat opposite to us swaying his head like a tortoise and saying nothing at length it was done  now i added let the lamp of your wisdom shine upon our darkness do you not find this story wondrous or do you perchance think that we are liars  brethren of the great monastery called the world kouen answered with his customary chuckle why should i think you liars who from the moment my eyes fell upon you knew you to be true men moreover why should i hold this tale so very wondrous you have but stumbled upon the fringe of a truth with which we have been acquainted for many many ages  because in a vision she showed you this monastery and led you to a spot beyond the mountains where she vanished you hope that this woman whom you saw die is reincarnated yonder why not in this there is nothing impossible to those who are instructed in the truth though the lengthening of her last life was strange and contrary to experience doubtless you will find her there as you expect and doubtless her khama or identity is the same as that which in some earlier life of hers once brought me to sin  only be not mistaken she is no immortal nothing is immortal she is but a being held back by her own pride her own greatness if you will upon the path towards nirvana that pride will be humbled as already it has been humbled that brow of majesty shall be sprinkled with the dust of change and death that sinful spirit must be purified by sorrows and by separations brother leo if you win her it will be but to lose and then the ladder must be reclimbed brother holly for you as for me loss is our only gain since thereby we are spared much woe oh bide here and pray with me why dash yourselves against a rock why labour to pour water into a broken jar whence it must sink into the sands of profitless experience and there be wasted whilst you remain athirst  water makes the sand fertile i answered where water falls life comes and sorrow is the seed of joy  love is the law of life broke in leo without love there is no life i seek love that i may live i believe that all these things are ordained to an end which we do not know fate draws me oni fulfil my fate  and do but delay your freedom yet i will not argue with you brother who must follow your own road see now what has this woman this priestess of a false faith if she be so still brought you in the past once in another life or so i understand your story you were sworn to a certain naturegoddess who was named isis were you not and to her alone then a woman tempted you and you fled with her afar and there what found you the betrayed and avenging goddess who slew you or if not the goddess one who had drunk of her wisdom and was the minister of her vengeance having that wisdom this ministerwoman or evil spiritrefused to die because she had learned to love you but waited knowing that in your next life she would find you again as indeed she would have done more swiftly in devachan had she died without living on alone in so much misery and she found you and she died or seemed to die and now she is reborn as she must be and doubtless you will meet once more and again there must come misery oh my friends go not across the mountains bide here with me and lament your sins  nay answered leo we are sworn to a tryst and we do not break our word  then brethren go keep your tryst and when you have reaped its harvest think upon my sayings for i am sure that the wine you crush from the vintage of your desire will run red like blood and that in its drinking you shall find neither forgetfulness nor peace made blind by a passion of which well i know the sting and power you seek to add a fairfaced evil to your lives thinking that from this unity there shall be born all knowledge and great joy  rather should you desire to live alone in holiness until at length your separate lives are merged and lost in the good unspeakable the eternal bliss that lies in the last nothingness ah you do not believe me now you shake your heads and smile yet a day will dawn it may be after many incarnations when you shall bow them in the dust and weep saying to me brother kouen yours were the words of wisdom ours the deeds of foolishness and with a deep sigh the old man turned and left us  a cheerful faith truly said leo looking after him to dwell through aeons in monotonous misery in order that consciousness may be swallowed up at last in some void and formless abstraction called the utter peace i would rather take my share of a bad world and keep my hope of a better also i do not think that he knows anything of ayesha and her destiny  so would i i answered though perhaps he is right after all who can tell moreover what is the use of reasoning leo we have no choice we follow our fate to what that fate may lead us we shall learn in due season  then we went to rest for it was late though i found little sleep that night the warnings of the ancient abbot good and learned man as he was full also of ripe experience and of the foresighted wisdom that is given to such as he oppressed me deeply he promised us sorrow and bloodshed beyond the mountains ending in death and rebirths full of misery well it might be so but no approaching sufferings could stay our feet and even if they could they should not since to see her face again i was ready to brave them all and if this was my case what must be that of leo  a strange theory that of kouens that ayesha was the goddess in old egypt to whom kallikrates was priest or at the least her representative that the royal amenartas with whom he fled seduced him from the goddess to whom he was sworn that this goddess incarnate in ayeshaor using the woman ayesha and her passions as her instrumentswas avenged upon them both at kor and that there in an after age the bolt she shot fell back upon her own head  well i had often thought as much myself only i was sure that she herself could be no actual divinity though she might be a manifestation of one a priestess a messenger charged to work its will to avenge or to reward and yet herself a human soul with hopes and passions to be satisfied and a destiny to fulfil in truth writing now when all is past and done with i find much to confirm me in and little to turn me from that theory since life and powers of a quality which are more than human do not alone suffice to make a soul divine on the other hand however it must be borne in mind that on one occasion at any rate ayesha did undoubtedly suggest that in the beginning she was a daughter of heaven and that there were others notably the old shaman simbri who seemed to take it for granted that her origin was supernatural but of all these things i hope to speak in their season  meanwhile what lay beyond the mountains should we find her there who held the sceptre and upon earth wielded the power of the outraged isis and with her that other woman who wrought the wrong and if so would the dread inhuman struggle reach its climax around the person of the sinful priest in a few months a few days even we might begin to know  thrilled by this thought at length i fell asleep    chapter iv  the avalanche  on the morning of the second day from that night the sunrise found us already on our path across the desert there nearly a mile behind us we could see the ruined statue of buddha seated in front of the ancient monastery and in that clear atmosphere could even distinguish the bent form of our friend the old abbot kouen leaning against it until we were quite lost to sight all the monks had wept when we parted from them and kouen even more bitterly than the rest for he had learned to love us  i am grieved he said much grieved which indeed i should not be for such emotion partakes of sin yet i find comfort for i know well that although i must soon leave this present life yet we shall meet again in many future incarnations and after you have put away these follies together tread the path to perfect peace now take with you my blessings and my prayers and begone forgetting not that should you live to returnand he shook his head doubtfullyhere you will be ever welcome  so we embraced him and went sorrowfully  it will be remembered that when the mysterious light fell upon us on the peak i had my compass with me and was able roughly to take its bearings for lack of any better guide we now followed these bearings travelling almost due northeast for in that direction had shone the fire all day in the most beautiful weather we marched across the flowerstrewn desert seeing nothing except bunches of game and one or two herds of wild asses which had come down from the mountains to feed upon the new grass as evening approached we shot an antelope and made our campfor we had brought the yak and a tent with usamong some tamarisk scrub of which the dry stems furnished us with fuel nor did we lack for water since by scraping in the sand soaked with melted snow we found plenty of fair quality so that night we supped in luxury upon tea and antelope meat which indeed we were glad to have as it spared our little store of dried provisions  the next morning we ascertained our position as well as we could and estimated that we had crossed about a quarter of the desert a guess which proved very accurate for on the evening of the fourth day of our journey we reached the bottom slopes of the opposing mountains without having experienced either accident or fatigue as leo said things were going like clockwork but i reminded him that a good start often meant a bad finish nor was i wrong for now came our hardships to begin with the mountains proved to be exceeding high it took us two days to climb their lower slopes also the heat of the sun had softened the snow which made walking through it laborious whilst accustomed though we were to such conditions through long years of travelling its continual glitter affected our eyes  the morning of the seventh day found us in the mouth of a defile which wound away into the heart of the mountains as it seemed the only possible path we followed it and were much cheered to discover that here must once have run a road not that we could see any road indeed for everything was buried in snow but that one lay beneath our feet we were certain since although we marched along the edge of precipices our path however steep was always flat moreover the rock upon one side of it had often been scarped by the hand of man of this there could be no doubt for as the snow did not cling here we saw the tool marks upon its bare surface  also we came to several places where galleries had been built out from the mountain side by means of beams let into it as is still a common practice in thibet these beams of course had long since rotted away leaving a gulf between us and the continuation of the path when we met with such gaps we were forced to go back and make a detour round or over some mountain but although much delayed thereby as it happened we always managed to regain the road if not without difficulty and danger  what tried us morefor here our skill and experience as mountaineers could not help uswas the cold at night obliged as we were to camp in the severe frost at a great altitude and to endure through the long hours of darkness penetrating and icy winds which soughed ceaselessly down the pass  at length on the tenth day we reached the end of the defile and as night was falling camped there in the most bitter cold those were miserable hours for now we had no fuel with which to boil water and must satisfy our thirst by eating frozen snow while our eyes smarted so sorely that we could not sleep and notwithstanding all our wraps and the warmth that we gathered from the yak in the little tent the cold caused our teeth to chatter like castanets  the dawn came and after it the sunrise we crept from the tent and leaving it standing awhile dragged our stiffened limbs a hundred yards or so to a spot where the defile took a turn in order that we might thaw in the rays of the sun which at that hour could not reach us where we had camped  leo was round it first and i heard him utter an exclamation in a few seconds i reached his side and lo before us lay our promised land  far beneath us ten thousand feet at leastfor it must be remembered that we viewed it from the top of a mountainit stretched away and away till its distances met the horizon in character it was quite flat an alluvial plain that probably in some primeval age had been the bottom of one of the vast lakes of which a number exist in central asia most of them now in process of desiccation one object only relieved this dreary flatness a single snowclad and gigantic mountain of which even at that distancefor it was very far from uswe could clearly see the outline indeed we could see more for from its rounded crest rose a great plume of smoke showing that it was an active volcano and on the hither lip of the crater an enormous pillar of rock whereof the top was formed to the shape of a loop  yes there it stood before us that symbol of our vision which we had sought these many years and at the sight of it our hearts beat fast and our breath came quickly we noted at once that although we had not seen it during our passage of the mountains since the peaks ahead and the rocky sides of the defile hid it from view so great was its height that it overtopped the tallest of them this made it clear to us how it came to be possible that the ray of light passing through the loop could fall upon the highest snows of that towering pinnacle which we had climbed upon the further side of the desert  also now we were certain of the cause of that ray for the smoke behind the loop explained this mystery doubtless at times when the volcano was awake that smoke must be replaced by flame emitting light of fearful intensity and this light it was that reached us concentrated and directed by the loop  for the rest we thought that about thirty miles away we could make out a whiteroofed town set upon a mound situated among trees upon the banks of a wide river which flowed across the plain also it was evident that this country had a large population who cultivated the soil for by the aid of a pair of field glasses one of our few remaining and most cherished possessions we could see the green of springing crops pierced by irrigation canals and the lines of trees that marked the limits of the fields  yes there before us stretched the promised land and there rose the mystic mount so that all we had to do was to march down the snow slopes and enter it where we would  thus we thought in our folly little guessing what lay before us what terrors and weary suffering we must endure before we stood at length beneath the shadow of the symbol of life  our fatigues forgotten we returned to the tent hastily swallowed some of our dried food which we washed down with lumps of snow that gave us toothache and chilled us inside but which thirst compelled us to eat dragged the poor yak to its feet loaded it up and started  all this while so great was our haste and so occupied were each of us with our own thoughts that if my memory serves me we scarcely interchanged a word down the snow slopes we marched swiftly and without hesitation for here the road was marked for us by means of pillars of rock set opposite to one another at intervals these pillars we observed with satisfaction for they told us that we were still upon a highway which led to the promised land  yet as we could not help noting it was one which seemed to have gone out of use since with the exception of a few wildsheep tracks and the spoor of some bears and mountain foxes not a single sign of beast or man could we discover this however was to be explained we reflected by the fact that doubtless the road was only used in the summer season or perhaps the inhabitants of the country were now stayathome people who never travelled it at all  those slopes were longer than we thought indeed when darkness closed in we had not reached the foot of them so we were obliged to spend another night in the snow pitching our tent in the shelter of an overhanging rock as we had descended many thousand feet the temperature proved fortunately a little milder indeed i do not think that there were more than eighteen or twenty degrees of frost that night also here and there the heat of the sun had melted the snow in secluded places so that we were able to find water to drink while the yak could fill its poor old stomach with deadlooking mountain mosses which it seemed to think better than nothing  again the still dawn came throwing its red garment over the lonesome endless mountains and we dragged ourselves to our numbed feet ate some of our remaining food and started onwards now we could no longer see the country beneath for it and even the towering volcano were hidden from us by an intervening ridge that seemed to be pierced by a single narrow gulley towards which we headed indeed as the pillars showed us thither ran the buried road by midday it appeared quite close to us and we tramped on in feverish haste as it chanced however there was no need to hurry for an hour later we learned the truth  between us and the mouth of the gulley rose or rather sank a sheer precipice that was apparently three or four hundred feet in depth and at its foot we could hear the sound of water  right to the edge of this precipice ran the path for one of the stone pillars stood upon its extreme brink and yet how could a road descend such a place as that we stared aghast then a possible solution occurred to us  dont you see said leo with a hollow laugh the gulf has opened since this track was used volcanic action probably  perhaps or perhaps there was a wooden bridge or stairway which has rotted it does not matter we must find another path that is all i answered as cheerfully as i could  yes and soon he said if we do not wish to stop here for ever  so we turned to the right and marched along the edge of the precipice till a mile or so away we came to a small glacier of which the surface was sprinkled with large stones frozen into its substance this glacier hung down the face of the cliff like a petrified waterfall but whether or no it reached the foot we could not discover at any rate to think of attempting its descent seemed out of the question from this point onwards we could see that the precipice increased in depth and far as the eye could reach was absolutely sheer  so we went back again and searched to the left of our road here the mountains receded so that above us rose a mighty dazzling slope of snow and below us lay that same pitiless unclimbable gulf as the light began to fade we perceived half a mile or more in front a baretopped hillock of rock which stood on the verge of the precipice and hurried to it thinking that from its crest we might be able to discover a way of descent  when at length we had struggled to the top it was about a hundred and fifty feet high what we did discover was that here also as beyond the glacier the gulf was infinitely deeper than at the spot where the road ended so deep indeed that we could not see its bottom although from it came the sound of roaring water moreover it was quite half a mile in width  whilst we stared round us the sinking sun vanished behind a mountain and the sky being heavy the light went out like that of a candle now the ascent of this hillock had proved so steep especially at one place where we were obliged to climb a sort of rock ladder that we scarcely cared to attempt to struggle down it again in that gloom therefore remembering that there was little to choose between the top of this knoll and the snow plain at its foot in the matter of temperature or other conveniences and being quite exhausted we determined to spend the night upon it thereby as we were to learn saving our lives  unloading the yak we pitched our tent under the lee of the topmost knob of rock and ate a couple of handfuls of dried fish and corncake this was the last of the food that we had brought with us from the lamasery and we reflected with dismay that unless we could shoot something our commissariat was now represented by the carcass of our old friend the yak then we wrapped ourselves up in our thick rugs and fur garments and forgot our miseries in sleep  it cannot have been long before daylight when we were awakened by a sudden and terrific sound like the boom of a great cannon followed by thousands of other sounds which might be compared to the fusillade of musketry  great heaven what is that i said  we crawled from the tent but as yet could see nothing whilst the yak began to low in a terrified manner but if we could not see we could hear and feel the booming and cracking had ceased and was followed by a soft grinding noise the most sickening sound i think to which i ever listened this was accompanied by a strange steady unnatural wind which seemed to press upon us as water presses then the dawn broke and we saw  the mountainside was moving down upon us in a vast avalanche of snow  oh what a sight was that on from the crest of the precipitous slopes above two miles and more away it came a living thing rolling sliding gliding piling itself in long leaping waves hollowing itself into cavernous valleys like a tempestdriven sea whilst above its surface hung a powdery cloud of frozen spray  as we watched clinging to each other terrified the first of these waves struck our hill causing the mighty mass of solid rock to quiver like a yacht beneath the impact of an ocean roller or an aspen in a sudden rush of wind it struck and slowly separated then with a majestic motion flowed like water over the edge of the precipice on either side and fell with a thudding sound into the unmeasured depths beneath and this was but a little thing a mere forerunner for after it with a slow serpentine movement rolled the body of the avalanche  it came in combers it came in level floods it piled itself against our hill yes to within fifty feet of the head of it till we thought that even that rooted rock must be torn from its foundations and hurled like a pebble to the deeps beneath and the turmoil of it all the screaming of the blast caused by the compression of the air the dull continuous thudding of the fall of millions of tons of snow as they rushed through space and ended their journey in the gulf  nor was this the worst of it for as the deep snows above thinned great boulders that had been buried beneath them perhaps for centuries were loosened from their restingplaces and began to thunder down the hill at first they moved slowly throwing up the hard snow around them as the prow of a ship throws foam then gathering momentum they sprang into the air with leaps such as those of shells ricocheting upon water till in the end singing and hurtling many of them rushed past and even over us to vanish far beyond some indeed struck our little mountain with the force of shot fired from the great guns of a battleship and shattered there or if they fell upon its side tore away tons of rock and passed with them into the chasm like a meteor surrounded by its satellites indeed no bombardment devised and directed by man could have been half so terrible or had there been anything to destroy half so destructive  the scene was appalling in its unchained and resistless might evolved suddenly from the completest calm there in the lap of the quiet mountains looked down upon by the peaceful tender sky the powers hidden in the breast of nature were suddenly set free and companioned by whirlwinds and all the terrifying majesty of sound loosed upon the heads of us two human atoms  at the first rush of snow we had leapt back behind our protecting peak and lying at full length upon the ground gripped it and clung there fearing lest the wind should whirl us to the abyss long ago our tent had gone like a dead leaf in an autumn gale and at times it seemed as if we must follow  the boulders hurtled over and past us one of them fell full upon the little peak shattering its crest and bursting into fragments which fled away each singing its own wild song we were not touched but when we looked behind us it was to see the yak which had risen in its terror lying dead and headless then in our fear we lay still waiting for the end and wondering dimly whether we should be buried in the surging snow or swept away with the hill or crushed by the flying rocks or lifted and lost in the hurricane  how long did it last we never knew it may have been ten minutes or two hours for in such a scene time loses its proportion only we became aware that the wind had fallen while the noise of grinding snow and hurtling boulders ceased very cautiously we gained our feet and looked  in front of us was sheer mountain side for a depth of over two miles the width of about a thousand yards which had been covered with many feet of snow was now bare rock piled up against the face of our hill almost to its summit lay a tongue of snow pressed to the consistency of ice and spotted with boulders that had lodged there the peak itself was torn and shattered so that it revealed great gleaming surfaces and pits in which glittered mica or some other mineral the vast gulf behind was half filled with the avalanche and its debris but for the rest it seemed as though nothing had happened for the sun shone sweetly overhead and the solemn snows reflected its rays from the sides of a hundred hills and we had endured it all and were still alive yes and unhurt  but what a position was ours we dared not attempt to descend the mount lest we should sink into the loose snow and be buried there moreover all along the breadth of the path of the avalanche boulders from time to time still thundered down the rocky slope and with them came patches of snow that had been left behind by the big slide small in themselves it is true but each of them large enough to kill a hundred men it was obvious therefore that until these conditions changed or death released us we must abide where we were upon the crest of the hillock  so there we sat foodless and frightened wondering what our old friend kouen would say if he could see us now by degrees hunger mastered all our other sensations and we began to turn longing eyes upon the headless body of the yak  lets skin him said leo it will be something to do and we shall want his hide tonight  so with affection and even reverence we performed this office for the dead companion of our journeyings rejoicing the while that it was not we who had brought him to his end indeed long residence among peoples who believed fully that the souls of men could pass into or were risen from the bodies of animals had made us a little superstitious on this matter it would be scarcely pleasant we reflected in some future incarnation to find our faithful friend clad in human form and to hear him bitterly reproach us for his murder  being dead however these arguments did not apply to eating him as we were sure he would himself acknowledge so we cut off little bits of his flesh and rolling them in snow till they looked as though they were nicely floured hunger compelling us swallowed them at a gulp it was a disgusting meal and we felt like cannibals but what could we do    chapter v  the glacier  even that day came to an end at last and after a few more lumps of yak our tent being gone we drew his hide over us and rested as best we could knowing that at least we had no more avalanches to fear that night it froze sharply so that had it not been for the yaks hide and the other rugs and garments which fortunately we were wearing when the snowslide began it would i think have gone hard with us as it was we suffered a great deal  horace said leo at the dawn i am going to leave this if we have to die i would rather do so moving but i dont believe that we shall die  very well i said let us start if the snow wont bear us now it never will  so we tied up our rugs and the yaks hide in two bundles and having cut off some more of the frozen meat began our descent now although the mount was under two hundred feet high its base fortunately for usfor otherwise it must have been swept away by the mighty pressure of the avalanchewas broad so that there was a long expanse of piledup snow between us and the level ground  since owing to the overhanging conformation of the place it was quite impossible for us to descend in front where pressure had made the snow hard as stone we were obliged to risk a march over the looser material upon its flank as there was nothing to be gained by waiting off we went leo leading and step by step trying the snow to our joy we discovered that the sharp night frost had so hardened its surface that it would support us about half way down however where the pressure had been less it became much softer so that we were forced to lie upon our faces which enabled us to distribute our weight over a larger surface and thus slither gently down the hill  all went well until we were within twenty paces of the bottom where we must cross a soft mound formed of the powdery dust thrown off by the avalanche in its rush leo slipped over safely but i following a yard or two to his right of a sudden felt the hard crust yield beneath me an illjudged but quite natural flounder and wriggle such as a newlylanded flatfish gives upon the sand completed the mischief and with one piercing but swiftly stifled yell i vanished  any one who has ever sunk in deep water will know that the sensation is not pleasant but i can assure him that to go through the same experience in soft snow is infinitely worse mud alone could surpass its terrors down i went and down till at length i seemed to reach a rock which alone saved me from disappearing for ever now i felt the snow closing above me and with it came darkness and a sense of suffocation so soft was the drift however that before i was overcome i contrived with my arms to thrust away the powdery dust from about my head thus forming a little hollow into which air filtered slowly getting my hands upon the stone i strove to rise but could not the weight upon me was too great  then i abandoned hope and prepared to die the process proved not altogether unpleasant i did not see visions from my past life as drowning men are supposed to do butand this shows how strong was her empire over memy mind flew back to ayesha i seemed to behold her and a man at her side standing over me in some dark rocky gulf she was wrapped in a long travelling cloak and her lovely eyes were wild with fear i rose to salute her and make report but she cried in a fierce concentrated voicewhat evil thing has happened here thou livest then where is my lord leo speak man and say where thou hast hid my lordor die  the vision was extraordinarily real and vivid i remember and considered in connection with a certain subsequent event in all ways most remarkable but it passed as swiftly as it came  then my senses left me  i saw a light again i heard a voice that of leo horace he cried horace hold fast to the stock of the rifle something was thrust against my outstretched hand i gripped it despairingly and there came a strain it was useless i did not move then bethinking me i drew up my legs and by chance or the mercy of heaven i know not got my feet against a ridge of the rock on which i was lying again i felt the strain and thrust with all my might of a sudden the snow gave and out of that hole i shot like a fox from its earth  i struck something it was leo straining at the gun and i knocked him backwards then down the steep slope we rolled landing at length upon the very edge of the precipice i sat up drawing in the air with great gasps and oh how sweet it was my eyes fell upon my hand and i saw that the veins stood out on the back of it black as ink and large as cords clearly i must have been near my end  how long was i in there i gasped to leo who sat at my side wiping off the sweat that ran from his face in streams  dont know nearly twenty minutes i should think  twenty minutes it seemed like twenty centuries how did you get me out you could not stand upon the drift dust  no i lay upon the yak skin where the snow was harder and tunnelled towards you through the powdery stuff with my hands for i knew where you had sunk and it was not far off at last i saw your finger tips they were so blue that for a few seconds i took them for rock but thrust the butt of the rifle against them luckily you still had life enough to catch hold of it and you know the rest were we not both very strong it could never have been done  thank you old fellow i said simply  why should you thank me he asked with one of his quick smiles do you suppose that i wished to continue this journey alone come if you have got your breath let us be getting on you have been sleeping in a cold bed and want exercise look my rifle is broken and yours is lost in the snow well it will save us the trouble of carrying the cartridges and he laughed drearily  then we began our march heading for the spot where the road ended four miles or so away for to go forward seemed useless in due course we reached it safely once a mass of snow as large as a church swept down just in front of us and once a great boulder loosened from the mountain rushed at us suddenly like an attacking lion or the stones thrown by polyphemus at the ship of odysseus and leaping over our heads vanished with an angry scream into the depths beneath but we took little heed of these things our nerves were deadened and no danger seemed to affect them  there was the end of the road and there were our own footprints and the impress of the yaks hoofs in the snow the sight of them affected me for it seemed strange that we should have lived to look upon them again we stared over the edge of the precipice yes it was sheer and absolutely unclimbable  come to the glacier said leo  so we went on to it and scrambling a little way down its root made an examination here so far as we could judge the cliff was about four hundred feet deep but whether or no the tongue of ice reached to the foot of it we were unable to tell since about two thirds of the way down it arched inwards like the end of a bent bow and the conformation of the overhanging rocks on either side was such that we could not see where it terminated we climbed back again and sat down and despair took hold of us bitter black despair  what are we to do i asked in front of us death behind us death for how can we recross those mountains without food or guns to shoot it with here death for we must sit and starve we have striven and failed leo our end is at hand only a miracle can save us  a miracle he answered well what was it that led us to the top of the mount so that we were able to escape the avalanche and what was it which put that rock in your way as you sank into the bed of dust and gave me wit and strength to dig you out of your grave of snow and what is it that has preserved us through seventeen years of dangers such as few men have known and lived some directing power some destiny that will accomplish itself in us why should the power cease to guide why should the destiny be baulked at last  he paused then added fiercely i tell you horace that even if we had guns food and yaks i would not turn back upon our spoor since to do so would prove me a coward and unworthy of her i will go on  how i asked  by that road and he pointed to the glacier  it is a road to death  well if so horace it would seem that in this land men find life in death or so they believe if we die now we shall die travelling our path and in the country where we perish we may be born again at least i am determined so you must choose  i have chosen long ago leo we began this journey together and we will end it together perhaps ayesha knows and will help us and i laughed drearily if notcome we are wasting time  then we took counsel and the end of it was that we cut a skin rug and the yaks tough hide into strips and knotted these together into two serviceable ropes which we fastened about our middles leaving one end loose for we thought that they might help us in our descent  next we bound fragments of another skin rug about our legs and knees to protect them from the chafing of the ice and rocks and for the same reason put on our thick leather gloves this done we took the remainder of our gear and heavy robes and having placed stones in them threw them over the brink of the precipice trusting to find them again should we ever reach its foot now our preparations were complete and it was time for us to start upon perhaps one of the most desperate journeys ever undertaken by men of their own will  yet we stayed a little looking at each other in piteous fashion for we could not speak only we embraced and i confess i think i wept a little it all seemed so sad and hopeless these longings endured through many years these perpetual weary travellings and nowthe end i could not bear to think of that splendid man my ward my most dear friend the companion of my life who stood before me so full of beauty and of vigour but who must within a few short minutes be turned into a heap of quivering mangled flesh for myself it did not matter i was old it was time that i should die i had lived innocently if it were innocent to follow this lovely image this siren of the caves who lured us on to doom  no i dont think that i thought of myself then but i thought a great deal of leo and when i saw his determined face and flashing eyes as he nerved himself to the last endeavour i was proud of him so in broken accents i blessed him and wished him well through all the aeons praying that i might be his companion to the end of time in few words and short he thanked me and gave me back my blessing then he mutteredcome  so side by side we began the terrible descent at first it was easy enough although a slip would have hurled us to eternity but we were strong and skilful accustomed to such places moreover and made none about a quarter of the way down we paused standing upon a great boulder that was embedded in the ice and turning round cautiously leaned our backs against the glacier and looked about us truly it was a horrible place almost sheer nor did we learn much for beneath us a hundred and twenty feet or more the projecting bend cut off our view of what lay below  so feeling that our nerves would not bear a prolonged contemplation of that dizzy gulf once more we set our faces to the ice and proceeded on the downward climb now matters were more difficult for the stones were fewer and once or twice we must slide to reach them not knowing if we should ever stop again but the ropes which we threw over the angles of the rocks or salient points of ice letting ourselves down by their help and drawing them after us when we reached the next foothold saved us from disaster  thus at length we came to the bend which was more than half way down the precipice being so far as i could judge about two hundred and fifty feet from its lip and say one hundred and fifty from the darksome bottom of the narrow gulf here were no stones but only some rough ice on which we sat to rest  we must look said leo presently  but the question was how to do this indeed there was only one way to hang over the bend and discover what lay below we read each others thought without the need of words and i made a motion as though i would start  no said leo i am younger and stronger than you come help me and he began to fasten the end of his rope to a strong projecting point of ice now he said hold my ankles  it seemed an insanity but there was nothing else to be done so fixing my heels in a niche i grasped them and slowly he slid forward till his body vanished to the middle what he saw does not matter for i saw it all afterwards but what happened was that suddenly all his great weight came upon my arms with such a jerk that his ankles were torn from my grip  or who knows perhaps in my terror i loosed them obeying the natural impulse which prompts a man to save his own life if so may i be forgiven but had i held on i must have been jerked into the abyss then the rope ran out and remained taut  leo i screamed leo and i heard a muffled voice saying as i thought come what it really said wasdont come but indeedand may it go to my crediti did not pause to think but face outwards just as i was sitting began to slide and scramble down the ice  in two seconds i had reached the curve in three i was over it beneath was what i can only describe as a great icicle broken off short and separated from the cliff by about four yards of space this icicle was not more than fifteen feet in length and sloped outwards so that my descent was not sheer moreover at the end of it the trickling of water or some such accident had worn away the ice leaving a little ledge as broad perhaps as a mans hand there were roughnesses on the surface below the curve upon which my clothing caught also i gripped them desperately with my fingers thus it came about that i slid down quite gently and my heels landing upon the little ledge remained almost upright with outstretched armslike a person crucified to a cross of ice  then i saw everything and the sight curdled the blood within my veins hanging to the rope four or five feet below the broken point was leo out of reach of it and out of reach of the cliff as he hung turning slowly round and round much asfor in a dreadful inconsequent fashion the absurd similarity struck me even thena joint turns before the fire below yawned the black gulf and at the bottom of it far far beneath appeared a faint white sheet of snow that is what i saw  think of it think of it i crucified upon the ice my heels resting upon a little ledge my fingers grasping excrescences on which a bird could scarcely have found a foothold round and below me dizzy space to climb back whence i came was impossible to stir even was impossible since one slip and i must be gone  and below me hung like a spider to its cord leo turning slowly round and round  i could see that rope of green hide stretch beneath his weight and the double knots in it slip and tighten and i remember wondering which would give first the hide or the knots or whether it would hold till he dropped from the noose limb by limb  oh i have been in many a perilous place i who sprang from the swaying stone to the point of the trembling spur and missed my aim but never never in such a one as this agony took hold of me a cold sweat burst from every pore i could feel it running down my face like tears my hair bristled upon my head and below in utter silence leo turned round and round and each time he turned his upcast eyes met mine with a look that was horrible to see  the silence was the worst of it the silence and the helplessness if he had cried out if he had struggled it would have been better but to know that he was alive there with every nerve and perception at its utmost stretch oh my god oh my god  my limbs began to ache and yet i dared not stir a muscle they ached horribly or so i thought and beneath this torture mental and physical my mind gave  i remembered things remembered how as a child i had climbed a tree and reached a place whence i could move neither up nor down and what i suffered then remembered how once in egypt a foolhardy friend of mine had ascended the second pyramid alone and become thus crucified upon its shining cap where he remained for a whole half hour with four hundred feet of space beneath him i could see him now stretching his stockinged foot downwards in a vain attempt to reach the next crack and drawing it back again could see his tortured face a white blot upon the red granite  then that face vanished and blackness gathered round me and in the blackness visions of the living resistless avalanche of the snowgrave into which i had sunkoh years and years ago of ayesha demanding leos life at my hands blackness and silence through which i could only hear the cracking of my muscles  suddenly in the blackness a flash and in the silence a sound the flash was the flash of a knife which leo had drawn he was hacking at the cord with it fiercely fiercely to make an end and the sound was that of the noise he made a ghastly noise half shout of defiance and half yell of terror as at the third stroke it parted  i saw it part the tough hide was half cut through and its severed portion curled upwards and downwards like the upper and lower lips of an angry dog whilst that which was unsevered stretched out slowly slowly till it grew quite thin then it snapped so that the rope flew upwards and struck me across the face like the lash of a whip  another instant and i heard a crackling thudding sound leo had struck the ground below leo was dead a mangled mass of flesh and bone as i had pictured him i could not bear it my nerve and human dignity came back i would not wait until my strength exhausted i slid from my perch as a wounded bird falls from a tree no i would follow him at once of my own act  i let my arms fall against my sides and rejoiced in the relief from pain that the movement gave me then balanced upon my heels i stood upright took my last look at the sky muttered my last prayer for an instant i remained thus poised  shouting i come i raised my hands above my head and dived as a bather dives dived into the black gulf beneath    chapter vi  in the gate  oh that rush through space folk falling thus are supposed to lose consciousness but i can assert that this is not true never were my wits and perceptions more lively than while i travelled from that broken glacier to the ground and never did a short journey seem to take a longer time i saw the white floor like some living thing leaping up through empty air to meet me thenfinis  crash why what was this i still lived i was in water for i could feel its chill and going down down till i thought i should never rise again but rise i did though my lungs were nigh to bursting first as i floated up towards the top i remembered the crash which told me that i had passed through ice therefore i should meet ice at the surface again oh to think that after surviving so much i must be drowned like a kitten and beneath a sheet of ice my hands touched it there it was above me shining white like glass heaven be praised my head broke through in this low and sheltered gorge it was but a film no thicker than a penny formed by the light frost of the previous night so i rose from the deep and stared about me treading water with my feet  then i saw the gladdest sight that ever my eyes beheld for on the right not ten yards away the water running from his hair and beard was leo leo alive for he broke the thin ice with his arms as he struggled towards the shore from the deep river he saw me also and his grey eyes seemed to start out of his head        usually as we learned afterwards the river at this      spot was quite shallow only a foot or two in depth it was      the avalanche that by damming it with fallen heaps of snow      had raised its level very many feet therefore to this      avalanche which had threatened to destroy us we in reality      owed our lives for had the stream stood only at its normal      height we must have been dashed to pieces upon the stones      l h h  still living both of us and the precipice passed he shouted in a ringing exultant voice i told you we were led  aye but whither i answered as i too fought my way through the film of ice  then it was i became aware that we were no longer alone for on the bank of the river some thirty yards from us stood two figures a man leaning upon a long staff and a woman he was a very old man for his eyes were horny his snowwhite hair and beard hung upon the bent breast and shoulders and his sardonic wrinkled features were yellow as wax they might have been those of a death mask cut in marble there clad in an ample monkish robe and leaning upon the staff he stood still as a statue and watched us i noted it all every detail although at the time i did not know that i was doing so as we broke our way through the ice towards them and afterwards the picture came back to me also i saw that the woman who was very tall pointed to us  nearer the bank or rather to the rock edge of the river its surface was free of ice for here the stream ran very swiftly seeing this we drew close together and swam on side by side to help each other if need were there was much need for in the fringe of the torrent the strength that had served me so long seemed to desert me and i became helpless numbed too with the biting coldness of the water indeed had not leo grasped my clothes i think that i should have been swept away by the current to perish thus aided i fought on a while till he saidi am going under hold to the rope end  so i gripped the strip of yaks hide that was still fast about him and his hand thus freed leo made a last splendid effort to keep us both cumbered as we were with the thick soaked garments that dragged us down like lead from being sucked beneath the surface moreover he succeeded where any other swimmer of less strength must have failed still i believe that we should have drowned since here the water ran like a millrace had not the man upon the shore seeing our plight and urged thereto by the woman run with surprising swiftness in one so aged to a point of rock that jutted some yards into the stream past which we were being swept and seating himself stretched out his long stick towards us  with a desperate endeavour leo grasped it as we went by rolling over and over each other and held on round we swung into the eddy found our feet were knocked down again rubbed and pounded on the rocks but still gripping that staff of salvation to his end of which the old man clung like a limpet to a stone while the woman clung to him we recovered ourselves and sheltered somewhat by the rock floundered towards the shore lying on his facefor we were still in great dangerthe man extended his arm we could not reach it and worse suddenly the staff was torn from him we were being swept away  then it was that the woman did a noble thing for springing into the wateryes up to her armpitsand holding fast to the old man by her left hand with the right she seized leos hair and dragged him shorewards now he found his feet for a moment and throwing one arm about her slender form steadied himself thus while with the other he supported me next followed a long confused struggle but the end of it was that three of us the old man leo and i rolled in a heap upon the bank and lay there gasping  presently i looked up the woman stood over us water streaming from her garments staring like one in a dream at leos face smothered as it was with blood running from a deep cut in his head even then i noticed how stately and beautiful she was now she seemed to awake and glancing at the robes that clung to her splendid shape said something to her companion then turned and ran towards the cliff  as we lay before him utterly exhausted the old man who had risen contemplated us solemnly with his dim eyes he spoke but we did not understand again he tried another language and without success a third time and our ears were opened for the tongue he used was greek yes there in central asia he addressed us in greek not very pure it is true but still greek  are you wizards he said that you have lived to reach this land  nay i answered in the same tongue though in broken wordssince of greek i had thought little for many a yearfor then we should have come otherwise and i pointed to our hurts and the precipice behind us  they know the ancient speech it is as we were told from the mountain he muttered to himself then he askedstrangers what seek you  now i grew cunning and did not answer fearing lest should he learn the truth he would thrust us back into the river but leo had no such caution or rather all reason had left him he was lightheaded  we seek he stuttered outhis greek which had always been feeble now was simply barbarous and mixed with various thibetan dialectswe seek the land of the fire mountain that is crowned with the sign of life  the man stared at us so you know he said then broke off and added and whom do you seek  her answered leo wildly the queen i think that he meant to say the priestess or the goddess but could only think of the greek for queen or rather something resembling it or perhaps it was because the woman who had gone looked like a queen  oh said the man you seek a queenthen you are those for whom we were bidden to watch nay how can i be sure  is this a time to put questions i gasped angrily answer me one rather who are you  i strangers my title is guardian of the gate and the lady who was with me is the khania of kaloon  at this point leo began to faint  that man is sick said the guardian and now that you have got your breath again you must have shelter both of you and at once come help me  so supporting leo on either side we dragged ourselves away from that accursed cliff and styxlike river up a narrow winding gorge presently it opened out and there stretching across the glade we saw the gate of this all i observed then for my memory of the details of this scene and of the conversation that passed is very weak and blurred was that it seemed to be a mighty wall of rock in which a pathway had been hollowed where doubtless once passed the road on one side of this passage was a stair which we began to ascend with great difficulty for leo was now almost senseless and scarcely moved his legs indeed at the head of the first flight he sank down in a heap nor did our strength suffice to lift him  while i wondered feebly what was to be done i heard footsteps and looking up saw the woman who had saved him descending the stair and after her two robed men with a tartar cast of countenance very impassive small eyes and yellowish skin even the sight of us did not appear to move them to astonishment she spoke some words to them whereon they lifted leos heavy frame apparently with ease and carried him up the steps  we followed and reached a room that seemed to be hewn from the rock above the gateway where the woman called khania left us from it we passed through other rooms one of them a kind of kitchen in which a fire burned till we came to a large chamber evidently a sleeping place for in it were wooden bedsteads mattresses and rugs here leo was laid down and with the assistance of one of his servants the old guardian undressed him at the same time motioning me to take off my own garments this i did gladly enough for the first time during many days though with great pain and difficulty to find that i was a mass of wounds and bruises  presently our host blew upon a whistle and the other servant appeared bringing hot water in a jar with which we were washed over then the guardian dressed our hurts with some soothing ointment and wrapped us round with blankets after this broth was brought into which he mixed medicine and giving me a portion to drink where i lay upon one of the beds he took leos head upon his knee and poured the rest of it down his throat instantly a wonderful warmth ran through me and my aching brain began to swim then i remembered no more  after this we were very very ill what may be the exact medical definition of our sickness i do not know but in effect it was such as follows loss of blood extreme exhaustion of body paralysing shock to the nerves and extensive cuts and contusions these taken together produced a long period of semiunconsciousness followed by another period of fever and delirium all that i can recall of those weeks while we remained the guests of the guardian of the gate may be summed up in one worddreams that is until at last i recovered my senses  the dreams themselves are forgotten which is perhaps as well since they were very confused and for the most part awful a hotchpotch of nightmares reflected without doubt from vivid memories of our recent and fearsome sufferings at times i would wake up from them a little i suppose when food was administered to me and receive impressions of whatever was passing in the place thus i can recollect that yellowfaced old guardian standing over me like a ghost in the moonlight stroking his long beard his eyes fixed upon my face as though he would search out the secrets of my soul  they are the men he muttered to himself without doubt they are the men then walked to the window and looked up long and earnestly like one who studies the stars  after this i remember a disturbance in the room and dominating it as it were the rich sound of a womans voice and the rustle of a womans silks sweeping the stone floor i opened my eyes and saw that it was she who had helped to rescue us who had rescued us in fact a tall and noblelooking lady with a beauteous weary face and liquid eyes which seemed to burn from the heavy cloak she wore i thought that she must have just returned from a journey  she stood above me and looked at me then turned away with a gesture of indifference if not of disgust speaking to the guardian in a low voice by way of answer he bowed pointing to the other bed where leo lay asleep and thither she passed with slow imperious movements i saw her bend down and lift the corner of a wrapping which covered his wounded head and heard her utter some smothered words before she turned round to the guardian as though to question him further  but he had gone and being alone for she thought me senseless she drew a rough stool to the side of the bed and seating herself studied leo who lay thereon with an earnestness that was almost terrible for her soul seemed to be concentrated in her eyes and to find expression through them long she gazed thus then rose and began to walk swiftly up and down the chamber pressing her hands now to her bosom and now to her brow a certain passionate perplexity stamped upon her face as though she struggled to remember something and could not  where and when she whispered oh where and when  of the end of that scene i know nothing for although i fought hard against it oblivion mastered me after this i became aware that the regallooking woman called khania was always in the room and that she seemed to be nursing leo with great care and tenderness sometimes even she nursed me when leo did not need attention and she had nothing else to do or so her manner seemed to suggest it was as though i excited her curiosity and she wished me to recover that it might be satisfied  again i awoke how long afterwards i cannot say it was night and the room was lighted by the moon only now shining in a clear sky its steady rays entering at the windowplace fell on leos bed and by them i saw that the dark imperial woman was watching at his side some sense of her presence must have communicated itself to him for he began to mutter in his sleep now in english now in arabic she became intensely interested as her every movement showed then rising suddenly she glided across the room on tiptoe to look at me seeing her coming i feigned to be asleep and so well that she was deceived  for i was also interested who was this lady whom the guardian had called the khania of kaloon could it be she whom we sought why not and yet if i saw ayesha surely i should know her surely there would be no room for doubt  back she went again to the bed kneeling down beside leo and in the intense silence which followedfor he had ceased his mutteringsi thought that i could hear the beating of her heart now she began to speak very low and in that same bastard greek tongue mixed here and there with mongolian words such as are common to the dialects of central asia i could not hear or understand all she said but some sentences i did understand and they frightened me not a little  man of my dreams she murmured whence come you who are you why did the hesea bid me to meet you then some sentences i could not catch you sleep in sleep the eyes are opened answer i bid you say what is the bond between you and me why have i dreamt of you why do i know you why and the sweet rich voice died slowly from a whisper into silence as though she were ashamed to utter what was on her tongue  as she bent over him a lock of her hair broke loose from its jewelled fillet and fell across his face at its touch leo seemed to wake for he lifted his gaunt white hand and touched the hair then said in englishwhere am i oh i remember and their eyes met as he strove to lift himself and could not then he spoke again in his broken stumbling greek you are the lady who saved me from the water say are you also that queen whom i have sought so long and endured so much to find  i know not she answered in a voice as sweet as honey a low trembling voice but true it is i am a queenif a khania be a queen  say then queen do you remember me  we have met in dreams she answered i think that we have met in a past that is far away yes i knew it when first i saw you there by the river stranger with the well remembered face tell me i pray you how you are named  leo vincey  she shook her head whisperingi know not the name yet you i know  you know me how do you know me he said heavily and seemed to sink again into slumber or swoon  she watched him for a while very intently then as though some force that she could not resist drew her i saw her bend down her head over his sleeping face yes and i saw her kiss him swiftly on the lips then spring back crimson to the hair as though overwhelmed with shame at this victory of her mad passion  now it was that she discovered me  bewildered fascinated amazed i had raised myself upon my bed not knowing it i suppose that i might see and hear the better it was wrong doubtless but no common curiosity overmastered me who had my share in all this story more it was foolish but illness and wonder had killed my reason  yes she saw me watching them and such fury seemed to take hold of her that i thought my hour had come  man have you dared she said in an intense whisper and snatching at her girdle now in her hand shone a knife and i knew that it was destined for my heart then in this sore danger my wit came back to me and as she advanced i stretched out my shaking hand sayingoh of your pity give me to drink the fever burns me it burns and i looked round like one bewildered who sees not repeating give me drink you who are called guardian and i fell back exhausted  she stopped like a hawk in its stoop and swiftly sheathed the dagger then taking a bowl of milk that stood on a table near her she held it to my lips searching my face the while with her flaming eyes for indeed passion rage and fear had lit them till they seemed to flame i drank the milk in great gulps though never in my life did i find it more hard to swallow  you tremble she said have dreams haunted you  aye friend i answered dreams of that fearsome precipice and of the last leap  aught else she asked  nay is it not enough oh what a journey to have taken to befriend a queen  to befriend a queen she repeated puzzled what means the man you swear you have had no other dreams  aye i swear by the symbol of life and the mount of the wavering flame and by yourself o queen from the ancient days  then i sighed and pretended to swoon for i could think of nothing else to do as i closed my eyes i saw her face that had been red as dawn turn pale as eve for my words and all which might lie behind them had gone home moreover she was in doubt for i could hear her fingering the handle of the dagger then she spoke aloud words for my ears if they still were open  i am glad she said that he dreamed no other dreams since had he done so and babbled of them it would have been illomened and i do not wish that one who has travelled far to visit us should be hurled to the deathdogs for burial one moreover who although old and hideous still has the air of a wise and silent man  now while i shivered at these unpleasant hintsthough what the deathdogs in which people were buried might be i could not conceiveto my intense joy i heard the foot of the guardian on the stairs heard him too enter the room and saw him bow before the lady  how go these sick men niece he said in his cold voice        i found later that the khania atene was not simbris      niece but his greatniece on the mothers sidel h h  they swoon both of them she answered  indeed is it so i thought otherwise i thought they woke  what have you heard shaman ie wizard she asked angrily  i oh i heard the grating of a dagger in its sheath and the distant baying of the deathhounds  and what have you seen shaman she asked again looking through the gate you guard  strange sight khania my niece butmen awake from swoons  aye she answered so while this one sleeps bear him to another chamber for he needs change and the lord yonder needs more space and untainted air  the guardian whom she called shaman or magician held a lamp in his hand and by its light it was easy to see his face which i watched out of the corner of my eye i thought that it wore a very strange expression one moreover that alarmed me somewhat from the beginning i had misdoubted me of this old man whose cast of countenance was vindictive as it was able now i was afraid of him  to which chamber khania he said with meaning  i think she answered slowly to one that is healthful where he will recover the man has wisdom she added as though in explanation moreover having the word from the mountain to harm him would be dangerous but why do you ask  he shrugged his shoulders  i tell you i heard the deathhounds bay that is all yes with you i think that he has wisdom and the bee which seeks honey should suck the flowerbefore it fades also as you say there are commands with which it is ill to trifle even if we cannot guess their meaning  then going to the door he blew upon his whistle and instantly i heard the feet of his servants upon the stairs he gave them an order and gently enough they lifted the mattress on which i lay and followed him down sundry passages and past some stairs into another chamber shaped like that we had left but not so large where they placed me upon a bed  the guardian watched me awhile to see that i did not wake next he stretched out his hand and felt my heart and pulse an examination the results of which seemed to puzzle him for he uttered a little exclamation and shook his head after this he left the room and i heard him bolt the door behind him then being still very weak i fell asleep in earnest  when i awoke it was broad daylight my mind was clear and i felt better than i had done for many a day signs by which i knew that the fever had left me and that i was on the high road to recovery now i remembered all the events of the previous night and was able to weigh them carefully this to be sure i did for many reasons among them that i knew i had been and still was in great danger  i had seen and heard too much and this woman called khania guessed that i had seen and heard indeed had it not been for my hints about the symbol of life and the mount of flame after i had disarmed her first rage by my artifice i felt sure that she would have ordered the old guardian or shaman to do me to death in this way or the other sure also that he would not have hesitated to obey her i had been spared partly because for some unknown reason she was afraid to kill me and partly that she might learn how much i knew although the deathhounds had bayed whatever that might mean well up to the present i was safe and for the rest i must take my chance moreover it was necessary to be cautious and if need were to feign ignorance so dismissing the matter of my own fate from my mind i fell to considering the scene which i had witnessed and what might be its purport  was our quest at an end was this woman ayesha leo had so dreamed but he was still delirious therefore here was little on which to lean what seemed more to the point was that she herself evidently appeared to think that there existed some tie between her and this sick man why had she embraced him i was sure that she could be no wanton nor indeed would any woman indulge for its own sake in such folly with a stranger who hung between life and death what she had done was done because irresistible impulse born of knowledge or at least of memories drove her on though mayhap the knowledge was imperfect and the memories were undefined who save ayesha could have known anything of leo in the past none who lived upon the earth today  and yet why not if what kouen the abbot and tens of millions of his fellowworshippers believed were true if the souls of human beings were in fact strictly limited in number and became the tenants of an endless succession of physical bodies which they change from time to time as we change our wornout garments why should not others have known him for instance that daughter of the pharaohs who caused him through love to break the vows that he had vowed knew a certain kallikrates a priest of isis whom the gods cherish and the demons obey even amenartas the mistress of magic  oh now a light seemed to break upon me a wonderful light what if amenartas and this khania this woman with royalty stamped on every feature should be the same would not that magic of my own people that i have of which she wrote upon the sherd enable her to pierce the darkness of the past and recognize the priest whom she had bewitched to love her snatching him out of the very hand of the goddess what if it were not ayesha but amenartas reincarnate who ruled this hidden land and once more sought to make the man she loved break through his vows if so knowing the evil that must come i shook even at its shadow the truth must be learned but how  whilst i wondered the door opened and the sardonic inscrutableoldfaced man whom this khania had called magician and who called the khania niece entered and stood before me    chapter vii  the first ordeal  the shaman advanced to my side and asked me courteously how i fared  i answered better far better oh my hostbut how are you named  simbri he answered and as i told you by the water my title is hereditary guardian of the gate by profession i am the royal physician in this land  did you say physician or magician i asked carelessly as though i had not caught the word he gave me a curious look  i said physician and it is well for you and your companion that i have some skill in my art otherwise i think perhaps you would not have been alive today o my guestbut how are you named  holly i said  o my guest holly  had it not been for the foresight that brought you and the lady khania to the edge of yonder darksome river certainly we should not have been alive venerable simbri a foresight that seems to me to savour of magic in such a lonely place that is why i thought you might have described yourself as a magician though it is true that you may have been but fishing in those waters  certainly i was fishing stranger hollyfor men and i caught two  fishing by chance host simbri  nay by design guest holly my trade of physician includes the study of future events for i am the chief of the shamans or seers of this land and having been warned of your coming quite recently i awaited your arrival  indeed that is strange most courteous also so here physician and magician mean the same  you say it he answered with a grave bow but tell me if you will how did you find your way to a land whither visitors do not wander  oh i answered perhaps we are but travellers or perhaps we also have studiedmedicine  i think that you must have studied it deeply since otherwise you would not have lived to cross those mountains in search ofnow what did you seek your companion i think spoke of a queenyonder on the banks of the torrent  did he did he indeed well that is strange since he seems to have found one for surely that royallooking lady named khania who sprang into the stream and saved us must be a queen  a queen she is and a great one for in our land khania means queen though how friend holly a man who has lain senseless can have learned this i do not know nor do i know how you come to speak our language  that is simple for the tongue you talk is very ancient and as it chances in my own country it has been my lot to study and to teach it it is greek but although it is still spoken in the world how it reached these mountains i cannot say  i will tell you he answered many generations ago a great conqueror born of the nation that spoke this tongue fought his way through the country to the south of us he was driven back but a general of his of another race advanced and crossed the mountains and overcame the people of this land bringing with him his masters language and his own worship here he established his dynasty and here it remains for being ringed in with deserts and with pathless mountain snows we hold no converse with the outer world  yes i know something of that story the conqueror was named alexander was he not i asked  he was so named and the name of the general was rassen a native of a country called egypt or so our records tell us his descendants hold the throne to this day and the khania is of his blood  was the goddess whom he worshipped called isis  nay he answered she was called hes  which i interrupted is but another title for isis tell me is her worship continued here i ask because it is now dead in egypt which was its home  there is a temple on the mountain yonder he replied indifferently and in it are priests and priestesses who practise some ancient cult but the real god of this people now as long before the day of rassen their conqueror is the fire that dwells in this same mountain which from time to time breaks out and slays them  and does a goddess dwell in the fire i asked  again he searched my face with his cold eyes then answeredstranger holly i know nothing of any goddess that mountain is sacred and to seek to learn its secrets is to die why do you ask such questions  only because i am curious in the matter of old religions and seeing the symbol of life upon yonder peak came hither to study yours of which indeed a tradition still remains among the learned  then abandon that study friend holly for the road to it runs through the paws of the deathhounds and the spears of savages nor indeed is there anything to learn  and what physician are the deathhounds  certain dogs to which according to our ancient custom all offenders against the law or the will of the khan are cast to be torn to pieces  the will of the khan has this khania of yours a husband then  aye he answered her cousin who was the ruler of half the land now they and the land are one but you have talked enough i am here to say that your food is ready and he turned to leave the room  one more question friend simbri how came i to this chamber and where is my companion  you were borne hither in your sleep and see the change has bettered you do you remember nothing  nothing nothing at all i answered earnestly but what of my friend  he also is better the khania atene nurses him  atene i said that is an old egyptian name it means the disk of the sun and a woman who bore it thousands of years ago was famous for her beauty  well and is not my niece atene beautiful  how can i tell o uncle of the khania i answered wearily who have scarcely seen her  then he departed and presently his yellowfaced silent servants brought me my food  later in the morning the door opened again and through it unattended came the khania atene who shut and bolted it behind her this action did not reassure me still rising in my bed i saluted her as best i could although at heart i was afraid she seemed to read my doubts for she saidlie down and have no fear at present you will come by no harm from me now tell me what is the man called leo to you your son nay it cannot be sinceforgive melight is not born of darkness  i have always thought that it was so born khania yet you are right he is but my adopted son and a man whom i love  say what seek you here she asked  we seek khania whatsoever fate shall bring us on yonder mountain that which is crowned with flame  her face paled at the words but she answered in a steady voicethen there you will find nothing but doom if indeed you do not find it before you reach its slopes which are guarded by savage men yonder is the college of hes and to violate its sanctuary is death to any man death in the everburning fire  and who rules this college khaniaa priestess  yes a priestess whose face i have never seen for she is so old that she veils herself from curious eyes  ah she veils herself does she i answered as the blood went thrilling through my veins i who remembered another who also was so old that she veiled herself from curious eyes well veiled or unveiled we would visit her trusting to find that we are welcome  that you shall not do she said for it is unlawful and i will not have your blood upon my hands  which is the stronger i asked of her you khania or this priestess of the mountain  i am the stronger holly for so you are named are you not look you at my need i can summon sixty thousand men in war while she has naught but her priests and the fierce untrained tribes  the sword is not the only power in the world i answered tell me now does this priestess ever visit the country of kaloon  never never for by the ancient pact made after the last great struggle long centuries ago between the college and the people of the plain it was decreed and sworn to that should she set her foot across the river this means war to the end between us and rule for the victor over both likewise save when unguarded they bear their dead to burial or for some such high purpose no khan or khania of kaloon ascends the mountain  which then is the true masterthe khan of kaloon or the head of the college of hes i asked again  in matters spiritual the priestess of hes who is our oracle and the voice of heaven in matters temporal the khan of kaloon  the khan ah you are married lady are you not  aye she answered her face flushing and i will tell you what you soon must learn if you have not learned it already i am the wife of a madman and he ishateful to me  i have earned the last already khania  she looked at me with her piercing eyes  what did my uncle the shaman he who is called guardian tell you nay you saw as i knew you saw and it would have been best to slay you for oh what must you think of me  i made no answer for in truth i did not know what to think also i feared lest further rash admissions should be followed by swift vengeance  you must believe she went on that i who have ever hated men that ii swear that it is truewhose lips are purer than those mountain snows i the khania of kaloon whom they name heartofice am but a shameless thing and covering her face with her hand she moaned in the bitterness of her distress  nay i said there may be reasons explanations if it pleases you to give them  wanderer there are such reasons and since you know so much you shall learn them also like that husband of mine i have become mad when first i saw the face of your companion as i dragged him from the river madness entered me and ii  loved him i suggested well such things have happened before to people who were not mad  oh she went on it was more than love i was possessed and that night i knew not what i did a power drove me on a destiny compelled me and to the end i am his and his alone yes i am his and i swear that he shall be mine and with this wild declaration dangerous enough under the conditions she turned and fled the room  she was gone and after the struggle for such it was i sank back exhausted how came it that this sudden passion had mastered her who and what was this khania i wondered again andthis was more to the point who and what would leo believe her to be if only i could be with him before he said words or did deeds impossible to recall  three days went by during which time i saw no more of the khania who or so i was informed by simbri the shaman had returned to her city to make ready for us her guests i begged him to allow me to rejoin leo but he answered politely though with much firmness that my fosterson did better without me now i grew suspicious fearing lest some harm had come to leo though how to discover the truth i knew not in my anxiety i tried to convey a note to him written upon a leaf of a watergained pocketbook but the yellowfaced servant refused to touch it and simbri said drily that he would have naught to do with writings which he could not read at length on the third night i made up my mind that whatever the risk with leave or without it i would try to find him  by this time i could walk well and indeed was almost strong again so about midnight when the moon was up for i had no other light i crept from my bed threw on my garments and taking a knife which was the only weapon i possessed opened the door of my room and started  now when i was carried from the rockchamber where leo and i had been together i took note of the way first reckoning from my sleepingplace there was a passage thirty paces long for i had counted the footfalls of my bearers then came a turn to the left and ten more paces of passage and lastly near certain steps running to some place unknown another sharp turn to the right which led to our old chamber  down the long passage i walked stealthily and although it was pitch dark found the turn to the left and followed it till i came to the second sharp turn to the right that of the gallery from which rose the stairs i crept round it only to retreat hastily enough as well i might for at the door of leos room which she was in the act of locking on the outside as i could see by the light of the lamp that she held in her hand stood the khania herself  my first thought was to fly back to my own chamber but i abandoned it feeling sure that i should be seen therefore i determined if she discovered me to face the matter out and say that i was trying to find leo and to learn how he fared so i crouched against the wall and waited with a beating heart i heard her sweep down the passage andyesbegin to mount the stair  now what should i do to try to reach leo was useless for she had locked the door with the key she held go back to bed no i would follow her and if we met would make the same excuse thus i might get some tidings or perhapsa dagger thrust  so round the corner and up the steps i went noiselessly as a snake they were many and winding like those of a church tower but at length i came to the head of them where was a little landing and opening from it a door it was a very ancient door the light streamed through cracks where its panels had rotted and from the room beyond came the sound of voices those of the shaman simbri and the khania  have you learned aught my niece i heard him say and also heard her answera little a very little  then in my thirst for knowledge i grew bold and stealing to the door looked through one of the cracks in its wood opposite to me in the full flood of light thrown by a hanging lamp her hand resting on a table at which simbri was seated stood the khania truly she was a beauteous sight for she wore robes of royal purple and on her brow a little coronet of gold beneath which her curling hair streamed down her shapely neck and bosom seeing her i guessed at once that she had arrayed herself thus for some secret end enhancing her loveliness by every art and grace that is known to woman simbri was looking at her earnestly with fear and doubt written on even his cold impassive features  what passed between you then he asked peering at her  i questioned him closely as to the reason of his coming to this land and wrung from him the answer that it was to seek some beauteous womanhe would say no more i asked him if she were more beauteous than i am and he replied with courtesynothing else i thinkthat it would be hard to say but that she had been different then i said that though it behooved me not to speak of such a matter there was no lady in kaloon whom men held to be so fair as i moreover that i was its ruler and that i and no other had saved him from the water aye and i added that my heart told me i was the woman whom he sought  have done niece said simbri impatiently i would not hear of the arts you usedwell enough doubtless what then  then he said that it might be so since he thought that this woman was born again and studied me a while asking me if i had ever passed through fire to this i replied that the only fires i had passed were those of the spirit and that i dwelt in them now he said show me your hair and i placed a lock of it in his hand presently he let it fall and from that satchel which he wears about his neck drew out another tress of hairoh simbri my uncle the loveliest hair that ever eyes beheld for it was soft as silk and reached from my coronet to the ground moreover no ravens wing in the sunshine ever shone as did that fragrant tress  yours is beautiful he said but see they are not the same  mayhap i answered since no woman ever wore such locks  you are right he replied for she whom i seek was more than a woman  and thenand thenthough i tried him in many ways he would say no more so feeling hate against this unknown rising in my heart and fearing lest i should utter words that were best unsaid i left him now i bid you search the books which are open to your wisdom and tell me of this woman whom he seeks who she is and where she dwells oh search them swiftly that i may find her andkill her if i can  aye if you can answered the shaman and if she lives to kill but say where shall we begin our quest now this letter from the mountain that the headpriest oros sent to your court a while agoand he selected a parchment from a pile which lay upon the table and looked at her  read she said i would hear it again  so he read from the hesea of the house of fire to atene khania of kaloon  my sisterwarning has reached me that two strangers of a western race journey to your land seeking my oracle of which they would ask a question on the first day of the next moon i command that you and with you simbri your greatuncle the wise shaman guardian of the gate shall be watching the river in the gulf at the foot of the ancient road for by that steep path the strangers travel aid them in all things and bring them safely to the mountain knowing that in this matter i shall hold him and you to account myself i will not meet them since to do so would be to break the pact between our powers which says that the hesea of the sanctuary visits not the territory of kaloon save in war also their coming is otherwise appointed  it would seem said simbri laying down the parchment that these are no chance wanderers since hes awaits them  aye they are no chance wanderers since my heart awaited one of them also yet the hesea cannot be that woman for reasons which are known to you  there are many women on the mountain suggested the shaman in a dry voice if indeed any woman has to do with this matter  i at least have to do with it and he shall not go to the mountain  hes is powerful my niece and beneath these smooth words of hers lies a dreadful threat i say that she is mighty from of old and has servants in the earth and air who warned her of the coming of these men and will warn her of what befalls them i know it who hate her and to your royal house of rassen it has been known for many a generation therefore thwart her not lest ill befall us all for she is a spirit and terrible she says that it is appointed that they shall go  and i say it is appointed that he shall not go let the other go if he desires  atene be plain what will you with the man called leothat he should become your lover asked the shaman  she stared him straight in the eyes and answered boldlynay i will that he should become my husband  first he must will it too who seems to have no mind that way also how can a woman have two husbands  she laid her hand upon his shoulder and saidi have no husband you know it well simbri i charge you by the close bond of blood between us brew me another draught  that we may be bound yet closer in a bond of murder nay atene i will not already your sin lies heavy on my head you are very fair take the man in your own net if you may or let him be which is better far  i cannot let him be would that i were able i must love him as i must hate the other whom he loves yet some power hardens his heart against me oh great shaman you that peep and mutter you who can read the future and the past tell me what you have learned from your stars and divinations  already i have sought through many a secret toilsome hour and learned this atene he answered you are right the fate of yonder man is intertwined with yours but between you and him there rises a mighty wall that my vision cannot pierce nor my familiars climb yet i am taught that in death you and heaye and i also shall be very near together  then come death she exclaimed with sullen pride for thence at least ill pluck out my desire  be not so sure he answered for i think that the power follows us even down this dark gulf of death i think also that i feel the sleepless eyes of hes watching our secret souls  then blind them with the dust of illusionsas you can tomorrow also saying nothing of their sex send a messenger to the mountain and tell the hesea that two old strangers have arrivedmark you oldbut that they are very sick that their limbs were broken in the river and that when they have healed again i will send them to ask the question of her oraclethat is some three moons hence perchance she may believe you and be content to wait or if she does not at least no more words i must sleep or my brain will burst give me that medicine which brings dreamless rest for never did i need it more who also feel eyes upon me and she glanced towards the door  then i left and not too soon for as i crept down the darksome passage i heard it open behind me    chapter viii  the deathhounds  it may have been ten oclock on the following morning or a little past it when the shaman simbri came into my room and asked me how i had slept  like a log i answered like a log a drugged man could not have rested more soundly  indeed friend holly and yet you look fatigued  my dreams troubled me somewhat i answered i suffer from such things but surely by your face friend simbri you cannot have slept at all for never yet have i seen you with so weary an air  i am weary he said with a sigh last night i spent up on my businesswatching at the gates  what gates i asked those by which we entered this kingdom for if so i would rather watch than travel them  the gates of the past and of the future yes those two which you entered if you will for did you not travel out of a wondrous past towards a future that you cannot guess  but both of which interest you i suggested  perhaps he answered then added i come to tell you that within an hour you are to start for the city whither the khania has but now gone on to make ready for you  yes only you told me that she had gone some days ago well i am sound again and prepared to march but say how is my fosterson  he mends he mends but you shall see him for yourself it is the khanias will here come the slaves bearing your robes and with them i leave you  so with their assistance i dressed myself first in good clean underlinen then in wide woollen trousers and vest and lastly in a furlined camelhair robe dyed black that was very comfortable to wear and in appearance not unlike a long overcoat a flat cap of the same material and a pair of boots made of untanned hide completed my attire  scarcely was i ready when the yellowfaced servants with many bows took me by the hand and led me down the passages and stairs of the gatehouse to its door here to my great joy i found leo looking pale and troubled but otherwise as well as i could expect after his sickness he was attired like myself save that his garments were of a finer quality and the overcoat was white with a hood to it added i suppose to protect the wound in his head from cold and the sun this white dress i thought became him very well also about it there was nothing grotesque or even remarkable he sprang to me and seized my hand asking how i fared and where i had been hidden away a greeting of which as i could see the warmth was not lost upon simbri who stood by  i answered well enough now that we were together again and for the rest i would tell him later  then they brought us palanquins carried each of them by two ponies one of which was harnessed ahead and the other behind between long shaftlike poles in these we seated ourselves and at a sign from simbri slaves took the leading ponies by the bridle and we started leaving behind us that grim old gatehouse through which we were the first strangers to pass for many a generation  for a mile or more our road ran down a winding rocky gorge till suddenly it took a turn and the country of kaloon lay stretched before us at our feet was a river probably the same with which we had made acquaintance in the gulf where fed by the mountain snows it had its source here it flowed rapidly but on the vast alluvial lands beneath became a broad and gentle stream that wound its way through the limitless plains till it was lost in the blue of the distance  to the north however this smooth monotonous expanse was broken by that mountain which had guided us from afar the house of fire it was a great distance from us more than a hundred miles i should say yet even so a most majestic sight in that clear air many leagues from the base of its peak the ground began to rise in brown and rugged hillocks from which sprang the holy mountain itself a white and dazzling point that soared full twenty thousand feet into the heavens  yes and there upon the nether lip of its crater stood the gigantic pillar surmounted by a yet more gigantic loop of virgin rock whereof the blackness stood out grimly against the blue of the sky beyond and the blinding snow beneath  we gazed at it with awe as well we might this beacon of our hopes that for aught we knew might also prove their monument feeling even then that yonder our fate would declare itself i noted further that all those with us did it reverence by bowing their heads as they caught sight of the peak and by laying the first finger of the right hand across the first finger of the left a gesture as we afterwards discovered designed to avert its evil influence yes even simbri bowed a yielding to inherited superstition of which i should scarcely have suspected him  have you ever journeyed to that mountain asked leo of him  simbri shook his head and answered evasively  the people of the plain do not set foot upon the mountain among its slopes beyond the river which washes them live hordes of brave and most savage men with whom we are oftentimes at war for when they are hungry they raid our cattle and our crops moreover there when the mountain labours run red streams of molten rock and now and again hot ashes fall that slay the traveller  do the ashes ever fall in your country asked leo  they have been known to do so when the spirit of the mountain is angry and that is why we fear her  who is this spirit said leo eagerly  i do not know lord he answered with impatience can men see a spirit  you look as though you might and had not so long ago replied leo fixing his gaze on the old mans waxen face and uneasy eyes for now their horny calm was gone from the eyes of simbri which seemed as though they had beheld some sight that haunted him  you do me too much honour lord he replied my skill and vision do not reach so far but see here is the landingstage where boats await us for the rest of our journey is by water  these boats proved to be roomy and comfortable having flat bows and sterns since although sometimes a sail was hoisted they were designed for towing not to be rowed with oars leo and i entered the largest of them and to our joy were left alone except for the steersman  behind us was another boat in which were attendants and slaves and some men who looked like soldiers for they carried bows and swords now the ponies were taken from the palanquins that were packed away and ropes of green hide fastened to iron rings in the prows of the boats were fixed to the towing tackle with which the animals had been reharnessed then we started the ponies two arranged tandem fashion to each punt trotting along a wellmade towing path that was furnished with wooden bridges wherever canals or tributary streams entered the main river  thank heaven said leo we are together again at last do you remember horace that when we entered the land of kor it was thus in a boat the tale repeats itself  i can quite believe it i answered i can believe anything leo i say that we are but gnats meshed in a web and yonder khania is the spider and simbri the shaman guards the net but tell me all you remember of what has happened to you and be quick for i do not know how long they may leave us alone  well he said of course i remember our arrival at that gate after the lady and the old man had pulled us out of the river and horace talking of spiders reminds me of hanging at the end of that string of yaks hide not that i need much reminding for i am not likely to forget it do you know i cut the rope because i felt that i was going mad and wished to die sane what happened to you did you slip  no i jumped after you it seemed best to end together so that we might begin again together  brave old horace he said affectionately the tears starting to his grey eyes  well never mind all that i broke in you see you were right when you said that we should get through and we have now for your tale  it is interesting but not very long he answered colouring i went to sleep and when i woke it was to find a beautiful woman leaning over me and horaceat first i thought that it wasyou know who and that she kissed me but perhaps it was all a dream  it was no dream i answered i saw it  i am sorry to hear itvery sorry at any rate there was the beautiful womanthe khaniafor i saw her plenty of times afterwards and talked to her in my best modern greekby the way ayesha knew the old greek thats curious  she knew several of the ancient tongues and so did other people go on  well she nursed me very kindly but so far as i know until last night there was nothing more affectionate and i had sense enough to refuse to talk about our somewhat eventful past i pretended not to understand said that we were explorers etc and kept asking her where you were for i forgot to say i found that you had gone i think that she grew rather angry with me for she wanted to know something and as you can guess i wanted to know a good deal but i could get nothing out of her except that she was the khaniaa person in authority there was no doubt about that for when one of those slaves or servants came in and interrupted her while she was trying to draw the facts out of me she called to some of her people to throw him out of the window and he only saved himself by going down the stairs very quickly  well i could make nothing of her and she could make little of me though why she should be so tenderly interested in a stranger i dont knowunless unlessoh who is she horace  if you will go on i will tell you what i think presently one tale at a time  very good i got quite well and strong comparatively speaking till the climax last night which upset me again after that old prophet simbri had brought me my supper just as i was thinking of going to sleep the khania came in alone dressed like a queen i can tell you she looked really royal like a princess in a fairy book with a crown on and her chestnut black hair flowing round her  well horace then she began to make love to me in a refined sort of way or so i thought looked at me and sighed saying that we had known each other in the pastvery well indeed i gatheredand implying that she wished to continue our friendship i fenced with her as best i could but a man feels fairly helpless lying on his back with a very handsome and very imperiallooking lady standing over him and paying him compliments  the end of it was that driven to it by her questions and to stop that sort of thing i told her that i was looking for my wife whom i had lost for after all ayesha is my wife horace she smiled and suggested that i need not look far in short that the lost wife was already foundin herself who had come to save me from death in the river indeed she spoke with such conviction that i grew sure that she was not merely amusing herself and felt very much inclined to believe her for after all ayesha may be changed now  then while i was at my wits end i remembered the lock of hairall that remains to us of her and leo touched his breast i drew it out and compared it with the khanias and at the sight of it she became quite different jealous i suppose for it is longer than hers and not in the least like  horace i tell you that the touch of that lock of hairfor she did touch itappeared to act upon her nature like nitric acid upon sham gold it turned it black all the bad in her came out in her anger her voice sounded coarse yes she grew almost vulgar and as you know when ayesha was in a rage she might be wicked as we understand it and was certainly terrible but she was never either coarse or vulgar any more than lightning is  well from that moment i was sure that whoever this khania may be she had nothing to do with ayesha they are so different that they never could have been the samelike the hair so i lay quiet and let her talk and coax and threaten on until at length she drew herself up and marched from the room and i heard her lock the door behind her thats all i have to tell you and quite enough too for i dont think that the khania has done with me and to say the truth i am afraid of her  yes i said quite enough now sit still and dont start or talk loud for that steersman is probably a spy and i can feel old simbris eyes fixed upon our backs dont interrupt either for our time alone may be short  then i set to work and told him everything i knew while he listened in blank astonishment  great heavens what a tale he exclaimed as i finished now who is this hesea who sent the letter from the mountain and who who is the khania  who does your instinct tell you that she is leo  amenartas he whispered doubtfully the woman who wrote the sherd whom ayesha said was the egyptian princessmy wife two thousand years ago amenartas reborn  i nodded i think so why not as i have told you again and again i have always been certain of one thing that if we were allowed to see the next act of the piece we should find amenartas or rather the spirit of amenartas playing a leading part in it you will remember i wrote as much in that record  if the old buddhist monk kouen could remember his past as thousands of them swear that they do and be sure of his identity continued from that past why should not this woman with so much at stake helped as she is by the wizardry of the shaman her uncle faintly remember hers  at any rate leo why should she not still be sufficiently under its influence to cause her without any fault or seeking of her own to fall madly in love at first sight with a man whom after all she has always loved  the argument seems sound enough horace and if so i am sorry for the khania who hasnt much choice in the matterbeen forced into it so to speak  yes but meanwhile your foot is in a trap again guard yourself leo guard yourself i believe that this is a trial sent to you and doubtless there will be more to follow but i believe also that it would be better for you to die than to make any mistake  i know it well he answered and you need not be afraid whatever this khania may have been to me in the pastif she was anything at allthat story is done with i seek ayesha and ayesha alone and venus herself shall not tempt me from her  then we began to speak with hope and fear of that mysterious hesea who had sent the letter from the mountain commanding the shaman simbri to meet us the priestess or spirit whom he declared was mighty from of old and had servants in the earth and air  presently the prow of our barge bumped against the bank of the river and looking round i saw that simbri had left the boat in which he sat and was preparing to enter ours this he did and placing himself gravely on a seat in front of us explained that nightfall was coming on and he wished to give us his company and protection through the dark  and to see that we do not give him the slip in it muttered leo  then the drivers whipped up their ponies and we went on again  look behind you said simbri presently and you will see the city where you will sleep tonight  we turned ourselves and there about ten miles away perceived a flatroofed town of considerable though not of very great size its position was good for it was set upon a large island that stood a hundred feet or more above the level of the plain the river dividing into two branches at the foot of it and as we discovered afterwards uniting again beyond  the vast mound upon which this city was built had the appearance of being artificial but very possibly the soil whereof it was formed had been washed up in past ages during times of flood so that from a mudbank in the centre of the broad river it grew by degrees to its present proportions with the exception of a columned and towered edifice that crowned the city and seemed to be encircled by gardens we could see no great buildings in the place  how is the city named asked leo of simbri  kaloon he answered as was all this land even when my forefathers the conquerors marched across the mountains and took it more than two thousand years ago they kept the ancient title but the territory of the mountain they called hes because they said that the loop upon yonder peak was the symbol of a goddess of this name whom their general worshipped  priestesses still live there do they not said leo trying in his turn to extract the truth  yes and priests also the college of them was established by the conquerors who subdued all the land or rather it took the place of another college of those who fashioned the sanctuary and the temple whose god was the fire in the mountain as it is that of the people of kaloon today  then who is worshipped there now  the goddess hes it is said but we know little of the matter for between us and the mountain folk there has been enmity for ages they kill us and we kill them for they are jealous of their shrine which none may visit save by permission to consult the oracle and to make prayer or offering in times of calamity when a khan dies or the waters of the river sink and the crops fail or when ashes fall and earthquakes shake the land or great sickness comes otherwise unless they attack us we leave them alone for though every man is trained to arms and can fight if need be we are a peaceful folk who cultivate the soil from generation to generation and thus grow rich look round you is it not a scene of peace  we stood up in the boat and gazed about us at the pastoral prospect everywhere appeared herds of cattle feeding upon meadow lands or troops of mules and horses or square fields sown with corn and outlined by trees village folk also clad in long grey gowns were labouring on the land or their days toil finished driving their beasts homewards along roads built upon the banks of the irrigation dykes towards the hamlets that were placed on rising knolls amidst tall poplar groves  in its sharp contrast with the arid deserts and fearful mountains amongst which we had wandered for so many years this country struck us as most charming and indeed seen by the red light of the sinking sun on that spring day even as beautiful with the same kind of beauty which is to be found in holland one could understand too that these landowners and peasantfarmers would by choice be men of peace and what a temptation their wealth must offer to the hungry halfsavage tribes of the mountains  also it was easy to guess when the survivors of alexanders legions under their egyptian general burst through the iron band of snowclad hills and saw this sweet country with its homes its herds and its ripening grass that they must have cried with one voice we will march and fight and toil no more here we will sit us down to live and die thus doubtless they did taking them wives from among the women of the people of the land which they had conqueredperhaps after a single battle  now as the light faded the wreaths of smoke which hung over the distant firemountain began to glow luridly redder and more angry did they become while the darkness gathered till at length they seemed to be charged with pulsing sheets of flame propelled from the womb of the volcano which threw piercing beams of light through the eye of the giant loop that crowned its brow far far fled those beams making a bright path across the land and striking the white crests of the bordering wall of mountains high in the air ran that path over the dim roofs of the city of kaloon over the river yes straight above us over the mountains and doubtlessthough there we could not follow themacross the desert to that high eminence on its farther side where we had lain bathed in their radiance it was a wondrous and most impressive sight one too that filled our companions with fear for the steersmen in our boats and the drivers on the towingpath groaned aloud and began to utter prayers what do they say asked leo of simbri  they say lord that the spirit of the mountain is angry and passes down yonder flying light that is called the road of hes to work some evil to our land therefore they pray her not to destroy them  then does that light not always shine thus he asked again  nay but seldom once about three months ago and now tonight but before that not for years let us pray that it portends no misfortune to kaloon and its inhabitants  for some minutes this fearsome illumination continued then it ceased as suddenly as it had begun and there remained of it only the dull glow above the crest of the peak  presently the moon rose a white shining ball and by its rays we perceived that we drew near to the city but there was still something left for us to see before we reached its shelter while we sat quietly in the boatfor the silence was broken only by the lapping of the still waters against its sides and the occasional splash of the slackened towline upon their surfacewe heard a distant sound as of a hunt in full cry  nearer and nearer it came its volume swelling every moment till it was quite close at last now echoing from the trodden earth of the towingpathnot that on which our ponies travelled but the other on the west bank of the riverwas heard the beat of the hoofs of a horse galloping furiously presently it appeared a fine white animal on the back of which sat a man it passed us like a flash but as he went by the man lifted himself and turned his head so that we saw his face in the moonlight saw also the agony of fear that was written on it and in his eyes  he had come out of the darkness he was gone into the darkness but after him swelled that awful music look a dog appeared a huge red dog that dropped its foaming muzzle to the ground as it galloped then lifted it and uttered a deepthroated belllike bay others followed and yet others in all there must have been a hundred of them every one baying as it took the scent  the deathhounds i muttered clasping leo by the arm  yes he answered they are running that poor devil here comes the huntsman  as he spoke there appeared a second figure splendidly mounted a cloak streaming from his shoulders and in his hand a long whip which he waved he was big but loosely jointed and as he passed he turned his face also and we saw that it was that of a madman there could be no doubt of it insanity blazed in those hollow eyes and rang in that savage screeching laugh  the khan the khan said simbri bowing and i could see that he was afraid  now he too was gone and after him came his guards i counted eight of them all carrying whips with which they flogged their horses  what does this mean friend simbri i asked as the sounds grew faint in the distance  it means friend holly he answered that the khan does justice in his own fashionhunting to death one that has angered him  what then is his crime and who is that poor man  he is a great lord of this land one of the royal kinsmen and the crime for which he has been condemned is that he told the khania he loved her and offered to make war upon her husband and kill him if she would promise herself to him in marriage but she hated the man as she hates all men and brought the matter before the khan that is all the story  happy is that prince who has so virtuous a wife i could not help saying unctuously but with meaning and the old wretch of a shaman turned his head at my words and began to stroke his white beard  it was but a little while afterwards that once more we heard the baying of the deathhounds yes they were heading straight for us this time across country again the white horse and its rider appeared utterly exhausted both of them for the poor beast could scarcely struggle on to the towingpath as it gained it a great red hound with a black ear gripped its flank and at the touch of the fangs it screamed aloud in terror as only a horse can the rider sprang from its back and to our horror ran to the rivers edge thinking evidently to take refuge in our boat but before ever he reached the water the devilish brutes were upon him  what followed i will not describe but never shall i forget the scene of those two heaps of worrying wolves and of the maniac khan who yelled in his fiendish joy and cheered on his deathhounds to finish their red work    chapter ix  the court of kaloon  horrified sick at heart we continued our journey no wonder that the khania hated such a mad despot and this woman was in love with leo and this lunatic khan her husband was a victim to jealousy which he avenged after the very unpleasant fashion that we had witnessed truly an agreeable prospect for all of us yet i could not help reflecting as an object lesson that horrid scene had its advantages  now we reached the place where the river forked at the end of the island and disembarked upon a quay here a guard of men commanded by some household officer was waiting to receive us they led us through a gate in the high wall for the town was fortified up a narrow stonepaved street which ran between houses apparently of the usual central asian type and so far as i could judge by moonlight with no pretensions to architectural beauty and not large in size  clearly our arrival was expected and excited interest for people were gathered in knots about the street to watch us pass also at the windows of the houses and even on their flat roofs at the top of the long street was a sort of market place crossing which accompanied by a curious crowd who made remarks about us that we could not understand we reached a gate in an inner wall here we were challenged but at a word from simbri it opened and we passed through to find ourselves in gardens following a road or drive we came to a large rambling house or palace surmounted by high towers and very solidly built of stone in a heavy bastard egyptian style  beyond its doorway we found ourselves in a courtyard surrounded by a kind of verandah from which short passages led to different rooms down one of these passages we were conducted by the officer to an apartment or rather a suite consisting of a sitting and two bedchambers which were panelled richly furnished in rather barbaric fashion and welllighted with primitive oil lamps  here simbri left us saying that the officer would wait in the outer room to conduct us to the dininghall as soon as we were ready then we entered the bedchambers where we found servants or slaves quietmannered obsequious men these valets changed our footgear and taking off our heavy travelling robes replaced them with others fashioned like civilized frockcoats but made of some white material and trimmed with a beautiful ermine fur  having dressed us in these they bowed to show that our toilette was finished and led us to the large outer room where the officer awaited us he conducted us through several other rooms all of them spacious and apparently unoccupied to a great hall lit with many lamps and warmedfor the nights were still coldwith large peat fires the roof of this hall was flat and supported by thick stone columns with carved capitals and its walls were hung with worked tapestries that gave it an air of considerable comfort  at the head of the hall on a dais stood a long narrow table spread with a cloth and set with platters and cups of silver here we waited till butlers with wands appeared through some curtains which they drew then came a man beating a silver gong and after him a dozen or more courtiers all dressed in white robes like ourselves followed by perhaps as many ladies some of them young and goodlooking and for the most part of a fair type with wellcut features though others were rather yellowskinned they bowed to us and we to them  then there was a pause while we studied one another till a trumpet blew and heralded by footmen in a kind of yellow livery two figures were seen advancing down the passage beyond the curtains preceded by the shaman simbri and followed by other officers they were the khan and the khania of kaloon  no one looking at this khan as he entered his dininghall clad in festal white attire would have imagined him to be the same raving human brute whom we had just seen urging on his devilish hounds to tear a fellowcreature and a helpless horse to fragments and devour them now he seemed a heavy loutish man very strongly built and not illlooking but with shifty eyes evidently a person of dulled intellect whom one would have thought incapable of keen emotions of any kind the khania need not be described she was as she had been in the chambers of the gate only more weary looking indeed her eyes had a haunted air and it was easy to see that the events of the previous night had left their mark upon her mind at the sight of us she flushed a little then beckoned to us to advance and said to her husbandmy lord these are the strangers of whom i have told you  his dull eyes fell upon me first and my appearance seemed to amuse him vaguely at any rate he laughed rudely saying in barbarous greek mixed with words from the local patoiswhat a curious old animal i have never seen you before have i  no great khan i answered but i have seen you out hunting this night did you have good sport  instantly he became wide awake and answered rubbing his handsexcellent he gave us a fine run but my little dogs caught him at last and then and he snapped his powerful jaws together  cease your brutal talk broke in his wife fiercely and he slunk away from her and in so doing stumbled against leo who was waiting to be presented to him  the sight of this great goldenbearded man seemed to astonish him for he stared at him then askedare you the khanias other friend whom she went to see in the mountains of the gate then i could not understand why she took so much trouble but now i do well be careful or i shall have to hunt you also  now leo grew angry and was about to reply but i laid my hand upon his arm and said in englishdont answer the man is mad  bad you mean grumbled leo and if he tries to set his cursed dogs on me i will break his neck  then the khania motioned to leo to take a seat beside her placing me upon her other hand between herself and her uncle the guardian while the khan shuffled to a chair a little way down the table where he called two of the prettiest ladies to keep him company  such was our introduction to the court of kaloon as for the meal that followed it was very plentiful but coarse consisting for the most part of fish mutton and sweetmeats all of them presented upon huge silver platters also much strong drink was served a kind of spirit distilled from grain of which nearly all present drank more than was good for them after a few words to me about our journey the khania turned to leo and talked to him for the rest of the evening while i devoted myself to the old shaman simbri  put briefly the substance of what i learned from him then and afterwards was as followstrade was unknown to the people of kaloon for the reason that all communication with the south had been cut off for ages the bridges that once existed over the chasm having been allowed to rot away their land which was very large and densely inhabited was ringed round with unclimbable mountains except to the north where stood the great firepeak the slopes of this peak and an unvisited expanse of country behind that ran up to the confines of a desert were the home of ferocious mountain tribes untamable highlanders who killed every stranger they caught consequently although the precious and other metals were mined to a certain extent and manufactured into articles of use and ornament money did not exist among the peoples either of the plain or of the mountain all business being transacted on the principle of barter and even the revenue collected in kind  amongst the tens of thousands of the aborigines of kaloon dwelt a mere handful of a ruling class who were said to beand probably weredescended from the conquerors that appeared in the time of alexander their blood however was now much mixed with that of the first inhabitants who to judge from their appearance and the yellow hue of their descendants must have belonged to some branch of the great tartar race the government if so it could be called was on the whole of a mild though of a very despotic nature and vested in an hereditary khan or khania according as a man or a woman might be in the most direct descent  of religions there were two that of the people who worshipped the spirit of the fire mountain and that of the rulers who believed in magic ghosts and divinations even this shadow of a religion if so it can be called was dying out like its followers for generation by generation the white lords grew less in number or became absorbed in the bulk of the people  still their rule was tolerated i asked simbri why seeing that they were so few he shrugged his shoulders and answered because it suited the country of which the natives had no ambition moreover the present khania our hostess was the last of the direct line of rulers her husband and cousin having less of the blood royal in his veins and as such the people were attached to her  also as is commonly the case with bold and beautiful women she was popular among them especially as she was just and very liberal to the poor these were many as the country was overpopulated which accounted for its wonderful state of cultivation lastly they trusted to her skill and courage to defend them from the continual attacks of the mountain tribes who raided their crops and herds their one grievance against her was that she had no child to whom the khanship could descend which meant that after her death as had happened after that of her father there would be struggles for the succession  indeed added simbri with meaning and glancing at leo out of the corners of his eyes the folk say openly that it would be a good thing if the khan who oppresses them and whom they hate should die so that the khania might take another husband while she is still young although he is mad he knows this and that is why he is so jealous of any lord who looks at her as friend holly you saw tonight for should such an one gain her favour rassen thinks that it would mean his death  also he may be attached to his wife i suggested speaking in a whisper  perhaps so answered simbri but if so she loves not him nor any of these men and he glanced round the hall  certainly they did not look lovable for by this time most of them were half drunk while even the women seemed to have taken as much as was good for them the khan himself presented a sorry spectacle for he was leaning back in his chair shouting something about his hunting in a thick voice the arm of one of his pretty companions was round his neck while the other gave him to drink from a gold cup some of the contents of which had been spilt down his white robe  just then atene looked round and saw him and an expression of hatred and contempt gathered on her beautiful face  see i heard her say to leo see the companion of my days and learn what it is to be khania of kaloon  then why do you not cleanse your court he asked  because lord if i did so there would be no court left swine will to their mire and these men and women who live in idleness upon the toil of the humble folk will to their liquor and vile luxury well the end is near for it is killing them and their children are but few weakly also for the ancient blood grows thin and stale but you are weary and would rest tomorrow we will ride together and calling to an officer she bade him conduct us to our rooms  so we rose and accompanied by simbri bowed to her and went she standing and gazing after us a royal and pathetic figure in the midst of all that dissolute revelry the khan rose also and in his cunning fashion understood something of the meaning of it all  you think us gay he shouted and why should we not be who do not know how long we have to live but you yellowhaired fellow you must not let atene look at you like that i tell you she is my wife and if you do i shall certainly have to hunt you  at this drunken sally the courtiers roared with laughter but taking leo by the arm simbri hurried him from the hall  friend said leo when we were outside it seems to me that this khan of yours threatens my life  have no fear lord answered the guardian so long as the khania does not threaten it you are safe she is the real ruler of this land and i stand next to her  then i pray you said leo keep me out of the way of that drunken man for look you if i am attacked i defend myself  and who can blame you simbri replied with one of his slow mysterious smiles  then we parted and having placed both our beds in one chamber slept soundly enough for we were very tired till we were awakened in the morning by the baying of those horrible deathhounds being fed i suppose in a place nearby  now in this city of kaloon it was our weary destiny to dwell for three long months one of the most hateful times perhaps that we ever passed in all our lives indeed compared to it our endless wanderings amid the central asia snows and deserts were but pleasure pilgrimages and our stay at the monastery beyond the mountains a sojourn in paradise to set out its record in full would be both tedious and useless so i will only tell briefly of our principal adventures  on the morrow of our arrival the khania atene sent us two beautiful white horses of pure and ancient blood and at noon we mounted them and went out to ride with her accompanied by a guard of soldiers first she led us to the kennels where the deathhounds were kept great flagged courts surrounded by iron bars in which were narrow locked gates never had i seen brutes so large and fierce the mastiffs of thibet were but as lapdogs compared to them they were red and black smoothcoated and with a bloodhound head and the moment they saw us they came ravening and leaping at the bars as an angry wave leaps against a rock  these hounds were in the charge of men of certain families who had tended them for generations they obeyed their keepers and the khan readily enough but no stranger might venture near them also these brutes were the executioners of the land for to them all murderers and other criminals were thrown and with them as we had seen the khan hunted any who had incurred his displeasure moreover they were used for a more innocent purpose the chasing of certain great bucks which were preserved in woods and swamps of reeds thus it came about that they were a terror to the country since no man knew but what in the end he might be devoured by them going to the dogs is a term full of meaning in any land but in kaloon it had a significance that was terrible  after we had looked at the hounds not without a prophetic shudder we rode round the walls of the town which were laid out as a kind of boulevard where the inhabitants walked and took their pleasure in the evenings on these however there was not much to see except the river beneath and the plain beyond moreover though they were thick and high there were places in them that must be passed carefully for like everything else with which the effete ruling class had to do they had been allowed to fall into disrepair  the town itself was an uninteresting place also for the most part peopled by hangerson of the court so we were not sorry when we crossed the river by a highpitched bridge where in days to come i was destined to behold one of the strangest sights ever seen by mortal man and rode out into the country here all was different for we found ourselves among the husbandmen who were the descendants of the original owners of the land and lived upon its produce every available inch of soil seemed to be cultivated by the aid of a wonderful system of irrigation indeed water was lifted to levels where it would not flow naturally by means of wheels turned with mules or even in some places carried up by the women who bore poles on their shoulders to which were balanced buckets  leo asked the khania what happened if there was a bad season she replied grimly that famine happened in which thousands of people perished and that after the famine came pestilence these famines were periodical and were it not for them she added the people would long ago have been driven to kill each other like hungry rats since having no outlet and increasing so rapidly the land large as it was could not hold them all  will this be a good year i asked  it is feared not she answered for the river has not risen well and but few rains have fallen also the light that shone last night on the firemountain is thought a bad omen which means they say that the spirit of the mountain is angry and that drought will follow let us hope they will not say also that this is because strangers have visited the land bringing with them bad luck  if so said leo with a laugh we shall have to fly to the mountain to take refuge there  do you then wish to take refuge in death she asked darkly of this be sure my guests that never while i live shall you be allowed to cross the river which borders the slopes of yonder peak  why not khania  because my lord leothat is your name is it notsuch is my will and while i rule here my will is law come let us turn homewards  that night we did not eat in the great hall but in the room which adjoined our bedchambers we were not left alone however for the khania and her uncle the shaman who always attended her joined our meal when we greeted them wondering she said briefly that it was arranged thus because she refused to expose us to more insults she added that a festival had begun which would last for a week and that she did not wish us to see how vile were the ways of her people  that evening and many others which followed itwe never dined in the central hall againpassed pleasantly enough for the khania made leo tell her of england where he was born and of the lands that he had visited their peoples and customs i spoke also of the history of alexander whose general rassen her faroff forefather conquered the country of kaloon and of the land of egypt whence the latter came and so it went on till midnight while atene listened to us greedily her eyes fixed always on leos face  many such nights did we spend thus in the palace of the city of kaloon where in fact we were close prisoners but oh the days hung heavy on our hands if we went into the courtyard or reception rooms of the palace the lords and their followers gathered round us and pestered us with questions for being very idle they were also very curious  also the women some of whom were fair enough began to talk to us on this pretext or on that and did their best to make love to leo for in contrast with their slim delicatelooking men they found this deepchested yellowhaired stranger to their taste indeed they troubled him much with gifts of flowers and messages sent by servants or soldiers making assignations with him which of course he did not keep  if we went out into the streets matters were as bad for then the people ceased from their business such as it was and followed us about staring at us till we took refuge again in the palace gardens  there remained therefore only our rides in the country with the khania but after three or four of them these came to an end owing to the jealousy of the khan who vowed that if we went out together any more he would follow with the deathhounds so we must ride alone if at all in the centre of a large guard of soldiers sent to see that we did not attempt to escape and accompanied very often by a mob of peasants who with threats and entreaties demanded that we should give back the rain which they said we had taken from them for now the great drought had begun in earnest  thus it came about that at length our only resource was making pretence to fish in the river where the water was so clear and low that we could catch nothing watching the while the firemountain that loomed in the distance mysterious and unreachable and vainly racking our brains for plans to escape thither or at least to communicate with its priestess of whom we could learn no more  for two great burdens lay upon our souls the burden of desire to continue our search and to meet with its reward which we were sure that we should pluck amid the snows of yonder peak if we could but come there and the burden of approaching catastrophe at the hands of the khania atene she had made no love to leo since that night in the gateway and indeed even if she had wished to this would have been difficult since i took care that he was never left for one hour alone no duenna could have clung to a spanish princess more closely than i did to leo yet i could see well that her passion was no whit abated that it grew day by day indeed as the fire swells in the heart of a volcano and that soon it must break loose and spread its ruin round the omen of it was to be read in her words her gestures and her tragic eyes    chapter x  in the shamans chamber  one night simbri asked us to dine with him in his own apartments in the highest tower of the palacehad we but known it for us a fateful place indeed for here the last act of the mighty drama was destined to be fulfilled so we went glad enough of any change when we had eaten leo grew very thoughtful then said suddenlyfriend simbri i wish to ask a favour of youthat you will beg the khania to let us go our ways  instantly the shamans cunning old face became like a mask of ivory  surely you had better ask your favours of the lady herself lord i do not think that any in reason will be refused to you he replied  let us stop fencing said leo and consider the facts it has seemed to me that the khania atene is not happy with her husband  your eyes are very keen lord and who shall say that they have deceived you  it has seemed further went on leo reddening that she has been so good as to look on me withsome undeserved regard  ah perhaps you guessed that in the gatehouse yonder if you have not forgotten what most men would remember  i remember certain things simbri that have to do with her and you  the shaman only stroked his beard and said proceed  there is little to add simbri except that i am not minded to bring scandal on the name of the first lady in your land  nobly said lord nobly said though here they do not trouble much about such things but how if the matter could be managed without scandal if for instance the khania chose to take another husband the whole land would rejoice for she is the last of her royal race  how can she take another husband when she has one living  true indeed that is a question which i have considered but the answer to it is that men die it is the common lot and the khan has been drinking very heavily of late  you mean that men can be murdered said leo angrily well i will have nothing to do with such a crime do you understand me  as the words passed his lips i heard a rustle and turned my head behind us were curtains beyond which the shaman slept kept his instruments of divination and worked out his horoscopes now they had been drawn and between them in her royal array stood the khania still as a statue  who was it that spoke of crime she asked in a cold voice was it you my lord leo  rising from his chair he faced her and saidlady i am glad that you have heard my words even if they should vex you  why should it vex me to learn that there is one honest man in this court who will have naught to do with murder nay i honour you for those words know also that no such foul thoughts have come near to me yet leo vincey that which is writtenis written  doubtless khania but what is written  tell him shaman  now simbri passed behind the curtain and returned thence with a roll from which he read the heavens have declared by their signs infallible that before the next new moon the khan rassen will lie dead at the hands of the stranger lord who came to this country from across the mountains  then the heavens have declared a lie said leo contemptuously  that is as you will answered atene but so it must befall not by my hand or those of my servants but by yours and then  why by mine why not by hollys yet if so then doubtless i shall suffer the punishment of my crime at the hands of his mourning widow he replied exasperated  you are pleased to mock me leo vincey well knowing what a husband this man is to me  now i felt that the crisis had come and so did leo for he looked her in the face and saidspeak on lady say all you wish perhaps it will be better for us both  i obey you lord of the beginning of this fate i know nothing but i read from the first page that is open to me it has to do with this present life of mine learn leo vincey that from my childhood onwards you have haunted me oh when first i saw you yonder by the river your face was not strange to me for i knew iti knew it well in dreams when i was a little maid and slept one day amidst the flowers by the rivers brim it came first to meask my uncle here if this be not so though it is true that your face was younger then afterwards again and again i saw it in my sleep and learned to know that you were mine for the magic of my heart taught me this  then passed the long years while i felt that you were drawing near to me slowly very slowly but ever drawing nearer wending onward and outward through the peoples of the world across the hills across the plains across the sands across the snows on to my side at length came the end for one night not three moons ago whilst this wise man my uncle and i sat together here studying the lore that he has taught me and striving to wring its secrets from the past a vision came to me  look you i was lost in a charmed sleep which looses the spirit from the body and gives it strength to stray afar and to see those things that have been and that are yet to be then i saw you and your companion clinging to a point of broken ice over the river of the gulf i do not lie it is written here upon the scroll yes it was you the man of my dreams and no other and we knew the place and hurried thither and waited by the water thinking that perhaps beneath it you lay dead  then while we waited lo two tiny figures appeared far above upon the icy tongue that no man may climb and oh you know the rest spellbound we stood and saw you slip and hang saw you sever the thin cord and rush downwards yes and saw that brave man holly leap headlong after you  but mine was the hand that drew you from the torrent where otherwise you must have drowned you the love of the long past and of today aye and of all time yes you and no other leo vincey it was this spirit that foresaw your danger and this hand which delivered you from death andand would you refuse them nowwhen i the khania of kaloon proffer them to you  so she spoke and leaned upon the table looking up into his face with lips that trembled and with appealing eyes  lady said leo you saved me and again i thank you though perhaps it would have been better if you had let me drown but forgive me the question if all this tale be true why did you marry another man  now she shrank back as though a knife had pricked her  oh blame me not she moaned it was but policy which bound me to this madman whom i ever loathed they urged me to it yes even you simbri my uncle and for that deed accursed be your headurged me saying that it was necessary to end the war between rassens faction and my own that i was the last of the true race moreover which must be carried on saying also that my dreams and my rememberings were but sick phantasies so alas alas i yielded thinking to make my people great  and yourself the greatest of them if all i hear is true commented leo bluntly for he was determined to end this thing well i do not blame you khania although now you tell me that i must cut a knot you tied by taking the life of this husband of your own choice for so forsooth it is decreed by fate that fate which you have shaped yes i must do what you will not do and kill him also your tale of the decree of the heavens and of that vision which led you to the precipice to save us is false lady you met me by the river because the mighty hesea the spirit of the mountain so commanded you  how know you that atene said springing up and facing him while the jaw of old simbri dropped and the eyelids blinked over his glazed eyes  in the same way that i know much else lady it would have been better if you had spoken all the truth  now atenes face went ashen and her cheeks sank in  who told you she whispered was it you magician and she turned upon her uncle like a snake about to strike oh if so be sure that i shall learn it and though we are of one blood and have loved each other i will pay you back in agony  atene atene simbri broke in holding up his clawlike hands you know well it was not i  then it was you you apefaced wanderer you messenger of the evil gods oh why did i not kill you at the first well that fault can be remedied  lady i said blandly am i also a magician  aye she answered i think that you are and that you have a mistress who dwells in fire  then khania i said such servants and such mistresses are ill to meddle with say what answer has the hesea sent to your report of our coming to this land  listen broke in leo before she could reply i go to ask a certain question of the oracle on yonder mountain peak with your will or without it i tell you that i go and afterwards you can settle which is the strongerthe khania of kaloon or the hesea of the house of fire  atene listened and for a while stood silent perhaps because she had no answer then she said with a little laughis that your will well i think that yonder are none whom you would wish to wed there is fire and to spare but no lovely shameless spirit haunts it to drive men mad with evil longings and as though at some secret thought a spasm of pain crossed her face and caught her breath then she went on in the same cold voicewanderers this land has its secrets into which no foreigner must pry i say to you yet again that while i live you set no foot upon that mountain know also leo vincey i have bared my heart to you and i have been told in answer that this long quest of yours is not for me as i was sure in my folly but as i think for some demon wearing the shape of woman whom you will never find now i make no prayer to you it is not fitting but you have learned too much  therefore consider well tonight and before next sundown answer having offered i do not go back and tomorrow you shall tell me whether you will take me when the time comes as come it must and rule this land and be great and happy in my love or whether you and your familiar together you willdie choose then between the vengeance of atene and her love since i am not minded to be mocked in my own land as a wanton who sought a stranger and wasrefused  slowly slowly in an intense whisper she spoke the words that fell one by one from her lips like drops of blood from a death wound and there followed silence never shall i forget the scene there the old wizard watched us through his horny eyes that blinked like those of some night bird there stood the imperial woman in her royal robes with icy rage written on her face and vengeance in her glance there facing her was the great form of leo quiet alert determined holding back his doubts and fears with the iron hand of will and there to the right was i noting all things and wondering how long i the familiar who had earned atenes hate would be left alive upon the earth  thus we stood watching each other till suddenly i noted that the flame of the lamp above us flickered and felt a draught strike upon my face then i looked round and became aware of another presence for yonder in the shadow showed the tall form of a man see it shambled forward silently and i saw that its feet were naked now it reached the ring of the lamplight and burst into a savage laugh  it was the khan  atene his wife looked up and saw him and never did i admire that passionate womans boldness more who admired little else about her save her beauty for her face showed neither anger nor fear but contempt only and yet she had some cause to be afraid as she well knew  what do you here rassen she asked creeping on me with your naked feet get you back to your drink and the ladies of your court  but he still laughed on an hyena laugh  what have you heard she said that makes you so merry  what have i heard rassen gurgled out between his screams of hideous glee oho i have heard the khania the last of the true blood the first in the land the proud princess who will not let her robes be soiled by those of the ladies of the court and my wife my wife who asked me to marry hermark that you strangersbecause i was her cousin and a rival ruler and the richest lord in all the land and thereby she thought she would increase her poweri have heard her offer herself to a nameless wanderer with a great yellow beard and i have heard him who hates and would escape from herhere he screamed with laughterrefuse her in such a fashion as i would not refuse the lowest woman in the palace  i have heard alsobut that i always knewthat i am mad for strangers i was made mad by a hatephiltre which that old rat and he pointed to simbri gave me in my drinkyes at my marriage feast it worked well for truly there is no one whom i hate more than the khania atene why i cannot bear her touch it makes me sick i loathe to be in the same room with her she taints the air there is a smell of sorceries about her  it seems that it takes you thus also yellowbeard well if so ask the old rat for a love drink he can mix it and then you will think her sweet and sound and fair and spend some few months jollily enough man dont be a fool the cup that is thrust into your hands looks goodly drink drink deep youll never guess the liquors badtill tomorrowthough it be mixed with a husbands poisoned blood and again rassen screamed in his unholy mirth  to all these bitter insults venomed with the sting of truth atene listened without a word then she turned to us and bowed  my guests she said i pray you pardon me for all i cannot help you have strayed to a corrupt and evil land and there stands its crown and flower khan rassen your doom is written and i do not hasten it because once for a little while we were near to each other though you have been naught to me for this many a year save a snake that haunts my house were it otherwise the next cup you drank should still your madness and that vile tongue of yours which gives its venom voice my uncle come with me your hand for i grow weak with shame and woe  the old shaman hobbled forward but when he came face to face with the khan he stopped and looked him up and down with his dim eyes then he saidrassen i saw you born the son of an evil woman and your father none knew but i the flame flared that night upon the firemountain and the stars hid their faces for none of them would own you no not even those of the most evil influence i saw you wed and rise drunken from your marriage feast your arm about a wantons neck i have seen you rule wasting the land for your cruel pleasure turning the fertile fields into great parks for your game leaving those who tilled them to starve upon the road or drown themselves in ditches for very misery and soon soon i shall see you die in pain and blood and then the chain will fall from the neck of this noble lady whom you revile and another more worthy shall take your place and rear up children to fill your throne and the land shall have rest again  now i listened to these wordsand none who did not hear them can guess the fearful bitterness with which they were spokenexpecting every moment that the khan would draw the short sword at his side and cut the old man down but he did not he cowered before him like a dog before some savage master the weight of whose whip he knows yes answering nothing he shrank into the corner and cowered there while simbri taking atene by the hand went from the room at its massive ironbound door he turned and pointing to the crouching figure with his staff saidkhan rassen i raised you up and now i cast you down remember me when you lie dyingin blood and pain  their footsteps died away and the khan crept from his corner looking about him furtively  have that rat and the other gone he asked of us wiping his damp brow with his sleeve and i saw that fear had sobered him and that for awhile the madness had left his eyes  i answered that they had gone  you think me a coward he went on passionately and it is true i am afraid of him and heras you yellowbeard will be afraid when your turn comes i tell you that they sapped my strength and crazed me with their drugged drink making me the thing i am for who can war against their wizardries look you now once i was a prince the lord of half this land noble of form and upright of heart and i loved her accursed beauty as all must love it on whom she turns her eyes and she turned them on me she sought me in marriage it was that old rat who bore her message  so i stayed the great war and married the khania and became the khan but better had it been for me if i had crept into her kitchen as a scullion than into her chamber as a husband for from the first she hated me and the more i loved the more she hated till at our wedding feast she doctored me with that poison which made me loathe her and thus divorced us which made me mad also eating into my brain like fire  if she hated you so sorely khan i asked why did she not mix a stronger draught and have done with you  why because of policy for i ruled half the land because it suited her also that i should live on a thing to mock at since while i was alive no other husband could be forced upon her by the people for she is not a woman she is a witch who desires to live alone or so i thought until tonightand he glowered at leo  she knew also that although i must shrink from her i still love her in my heart and can still be jealous and therefore that i should protect her from all men it was she who set me on that lord whom my dogs tore awhile ago because he was powerful and sought her favour and would not be denied but now and again he glowered at leo now i know why she has always seemed so cold it is because there lived a man to melt whose ice she husbanded her fire  then leo who all this while had stood silent stepped forward  listen khan he said did the ice seem like melting a little while ago  nounless you lied but that was only because the fire is not yet hot enough wait awhile until it burns up and melt you must for who can match his will against atene  and what if the ice desires to flee the fire khan they said that i should kill you but i do not seek your blood you think that i would rob you of your wife yet i have no such thought towards her we desire to escape this town of yours but cannot because its gates are locked and we are prisoners guarded night and day hear me then you have the power to set us free and to be rid of us  the khan looked at him cunningly and if i set you free whither would you go you could tumble down yonder gorge but only the birds can climb its heights  to the firemountain where we have business  rassen stared at him  is it i who am mad or are you who wish to visit the firemountain yet that is nothing to me save that i do not believe you but if so you might return again and bring others with you perchance having its lady you wish this land also by right of conquest it has foes up yonder  it is not so answered leo earnestly as one man to another i tell you it is not so i ask no smile of your wife and no acre of your soil be wise and help us to be gone and live on undisturbed in such fashion as may please you  the khan stood still awhile swinging his long arms vacantly till something seemed to come into his mind that moved him to merriment for he burst into one of his hideous laughs  i am thinking he said what atene would say if she woke up to find her sweet bird flown she would search for you and be angry with me  it seems that she cannot be angrier than she is i answered give us a nights start and let her search never so closely she shall not find us  you forget wanderer that she and her old rat have arts those who knew where to meet you might know where to seek you and yet and yet it would be rare to see her rage oh yellowbeard where are you yellowbeard he went on mimicking his wifes voice come back and let me melt your ice yellowbeard  again he laughed then said suddenlywhen can you be ready  in half an hour i answered  good go to your chambers and prepare i will join you there presently  so we went    chapter xi  the hunt and the kill  we reached our rooms meeting no one in the passages and there made our preparations first we changed our festal robes for those warmer garments in which we had travelled to the city of kaloon then we ate and drank what we could of the victuals which stood in the antechamber not knowing when we should find more food and filled two satchels such as these people sling about their shoulders with the remains of the meat and liquor and a few necessaries also we strapped our big hunting knives about our middles and armed ourselves with short spears that were made for the stabbing of game  perhaps he has laid a plot to murder us and we may as well defend ourselves while we can suggested leo  i nodded for the echoes of the khans last laugh still rang in my ears it was a very evil laugh  likely enough i said i do not trust that insane brute still he wishes to be rid of us  yes but as he said live men may return whereas the dead do not  atene thinks otherwise i commented  and yet she threatened us with death answered leo  because her shame and passion make her mad i replied after which we were silent  presently the door opened and through it came the khan muffled in a great cloak as though to disguise himself  come he said if you are ready then catching sight of the spears we held he added you will not need those things you do not go ahunting  no i answered but who can saywe might be hunted  if you believe that perhaps you had best stay where you are till the khania wearies of yellowbeard and opens the gates for you he replied eyeing me with his cunning glance  i think not i said and we started the khan leading the way and motioning us to be silent  we passed through the empty rooms on to the verandah and from the verandah down into the courtyard where he whispered to us to keep in the shadow for the moon shone very clearly that night so clearly i remember that i could see the grass which grew between the joints of the pavement and the little shadows thrown by each separate blade upon the worn surface of its stones now i wondered how we should pass the gate for there a guard was stationed which had of late been doubled by order of the khania but this gate we left upon our right taking a path that led into the great walled garden where rassen brought us to a door hidden behind a clump of shrubs which he unlocked with a key he carried  now we were outside the palace wall and our road ran past the kennels as we went by these the great sleepless deathhounds that wandered to and fro like prowling lions caught our wind and burst into a sudden chorus of terrific bays i shivered at the sound for it was fearful in that silence also i thought that it would arouse the keepers but the khan went to the bars and showed himself whereon the brutes which knew him ceased their noise  fear not he said as he returned the huntsmen know that they are starved tonight for tomorrow certain criminals will be thrown to them  now we had reached the palace gates here the khan bade us hide in an archway and departed we looked at each other for the same thought was in both our mindsthat he had gone to fetch the murderers who were to make an end of us but in this we did him wrong for presently we heard the sound of horses hoofs upon the stones and he returned leading the two white steeds that atene had given us  i saddled them with my own hands he whispered who can do more to speed the parting guest now mount hide your faces in your cloaks as i do and follow me  so we mounted and he trotted before us like a running footman such as the great lords of kaloon employed when they went about their business or their pleasure leaving the main street he led us through a quarter of the town that had an evil reputation and down its tortuous byways here we met a few revellers while from time to time nightbirds flitted from the doorways and throwing aside their veils looked at us but as we made no sign drew back again thinking that we passed to some assignation we reached the deserted docks upon the rivers edge and came to a little quay alongside of which a broad ferryboat was fastened  you must put your horses into it and row across rassen said for the bridges are guarded and without discovering myself i cannot bid the soldiers to let you pass  so with some little trouble we urged the horses into the boat where i held them by their bridles while leo took the oars  now go your ways accursed wanderers cried the khan as he thrust us from the quay and pray the spirit of the mountain that the old rat and his pupilyour love yellowbeard your loveare not watching you in their magic glass for if so we may meet again  then as the stream caught us sweeping the boat out towards the centre of the river he began to laugh that horrible laugh of his calling after usride fast ride fast for safety strangers there is death behind  leo put out his strength and backed water so that the punt hung upon the edge of the stream  i think that we should do well to land again and kill that man for he means mischief he said  he spoke in english but rassen must have caught the ring of his voice and guessed its meaning with the cunning of the mad at least he shoutedtoo late fools and with a last laugh turned ran so swiftly up the quay that his cloak flew out upon the air behind him and vanished into the shadows at its head  row on i said and leo bent himself to the oars  but the ferryboat was cumbersome and the current swift so that we were swept down a long way before we could cross it at length we reached still water near the further shore and seeing a landingplace managed to beach the punt and to drag our horses to the bank then leaving the craft to drift for we had no time to scuttle her we looked to our girths and bridles and mounted heading towards the far column of glowing smoke which showed like a beacon above the summit of the house of fire  at first our progress was very slow for here there seemed to be no path and we were obliged to pick our way across the fields and to search for bridges that spanned such of the waterditches as were too wide for us to jump more than an hour was spent in this work till we came to a village wherein none were stirring and here struck a road which seemed to run towards the mountain though as we learned afterwards it took us very many miles out of our true path now for the first time we were able to canter and pushed on at some speed though not too fast for we wished to spare our horses and feared lest they might fall in the uncertain light  a while before dawn the moon sank behind the mountain and the gloom grew so dense that we were forced to stop which we did holding the horses by their bridles and allowing them to graze a little on some young corn then the sky turned grey the light faded from the column of smoke that was our guide the dawn came blushing red upon the vast snows of the distant peak and shooting its arrows through the loop above the pillar we let the horses drink from a channel that watered the corn and mounting them rode onward slowly  now with the shadows of the night a weight of fear seemed to be lifted off our hearts and we grew hopeful aye almost joyous that hated city was behind us behind us were the khania with her surging doomdriven passions and her stormy loveliness the wizardries of her hornyeyed mentor so old in years and secret sin and the madness of that strange being halfdevil halfmartyr at once cruel and a cowardthe khan her husband and his polluted court in front lay the fire the snow and the mystery they hid sought for so many empty years now we would solve it or we would die so we pressed forward joyfully to meet our fate whatever it might be  for many hours our road ran deviously through cultivated land where the peasants at their labour laid down their tools and gathered into knots to watch us pass and quaint flatroofed villages whence the women snatched up their children and fled at the sight of us they believed us to be lords from the court who came to work them some harm in person or in property and their terror told us how the country smarted beneath the rod of the oppressor by midday although the peak seemed to be but little nearer the character of the land had changed now it sloped gently upwards and therefore could not be irrigated  evidently all this great district was dependent on the fall of timely rains which had not come that spring therefore although the population was still dense and every rod of the land was under the plough or spade the crops were failing it was pitiful to see the green uneared corn already turning yellow because of the lack of moisture the beasts searching the starved pastures for food and the poor husbandmen wandering about their fields or striving to hoe the iron soil  here the people seemed to know us as the two foreigners whose coming had been noised abroad and the fear of famine having made them bold they shouted at us as we went by to give them back the rain which we had stolen or so we understood their words even the women and the children in the villages prostrated themselves before us pointing first to the mountain and then to the hard blue sky and crying to us to send them rain once indeed we were threatened by a mob of peasants armed with spades and reapinghooks who seemed inclined to bar our path so that we were obliged to put our horses to a gallop and pass through them with a rush as we went forward the country grew ever more arid and its inhabitants more scarce till we saw no man save a few wandering herds who drove their cattle from place to place in search of provender  by evening we guessed that we had reached that border tract which was harried by the mountain tribes for here strong towers built of stone were dotted about the heaths doubtless to serve as watchhouses or places of refuge whether they were garrisoned by soldiers i do not know but i doubt it for we saw none it seems probable indeed that these forts were relics of days when the land of kaloon was guarded from attack by rulers of a very different character to that of the present khan and his immediate predecessors  at length even the watchtowers were left behind and by sundown we found ourselves upon a vast uninhabited plain where we could see no living thing now we made up our minds to rest our horses awhile proposing to push forward again with the moon for having the wrath of the khania behind us we did not dare to linger by this evening doubtless she would have discovered our escape since before sundown as she had decreed leo must make his choice and give his answer then as we were sure she would strike swiftly perhaps her messengers were already at their work rousing the country to capture us and her soldiers following on our path  we unsaddled the horses and let them refresh themselves by rolling on the sandy soil and graze after a fashion upon the coarse tufts of withering herbage which grew around there was no water here but this did not so much matter for both they and we had drunk at a little muddy pool we found not more than an hour before we were finishing our meal of the food that we had brought with us which indeed we needed sorely after our sleepless night and long days journey when my horse which was kneehaltered close at hand lay down to roll again this it could not do with ease because of the rope about its foreleg and i watched its efforts idly till at length at the fourth attempt after hanging for a few seconds upon its back its legs sticking straight into the air it fell over slowly towards me as horses do  why are its hoofs so red has it cut itself asked leo in an indifferent voice  as it chanced i also had just noticed this red tinge and for the first time since it was most distinct about the animals frogs which until it rolled thus i had not seen so i rose to look at them thinking that probably the evening light had deceived us or that we might have passed through some ruddycoloured mud sure enough they were red as though a dye had soaked into the horn and the substance of the frogs what was more they gave out a pungent aromatic smell that was unpleasant such a smell as might arise from blood mixed with musk and spices  it is very strange i said let us look at your beast leo  so we did and found that its hoofs had been similarlytreated  perhaps it is a native mixture to preserve the horn suggested leo  i thought awhile then a terrible idea struck me  i dont want to frighten you i said but i think that we had better saddle up and get on  why he asked  because i believe that villain of a khan has doctored our horses  what for to make them go lame  no leo to make them leave a strong scent upon dry ground  he turned pale do you meanthose hounds  i nodded then wasting no more time in words we saddled up in frantic haste just as i fastened the last strap of my saddle i thought that a faint sound reached my ear  listen i said again it came and now there was no doubt about it it was the sound of baying dogs  by heaven the deathhounds said leo  yes i answered quietly enough for at this crisis my nerves hardened and all fear left me our friend the khan is out ahunting that is why he laughed  what shall we do asked leo leave the horses  i looked at the peak its nearest flanks were miles and miles away  time enough to do that when we are forced we can never reach that mountain on foot and after they had run down the horses they would hunt us by spoor or gaze no man ride as you never rode before  we sprang to our saddles but before we gave rein i turned and looked behind me it will be remembered that we had ridden up a long slope which terminated in a ridge about three miles away the border of the great plain whereon we stood now the sun had sunk behind that ridge so that although it was still light the plain had fallen into shadow therefore while no distant object could be seen upon the plain anything crossing the ridge remained visible enough in that clear air at least to persons of keen sight  this is what we saw over the ridge poured a multitude of little objects and amongst the last of these galloped a man mounted on a great horse who led another horse by the bridle  all the pack are out said leo grimly and rassen has brought a second mount with him now i see why he wanted us to leave the spears and i think he shouted as we began to gallop that before all is done the shaman may prove himself a true prophet  away we sped through the gathering darkness heading straight for the peak while we went i calculated our chances our horses as good as any in the land were still strong and fresh for although we had ridden far we had not overpressed them and their condition was excellent but doubtless the deathhounds were fresh also for meaning to run us down at night when he thought that he might catch us sleeping rassen would have brought them along easily following us by inquiry among the peasants and only laying them on our spoor after the last village had been left behind  also he had two mounts and for aught we knewthough afterwards this proved not to be the case for he wished to work his wickedness alone and unseenhe might be followed by attendants with relays therefore it would appear that unless we reached some place whither he did not dare to follow before himthat is the slopes of the peak many miles away he must run us down there remained the chance also that the dogs would tire and refuse to pursue the chase  this however seemed scarcely probable for they were extraordinarily swift and strong and so savage that when once they had scented blood in which doubtless our horses hoofs were steeped they would fall dead from exhaustion sooner than abandon the trail indeed both the khania and simbri had often told us as much another chancethey might lose the scent but seeing its nature again this was not probable even an english pack will carry the trail of a red herring breast high without a fault for hours and here was something strongera cunning compound of which the telltale odour would hold for days a last chance if we were forced to abandon our horses we their riders might possibly escape could we find any place to hide in on that great plain if not we should be seen as well as scented and thenno the odds were all against us but so they had often been before meanwhile we had three miles start and perhaps help would come to us from the mountain some help unforeseen so we set our teeth and sped away like arrows while the light lasted  very soon it failed and whilst the moon was hidden behind the mountains the night grew dark  now the hounds gained on us for in the gloom which to them was nothing we did not dare to ride full speed fearing lest our horses should stumble and lame themselves or fall then it was for the second time since we had dwelt in this land of kaloon that of a sudden the fire flamed upon the peak when we had seen it before it had appeared to flash across the heavens in one great lighthouse ray concentrated through the loop above the pillar and there this night also the ray ran far above us like a lance of fire but now that we were nearer to its fount we found ourselves bathed in a soft mysterious radiance like that of the phosphorescence on a summer sea reflected downwards perhaps from the clouds and massy rock roof of the column loop and diffused by the snows beneath  this unearthly glimmer faint as it was helped us much indeed but for it we must have been overtaken for here the ground was very rough full of holes also made by burrowing marmots thus in our extremity help did come to us from the mountain until at length the moon rose when as quickly as they had appeared the volcanic fires vanished leaving behind them nothing but the accustomed pillar of dull red smoke  it is a commonplace to speak of the music of hounds at chase but often i have wondered how that music sounds in the ears of the deer or the fox fleeing for its life  now when we filled the place of the quarry it was my destiny to solve this problem and i assert with confidence that the progeny of earth can produce no more hideous noise it had come near to us and in the desolate silence of the night the hellish harmonies of its volume seemed terrific yet i could discern the separate notes of which it was composed especially one deep belllike bay  i remembered that i had heard this bay when we sat in the boat upon the river and saw that poor noble done to death for the crime of loving the khania as the hunt passed us then i observed that it burst from the throat of the leading hound a huge brute red in colour with a coalblack ear fangs that gleamed like ivory and a mouth which resembled a hot oven i even knew the name of the beast for afterwards the khan whose peculiar joy it was had pointed it out to me he called it master because no dog in the pack dared fight it and told me that it could kill an armed man alone  now as its baying warned us master was not half a mile away  the coming of the moonlight enabled us to gallop faster especially as here the ground was smooth being covered with a short dry turf and for the next two hours we gained upon the pack yes it was only two hours or perhaps less but it seemed a score of centuries the slopes of the peak were now not more than ten miles ahead but our horses were giving out at last they had borne us nobly poor beasts though we were no light weights yet their strength had its limits the sweat ran from them their sides panted like bellows they breathed in gasps they stumbled and would scarcely answer to the flogging of our spearshafts their gallop sank to a jolting canter and i thought that soon they must come to a dead stop  we crossed the brow of a gentle rise from which the ground that was sprinkled with bush and rocks sloped downwards to where some miles below us the river ran bounding the enormous flanks of the mountain when we had travelled a little way down this slope we were obliged to turn in order to pass between two heaps of rock which brought us side on to its brow and there crossing it not more than three hundred yards away we saw the pack there were fewer of them now doubtless many had fallen out of the hunt but many still remained moreover not far behind them rode the khan though his second mount was gone or more probably he was riding it having galloped the first to a standstill  our poor horses saw them also and the sight lent them wings for all the while they knew that they were running for their lives this we could tell from the way they quivered whenever the baying came near to them not as horses tremble with the pleasureable excitement of the hunt but in an extremity of terror as i have often seen them do when a prowling tiger roars close to their camp on they went as though they were fresh from the stable nor did they fail again until another four miles or so were covered and the river was but a little way ahead for we could hear the rush of its waters  then slowly but surely the pack overtook us we passed a clump of bush but when we had gone a couple of hundred yards or so across the open plain beyond feeling that the horses were utterly spent i shouted to leoride round back to the bush and hide there so we did and scarcely had we reached it and dismounted when the hounds came past yes they went within fifty yards of us lolloping along upon our spoor and running all but mute for now they were too weary to waste their breath in vain run for it i said to leo as soon as they had gone by for they will be back on the scent presently and we set off to the right across the line that the hounds had taken so as not to cut our own spoor  about a hundred yards away was a rock which fortunately we were able to reach before the pack swung round upon the horses tracks and therefore they did not view us here we stayed until following the loop they came to the patch of bush and passed behind it then we ran forward again as far as we could go glancing backwards as we went i saw our two poor foundered beasts plunging away across the plain happily almost in the same line along which we had ridden from the rise they were utterly done but freed from our weights and urged on by fear could still gallop and keep ahead of the dogs though we knew that this would not be for very long i saw also that the khan guessing what we had done in our despair was trying to call his hounds off the horses but as yet without avail for they would not leave the quarry which they had viewed  all this came to my sight in a flash but i remember the picture well the mighty snowclad peak surmounted by its column of glowing smoke and casting its shadow for mile upon mile across the desert flats the plain with its isolated rocks and grey bushes the doomed horses struggling across it with convulsive bounds the trailing line of great dogs that loped after them and amongst these looking small and lonely in that vast place the figure of the khan and his horse of which the black hide was beflecked with foam then above the blue and tender sky where the round moon shone so clearly that in her quiet level light no detail even the smallest could escape the eye  now youth and even middle age were far behind me and although a very strong man for my years i could not run as i used to do also i was most weary and my limbs were stiff and chafed with long riding so i made but slow progress and to worsen matters i struck my left foot against a stone and hurt it much i implored leo to go on and leave me for we thought that if we could once reach the river our scent would be lost in the water at any rate that it would give us a chance of life just then too i heard the belling bay of the hound master and waited for the next yes it was nearer to us the khan had made a cast and found our line presently we must face the end  go go i said i can keep them back for a few minutes and you may escape it is your quest not mine ayesha awaits you not me and i am weary of life i wish to die and have done with it  thus i gasped not all at once but in broken words as i hobbled along clinging to leos arm but he only answered in a low voicebe quiet or they will hear you and on he went dragging me with him  we were quite near the water now for we could see it gleaming below us and oh how i longed for one deep drink i remember that this was the uppermost desire in my mind to drink and drink but the hounds were nearer still to us so near that we could hear the pattering of their feet on the dry ground mingled with the thud of the hoofs of the khans galloping horse we had reached some rocks upon a little rise just where the bank began when leo said suddenlyno use we cant make it stop and lets see the thing through  so we wheeled round resting our backs against the rock there about a hundred yards off were the deathhounds but heaven be praised only three of them the rest had followed the flying horses and doubtless when they caught them at last which may have been far distant had stopped to gorge themselves upon them so they were out of the fight only three and the khan a wild figure who galloped with them but those three the black and red brute master and two others almost as fierce and big  it might be worse said leo if you will try to tackle the dogs ill do my best with the khan and stooping down he rubbed his palms in the grit for they were wet as water an example which i followed then we gripped the spears in our right hands and the knives in our left and waited  the dogs had seen us now and came on growling and baying fearfully with a rush they came and i am not ashamed to own that i felt terribly afraid for the brutes seemed the size of lions and more fierce one it was the smallest of them outstripped the others and leaping up the little rise sprang straight at my throat  why or how i do not know but on the impulse of the moment i too sprang to meet it so that its whole weight came upon the point of my spear which was backed by my weight the spear entered between its forelegs and such was the shock that i was knocked backwards but when i regained my feet i saw the dog rolling on the ground before me and gnashing at the spear shaft which had been twisted from my hand  the other two had jumped at leo but failed to get hold though one of them tore away a large fragment from his tunic foolishly enough he hurled his spear at it but missed for the steel passed just under its belly and buried itself deep in the ground the pair of them did not come on again at once perhaps the sight of their dying companion made them pause at any rate they stood at a little distance snarling where as our spears were gone they were safe from us  now the khan had ridden up and sat upon his horse glowering at us and his face was like the face of a devil i had hoped that he might fear to attack but the moment i saw his eyes i knew that this would not be he was quite mad with hate jealousy and the longdrawn excitement of the hunt and had come to kill or be killed sliding from the saddle he drew his short swordfor either he had lost his spear or had brought noneand made a hissing noise to the two dogs pointing at me with the sword i saw them spring and i saw him rush at leo and after that who can tell exactly what happened  my knife went home to the hilt in the body of one dogand it came to the ground and lay therefor its hindquarters were paralysed howling snarling and biting at me but the other the fiend called master got me by the right arm beneath the elbow and i felt my bones crack in its mighty jaws and the agony of it or so i suppose caused me to drop the knife so that i was weaponless the brute dragged me from the rock and began to shake and worry me although i kicked it in the stomach with all my strength i fell to my knees and as it chanced my left hand came upon a stone of about the size of a large orange which i gripped i gained my feet again and pounded at its skull with the stone but still it did not leave go and this was well for me for its next hold would have been on my throat  we twisted and tumbled to and fro man and dog together at one turn i thought that i saw leo and the khan rolling over and over each other upon the ground at another that he the khan was sitting against a stone looking at me and it came into my mind that he must have killed leo and was watching while the dog worried me to death  then just as things began to grow black something sprang forward and i saw the huge hound lifted from the earth its jaws opened my arm came free and fell against my side yes the brute was whirling round in the air leo held it by its hind legs and with all his great strength whirled it round and round  thud  he had dashed its head against the rock and it fell and lay still a huddled heap of black and red oddly enough i did not faint i suppose that the pain and the shock to my nerves kept me awake for i heard leo say in a matteroffact voice between his gasps for breathwell thats over and i think that i have fulfilled the shamans prophecy lets look and make sure  then he led me with him to one of the rocks and there resting supinely against it sat the khan still living but unable to move hand or foot the madness had quite left his face and he looked at us with melancholy eyes like the eyes of a sick child  you are brave men he said slowly strong also to have killed those hounds and broken my back so it has come about as was foretold by the old rat after all i should have hunted atene not you though now she lives to avenge me for her own sake not mine yellowbeard she hunts you too and with deadlier hounds than these those of her thwarted passions forgive me and fly to the mountain yellowbeard whither i go before you for there one dwells who is stronger than atene  then his jaw dropped and he was dead    chapter xii  the messenger  he is gone i panted and the world hasnt lost much  well it didnt give him much did it poor devil so dont lets speak ill of him answered leo who had thrown himself exhausted to the ground perhaps he was all right before they made him mad at any rate he had pluck for i dont want to tackle such another  how did you manage it i asked  dodged in beneath his sword closed with him threw him and smashed him up over that lump of stone sheer strength thats all a cruel business but it was his life or mine and there you are its lucky i finished it in time to help you before that ovenmouthed brute tore your throat out did you ever see such a dog it looks as large as a young donkey are you much hurt horace  oh my forearm is chewed to a pulp but nothing else i think let us get down to the water if i cant drink soon i shall faint also the rest of the pack is somewhere about fifty or more of them  i dont think they will trouble us they have got the horses poor beasts wait a minute and i will come  then he rose found the khans sword a beautiful and ancient weapon and with a single cut of its keen edge killed the second dog that i had wounded which was still yowling and snarling at us after this he collected the two spears and my knife saying that they might be useful and without trouble caught the khans horse which stood with hanging head close by so tired that even this desperate fight had not frightened it away  now he said up you go old fellow you are not fit to walk any farther and with his help i climbed into the saddle  then slipping the rein over his arm he led the horse which walked stiffly on to the river that ran within a quarter of a mile of us though to me tortured as i was by pain and half delirious with exhaustion the journey seemed long enough  still we came there somehow and forgetting my wounds i tumbled from the horse threw myself flat and drank and drank more i think than ever i did before not in all my life have i tasted anything so delicious as was that long draught of water when i had satisfied my thirst i dipped my head and made shift to jerk my wounded arm into it for its coolness seemed to still the pain presently leo rose the water running from his face and beard and saidwhat shall we do now the river seems to be wide over a hundred yards and it is low but there may be deep water in the middle shall we try to cross in which case we might drown or stop where we are till daylight and take our chance of the deathhounds  i cant go another foot i murmured faintly much less try to ford an unknown river  now about thirty yards from the shore was an island covered with reeds and grasses  perhaps we could reach that he said come get on to my back and we will try  i obeyed with difficulty and we set out he feeling his way with the handle of the spear the water proved to be quite shallow indeed it never came much above his knees so that we reached the island without trouble here leo laid me down on the soft rushes and returning to the mainland brought over the black horse and the remaining weapons and having unsaddled the beast kneehaltered and turned it loose whereon it immediately lay down for it was too spent to feed  then he set to work to doctor my wounds well it proved for me that the sleeve of my garment was so thick for even through it the flesh of my forearm was torn to ribbons moreover a bone seemed to be broken leo collected a double handful of some soft wet moss and having washed the arm wrapped it round with a handkerchief over which he laid the moss then with a second handkerchief and some strips of linen torn from our undergarments he fastened a couple of split reeds to serve as rough splints to the wounded limb while he was doing this i suppose that i slept or swooned at any rate i remember no more  sometime during that night leo had a strange dream of which he told me the next morning i suppose that it must have been a dream as certainly i saw or was aware of nothing well he dreamedi use his own words as nearly as possiblethat again he heard those accursed deathhounds in full cry nearer and nearer they came following our spoor to the edge of the riverall the pack that had run down the horses at the waters brink they halted and were mute then suddenly a puff of wind brought the scent of us upon the island to one of them which lifted up its head and uttered a single bay the rest clustered about it and all at once they made a dash at the water  leo could see and hear everything he felt that after all our doom was now at hand and yet held in the grip of nightmare if nightmare it were he was quite unable to stir or even to cry out to wake and warn me  now followed the marvel of this vision giving tongue as they came half swimming and half plunging the hounds drew near to the island where we slept then suddenly leo saw that we were no longer alone in front of us on the brink of the water stood the figure of a woman clad in some dark garment he could not describe her face or appearance for her back was towards him  all he knew was that she stood there like a guard holding some object in her raised hand and that suddenly the advancing hounds caught sight of her in an instant it was as though they were paralysed by fearfor their bays turned to fearful howlings one or two of those that were nearest to the island seemed to lose their footing and be swept away by the stream the rest struggled back to the bank and fled wildly like whipped curs  then the dark commanding figure which in his dream leo took to be the guardian spirit of the mountain vanished that it left no footprints behind it i can vouch for in the morning we looked to see  when awakened by the sharp pangs in my arm i opened my eyes again the dawn was breaking a thin mist hung over the river and the island and through it i could see leo sleeping heavily at my side and the shape of the black horse which had risen and was grazing close at hand i lay still for a while remembering all that we had undergone and wondering that i should live to wake till presently above the murmuring of the water i heard a sound which terrified me the sound of voices i sat up and peered through the reeds and there upon the bank looking enormous in the mist i saw two figures mounted upon horses those of a woman and a man  they were pointing to the ground as though they examined spoor in the sand i heard the man say something about the dogs not daring to enter the territory of the mountain a remark which came back to my mind again after leo had told me his dream then i remembered how we were placed  wake i whispered to leo wake we are pursued  he sprang to his feet rubbing his eyes and snatching at a spear now those upon the bank saw him and a sweet voice spoke through the mist sayinglay down that weapon my guest for we are not come to harm you  it was the voice of the khania atene and the man with her was the old shaman simbri  what shall we do now horace asked leo with something like a groan for in the whole world there were no two people whom he less wished to see  nothing i answered it is for them to play  come to us called the khania across the water i swear that we mean no harm are we not alone  i do not know answered leo but it seems unlikely where we are we stop until we are ready to march again  atene spoke to simbri what she said we could not hear for she whispered but she appeared to be arguing with him and persuading him to some course of which he strongly disapproved then suddenly both of them put their horses at the water and rode to us through the shallows reaching the island they dismounted and we stood staring at each other the old man seemed very weary in body and oppressed in mind but the khania was strong and beautiful as ever nor had passion and fatigue left any trace upon her inscrutable face it was she who broke the silence sayingyou have ridden fast and far since last we met my guests and left an evil token to mark the path you took yonder among the rocks one lies dead say how came he to his end who has no wound upon him  by these answered leo stretching out his hands  i knew it she answered and i blame you not for fate decreed that death for him and now it is fulfilled still there are those to whom you must answer for his blood and i only can protect you from them  or betray me to them said leo khania what do you seek  that answer which you should have given me this twelve hours gone remember before you speak that i alone can save your lifeaye and will do it and clothe you with that dead madmans crown and mantle  you shall have your answer on yonder mountain said leo pointing to the peak above us where i seek mine  she paled a little and replied to find that it is death for as i have told you the place is guarded by savage folk who know no pity  so be it then death is the answer that we seek come horace let us go to meet him  i swear to you she broke in that there dwells not the woman of your dreams i am that woman yes even i as you are the man of mine  then lady prove it yonder upon the mountain leo answered  there dwells there no woman atene went on hurriedly nothing dwells there it is the home of fire anda voice  what voice  the voice of the oracle that speaks from the fire the voice of a spirit whom no man has ever seen or shall see  come horace said leo and he moved towards the horse  men broke in the old shaman would you rush upon your doom listen i have visited yonder haunted place for it was i who according to custom brought thither the body of the khan atenes father for burial and i warn you to set no foot within its temples  which your mistress said that we should never reach i commented but leo only answeredwe thank you for your warning and added horace watch them while i saddle the horse lest they do us a mischief  so i took the spear in my uninjured hand and stood ready but they made no attempt to hurt us only fell back a little and began to talk in hurried whispers it was evident to me that they were much perturbed in a few minutes the horse was saddled and leo assisted me to mount it then he saidwe go to accomplish our fate whatever it may be but before we part khania i thank you for the kindness you have shown us and pray you to be wise and forget that we have ever been through no will of mine your husbands blood is on my hands and that alone must separate us for ever we are divided by the doors of death and destiny go back to your people and pardon me if most unwillingly i have brought you doubt and trouble farewell  she listened with bowed head then replied very sadlyi thank you for your gentle words but leo vincey we do not part thus easily you have summoned me to the mountain and even to the mountain i shall follow you aye and there i will meet its spirit as i have always known i must and as the shaman here has always known i must yes i will match my strength and magic against hers as it is decreed that i shall do to the victor be that crown for which we have warred for ages  then suddenly atene sprang to her saddle and turning her horses head rode it back through the water to the shore followed by old simbri who lifted up his crooked hands as though in woe and fear muttering as he wentyou have entered the forbidden river and now atene the day of decision is upon us allupon us and herthat predestined day of ruin and of war  what do they mean asked leo of me  i dont know i answered but i have no doubt we shall find out soon enough and that it will be something unpleasant now for this river  before we had struggled through it i thought more than once that the day of drowning was upon us also for in places there were deep rapids which nearly swept us away but leo who waded leading the khans horse by the bridle felt his path and supported himself with the spear shaft so that in the end we reached the other bank safely  beyond it lay a breadth of marshy lands that doubtless were overflowed when the torrent was in flood through these we pushed our way as fast as we could for we feared lest the khania had gone to fetch her escort which we thought she might have left behind the rise and would return with it presently to hunt us down at that time we did not know what we learned afterwards that with its bordering river the soil of the mountain was absolutely sacred and in practice inviolable true it had been invaded by the people of kaloon in several wars but on each occasion their army was destroyed or met with terrible disaster little wonder then they had come to believe that the house of fire was under the protection of some unconquerable spirit  leaving the marsh we reached a bare rising plain which led to the first slope of the mountain three or four miles away here we expected every moment to be attacked by the savages of whom we had heard so much but no living creature did we see the place was a desert streaked with veins of rock that once had been molten lava i do not remember much else about it indeed the pain in my arm was so sharp that i had no eyes for physical features at length the rise ended in a bare broad donga quite destitute of vegetation of which the bottom was buried in lava and a debris of rocks washed down by the rain or melting snows from slopes above this donga was bordered on the farther side by a cliff perhaps fifty feet in height in which we could see no opening  still we descended the place that was dark and rugged pervaded moreover by an extraordinary gloom and as we went perceived that its lava floor was sprinkled over with a multitude of white objects soon we came to the first of these and found that it was the skeleton of a human being here was a veritable valley of dead bones thousands upon thousands of them a gigantic graveyard it seemed as though some great army had perished here  indeed we found afterwards that this was the case for on one of those occasions in the far past when the people of kaloon had attacked the mountain tribes they were trapped and slaughtered in this gully leaving their bones as a warning and a token among these sad skeletons we wandered disconsolately seeking a path up the opposing cliff and finding none until at length we came to a halt not knowing which way to turn then it was that we met with our first strange experience on the mountain  the gulf and its mouldering relics depressed us so that for awhile we were silent and to tell the truth somewhat afraid yes even the horse seemed afraid for it snorted a little hung its head and shivered close by us lay a pile of bones the remains evidently of a number of wretched creatures that dead or living had been hurled down from the cliff above and on the top of the pile was a little huddled heap which we took for more bones  unless we can find a way out of this accursed charnelhouse before long i think that we shall add to its company i said staring round me  as the words left my lips it seemed to me that from the corner of my eye i saw the heap on the top of the bones stir i looked round yes it was stirring it rose it stood up a human figure apparently that of a womanbut of this i could not be surewrapped from head to foot in white and wearing a hanging veil over its face or rather a mask with cut eyeholes it advanced towards us while we stared at it till the horse catching sight of the thing shied violently and nearly threw me when at a distance of about ten paces it paused and beckoned with its hand that was also swathed in white like the arm of a mummy  what the devil are you shouted leo and his voice echoed drearily among those naked rocks but the creature did not answer it only continued to beckon  leo walked up to it to assure himself that we were not the victims of some hallucination as he came it glided back to its heap of bones and stood there like a ghost of one dead arisen from amidst these grinning evidences of death or rather a swathed corpse for that is what it resembled leo followed with the intention of touching it to assure himself of its reality whereon it lifted its whitewrapped arm and struck him lightly on the breast then as he recoiled it pointed with its hand first upwards as though to the peak or the sky and next at the wall of rock which faced us  he returned to me saying what shall we do  follow i suppose it may be a messenger from above and i nodded toward the mountain crest  from below more likely leo muttered for i dont like the look of this guide  still he motioned with his hand to the creature to proceed apparently it understood for it turned to the left and began to pick its way amongst the stones and skeletons swiftly and without noise we followed for several hundred yards till it reached a shallow cleft in the rock this cleft we had seen already but as it appeared to end at a depth of about thirty feet we passed on the figure entered here and vanished  it must be a shadow said leo doubtfully  nonsense i answered shadows dont strike one go on  so he led the horse up the cleft to find that at the end it turned sharply to the right and that the form was standing there awaiting us forward it went again and we after it down a little gorge that grew ever gloomier till it terminated in what might have been a cave or a gallery cut in the rock  here our guide came back to us apparently with the intention of taking the horse by the bridle but at this nearer sight of it the brute snorted and reared up so that it almost fell backwards upon me as it found its feet again the figure struck it on the head in the same passionless inhuman way that it had struck leo whereon the horse trembled and burst into a sweat as though with fear making no further attempt to escape or to disobey then it took one side of the bridle in its swathed hand and leo clinging to the other we plunged into the tunnel  our position was not pleasant for we knew not whither we were being led by this horrible conductor and suspected that it might be to meet our deaths in the darkness moreover i guessed that the path was narrow and bordered by some gulf for as we went i heard stones fall apparently to a considerable depth while the poor horse lifted its feet gingerly and snorted in abject fear at length we saw daylight and never was i more glad of its advent although it showed us that there was a gulf on our right and that the path we travelled could not measure more than ten feet in width  now we were out of the tunnel that evidently had saved us a wide detour and standing for the first time upon the actual slope of the mountain which stretched upwards for a great number of miles till it reached the snowline above here also we saw evidences of human life for the ground was cultivated in patches and herds of mountain sheep and cattle were visible in the distance  presently we entered a gully following a rough path that led along the edge of a raging torrent it was a desolate place half a mile wide or more having hundreds of fantastic lava boulders strewn about its slopes before we had gone a mile i heard a shrill whistle and suddenly from behind these boulders sprang a number of men quite fifty of them all we could note at the time was that they were brawny savagelooking fellows for the most part red haired and bearded although their complexions were rather dark who wore cloaks of white goat skins and carried spears and shields i should imagine that they were not unlike the ancient picts and scots as they appeared to the invading romans at us they came uttering their shrill whistling cries evidently with the intention of spearing us on the spot  now for it said leo drawing his sword for escape was impossible they were all round us goodbye horace  goodbye i answered rather faintly understanding what the khania and the old shaman had meant when they said that we should be killed before we ascended the first slope of the mountain  meanwhile our ghastlylooking guide had slipped behind a great boulder and even then it occurred to me that her part in the tragedy being played she if it were a woman at all was withdrawing herself while we met our miserable fate but here i did her injustice for she had i suppose come to save us from this very fate which without her presence we must most certainly have suffered when the savages were within a few yards suddenly she appeared on the top of the boulder looking like a second witch of endor and stretched out her arm not a word did she speak only stretched out her draped arm but the effect was remarkable and instantaneous  at the sight of her down on to their faces went those wild men every one of them as though a lightning stroke had in an instant swept them out of existence then she let her arm fall and beckoned whereon a great fellow who i suppose was the leader of the band rose and crept towards her with bowed head submissive as a beaten dog to him she made signs pointing to us pointing to the faroff peak crossing and uncrossing her whitewrapped arms but so far as i could hear speaking no word it was evident that the chief understood her however for he said something in a guttural language then he uttered his shrill whistle whereon the band rose and departed thence at full speed this way and the other so that in another minute they had vanished as quickly as they came  now our guide motioned to us to proceed and led the way upward as calmly as though nothing had happened  for over two hours we went on thus till our path brought us from the ravine on to a grassy declivity across which it wound its way here to our astonishment we found a fire burning and hanging above the fire an earthenware pot which was on the boil although we could see no man tending it the figure signalled to me to dismount pointing to the pot in token that we were to eat the food which doubtless she had ordered the wild men to prepare for us and very glad was i to obey her provision had been made for the horse also for near the fire lay a great bundle of green forage  while leo offsaddled the beast and spread the provender for it taking with me a spare earthen vessel that lay ready i went to the edge of the torrent to drink and steep my wounded arm in its icecold stream this relieved it greatly though by now i was sure from various symptoms that the brute masters fangs had fortunately only broken or injured the small bone a discovery for which i was thankful enough having finished attending to it as well as i was able i filled the jar with water  on my way back a thought struck me and going to where our mysterious guide stood still as lots wife after she had been turned into a pillar of salt i offered it to her hoping that she would unveil her face and drink then for the first time she showed some sign of being human or so i thought for it seemed to me that she bowed ever so little in acknowledgment of the courtesy if soand i may have been mistakenthis was all for the next instant she turned her back on me to show that it was declined so she would not or for aught i knew could not drink neither would she eat for when leo tried her afterwards with food she refused it in like fashion  meanwhile he had taken the pot off the fire and as soon as its contents grew cool enough we fell on them eagerly for we were starving after we had eaten and drunk leo redressed my arm as best he could and we rested awhile indeed i think that being very tired we began to doze for i was awakened by a shadow falling on us and looked up to see our corpselike guide standing close by and pointing first to the sun then at the horse as though to show us that we had far to travel so we saddled up and went on again somewhat refreshed for at least we were no longer ravenous  all the rest of that day we journeyed on up the grassy slopes seeing no man although occasionally we heard the wild whistle which told us that we were being watched by the mountain savages by sundown the character of the country had changed for the grass was replaced with rocks amongst which grew stunted firs we had left the lower slopes and were beginning to climb the mountain itself  the sun sank and we went on through the twilight the twilight died and we went on through the dark our path lit only by the stars and the faint radiance of the glowing pillar of smoke above the peak which was reflected on to us from the mighty mantle of its snows forward we toiled whilst a few paces ahead of us walked our unwearying guide if she had seemed weird and inhuman before now she appeared a very ghost as clad in her graveyard white upon which the faint light shimmered never speaking never looking back she glided on noiselessly between the black rocks and the twisted darkgreen firs and junipers  soon we lost all count of the road we turned this way and turned that way we passed an open patch and through the shadows of a grove till at length as the moon rose we entered a ravine and following a path that ran down it came to a place which is best described as a large amphitheatre cut by the hand of nature out of the rock of the mountain evidently it was chosen as a place of defence for its entrance was narrow and tortuous built up at the end also so that only one person could pass its gateway at a time within an open space and at its farther side stood low stone houses built against the rock in front of these houses the moonlight shining full upon them were gathered several hundred men and women arranged in a semicircle and in alternate companies who appeared to be engaged in the celebration of some rite  it was wild enough in front of them and in the exact centre of the semicircle stood a gigantic redbearded man who was naked except for a skin girdle about his loins he was swinging himself backwards and forwards his hands resting upon his hips and as he swung shouting something like ho haha ho when he bent towards the audience it bent towards him and every time he straightened himself it echoed his final shout of ho in a volume of sound that made the precipices ring nor was this all for perched upon his hairy head with arched back and waving tail stood a great white cat  anything stranger and indeed more fantastic than the general effect of this scene lit by the bright moonlight and set in that wild arena it was never my lot to witness the redhaired halfnaked men and women the gigantic priest the mystical white cat that gripping his scalp with its claws waved its tail and seemed to take a part in the performance the unholy chant and its volleying chorus all helped to make it extraordinarily impressive this struck us the more perhaps because at the time we could not in the least guess its significance though we imagined that it must be preliminary to some sacrifice or offering it was like the fragment of a nightmare preserved by the awakened senses in all its mad meaningless reality  now round the open space where these savages were celebrating their worship or whatever it might be ran a rough stone wall about six feet in height in which wall was a gateway towards this we advanced quite unseen for upon our side of the wall grew many stunted pines through these pines our guide led us till in the thickest of them some few yards from the open gateway and a little to the right of it she motioned to us to stop  then she went to a low place in the wall and stood there as though she were considering the scene beyond it seemed to us indeed that she saw what she had not expected and was thereby perplexed or angered presently she appeared to make up her mind for again she motioned to us to remain where we were enjoining silence upon us by placing her swathed hand upon the mask that hid her face next moment she was gone how she went or whither i cannot say all we knew was that she was no longer there  what shall we do now whispered leo to me  stay where we are till she comes back again or something happens i answered  so there being nothing else to be done we stayed hoping that the horse would not betray us by neighing or that we might not be otherwise discovered since we were certain that if so we should be in danger of death very soon however we forgot the anxieties of our own position in the study of the wild scene before us which now began to develop a fearful interest  it would seem that what has been described was but preliminary to the drama itself and that this drama was the trial of certain people for their lives this we could guess for after awhile the incantation ceased and the crowd in front of the big man with the cat upon his head opened out while behind him a column of smoke rose into the air as though light had been set to some sunk furnace  into the space that had thus been cleared were now led seven persons whose hands were tied behind them they were of both sexes and included an old man and a woman with a tall and handsome figure who appeared to be quite young scarcely more than a girl indeed these seven were ranged in a line where they stood clearly in great fear for the old man fell upon his knees and one of the women began to sob thus they were left awhile perhaps to allow the fire behind them to burn up which it soon did with great fierceness throwing a vivid light upon every detail of the spectacle  now all was ready and a man brought a wooden tray to the redbearded priest who was seated on a stool the white cat upon his knees whither we had seen it leap from his head a little while before he took the tray by its handles and at a word from him the cat jumped on to it and sat there then amidst the most intense silence he rose and uttered some prayer apparently to the cat which sat facing him this done he turned the tray round so that the creatures back was now towards him and advancing to the line of prisoners began to walk up and down in front of them which he did several times at each turn drawing a little nearer  holding out the tray he presented it at the face of the prisoner on the left whereon the cat rose arched its back and began to lift its paws up and down presently he moved to the next prisoner and held it before him awhile and so on till he came to the fifth that young woman of whom i have spoken now the cat grew very angry for in the deathlike stillness we could hear it spitting and growling at length it seemed to lift its paws and strike the girl upon the face whereon she screamed aloud a terrible scream then all the audience broke out into a shout a single word which we understood for we had heard one very like it used by the people of the plain it was witch witch witch  executioners who were waiting for the victim to be chosen in this ordeal by cat rushed forward and seizing the girl began to drag her towards the fire the prisoner who was standing by her and whom we rightly guessed to be her husband tried to protect her but his arms being bound poor fellow he could do nothing one of the executioners knocked him down with a stick for a moment his wife escaped and threw herself upon him but the brutes lifted her up again haling her towards the fire whilst all the audience shouted wildly  i cant stand this said leo its murdercoldblooded murder and he drew his sword  best leave the beasts alone i answered doubtfully though my own blood was boiling in my veins  whether he heard or not i do not know for the next thing i saw was leo rushing through the gate waving the khans sword and shouting at the top of his voice then i struck my heels into the ribs of the horse and followed after him in ten seconds we were among them as we came the savages fell back this way and that staring at us amazed for at first i think they took us for apparitions thus leo on foot and i galloping after him we came to the place  the executioners and their victim were near the fire nowa very great fire of resinous pine logs built in a pit that measured about eight feet across close to it sat the priest upon his stool watching the scene with a cruel smile and rewarding the cat with little gobbets of raw meat that he took from a leathern pouch at his side occupations in which he was so deeply engaged that he never saw us until we were right on to him  shouting leave her alone you blackguards leo rushed at the executioners and with a single blow of his sword severed the arm of one of them who gripped the woman by the nape of the neck  with a yell of pain and rage the man sprang back and stood waving the stump towards the people and staring at it wildly in the confusion that followed i saw the victim slip from the hands of her astonished wouldbe murderers and run into the darkness where she vanished also i saw the witchdoctor spring up still holding the tray on which the cat was sitting and heard him begin to shout a perfect torrent of furious abuse at leo who in reply waved his sword and cursed him roundly in english and many other languages  then of a sudden the cat upon the tray infuriated i suppose by the noise and the interruption of its meal sprang straight at leos face he appeared to catch it in midair with his left hand and with all his strength dashed it to the ground where it lay writhing and screeching then as though by an afterthought he stooped picked the devilish creature up again and hurled it into the heart of the fire for he was mad with rage and knew not what he did  at the sight of that awful sacrilegefor such it was to them who worshipped this beasta gasp of horror rose from the spectators followed by a howl of execration then like a wave of the sea they rushed at us i saw leo cut one man down and next instant i was off the horse and being dragged towards the furnace at the edge of it i met leo in like plight but fighting furiously for his strength was great and they were half afraid of him  why couldnt you leave the cat alone i shouted at him in idiotic remonstrance for my brain had gone and all i knew was that we were about to be thrown into the fiery pit already i was over it i felt the flames singe my hair and saw its red caverns awaiting me when of a sudden the brutal hands that held me were unloosed and i fell backwards to the ground where i lay staring upwards  this was what i saw standing in front of the fire her draped form quivering as though with rage was our ghostlylooking guide who pointed with her hand at the gigantic redheaded witchdoctor but she was no longer alone for with her were a score or more of men clad in white robes and armed with swords blackeyed asceticlooking men with cleanshaved heads and faces for their scalps shone in the firelight  at the sight of them terror had seized that multitude which mad as goaded bulls but a few seconds before now fled in every direction like sheep frightened by a wolf the leader of the whiterobed priests a man with a gentle face which when at rest was clothed in a perpetual smile was addressing the medicineman and i understood something of his talk  dog he said in effect speaking in a smooth measured voice that yet was terrible accursed dog beastworshipper what were you about to do to the guests of the mighty mother of the mountain is it for this that you and your idolatries have been spared so long answer if you have anything to say answer quickly for your time is short  with a groan of fear the great fellow flung himself upon his knees not to the headpriest who questioned him but before the quivering shape of our guide and to her put up halfarticulate prayers for mercy  cease said the highpriest she is the minister who judges and the sword that strikes i am the ears and the voice speak and tell mewere you about to cast those men whom you were commanded to receive hospitably into yonder fire because they saved the victim of your devilries and killed the imp you cherished nay i saw it all know that it was but a trap set to catch you who have been allowed to live too long  but still the wretch writhed before the draped form and howled for mercy  messenger said the highpriest with thee the power goes declare thy decree  then our guide lifted her hand slowly and pointed to the fire at once the man turned ghastly white groaned and fell back as i think quite dead slain by his own terror  now many of the people had fled but some remained and to these the priest called in cold tones bidding them approach they obeyed creeping towards him  look he said pointing to the man look and tremble at the justice of hes the mother aye and be sure that as it is with him so shall it be with every one of you who dares to defy her and to practise sorcery and murder lift up that dead dog who was your chief  some of them crept forward and did his bidding  now cast him into the bed which he had made ready for his victims  staggering forward to the edge of the flaming pit they obeyed and the great body fell with a crash amongst the burning boughs and vanished there  listen you people said the priest and learn that this man deserved his dreadful doom know you why he purposed to kill that woman whom the strangers saved because his familiar marked her as a witch you think i tell you it was not so it was because she being fair he would have taken her from her husband as he had taken many another and she refused him but the eye saw the voice spoke and the messenger did judgment he is caught in his own snare and so shall you be every one of you who dares to think evil in his heart or to do it with his hands  such is the just decree of the hesea spoken by her from her throne amidst the fires of the mountain    chapter xiii  beneath the shadowing wings  one by one the terrified tribesmen crept away when the last of them were gone the priest advanced to leo and saluted him by placing his hand upon his forehead  lord he said in the same corrupt grecian dialect which was used by the courtiers of kaloon i will not ask if you are hurt since from the moment that you entered the sacred river and set foot within this land you and your companion were protected by a power invisible and could not be harmed by man or spirit however great may have seemed your danger yet vile hands have been laid upon you and this is the command of the mother whom i serve that if you desire it every one of those men who touched you shall die before your eyes say is that your will  nay answered leo they were mad and blind let no blood be shed for us all we ask of you friendbut how are you called  name me oros he answered  friend orosa good title for one who dwells upon the mountainall we ask is food and shelter and to be led swiftly into the presence of her whom you name mother that oracle whose wisdom we have travelled far to seek  he bowed and answered the food and shelter are prepared and tomorrow when you have rested i am commanded to conduct you whither you desire to be follow me i pray you and he preceded us past the fiery pit to a building that stood about fifty yards away against the rock wall of the amphitheatre  it would seem that it was a guesthouse or at least had been made ready to serve that purpose as in it lamps were lit and a fire burned for here the air was cold the house was divided into two rooms the second of them a sleeping place to which he led us through the first  enter he said for you will need to cleanse yourselves and youhere he addressed himself to meto be treated for that hurt to your arm which you had from the jaws of the great hound  how know you that i asked  it matters not if i do know and have made ready oros answered gravely  this second room was lighted and warmed like the first moreover heated water stood in basins of metal and on the beds were laid clean linen garments and darkcoloured hooded robes lined with rich fur also upon a little table were ointments bandages and splints a marvellous thing to see for it told me that the very nature of my hurt had been divined but i asked no more questions i was too weary moreover i knew that it would be useless  now the priest oros helped me to remove my tattered robe and undoing the rough bandages upon my arm washed it gently with warm water in which he mixed some spirit and examined it with the skill of a trained doctor  the fangs rent deep he said and the small bone is broken but you will take no harm save for the scars which must remain then having treated the wounds with ointment he wrapped the limb with such a delicate touch that it scarcely pained me saying that by the morrow the swelling would have gone down and he would set the bone this indeed happened  after it was done he helped me to wash and to clothe myself in the clean garments and put a sling about my neck to serve as a rest for my arm meanwhile leo had also dressed himself so that we left the chamber together very different men to the foul bloodstained wanderers who had entered there in the outer room we found food prepared for us of which we ate with a thankful heart and without speaking then blind with weariness we returned to the other chamber and having removed our outer garments flung ourselves upon the beds and were soon plunged in sleep  at some time in the night i awoke suddenly at what hour i do not know as certain people wake i among them when their room is entered even without the slightest noise before i opened my eyes i felt that some one was with us in the place nor was i mistaken a little lamp still burned in the chamber a mere wick floating in oil and by its light i saw a dim ghostlike form standing near the door indeed i thought almost that it was a ghost till presently i remembered and knew it for our corpselike guide who appeared to be looking intently at the bed on which leo lay or so i thought for the head was bent in that direction  at first she was quite still then she moaned aloud a low and terrible moan which seemed to well from the very heart  so the thing was not dumb as i had believed evidently it could suffer and express its suffering in a human fashion look it was wringing its padded hands as in an excess of woe now it would seem that leo began to feel its influence also for he stirred and spoke in his sleep so low at first that i could only distinguish the tongue he used which was arabic presently i caught a few words  ayesha he said ayesha  the figure glided towards him and stopped he sat up in the bed still fast asleep for his eyes were shut he stretched out his arms as though seeking one whom he would embrace and spoke again in a low and passionate voiceayesha through life and death i have sought thee long come to me my goddess my desired  the figure glided yet nearer and i could see that it was trembling and now its arms were extended also  at the bedside she halted and leo laid himself down again now the coverings had fallen back exposing his breast where lay the leather satchel he always wore that which contained the lock of ayeshas hair he was fast asleep and the figure seemed to fix its eyes upon this satchel presently it did more for with surprising deftness those whitewrapped fingers opened its clasp yes and drew out the long tress of shining hair long and earnestly she gazed at it then gently replaced the relic closed the satchel and for a little while seemed to weep while she stood thus the dreaming leo once more stretched out his arms and spoke saying in the same passionladen voicecome to me my darling my beautiful my beautiful  at those words with a little muffled scream like that of a scared nightbird the figure turned and flitted through the doorway  when i was quite certain that she had gone i gasped aloud  what might this mean i wondered in a very agony of bewilderment this could certainly be no dream it was real for i was wide awake indeed what did it all mean who was the ghastly mummylike thing which had guided us unharmed through such terrible dangers the messenger that all men feared who could strike down a brawny savage with a motion of its hand why did it creep into the place thus at dead of night like a spirit revisiting one beloved why did its presence cause me to awake and leo to dream why did it draw out the tress indeed how knew it that this tress was hidden there and whyoh why at those tender and passionate words did it flit away at last like some scared bat  the priest oros had called our guide minister and sword that is one who carries out decrees but what if they were its own decrees what if this thing should be she whom we sought ayesha herself why should i tremble at the thought seeing that if so our quest was ended we had achieved oh it must be because about this being there was something terrible something unhuman and appalling if ayesha lived within those mummycloths then it was a different ayesha whom we had known and worshipped well could i remember the whitedraped form of shewhomustbeobeyed and how long before she revealed her glorious face to us we guessed the beauty and the majesty hidden beneath that veil by which her radiant life and loveliness incarnate could not be disguised  but what of this creature i would not pursue the thought i was mistaken doubtless she was what the priest oros had saidsome halfsupernatural being to whom certain powers were given and doubtless she had come to spy on us in our rest that she might make report to the giver of those powers  comforting myself thus i fell asleep again for fatigue overcame even such doubts and fears in the morning when they were naturally less vivid i made up my mind that for various reasons it would be wisest to say nothing of what i had seen to leo nor indeed did i do so until some days had gone by  when i awoke the full light was pouring into the chamber and by it i saw the priest oros standing at my bedside i sat up and asked him what time it was to which he answered with a smile but in a low voice that it lacked but two hours of midday adding that he had come to set my arm now i saw why he spoke low for leo was still fast asleep  let him rest on he said as he undid the wrappings on my arm for he has suffered much and he continued significantly may still have more to suffer  what do you mean friend oros i asked sharply i thought you told us that we were safe upon this mountain  i told you friend and he looked at me  holly is my name  friend holly that your bodies are safe i said nothing of all the rest of you man is more than flesh and blood he is mind and spirit as well and these can be injured also  who is there that would injure them i asked  friend he answered gravely you and your companion have come to a haunted land not as mere wanderers for then you would be dead ere now but of set purpose seeking to lift the veil from mysteries which have been hid for ages well your aim is known and it may chance that it will be achieved but if this veil is lifted it may chance also that you will find what shall send your souls shivering to despair and madness say are you not afraid  somewhat i answered yet my fosterson and i have seen strange things and lived we have seen the very light of life roll by in majesty we have been the guests of an immortal and watched death seem to conquer her and leave us untouched think you then that we will turn cowards now nay we march on to fulfil our destinies  at these words oros showed neither curiosity nor surprise it was as though i told him only what he knew  good he replied smiling and with a courteous bow of his shaven head within an hour you shall march onto fulfil your destinies if i have warned you forgive me for i was bidden so to do perhaps to try your mettle is it needful that i should repeat this warning to the lord and again he looked at me  leo vincey i said  leo vincey yes leo vincey he repeated as though the name were familiar to him but had slipped his mind but you have not answered my question is it needful that i should repeat the warning  not in the least but you can do so if you wish when he awakes  nay i think with you that it would be but waste of words forforgive the comparisonwhat the wolf daresand he looked at methe tiger does not flee from and he nodded towards leo there see how much better are the wounds upon your arm which is no longer swollen now i will bandage it and within some few weeks the bone will be as sound again as it was before you met the khan rassen hunting in the plains by the way you will see him again soon and his fair wife with him  see him again do the dead then come to life upon this mountain  nay but certain of them are brought hither for burial it is the privilege of the rulers of kaloon also i think that the khania has questions to ask of its oracle  who is its oracle i asked with eagerness  the oracle he replied darkly is a voice it was ever so was it not  yes i have heard that from atene but a voice implies a speaker is this speaker she whom you name mother  perhaps friend holly  and is this mother a spirit  it is a point that has been much debated they told you so in the plains did they not also the tribes think it on the mountain indeed the thing seems reasonable seeing that all of us who live are flesh and spirit but you will form your own judgment and then we can discuss the matter there your arm is finished be careful now not to strike it or to fall and look your companion awakes  something over an hour later we started upon our upward journey i was again mounted on the khans horse which having been groomed and fed was somewhat rested while to leo a litter had been offered this he declined however saying that he had now recovered and would not be carried like a woman so he walked by the side of my horse using his spear as a staff we passed the firepitnow full of dead white ashes among which were mixed those of the witchfinder and his horrible catpreceded by our dumb guide at the sight of whom in her pale wrappings the people of the tribe who had returned to their village prostrated themselves and so remained until she was gone by  one of them however rose again and breaking through our escort of priests ran to leo knelt before him and kissed his hand it was that young woman whose life he had saved a noblelooking girl with masses of red hair and by her was her husband the marks of his bonds still showing on his arms our guide seemed to see this incident though how she did so i do not know at any rate she turned and made some sign which the priest interpreted  calling the woman to him he asked her sternly how she dared to touch the person of this stranger with her vile lips she answered that it was because her heart was grateful oros said that for this reason she was forgiven moreover that in reward for what they had suffered he was commanded to lift up her husband to be the ruler of that tribe during the pleasure of the mother he gave notice moreover that all should obey the new chief in his place according to their customs and if he did any evil make report that he might suffer punishment then waving the pair aside without listening to their thanks or the acclamations of the crowd he passed on  as we went down the ravine by which we had approached the village on the previous night a sound of chanting struck our ears presently the path turned and we saw a solemn procession advancing up that dismal sunless gorge at the head of it rode none other than the beautiful khania followed by her greatuncle the old shaman and after these came a company of shaven priests in their white robes bearing between them a bier upon which its face uncovered lay the body of the khan draped in a black garment yet he looked better thus than he had ever done for now death had touched this insane and dissolute man with something of the dignity which he lacked in life  thus then we met at the sight of our guides white form the horse which the khania rode reared up so violently that i thought it would have thrown her but she mastered the animal with her whip and voice and called outwho is this draped hag of the mountain that stops the path of the khania atene and her dead lord my guests i find you in ill company for it seems that you are conducted by an evil spirit to meet an evil fate that guide of yours must surely be something hateful and hideous for were she a wholesome woman she would not fear to show her face  now the shaman plucked his mistress by the sleeve and the priest oros bowing to her prayed her to be silent and cease to speak such illomened words into the air which might carry them she knew not whither but some instinctive hate seemed to bubble up in atene and she would not be silent for she addressed our guide using the direct thou a manner of speech that we found was very usual on the mountain though rare upon the plains  let the air carry them whither it will she cried sorceress strip off thy rags fit only for a corpse too vile to view show us what thou art thou flitting nightowl who thinkest to frighten me with that livery of death which only serves to hide the death within  cease i pray lady cease said oros stirred for once out of his imperturbable calm she is the minister none other and with her goes the power  then it goes not against atene khania of kaloon she answered or so i think power forsooth let her show her power if she has any it is not her own but that of the witch of the mountain who feigns to be a spirit and by her sorceries has drawn away my guestsand she pointed to usthus bringing my husband to his death  niece be silent said the old shaman whose wrinkled face was white with terror whilst oros held up his hands as though in supplication to some unseen strength sayingo thou that hearest and seest be merciful i beseech thee and forgive this woman her madness lest the blood of a guest should stain the hands of thy servants and the ancient honour of our worship be brought low in the eyes of men  thus he prayed but although his hands were uplifted it seemed to me that his eyes were fixed upon our guide as ours were while he spoke i saw her hand raised as she had raised it when she slew or rather sentenced the witchdoctor then she seemed to reflect and stayed it in mid air so that it pointed at the khania she did not move she made no sound only she pointed and the angry words died upon atenes lips the fury left her eyes and the colour her face yes she grew white and silent as the corpse upon the bier behind her then cowed by that invisible power she struck her horse so fiercely that it bounded by us onward towards the village at which the funeral company were to rest awhile  as the shaman simbri followed the khania the priest oros caught his horses bridle and said to himmagician we have met before for instance when your ladys father was brought to his funeral warn her then you that know something of the truth and of her power to speak more gently of the ruler of this land say to her from me that had she not been the ambassadress of death and therefore inviolate surely ere now she would have shared her husbands bier farewell tomorrow we will speak again and loosing the shamans bridle oros passed on  soon we had left the melancholy procession behind us and issuing from the gorge turned up the mountain slope towards the edge of the bright snows that lay not far above it was as we came out of this darksome valley where the overhanging pine trees almost eclipsed the light that suddenly we missed our guide  has she gone back toto reason with the khania i asked of oros  nay he answered with a slight smile i think that she has gone forward to give warning that the heseas guests draw near  indeed i answered staring hard at the bare slope of mountain up which not a mouse could have passed without being seen i understandshe has gone forward and the matter dropped but what i did not understand washow she had gone as the mountain was honeycombed with caves and galleries i suppose however that she entered one of them  all the rest of that day we marched upwards gradually drawing nearer to the snowline as we went gathering what information we could from the priest oros this was the sum of itfrom the beginning of the world as he expressed it that is from thousands and thousands of years ago this mountain had been the home of a peculiar fireworship of which the head heirophant was a woman about twenty centuries before however the invading general named rassen had made himself khan of kaloon rassen established a new priestess on the mountain a worshipper of the egyptian goddess hes or isis this priestess had introduced certain modifications in the ancient doctrines superseding the cult of fire pure and simple by a new faith which while holding to some of the old ceremonies revered as its head the spirit of life or nature of whom they looked upon their priestess as the earthly representative  of this priestess oros would only tell us that she was ever present although we gathered that when one priestess died or was taken to the fire as he put it her child whether in fact or by adoption succeeded her and was known by the same names those of hes or the hesea and mother we asked if we should see this mother to which he answered that she manifested herself very rarely as to her appearance and attributes he would say nothing except that the former changed from time to time and that when she chose to use it she had all power  the priests of her college he informed us numbered three hundred never more nor less and there were also three hundred priestesses certain of those who desired it were allowed to marry and from among their children were reared up the new generation of priests and priestesses thus they were a people apart from all others with distinct racial characteristics this indeed was evident for our escort were all exceedingly like to each other very handsome and refined in appearance with dark eyes cleancut features and olivehued skins such a people as might well have descended from easterns of high blood with a dash of that of the egyptians and greeks thrown in  we asked him whether the mighty looped pillar that towered from the topmost cup of the mountain was the work of men he answered no the hand of nature had fashioned it and that the light shining through it came from the fires which burned in the crater of the volcano the first priestess having recognized in this gigantic column the familiar symbol of life of the egyptian worship established her altars beneath its shadow  for the rest the mountain with its mighty slopes and borderlands was peopled by a multitude of halfsavage folk who accepted the rule of the hesea bringing her tribute of all things necessary such as food and metals much of the meat and grain however the priests raised themselves on sheltered farms and the metals they worked with their own hands this rule however was of a moral nature since for centuries the college had sought no conquests and the mother contented herself with punishing crime in some such fashion as we had seen for the petty wars between the tribes and the people of the plain they were not responsible and those chiefs who carried them on were deposed unless they had themselves been attacked all the tribes however were sworn to the defence of the hesea and the college and however much they might quarrel amongst themselves if need arose were ready to die for her to the last man that war must one day break out again between the priests of the mountain and the people of kaloon was recognized therefore they endeavoured to be prepared for that great and final struggle  such was the gist of his history which as we learned afterwards proved to be true in every particular  towards sundown we came to a vast cup extending over many thousand acres situated beneath the snowline of the peak and filled with rich soil washed down i suppose from above so sheltered was the place by its configuration and the overhanging mountain that facing southwest as it did notwithstanding its altitude it produced corn and other temperate crops in abundance here the college had its farms and very well cultivated these seemed to be this great cup which could not be seen from below we entered through a kind of natural gateway that might be easily defended against a host  there were other peculiarities but it is not necessary to describe them further than to say that i think the soil benefited by the natural heat of the volcano and that when this erupted as happened occasionally the lava streams always passed to the north and south of the cup of land indeed it was these lava streams that had built up the protecting cliffs  crossing the gardenlike lands we came to a small town beautifully built of lava rock here dwelt the priests except those who were on duty no man of the tribes or other stranger being allowed to set foot within the place  following the main street of this town we arrived at the face of the precipice beyond and found ourselves in front of a vast archway closed with massive iron gates fantastically wrought here taking my horse with them our escort left us alone with oros as we drew near the great gates swung back upon their hinges we passed themwith what sensations i cannot describeand groped our way down a short corridor which ended in tall ironcovered doors these also rolled open at our approach and next instant we staggered back amazed and halfblinded by the intense blaze of light within  imagine you who read the nave of the vastest cathedral with which you are acquainted then double or treble its size and you will have some conception of that temple in which we found ourselves perhaps in the beginning it had been a cave who can say but now its sheer walls its multitudinous columns springing to the arched roof far above us had all been worked on and fashioned by the labour of men long dead doubtless the old fireworshippers of thousands of years ago  you will wonder how so great a place was lighted but i think that never would you guess thusby twisted columns of living flame i counted eighteen of them but there may have been others they sprang from the floor at regular intervals along the lines of what in a cathedral would be the aisles right to the roof they sprang of even height and girth so fierce was the force of the natural gas that drove them and there were lost i suppose through chimneys bored in the thickness of the rock nor did they give off smell or smoke or in that great cold place any heat which could be noticed only an intense white light like that of molten iron and a sharp hissing noise as of a million angry snakes  the huge temple was utterly deserted and save for this sybilant pervading sound utterly silent an awesome an overpowering place  do these candles of yours ever go out asked leo of oros placing his hand before his dazzled eyes  how can they replied the priest in his smooth matteroffact voice seeing that they rise from the eternal fire which the builders of this hall worshipped thus they have burned from the beginning and thus they will burn for ever though if we wish it we can shut off their light be pleased to follow me you will see greater things        this as i ascertained afterwards was done by thrusting      a broad stone of great thickness over the apertures through      which the gas or fire rushed and thus cutting off the air      these stones were worked to and fro by means of pulleys      connected with iron rodsl h h  so in awed silence we followed and oh how small and miserable we three human beings looked alone in that vast temple illuminated by this lightning radiance we reached the end of it at length only to find that to right and left ran transepts on a like gigantic scale and lit in the same amazing fashion here oros bade us halt and we waited a little while till presently from either transept arose a sound of chanting and we perceived two whiterobed processions advancing towards us from their depths  on they came very slowly and we saw that the procession to the right was a company of priests and that to the left a company of priestesses a hundred or so of them in all  now the men ranged themselves in front of us while the women ranged themselves behind and at a signal from oros all of them still chanting some wild and thrilling hymn once more we started forward this time along a narrow gallery closed at the end with double wooden doors as our procession reached these they opened and before us lay the crowning wonder of this marvellous fane a vast ellipseshaped apse now we understood the plan of the temple was the plan of the looped pillar which stood upon the brow of the peak and as we rightly guessed its dimensions were the same  at intervals around this ellipse the fiery columns flared but otherwise the place was empty  no not quite for at the head of the apse almost between two of the flame columns stood a plain square altar of the size of a small room in front of which as we saw when we drew nearer were hung curtains of woven silver thread on this altar was placed a large statue of silver that backed as it was by the black rock seemed to concentrate and reflect from its burnished surface the intense light of the two blazing pillars  it was a lovely thing but to describe it is hard indeed the figure which was winged represented a draped woman of mature years and pure but gracious form half hidden by the forwardbending wings sheltered by these yet shown between them appeared the image of a male child clasped to its bearers breast with her left arm while the right was raised toward the sky a study of motherhood evidently but how shall i write of all that was conveyed by those graven faces  to begin with the child it was that of a sturdy boy full of health and the joy of life yet he had been sleeping and in his sleep some terror had overshadowed him with the dark shades of death and evil there was fear in the lines of his sweet mouth and on the lips and cheeks that seemed to quiver he had thrown his little arm about his mothers neck and pressing close against her breast looked up to her for safety his right hand and outstretched finger pointing downwards and behind him as though to indicate whence the danger came yet it was passing already halfforgotten for the upturned eyes expressed confidence renewed peace of soul attained  and the mother she did not seem to mock or chide his fears for her lovely face was anxious and alert yet upon it breathed a very atmosphere of unchanging tenderness and power invincible care for the helpless strength to shelter it from every harm the great calm eyes told their story the parted lips were whispering some tale of hope sure and immortal the raised hand revealed whence that hope arose all love seemed to be concentrated in the brooding figure so human yet so celestial all heaven seemed to lie an open path before those quivering wings and see the arching instep the upwardspringing foot suggested that thither those wings were bound bearing their godgiven burden far from the horror of the earth deep into the bosom of a changeless rest above  the statue was only that of an affrighted child in its mothers arms its interpretation made clear even to the dullest by the simple symbolism of some geniushumanity saved by the divine  while we gazed at its enchanting beauty the priests and priestesses filing away to right and left arranged themselves alternately first a man and then a woman within the ring of the columns of fire that burned around the loopshaped shrine so great was its circumference that the whole hundred of them must stand wide apart one from another and to our sight resembled little lonely children clad in gleaming garments while their chant of worship reached us only like echoes thrown from a far precipice in short the effect of this holy shrine and its occupants was superb yet overwhelming at least i know that it filled me with a feeling akin to fear  oros waited till the last priest had reached his appointed place then he turned and said in his gentle reverent tonesdraw nigh now o wanderers wellbeloved and give greeting to the mother and he pointed towards the statue  where is she asked leo in a whisper for here we scarcely dared to speak aloud i see no one  the hesea dwells yonder he answered and taking each of us by the hand he led us forward across the great emptiness of the apse to the altar at its head  as we drew near the distant chant of the priests gathered in volume assuming a glad triumphant note and it seemed to methough this perhaps was fancythat the light from the twisted columns of flame grew even brighter  at length we were there and oros loosing our hands prostrated himself thrice before the altar then he rose again and falling behind us stood in silence with bent head and folded fingers we stood silent also our hearts filled with mingled hope and fear like a cup with wine  were our labours ended had we found her whom we sought or were we perchance but enmeshed in the web of some marvellous mummery and about to make acquaintance with the secret of another new and mystical worship for years and years we had searched enduring every hardness of flesh and spirit that man can suffer and now we were to learn whether we had endured in vain yes and leo would learn if the promise was to be fulfilled to him or whether she whom he adored had become but a departed dream to be sought for only beyond the gate of death little wonder that he trembled and turned white in the agony of that great suspense  long long was the time hours years ages aeons seemed to flow over us as we stood there before glittering silver curtains that hid the front of the black altar beneath the mystery of the sphinxlike face of the glorious image which was its guardian clothed with that frozen smile of eternal love and pity all the past went before us as we struggled in those dark waters of our doubt item by item event by event we rehearsed the story which began in the caves of kor for our thoughts so long attuned were open to each other and flashed from soul to soul  oh now we knew they were open also to another soul we could see nothing save the altar and the effigy we could only hear the slow chant of the priests and priestesses and the snakelike hiss of the rushing fires yet we knew that our hearts were as an open book to one who watched beneath the mothers shadowing wings    chapter xiv  the court of death  now the curtains were open before us appeared a chamber hollowed from the thickness of the altar and in its centre a throne and on the throne a figure clad in waves of billowy white flowing from the head over the arms of the throne down to its marble steps we could see no more in the comparative darkness of that place save that beneath the folds of the drapery the oracle held in its hand a loopshaped jewelled sceptre  moved by some impulse we did as oros had done prostrating ourselves and there remained upon our knees at length we heard a tinkling as of little bells and looking up saw that the sistrumshaped sceptre was stretched towards us by the draped arm which held it then a thin clear voice spoke and i thought that it trembled a little it spoke in greek but in a much purer greek than all these people used  i greet you wanderers who have journeyed so far to visit this most ancient shrine and although doubtless of some other faith are not ashamed to do reverence to that unworthy one who is for this time its oracle and the guardian of its mysteries rise now and have no fear of me for have i not sent my messenger and servants to conduct you to this sanctuary  slowly we rose and stood silent not knowing what to say  i greet you wanderers the voice repeated tell me thouand the sceptre pointed towards leohow art thou named  i am named leo vincey he answered  leo vincey i like the name which to me well befits a man so goodly and thou the companion ofleo vincey  i am named horace holly  so then tell me leo vincey and horace holly what came ye so far to seek  we looked at each other and i saidthe tale is long and strange obut by what title must we address thee  by the name which i bear here hes  o hes i said wondering what name she bore elsewhere  yet i desire to hear that tale she went on and to me her voice sounded eager nay not all tonight for i know that you both are weary a little of it only in sooth strangers there is a sameness in this home of contemplations and no heart can feed only on the past if such a thing there be therefore i welcome a new history from the world without tell it me thou leo as briefly as thou wilt so that thou tell the truth for in the presence of which i am a minister may nothing else be uttered  priestess he said in his curt fashion i obey many years ago when i was young my friend and fosterfather and i led by records of the past travelled to a wild land and there found a certain divine woman who had conquered time  then that woman must have been both aged and hideous  i said priestess that she had conquered time not suffered it for the gift of immortal youth was hers also she was not hideous she was beauty itself  therefore stranger thou didst worship her for her beautys sake as a man does  i did not worship her i loved her which is another thing the priest oros here worships thee whom he calls mother i loved that immortal woman  then thou shouldst love her still yet not so since love is very mortal  i love her still he answered although she died  why how is that thou saidst she was immortal  perchance she only seemed to die perchance she changed at least i lost her and what i lost i seek and have sought this many a year  why dost thou seek her in my mountain leo vincey  because a vision led me to ask counsel of its oracle i am come hither to learn tidings of my lost love since here alone these may be found  and thou holly didst thou also love an immortal woman whose immortality it seems must bow to death  priestess i answered i am sworn to this quest and where my fosterson goes i follow he follows beauty that is dead  and thou dost follow him therefore both of you follow beauty as men have ever done being blind and mad  nay i answered if they were blind beauty would be naught to them who could not see it and if they were mad they would not know it when it was seen knowledge and vision belong to the wise o hes  thou art quick of wit and tongue holly as and she checked herself then of a sudden said tell me did my servant the khania of kaloon entertain both of you hospitably in her city and speed you on your journey hither as i commanded her  we knew not that she was thy servant i replied hospitality we had and to spare but we were sped from her court hitherward by the deathhounds of the khan her husband tell us priestess what thou knowest of this journey of ours  a little she answered carelessly more than three moons ago my spies saw you upon the far mountains and creeping very close to you at night heard you speak together of the object of your wanderings then returning thence swiftly made report to me thereon i bade the khania atene and that old magician her greatuncle who is guardian of the gate go down to the ancient gates of kaloon to receive you and bring you hither with all speed yet for men who burned to learn the answer to a riddle you have been long in coming  we came as fast as we might o hes said leo and if thy spies could visit those mountains where no man was and find a path down that hideous precipice they must have been able also to tell thee the reason of our delay therefore i pray ask it not of us  nay i will ask it of atene herself and she shall surely answer me for she stands without replied the hesea in a cold voice oros lead the khania hither and be swift  the priest turned and walking quickly to the wooden doors by which we had entered the shrine vanished there  now said leo to me nervously in the silence that followed and speaking in english now i wish we were somewhere else for i think that there will be trouble  i dont think i am sure i answered but the more the better for out of trouble may come the truth which we need sorely then i stopped reflecting that the strange woman before us said that her spies had overheard our talk upon the mountains where we had spoken nothing but english  as it proved i was wise for quite quietly the hesea repeated after methou hast experience holly for out of trouble comes the truth as out of wine  then she was silent and needless to say i did not pursue the conversation  the doors swung open and through them came a procession clad in black followed by the shaman simbri who walked in front of a bier upon which lay the body of the khan carried by eight priests behind it was atene draped in a black veil from head to foot and after her marched another company of priests in front of the altar the bier was set down and the priests fell back leaving atene and her uncle standing alone before the corpse  what seeks my vassal the khania of kaloon asked the hesea in a cold voice  now atene advanced and bent the knee but with little graciousness  ancient mother mother from of old i do reverence to thy holy office as my forefathers have done for many a generation and again she curtseyed mother this dead man asks of thee that right of sepulchre in the fires of the holy mountain which from the beginning has been accorded to the royal departed who went before him  it has been accorded as thou sayest answered the hesea by those priestesses who filled my place before me nor shall it be refused to thy dead lordor to thee atenewhen thy time comes  i thank thee o hes and i pray that this decree may be written down for the snows of age have gathered on thy venerable head and soon thou must leave us for awhile therefore bid thy scribes that it be written down so that the hesea who rules after thee may fulfil it in its season  cease said the hesea cease to pour out thy bitterness at that which should command thy reverence oh thou foolish child who dost not know but that tomorrow the fire shall claim the frail youth and beauty which are thy boast i bid thee cease and tell me how did death find this lord of thine  ask those wanderers yonder that were his guests for his blood is on their heads and cries for vengeance at thy hands  i killed him said leo to save my own life he tried to hunt us down with his dogs and there are the marks of them and he pointed to my arm the priest oros knows for he dressed the hurts  how did this chance asked the hesea of atene  my lord was mad she answered boldly and such was his cruel sport  so and was thy lord jealous also nay keep back the falsehood i see rising to thy lips leo vincey answer thou me yet i will not ask thee to lay bare the secrets of a woman who has offered thee her love thou holly speak and let it be the truth  it is this o hes i answered yonder lady and her uncle the shaman simbri saved us from death in the waters of the river that bounds the precipices of kaloon afterwards we were ill and they treated us kindly but the khania became enamoured of my fosterson  here the figure of the priestess stirred beneath its gauzy wrappings and the voice askedand did thy fosterson become enamoured of the khania as being a man he may well have done for without doubt she is fair  he can answer that question for himself o hes all i know is that he strove to escape from her and that in the end she gave him a day to choose between death and marriage with her when her lord should be dead so helped by the khan her husband who was jealous of him we fled towards this mountain which we desired to reach then the khan set his hounds upon us for he was mad and falsehearted we killed him and came on in spite of this lady his wife and her uncle who would have prevented us and were met in a place of bones by a certain veiled guide who led us up the mountain and twice saved us from death that is all the story  woman what hast thou to say asked the hesea in a menacing voice  but little atene answered without flinching for years i have been bound to a madman and a brute and if my fancy wandered towards this man and his fancy wandered towards mewell nature spoke to us and that is all afterwards it seems that he grew afraid of the vengeance of rassen or this holly whom i would that the hounds had torn bone from bone grew afraid so they strove to escape the land and perchance wandered to thy mountain but i weary of this talk and ask thy leave to rest before tomorrows rite  thou sayest atene said the hesea that nature spoke to this man and to thee and that his heart is thine but that fearing thy lords vengeance he fled from thee he who seems no coward tell me then is that tress he hides in the satchel on his breast thy gage of love to him  i know nothing of what he hides in the satchel answered the khania sullenly  and yet yonder in the gatehouse when he lay so sick he set the lock against thine ownah dost remember now  so o hes already he has told thee all our secrets though they be such as most men hide within their breasts and she looked contemptuously at leo  i told her nothing of the matter khania leo said in an angry voice  nay thou toldest me nothing wanderer my watching wisdom told me oh didst thou think atene that thou couldst hide the truth from the allseeing hesea of the mountain if so spare thy breath for i know all and have known it from the first i passed thy disobedience by of thy false messages i took no heed for my own purposes i to whom time is naught suffered even that thou shouldst hold these my guests thy prisoners whilst thou didst strive by threats and force to win a love denied  she paused then went on coldly woman i tell thee that to complete thy sin thou hast even dared to lie to me here in my very sanctuary  if so what of it was the bold answer dost thou love the man thyself nay it is monstrous nature would cry aloud at such a shame oh tremble not with rage hes i know thy evil powers but i know also that i am thy guest and that in this hallowed place beneath yonder symbol of eternal love thou mayst shed no blood more thou canst not harm me hes who am thy equal  atene replied the measured voice did i desire it i could destroy thee where thou art yet thou art right i shall not harm thee thou faithless servant did not my writ bid thee through yonder searcher of the stars thy uncle to meet these guests of mine and bring them straight to my shrine tell me for i seek to know how comes it that thou didst disobey me  have then thy desire answered atene in a new and earnest voice devoid now of bitterness and falsehood i disobeyed because that man is not thine but mine and no other womans because i love him and have loved him from of old aye since first our souls sprang into life i have loved him as he has loved me my own heart tells me so the magic of my uncle here tells me so though how and where and when these things have been i know not therefore i come to thee mother of mysteries guardian of the secrets of the past to learn the truth at least thou canst not lie at thine own altar and i charge thee by the dread name of that power to which thou also must render thy account that thou answer now and here  who is this man to whom my being yearns what has he been to me what has he to do with thee speak o oracle and make the secret clear speak i command even though afterwards thou dost slay meif thou canst  aye speak speak said leo for know i am in sore suspense i also am bewildered by memories and rent with hopes and fears  and i too echoed speak  leo vincey asked the hesea after she had thought awhile whom dost thou believe me to be  i believe he answered solemnly that thou art that ayesha at whose hands i died of old in the caves of kor in africa i believe thou art that ayesha whom not twenty years ago i found and loved in those same caves of kor and there saw perish miserably swearing that thou wouldst return again  see now how madness can mislead a man broke in atene triumphantly not twenty years ago he said whereas i know well that more than eighty summers have gone by since my grandsire in his youth saw this same priestess sitting on the mothers throne  and whom dost thou believe me to be o holly the priestess asked taking no note of the khanias words  what he believes i believe i answered the dead come back to lifesometimes yet alone thou knowest the truth and by thee only it can be revealed  aye she said as though musing the dead come back to lifesometimesand in strange shape and mayhap i know the truth tomorrow when yonder body is borne on high for burial we will speak of it again till then rest you all and prepare to face that fearful thingthe truth  while the hesea still spoke the silvery curtains swung to their place as mysteriously as they had opened then as though at some signal the blackrobed priests advanced surrounding atene they led her from the sanctuary accompanied by her uncle the shaman who as it seemed to me either through fatigue or fear could scarcely stand upon his feet but stood blinking his dim eyes as though the light dazed him when these were gone the priests and priestesses who all this time had been ranged round the walls far out of hearing of our talk gathered themselves into their separate companies and still chanting departed also leaving us alone with oros and the corpse of the khan which remained where it had been set down  now the headpriest oros beckoned to us to follow him and we went also nor was i sorry to leave the place for its deathlike lonelinessenhanced strangely enough as it was by the flood of light that filled it a loneliness which was concentrated and expressed in the awful figure stretched upon the bier oppressed and overcame us whose nerves were broken by all that we had undergone thankful enough was i when having passed the transepts and down the length of the vast nave we came to the iron doors the rock passage and the outer gates which as before opened to let us through and so at last into the sweet cold air of the night at that hour which precedes the dawn  oros led us to a house wellbuilt and furnished where at his bidding like men in a dream we drank of some liquor which he gave us i think that drink was drugged at least after swallowing it i remembered no more till i awoke to find myself lying on a bed and feeling wonderfully strong and well this i thought strange for a lamp burning in the room showed me that it was still dark and therefore that i could have rested but a little time  i tried to sleep again but was not able so fell to thinking till i grew weary of the task for here thoughts would not help me nothing could help except the truth that fearful thing as the veiled priestess had called it  oh what if she should prove not the ayesha whom we desired but some fearful thing what were the meaning of the khanias hints and of her boldness that surely had been inspired by the strength of a hidden knowledge what ifnay it could not bei would rise and dress my arm or i would wake leo and make him dress itanything to occupy my mind until the appointed hour when we must learnthe bestor the worst  i sat up in the bed and saw a figure advancing towards me it was oros who bore a lamp in his hand  you have slept long friend holly he said and now it is time to be up and doing  long i answered testily how can that be when it is still dark  because friend the dark is that of a new night many hours have gone by since you lay down upon this bed well you were wise to rest you while you may for who knows when you will sleep again come let me bathe your arm  tell me i broke innay friend he interrupted firmly i will tell you nothing except that soon you must start to be present at the funeral of the khan and perchance to learn the answer to your questions  ten minutes later he led me to the eatingchamber of the house where i found leo already dressed for oros had awakened him before he came to me and bidden him to prepare himself oros told us here that the hesea had not suffered us to be disturbed until the night came again since we had much to undergo that day so presently we started  once more we were led through the flamelit hall till we came to the loopshaped apse the place was empty now even the corpse of the khan had gone and no draped oracle sat in the altar shrine for its silver curtains were drawn and we saw that it was untenanted  the mother has departed to do honour to the dead according to the ancient custom oros explained to us  then we passed the altar and behind the statue found a door in the rock wall of the apse and beyond the door a passage and a hall as of a house for out of it opened other doors leading to chambers these our guide told us were the dwellingplaces of the hesea and her maidens he added that they ran to the side of the mountain and had windows that opened on to gardens and let in the light and air in this hall six priests were waiting each of whom carried a bundle of torches beneath his arm and held in his hand a lighted lamp  our road runs through the dark said oros though were it day we might climb the outer snows but this at night it is dangerous to do  then taking torches he lit them at a lamp and gave one to each of us  now our climb began up endless sloping galleries we went hewn with inconceivable labour by the primeval fireworshippers from the living rock of the mountain it seemed to me that they stretched for miles and indeed this was so since although the slope was always gentle it took us more than an hour to climb them at length we came to the foot of a great stair  rest awhile here my lord oros said bowing to leo with the reverence that he had shown him from the first for this stair is steep and long now we stand upon the mountains topmost lip and are about to climb that tall looped column which soars above  so we sat down in the vaultlike place and let the sharp draught of air rushing to and from the passages play upon us for we were heated with journeying up those close galleries as we sat thus i heard a roaring sound and asked oros what it might be he answered that we were very near to the crater of the volcano and that what we heard through the thickness of the rock was the rushing of its everlasting fires then the ascent commenced  it was not dangerous though very wearisome for there were nearly six hundred of those steps the climb of the passages had reminded me of that of the gallery of the great pyramid drawn out for whole furlongs that of the pillar was like the ascent of a cathedral spire or rather of several spires piled one upon another  resting from time to time we dragged ourselves up the steep steps each of them quite a foot in height till the pillar was climbed and only the loop remained up it we went also oros leading us and glad was i that the stairway still ran within the substance of the rock for i could feel the needles mighty eye quiver in the rush of the winds which swept about its sides  at length we saw light before us and in another twenty steps emerged upon a platform as leo who went in front of me walked from the stairway i saw oros and another priest seize him by the arms and called to him to ask what they were doing  nothing he cried back except that this is a dizzy place and they feared lest i should fall mind how you come horace and he stretched out his hand to me  now i was clear of the tunnel and i believe that had it not been for that hand i should have sunk to the rocky floor for the sight before me seemed to paralyse my brain nor was this to be wondered at for i doubt whether the world can show such another  we stood upon the very apex of the loop a flat space of rock about eighty yards in length by some thirty in breadth with the starstrewn sky above us to the south twenty thousand feet or more below stretched the dim plain of kaloon and to the east and west the snowclad shoulders of the peak and the broad brown slopes beneath to the north was a different sight and one more awesome there right under us as it seemed for the pillar bent inwards lay the vast crater of the volcano and in the centre of it a wide lake of fire that broke into bubbles and flowers of sudden flame or spouted writhed and twisted like an angry sea  from the surface of this lake rose smoke and gases that took fire as they floated upwards and mingling together formed a gigantic sheet of living light right opposite to us burned this sheet and the flare of it passing through the needleeye of the pillar under us sped away in one dazzling beam across the country of kaloon across the mountains beyond till it was lost on the horizon  the wind blew from south to north being sucked in towards the hot crater of the volcano and its fierce breath that screamed through the eye of the pillar and against its rugged surface bent the long crest of the sheet of flame as an ocean roller is bent over by the gale and tore from it fragments of fire that floated away to leeward like the blownout sails of a burning ship  had it not been for this strong and steady wind indeed no creature could have lived upon the pillar for the vapours would have poisoned him but its unceasing blast drove these all away towards the north for the same reason in the thin air of that icy place the heat was not too great to be endured  appalled by that terrific spectacle which seemed more appropriate to the terrors of the pit than to this earth of ours and fearful lest the blast should whirl me like a dead leaf into the glowing gulf beneath i fell on to my sound hand and my knees shouting to leo to do likewise and looked about me now i observed lines of priests wrapped in great capes kneeling upon the face of the rock and engaged apparently in prayer but of hes the mother or of atene or of the corpse of the dead khan i could see nothing  whilst i wondered where they might be oros upon whose nerves this dread scene appeared to have no effect and some of our attendant priests surrounded us and led us onwards by a path that ran perilously near to the rounded edge of the rock a few downward steps and we found that we were under shelter for the gale was roaring over us twenty more paces and we came to a recess cut i suppose by man in the face of the loop in such fashion that a lava roof was left projecting half across its width  this recess or rock chamber which was large enough to shelter a great number of people we reached safely to discover that it was already tenanted seated in a chair hewn from the rock was the hesea wearing a broidered purple mantle above her gauzy wrappings that enveloped her from head to foot there too standing near to her were the khania atene and her uncle the old shaman who looked but ill at ease and lastly stretched upon his funeral couch the fiery light beating upon his stark form and face lay the dead khan rassen  we advanced to the throne and bowed to her who sat thereon the hesea lifted her hooded head which seemed to have been sunk upon her breast as though she were overcome by thought or care and addressed oros the priest for in the shelter of those massive walls by comparison there was silence and folk could hear each other speak  so thou hast brought them safely my servant she said and i am glad for to those that know it not this road is fearful my guests what say you of the buryingpit of the children of hes  our faith tells us of a hell lady answered leo and i think that yonder cauldron looks like its mouth  nay she answered there is no hell save that which from life to life we fashion for ourselves within the circle of this little star leo vincey i tell thee that hell is here aye here and she struck her hand upon her breast while once more her head drooped forward as though bowed down beneath some load of secret misery  thus she stayed awhile then lifted it and spoke again sayingmidnight is past and much must be done and suffered before the dawn aye the darkness must be turned to light or perchance the light to eternal darkness  royal woman she went on addressing atene as is his right thou hast brought thy dead lord hither for burial in this consecrated place where the ashes of all who went before him have become fuel for the holy fires oros my priest summon thou the accuser and him who makes defence and let the books be opened that i may pass my judgment on the dead and call his soul to live again or pray that from it the breath of life may be withheld  priest i say the court of death is open    chapter xv  the second ordeal  oros bowed and left the place whereon the hesea signed to us to stand upon her right and to atene to stand upon her left presently from either side the hooded priests and priestesses stole into the chamber and to the number of fifty or more ranged themselves along its walls then came two figures draped in black and masked who bore parchment books in their hands and placed themselves on either side of the corpse while oros stood at its feet facing the hesea  now she lifted the sistrum that she held and in obedience to the signal oros saidlet the books be opened  thereon the masked accuser to the right broke the seal of his book and began to read its pages it was a tale of the sins of this dead man entered as fully as though that officer were his own conscience given life and voice in cold and horrible detail it told of the evil doings of his childhood of his youth and of his riper years and thus massed together the record was black indeed  i listened amazed wondering what spy had been set upon the deeds of yonder man throughout his days thinking also with a shudder of how heavy would be the tale against any one of us if such a spy should companion him from the cradle to the grave remembering too that full surely this count is kept by scribes even more watchful than the ministers of hes  at length the long story drew to its close lastly it told of the murder of that noble upon the banks of the river it told of the plot against our lives for no just cause it told of our cruel hunting with the deathhounds and of its end then the accuser shut his book and cast it on the ground sayingsuch is the record o mother sum it up as thou hast been given wisdom  without speaking the hesea pointed with her sistrum to the defender who thereon broke the seal of his book and began to read  its tale spoke of all the good that the dead man had done of every noble word that he had said of every kind action of plans which he had made for the welfare of his vassals of temptations to ill that he had resisted of the true love that he had borne to the woman who became his wife of the prayers which he had made and of the offerings which he had sent to the temple of hes  making no mention of her name it told of how that wife of his had hated him of how she and the magician who had fostered and educated her and was her relative and guide had set other women to lead him astray that she might be free of him of how too they had driven him mad with a poisonous drink which took away his judgment unchained all the evil in his heart and caused him by its baneful influence to shrink unnaturally from her whose love he still desired  also it set out that the heaviest of his crimes were inspired by this wife of his who sought to befoul his name in the ears of the people whom she led him to oppress and how bitter jealousy drove him to cruel acts the last and worst of which caused him foully to violate the law of hospitality and in attempting to bring about the death of blameless guests at their hands to find his own  thus the defender read and having read closed the book and threw it on the ground sayingsuch is the record o mother sum it up as thou hast been given wisdom  then the khania who all this time had stood cold and impassive stepped forward to speak and with her her uncle the shaman simbri but before a word passed atenes lips the hesea raised her sceptre and forbade them sayingthy day of trial is not yet nor have we aught to do with thee when thou liest where he lies and the books of thy deeds are read aloud to her who sits in judgment then let thine advocate make answer for these things  so be it answered atene haughtily and fell back  now it was the turn of the highpriest oros mother he said thou hast heard balance the writings assess the truth and according to thy wisdom issue thy commands shall we hurl him who was rassen feet first into the fiery gulf that he may walk again in the paths of life or head first in token that he is dead indeed  then while all waited in a hushed expectancy the great priestess delivered her verdict  i hear i balance i assess but judge i do not who claim no such power let the spirit who sent him forth to whom he is returned again pass judgment on his spirit this dead one has sinned deeply yet has he been more deeply sinned against nor against that man can be reckoned the account of his deeds of madness cast him then to his grave feet first that his name may be whitened in the ears of those unborn and that thence he may return again at the time appointed it is spoken  now the accuser lifted the book of his accusations from the ground and advancing hurled it into the gulf in token that it was blotted out then he turned and vanished from the chamber while the advocate taking up his book gave it into the keeping of the priest oros that it might be preserved in the archives of the temple for ever this done the priests began a funeral chant and a solemn invocation to the great lord of the underworld that he would receive this spirit and acquit it there as here it had been acquitted by the hesea his minister  ere their dirge ended certain of the priests advancing with slow steps lifted the bier and carried it to the edge of the gulf then at a sign from the mother hurled it feet foremost into the fiery lake below whilst all watched to see how it struck the flame for this they held to be an omen since should the body turn over in its descent it was taken as a sign that the judgment of mortal men had been refused in the place of the immortals it did not turn it rushed downwards straight as a plummet and plunged into the fire hundreds of feet below and there for ever vanished this indeed was not strange since as we discovered afterwards the feet were weighted  in fact this solemn rite was but a formula that down to the exact words of judgment and committal had been practised here from unknown antiquity over the bodies of the priests and priestesses of the mountain and of certain of the great ones of the plain so it was in ancient egypt whence without doubt this ceremony of the trial of the dead was derived and so it continued to be in the land of hes for no priestess ever ventured to condemn the soul of one departed  the real interest of the custom apart from its solemnity and awful surroundings centred in the accurate knowledge displayed by the masked accuser and advocate of the lifedeeds of the deceased it showed that although the college of hes affected to be indifferent to the doings and politics of the people of the plain that they once ruled and over which whilst secretly awaiting an opportunity of reconquest they still claimed a spiritual authority the attitude was assumed rather than real moreover it suggested a system of espionage so piercing and extraordinary that it was difficult to believe it unaided by the habitual exercise of some gift of clairvoyance  the service if i may call it so was finished the dead man had followed the record of his sins into that lurid sea of fire and by now was but a handful of charred dust but if his book had closed ours remained open and at its strangest chapter we knew it all of us and waited our nerves thrilled with expectancy  the hesea sat brooding on her rocky throne she also knew that the hour had come presently she sighed then motioned with her sceptre and spoke a word or two dismissing the priests and priestesses who departed and were seen no more two of them remained however oros and the head priestess who was called papave a young woman of a noble countenance  listen my servants she said great things are about to happen which have to do with the coming of yonder strangers for whom i have waited these many years as is well known to you nor can i tell the issue since to me to whom power is given so freely foresight of the future is denied it well may happen therefore that this seat will soon be empty and this frame but food for the eternal fires nay grieve not grieve not for i do not die and if so the spirit shall return again  hearken papave thou art of the blood and to thee alone have i opened all the doors of wisdom if i pass now or at any time take thou the ancient power fill thou my place and in all things do as i have instructed thee that from this mountain light may shine upon the world further i command thee and thee also oros my priest that if i be summoned hence you entertain these strangers hospitably until it is possible to escort them from the land whether by the road they came or across the northern hills and deserts should the khania atene attempt to detain them against their will then raise the tribes upon her in the name of the hesea depose her from her seat conquer her land and hold it hear and obey  mother we hear and we will obey answered oros and papave as with a single voice  she waved her hand to show that this matter was finished then after long thought spoke again addressing herself to the khania  atene last night thou didst ask me a questionwhy thou dost love this man and she pointed to leo to that the answer would be easy for is he not one who might well stir passion in the breast of a woman such as thou art but thou didst say also that thine own heart and the wisdom of yonder magician thy uncle told thee that since thy soul first sprang to life thou hadst loved him and didst adjure me by the power to whom i must give my account to draw the curtain from the past and let the truth be known  woman the hour has come and i obey thy summonsnot because thou dost command but because it is my will of the beginning i can tell thee nothing who am still human and no goddess i know not why we three are wrapped in this coil of fate i know not the destinies to which we journey up the ladder of a thousand lives with grief and pain climbing the endless stair of circumstance or if i know i may not say therefore i take up the tale where my own memory gives me light  the hesea paused and we saw her frame shake as though beneath some fearful inward effort of the will look now behind you she cried throwing her arms wide  we turned and at first saw nothing save the great curtain of fire that rose from the abyss of the volcano whereof as i have told the crest was bent over by the wind like the crest of a breaking billow but presently as we watched in the depths of this red veil natures awful lampflame a picture began to form as it forms in the seers magic crystal  behold a temple set amid sands and washed by a wide palmbordered river and across its pyloned court processions of priests who pass to and fro with flaunting banners the court empties i could see the shadow of a falcons wings that fled across its sunlit floor a man clad in a priests white robe shavenheaded and barefooted enters through the southern pylon gate and walks slowly towards a painted granite shrine in which sits the image of a woman crowned with the double crown of egypt surmounted by a lotus bloom and holding in her hand the sacred sistrum now as though he heard some sound he halts and looks towards us and by the heaven above me his face is the face of leo vincey in his youth the face too of that kallikrates whose corpse we had seen in the caves of kor  look look gasped leo catching me by the arm but i only nodded my head in answer  the man walks on again and kneeling before the goddess in the shrine embraces her feet and makes his prayer to her now the gates roll open and a procession enters headed by a veiled noblelooking woman who bears offerings which she sets on the table before the shrine bending her knee to the effigy of the goddess her oblations made she turns to depart and as she goes brushes her hand against the hand of the watching priest who hesitates then follows her  when all her company have passed the gate she lingers alone in the shadow of the pylon whispering to the priest and pointing to the river and the southern land beyond he is disturbed he reasons with her till after one swift glance round she lets drop her veil bending towards him andtheir lips meet  as time flies her face is turned towards us and lo it is the face of atene and amid her dusky hair the aura is reflected in jewelled gold the symbol of her royal rank she looks at the shaven priest she laughs as though in triumph she points to the westering sun and to the river and is gone  aye and that laugh of long ago is echoed by atene at our side for she also laughs in triumph and cries aloud to the old shamantrue diviners were my heart and thou behold how i won him in the past  then like ice on fire fell the cold voice of the hesea  be silent woman and see how thou didst lose him in the past  lo the scene changes and on a couch a lovely shape lies sleeping she dreams she is afraid and over her bends and whispers in her ear a shadowy form clad with the emblems of the goddess in the shrine but now wearing upon her head the vulture cap the woman wakes from her dream and looks round and oh the face is the face of ayesha as it was seen of us when first she loosed her veil in the caves of kor  a sigh went up from us we could not speak who thus fearfully once more beheld her loveliness  again she sleeps again the awful form bends over her and whispers it points the distance opens lo on a stormy sea a boat and in the boat two wrapped in each others arms the priest and the royal woman while over them like a vengeance rawnecked and raggedpinioned hovers a following vulture such a vulture as the goddess wore for headdress  that picture fades from its burning frame leaving the vast sheet of fire empty as the noonday sky then another forms first a great smoothwalled cave carpeted with sand a cave that we remembered well then lying on the sand now no longer shaven but goldenhaired the corpse of the priest staring upwards with his glazed eyes his white skin streaked with blood and standing over him two women one holds a javelin in her hand and is naked except for her flowing hair and beautiful beautiful beyond imagining the other wrapped in a dark cloak beats the air with her hands casting up her eyes as though to call the curse of heaven upon her rivals head and those women are she into whose sleeping ear the shadow had whispered and the royal egyptian who had kissed her lover beneath the pylon gate  slowly all the figures faded it was as though the fire ate them up for first they became thin and white as ashes then vanished the hesea who had been leaning forward sank backwards in her chair as if weary with the toil of her own magic  for a while confused pictures flitted rapidly to and fro across the vast mirror of the flame such as might be reflected from an intelligence crowded with the memories of over two thousand years which it was too exhausted to separate and define  wild scenes multitudes of people great caves and in them faces amongst others our own starting up distorted and enormous to grow tiny in an instant and depart stark imaginations of forms towering and divine of things monstrous and inhuman armies marching illimitable battlefields and corpses rolled in blood and hovering over them the spirits of the slain  these pictures died as the others had died and the fire was blank again  then the hesea spoke in a voice very faint at first that by slow degrees grew stronger  is thy question answered o atene  i have seen strange sights mother mighty limnings worthy of thy magic but how know i that they are more than vapours of thine own brain cast upon yonder fire to deceive and mock us        considered in the light of subsequent revelations      vouchsafed to us by ayesha herself i am inclined to believe      that atenes shrewd surmise was accurate and that these      fearful pictures although founded on events that had      happened in the past were in the main vapours cast upon      the crater fire visions raised in our minds to deceive and      mock usl h h  listen then said the hesea in her weary voice to the interpretation of the writing and cease to trouble me with thy doubts many an age ago but shortly after i began to live this last long life of mine isis the great goddess of egypt had her holy house at behbit near the nile it is a ruin now and isis has departed from egypt though still under the power that fashioned it and her she rules the world for she is natures self of that shrine a certain man a greek kallikrates by name was chief priest chosen for her service by the favour of the goddess vowed to her eternally and to her alone by the dreadful oath that might not be broken without punishment as eternal  in the flame thou sawest that priest and here at thy side he stands reborn to fulfil his destiny and ours  there lived also a daughter of pharaohs house one amenartas who cast eyes of love upon this kallikrates and wrapping him in her spellsfor then as now she practised witcheriescaused him to break his oaths and fly with her as thou sawest written in the flame thou atene wast that amenartas  lastly there lived a certain arabian named ayesha a wise and lovely woman who in the emptiness of her heart and the sorrow of much knowledge had sought refuge in the service of the universal mother thinking there to win the true wisdom which ever fled from her that ayesha as thou sawest also the goddess visited in a dream bidding her to follow those faithless ones and work heavens vengeance on them and promising her in reward victory over death upon the earth and beauty such as had not been known in woman  she followed far she awaited them where they wandered guided by a sage named noot one who from the beginning had been appointed to her service and that of anotherthou o holly wast that manshe found the essence in which to bathe is to outlive generations faiths and empires sayingi will slay these guilty ones i will slay them presently as i am commanded  yet ayesha slew not for now their sin was her sin since she who had never loved came to desire this man she led them to the place of life purposing there to clothe him and herself with immortality and let the woman die but it was not so fated for then the goddess smote the life was ayeshas as had been sworn but in its first hour blinded with jealous rage because he shrank from her unveiled glory to the mortal woman at his side this ayesha brought him to his death and alas alas left herself undying  thus did the angry goddess work woe upon her faithless ministers giving to the priest swift doom to the priestess ayesha long remorse and misery and to the royal amenartas jealousy more bitter than life or death and the fate of unending effort to win back that love which defying heaven she had dared to steal but to be bereft thereof again  lo now the ages pass and at the time appointed to that undying ayesha who whilst awaiting his rebirth from century to century mourned his loss and did bitter penance for her sins came back the man her hearts desire then whilst all went well for her and him again the goddess smote and robbed her of her reward before her lovers living eyes sunk in utter shame and misery the beautiful became hideous the undying seemed to die  yet o kallikrates i tell thee that she died not did not ayesha swear to thee yonder in the caves of kor that she would come again for even in that awful hour this comfort kissed her soul thereafter leo vincey who art killikrates did not her spirit lead thee in thy sleep and stand with thee upon this very pinnacle which should be thy beacon light to guide thee back to her and didst thou not search these many years not knowing that she companioned thy every step and strove to guard thee in every danger till at length in the permitted hour thou earnest back to her  she paused and looked towards leo as though awaiting his reply  of the first part of the tale except from the writing on the sherd i know nothing lady he said of the rest i or rather we know that it is true yet i would ask a question and i pray thee of thy charity let thy answer be swift and short thou sayest that in the permitted hour i came back to ayesha where then is ayesha art thou ayesha and if so why is thy voice changed why art thou less in stature oh in the name of whatever god thou dost worship tell me art thou ayesha  i am ayesha she answered solemnly that very ayesha to whom thou didst pledge thyself eternally  she lies she lies broke in atene i tell thee husbandfor such with her own lips she declares thou art to methat yonder woman who says that she parted from thee young and beautiful less than twenty years ago is none other than the aged priestess who for a century at least has borne rule in these halls of hes let her deny it if she can  oros said the mother tell thou the tale of the death of that priestess of whom the khania speaks  the priest bowed and in his usual calm voice as though he were narrating some event of every day said mechanically and in a fashion that carried no conviction to my mindeighteen years ago on the fourth night of the first month of the winter in the year 2333 of the founding of the worship of hes on this mountain the priestess of whom the khania atene speaks died of old age in my presence in the hundred and eighth year of her rule three hours later we went to lift her from the throne on which she died to prepare her corpse for burial in this fire according to the ancient custom lo a miracle for she lived again the same yet very changed  thinking this a work of evil magic the priests and priestesses of the college rejected her and would have driven her from the throne thereon the mountain blazed and thundered the light from the fiery pillars died and great terror fell upon the souls of men then from the deep darkness above the altar where stands the statue of the mother of men the voice of the living goddess spoke sayingaccept ye her whom i have set to rule over you that my judgments and my purposes may be fulfilled  the voice ceased the fiery torches burnt again and we bowed the knee to the new hesea and named her mother in the ears of all that is the tale to which hundreds can bear witness  thou hearest atene said the hesea dost thou still doubt  aye answered the khania for i hold that oros also lies or if he lies not then he dreams or perchance that voice he heard was thine own now if thou art this undying woman this ayesha let proof be made of it to these two men who knew thee in the past tear away those wrappings that guard thy loveliness thus jealously let thy shape divine thy beauty incomparable shine out upon our dazzled sight surely thy lover will not forget such charms surely he will know thee and bow the knee saying this is my immortal and no other woman  then and not till then will i believe that thou art even what thou declarest thyself to be an evil spirit who bought undying life with murder and used thy demon loveliness to bewitch the souls of men  now the hesea on the throne seemed to be much troubled for she rocked herself to and fro and wrung her whitedraped hands  kallikrates she said in a voice that sounded like a moan is this thy will for if it be know that i must obey yet i pray thee command it not for the time is not yet come the promise unbreakable is not yet fulfilled i am somewhat changed kallikrates since i kissed thee on the brow and named thee mine yonder in the caves of kor  leo looked about him desperately till his eyes fell upon the mocking face of atene who criedbid her unveil my lord i swear to thee ill not be jealous  at that taunt he took fire  aye he said i bid her unveil that i may learn the best or worst who otherwise must die of this suspense howsoever changed if she be ayesha i shall know her and if she be ayesha i shall love her  bold words kallikrates answered the hesea yet from my very heart i thank thee for them those sweet words of trust and faithfulness to thou knowest not what learn now the truth for i may keep naught back from thee when i unveil it is decreed that thou must make thy choice for the last time on this earth between yonder woman my rival from the beginning and that ayesha to whom thou art sworn thou canst reject me if thou wilt and no ill shall come to thee but many a blessing as men reckon thempower and wealth and love only then thou must tear my memory from thy heart for then i leave thee to follow thy fate alone till at the last the purpose of these deeds and sufferings is made clear  be warned no light ordeal lies before thee be warned i can promise thee naught save such love as woman never gave to man love that perchancei know notmust yet remain unsatisfied upon the earth  then she turned to me and said  oh thou holly thou true friend thou guardian from of old thou next to him most beloved by me to thy clear and innocent spirit perchance wisdom may be given that is denied to us the little children whom thine arms protect counsel thou him my holly with the counsel that is given thee and i will obey thy words and his and whatever befalls will bless thee from my soul aye and should he cast me off then in the land beyond the lands in the star appointed where all earthly passions fade together will we dwell eternally in a friendship glorious thou and i alone  for thou wilt not reject thy steel forged in the furnace of pure truth and power shall not lose its temper in these small fires of temptation and become a rusted chain to bind thee to another womans breastuntil it canker to her heart and thine  ayesha i thank thee for thy words i answered simply and by them and that promise of thine i thy poor friendfor more i never thought to beam a thousandfold repaid for many sufferings this i will add that for my part i know that thou art she whom we have lost since whatever the lips that speak them those thoughts and words are ayeshas and hers alone  thus i spoke not knowing what else to say for i was filled with a great joy a calm and ineffable satisfaction which broke thus feebly from my heart for now i knew that i was dear to ayesha as i had always been dear to leo the closest of friends from whom she never would be parted what more could i desire  we fell back we spoke together whilst they watched us silently what we said i do not quite remember but the end of it was that as the hesea had done leo bade me judge and choose then into my mind there came a clear command from my own conscience or otherwhere who can say this was the command that i should bid her to unveil and let fate declare its purposes  decide said leo i cannot bear much more like that woman whoever she may be whatever happens i will not blame you horace  good i answered i have decided and stepping forward i said we have taken counsel hes and it is our will who would learn the truth and be at rest that thou shouldst unveil before us here and now  i hear and obey the priestess answered in a voice like to that of a dying woman only i beseech you both be pitiful to me spare me your mockeries add not the coals of your hate and scorn to the fires of a soul in hell for whateer i am i became it for thy sake kallikrates yet yet i also am athirst for knowledge for though i know all wisdom although i wield much power one thing remains to me to learnwhat is the worth of the love of man and if indeed it can live beyond the horrors of the grave  then rising slowly the hesea walked or rather tottered to the unroofed open space in front of the rock chamber and stood there quite near to the brink of the flaming gulf beneath  come hither papave and loose these veils she cried in a shrill thin voice  papave advanced and with a look of awe upon her handsome face began the task she was not a tall woman yet as she bent over her i noted that she seemed to tower above her mistress the hesea  the outer veils fell revealing more within these fell also and now before us stood the mummylike shape although it seemed to be of less stature of that strange being who had met us in the place of bones so it would seem that our mysterious guide and the high priestess hes were the same  look length by length the wrappings sank from her would they never end how small grew the frame within she was very short now unnaturally short for a fullgrown woman and oh i grew sick at heart the last bandages uncoiled themselves like shavings from a stick two wrinkled hands appeared if hands they could be called then the feetonce i had seen such on the mummy of a princess of egypt and even now by some fantastic play of the mind i remembered that on her coffin this princess was named the beautiful  everything was gone now except a shift and a last inner veil about the head hes waved back the priestess papave who fell half fainting to the ground and lay there covering her eyes with her hand then uttering something like a scream she gripped this veil in her thin talons tore it away and with a gesture of uttermost despair turned and faced us  oh she wasnay i will not describe her i knew her at once for thus had i seen her last before the fire of life and strangely enough through the mask of unutterable age through that cloak of humanitys last decay still shone some resemblance to the glorious and superhuman ayesha the shape of the face the air of defiant pride that for an instant bore her upi know not what  yes there she stood and the fierce light of the heartless fires beat upon her revealing every shame  there was a dreadful silence i saw leos lips turn white and his knees begin to give but by some effort he recovered himself and stayed still and upright like a dead man held by a wire also i saw ateneand this is to her creditturn her head away she had desired to see her rival humiliated but that horrible sight shocked her some sense of their common womanhood for the moment touched her pity only simbri who i think knew what to expect and oros remained quite unmoved indeed in that ghastly silence the latter spoke and ever afterwards i loved him for his words  what of the vile vessel rotted in the grave of time what of the flesh that perishes he said look through the ruined lamp to the eternal light which burns within look through its covering carrion to the inextinguishable soul  my heart applauded these noble sentiments i was of one mind with oros but oh heaven i felt that my brain was going and i wished that it would go so that i might hear and see no more  that look which gathered on ayeshas mummy face at first there had been a little hope but the hope died and anguish anguish anguish took its place  something must be done this could not endure my lips clave together no word would come my feet refused to move  i began to contemplate the scenery how wonderful were that sheet of flame and the ripples which ran up and down its height how awesome its billowy crest it would be warm lying in yonder red gulf below with the dead rassen but oh i wished that i shared his bed and had finished with these agonies  thank heaven atene was speaking she had stepped to the side of the nakedheaded thing and stood by it in all the pride of her rich beauty and perfect womanhood  leo vincey or kallikrates said atene take which name thou wilt thou thinkest ill of me perhaps but know that at least i scorn to mock a rival in her mortal shame she told us a wild tale but now a tale true or false but more false than true i think of how i robbed a goddess of a votary and of how that goddessayeshas self perchancewas avenged upon me for the crime of yielding to the man i loved well let goddessesif such indeed there betake their way and work their will upon the helpless and i a mortal will take mine until the clutch of doom closes round my throat and chokes out life and memory and i too am a goddessor a clod  meanwhile thou man i shame not to say it before all these witnesses i love thee and it seems that thisthis woman or goddessloves thee also and she has told us that now now thou must choose between us once and for ever she has told us too that if i sinned against isis whose minister be it remembered she declares herself herself she sinned yet more for she would have taken thee both from a heavenly mistress and from an earthly bride and yet snatch that guerdon of immortality which is hers today therefore if i am evil she is worse nor does the flame that burns within the casket whereof oros spoke shine so very pure and bright  choose thou then leo vincey and let there be an end i vaunt not myself thou knowest what i have been and seest what i am yet i can give thee love and happiness and mayhap children to follow after thee and with them some place and power what yonder witch can give thee thou canst guess tales of the past pictures on the flame wise maxims and honeyed words and after thou art dead once more promises perhaps of joy to come when that terrible goddess whom she serves so closely shall be appeased i have spoken yet i will add a word  o thou for whom if the heseas tale be true i did once lay down my royal rank and dare the dangers of an unsailed sea o thou whom in ages gone i would have sheltered with my frail body from the sorceries of this cold selfseeking witch o thou whom but a little while ago at my own lifes risk i drew from death in yonder river choose choose  to all this speech so moderate yet so cruel so wellreasoned and yet so false because of its glosses and omissions the huddled ayesha seemed to listen with a fierce intentness yet she made no answer not a single word not a sign even she who had said her say and scorned to plead her part  i looked at leos ashen face he leaned towards atene drawn perhaps by the passion shining in her beauteous eyes then of a sudden straightened himself shook his head and sighed the colour flamed to his brow and his eyes grew almost happy  after all he said thinking aloud rather than speaking i have to do not with unknowable pasts or with mystic futures but with the things of my own life ayesha waited for me through two thousand years atene could marry a man she hated for powers sake and then could poison him as perhaps she would poison me when i wearied her i know not what oaths i swore to amenartas if such a woman lived i remember the oaths i swore to ayesha if i shrink from her now why then my life is a lie and my belief a fraud then love will not endure the touch of age and never can survive the grave  nay remembering what ayesha was i take her as she is in faith and hope of what she shall be at least love is immortal and if it must why let it feed on memory alone till death sets free the soul  then stepping to where stood the dreadful shrivelled form leo knelt down before it and kissed her on the brow  yes he kissed the trembling horror of that wrinkled head and i think it was one of the greatest bravest acts ever done by man  thou hast chosen said atene in a cold voice and i tell thee leo vincey that the manner of thy choice makes me mourn my loss the more take now thythy bride and let me hence  but ayesha still said no word and made no sign till presently she sank upon her bony knees and began to pray aloud these were the words of her prayer as i heard them though the exact power to which it was addressed is not very easy to determine as i never discovered who or what it was that she worshipped in her hearto thou minister of the almighty will thou sharp sword in the hand of doom thou inevitable law that art named nature thou who wast crowned as isis of the egyptians but art the goddess of all climes and ages thou that leadest the man to the maid and layest the infant on his mothers breast that bringest our dust to its kindred dust that givest life to death and into the dark of death breathest the light of life again thou who causest the abundant earth to bear whose smile is spring whose laugh is the ripple of the sea whose noontide rest is drowsy summer and whose sleep is winters night hear thou the supplication of thy chosen child and minister  of old thou gavest me thine own strength with deathless days and beauty above every daughter of this star but i sinned against thee sore and for my sin i paid in endless centuries of solitude in the vileness that makes me loathsome to my lovers eyes and for its diadem of perfect power sets upon my brow this crown of naked mockery yet in thy breath the swift essence that brought me light that brought me gloom thou didst vow to me that i who cannot die should once more pluck the lost flower of my immortal loveliness from this foul slime of shame  therefore merciful mother that bore me to thee i make my prayer oh let his true love atone my sin or if it may not be then give me death the last and most blessed of thy boons    chapter xvi  the change  she ceased and there was a long long silence leo and i looked at each other in dismay we had hoped against hope that this beautiful and piteous prayer addressed apparently to the great dumb spirit of nature would be answered that meant a miracle but what of it the prolongation of the life of ayesha was a miracle though it is true that some humble reptiles are said to live as long as she had done  the transference of her spirit from the caves of kor to this temple was a miracle that is to our western minds though the dwellers in these parts of central asia would not hold it so that she should reappear with the same hideous body was a miracle but was it the same body was it not the body of the last hesea one very ancient woman is much like another and eighteen years of the working of the soul or identity within might well wear away their trivial differences and give to the borrowed form some resemblance to that which it had left  at least the figures on that mirror of the flame were a miracle nay why so a hundred clairvoyants in a hundred cities can produce or see their like in water and in crystal the difference being only one of size they were but reflections of scenes familiar to the mind of ayesha or perhaps not so much as that perhaps they were only phantasms called up in our minds by her mesmeric force  nay none of these things were true miracles since all however strange might be capable of explanation what right then had we to expect a marvel now  such thoughts as these rose in our minds as the endless minutes were born and died andnothing happened  yes at last one thing did happen the light from the sheet of flame died gradually away as the flame itself sank downwards into the abysses of the pit but about this in itself there was nothing wonderful for as we had seen with our own eyes from afar this fire varied much and indeed it was customary for it to die down at the approach of dawn which now drew very near  still that onwardcreeping darkness added to the terrors of the scene by the last rays of the lurid light we saw ayesha rise and advance some few paces to that little tongue of rock at the edge of the pit off which the body of rassen had been hurled saw her standing on it also looking like some black misshapen imp against the smoky glow which still rose from the depths beneath  leo would have gone forward to her for he believed that she was about to hurl herself to doom which indeed i thought was her design but the priest oros and the priestess papave obeying i suppose some secret command that reached them i know not how sprang to him and seizing his arms held him back then it became quite dark and through the darkness we could hear ayesha chanting a dirgelike hymn in some secret holy tongue which was unknown to us  a great flake of fire floated through the gloom rocking to and fro like some vast bird upon its pinions we had seen many such that night torn by the gale from the crest of the blazing curtain as i have described butbuthorace whispered leo through his chattering teeth that flame is coming up against the wind  perhaps the wind has changed i answered though i knew well that it had not that it blew stronger than ever from the south  nearer and nearer sailed the rocking flame two enormous wings was the shape of it with something dark between them it reached the little promontory the wings appeared to fold themselves about the dwarfed figure that stood thereonilluminating it for a moment then the light went out of them and they vanishedeverything vanished  a while passed it may have been one minute or ten when suddenly the priestess papave in obedience to some summons which we could not hear crept by me i knew that it was she because her womans garments touched me as she went another space of silence and of deep darkness during which i heard papave return breathing in short sobbing gasps like one who is very frightened  ah i thought ayesha has cast herself into the pit the tragedy is finished  then it was that the wondrous music came of course it may have been only the sound of priests chanting beyond us but i do not think so since its quality was quite different to any that i heard in the temple before or afterwards to any indeed that ever i heard upon the earth  i cannot describe it but it was awful to listen to yet most entrancing from the black smokeveiled pit where the fire had burned it welled and echoednow a single heavenly voice now a sweet chorus and now an airshaking thunder as of a hundred organs played to time  that diverse and majestic harmony seemed to include to express every human emotion and i have often thought since then that in its allembracing scope and range this the song or paean of her rebirth was symbolical of the infinite variety of ayeshas spirit yet like that spirit it had its master notes power passion suffering mystery and loveliness also there could be no doubt as to the general significance of the chant by whomsoever it was sung it was the changeful story of a mighty soul it was worship worship worship of a queen divine  like slow clouds of incense fading to the bannered roof of some high choir the bursts of unearthly melodies grew faint in the far distance of the hollow pit they wailed themselves away  look from the east a single ray of upwardspringing light  behold the dawn said the quiet voice of oros  that ray pierced the heavens above our heads a very sword of flame it sank downwards swiftly suddenly it fell not upon us for as yet the rocky walls of our chamber warded it away but on to the little promontory at its edge  oh and therea glory covered with a single garmentstood a shape celestial it seemed to be asleep since the eyes were shut or was it dead for at first that face was a face of death look the sunlight played upon her shining through the thin veil the dark eyes opened like the eyes of a wondering child the blood of life flowed up the ivory bosom into the pallid cheeks the raiment of black and curling tresses wavered in the wind the head of the jewelled snake that held them sparkled beneath her breast  was it an illusion or was this ayesha as she had been when she entered the rolling flame in the caverns of kor our knees gave way beneath us and down our arms about each others necks leo and i sank till we lay upon the ground then a voice sweeter than honey softer than the whisper of a twilight breeze among the reeds spoke near to us and these were the words it saidcome hither to me kallikrates who would pay thee back that redeeming kiss of faith and love thou gavest me but now  leo struggled to his feet like a drunken man he staggered to where ayesha stood then overcome sank before her on his knees  arise she said it is i who should kneel to thee and she stretched out her hand to raise him whispering in his ear the while  still he would not or could not rise so very slowly she bent over him and touched him with her lips upon the brow next she beckoned to me i came and would have knelt also but she suffered it not  nay she said in her rich remembered voice thou art no suitor it shall not be of lovers and worshippers henceforth as before i can find a plenty if i will or even if i will it not but where shall i find another friend like to thee o holly whom thus i greet and leaning towards me with her lips she touched me also on the browjust touched me and no more  fragrant was ayeshas breath as roses the odour of roses clung to her lovely hair her sweet body gleamed like some white seapearl a faint but palpable radiance crowned her head no sculptor ever fashioned such a marvel as the arm with which she held her veil about her no stars in heaven ever shone more purely bright than did her calm entranced eyes  yet it is true even with her lips upon me all i felt for her was a love divine into which no human passion entered once i acknowledge to my shame it was otherwise but i am an old man now and have done with such frailties moreover had not ayesha named me guardian protector friend and sworn to me that with her and leo i should ever dwell where all earthly passions fail i repeat what more could i desire  taking leo by the hand ayesha returned with him into the shelter of the rockhewn chamber and when she entered its shadows shivered a little as though with cold i rejoiced at this i remember for it seemed to show me that she still was human divine as she might appear here her priest and priestess prostrated themselves before her newborn splendour but she motioned to them to rise laying a hand upon the head of each as though in blessing i am cold she said give me my mantle and papave threw the purplebroidered garment upon her shoulders whence now it hung royally like a coronation robe  nay she went on it is not this longlost shape of mine which in his kiss my lord gave back to me that shivers in the icy wind it is my spirits self bared to the bitter breath of destiny o my love my love offended powers are not easily appeased even when they appear to pardon and though i shall no more be made a mockery in thy sight how long is given us together upon the world i know not but a little hour perchance well ere we pass otherwhere we will make it glorious drinking as deeply of the cup of joy as we have drunk of those of sorrows and of shame this place is hateful to me for here i have suffered more than ever woman did on earth or phantom in the deepest hell it is hateful it is illomened i pray that never again may i behold it  say what is it passes in thy mind magician and of a sudden she turned fiercely upon the shaman simbri who stood near his arms crossed upon his breast  only thou beautiful he answered a dim shadow of things to come i have what thou dost lack with all thy wisdom the gift of foresight and here i see a dead man lying  another word she broke in with fury born of some dark fear and thou shalt be that man fool put me not in mind that now i have strength again to rid me of the ancient foes i hate lest i should use a sword thou thrustest to my hand and her eyes that had been so calm and happy blazed upon him like fire  the old wizard felt their fearsome might and shrank from it till the wall stayed him  great one now as ever i salute thee yes now as at the first beginning whereof we know alone he stammered i had no more to say the face of that dead man was not revealed to me i saw only that some crowned khan of kaloon to be shall lie here as he whom the flame has taken lay an hour ago  doubtless many a khan of kaloon will lie here she answered coldly fear not shaman my wrath is past yet be wise mine enemy and prophesy no more evil to the great come let us hence  so still led by leo she passed from that chamber and stood presently upon the apex of the soaring pillar the sun was up now flooding the mountain flanks the plains of kaloon far beneath and the distant misty peaks with a sheen of gold ayesha stood considering the mighty prospect then addressing leo she saidthe world is very fair i give it all to thee  now atene spoke for the first time  dost thou mean hesif thou art still the hesea and not a demon arisen from the pitthat thou offerest my territories to this man as a lovegift if so i tell thee that first thou must conquer them  ungentle are thy words and mien answered ayesha yet i forgive them both for i also can scorn to mock a rival in my hour of victory when thou wast the fairer thou didst proffer him these very lands but say who is the fairer now look at us all of you and judge and she stood by atene and smiled  the khania was a lovely woman never to my knowledge have i seen one lovelier but oh how coarse and poor she showed beside the wild ethereal beauty of ayesha born again for that beauty was not altogether human far less so indeed than it had been in the caves of kor now it was the beauty of a spirit  the little light that always shone upon ayeshas brow the wideset maddening eyes which were filled sometimes with the fire of the stars and sometimes with the blue darkness of the heavens wherein they float the curved lips so wistful yet so proud the tresses fine as glossy silk that still spread and rippled as though with a separate life the general air not so much of majesty as of some secret power hard to be restrained which strove in that delicate body and proclaimed its presence to the most careless that flame of the soul within whereof oros had spoken shining now through no vile vessel but in a vase of alabaster and of pearlnone of these things and qualities were altogether human i felt it and was afraid and atene felt it also for she answeredi am but a woman what thou art thou knowest best still a taper cannot shine midst yonder fires or a glowworm against a fallen star nor can my mortal flesh compare with the glory thou hast earned from hell in payment for thy gifts and homage to the lord of ill yet as woman i am thy equal and as spirit i shall be thy mistress when robbed of these borrowed beauties thou ayesha standest naked and ashamed before the judge of all whom thou hast deserted and defied yes as thou stoodest but now upon yonder brink above the burning pit where thou yet shalt wander wailing thy lost love for this i know mine enemy that man and spirit cannot mate and atene ceased choking in her bitter rage and jealousy  now watching ayesha i saw her wince a little beneath these evilomened words saw also a tinge of grey touch the carmine of her lips and her deep eyes grow dark and troubled but in a moment her fears had gone and she was asking in a voice that rang clear as silver bellswhy ravest thou atene like some shortlived summer torrent against the barrier of a seamless cliff dost think poor creature of an hour to sweep away the rock of my eternal strength with foam and bursting bubbles have done and listen i do not seek thy petty rule who if i will it can take the empire of the world yet learn thou holdest it of my hand morei purpose soon to visit thee in thy citychoose thou if it shall be in peace or war therefore khania purge thy court and amend thy laws that when i come i may find contentment in the land which now it lacks and confirm thee in thy government my counsel to thee also is that thou choose some worthy man to husband let him be whom thou wilt if only he is just and upright and one upon whom thou mayest rest needing wise guidance as thou dost atene come now my guests let us hence and she walked past the khania stepping fearlessly upon the very edge of the windswept rounded peak  in a second the attempt had been made and failed so quickly indeed that it was not until leo and i compared our impressions afterwards that we could be sure of what had happened as ayesha passed her the maddened khania drew a hidden dagger and struck with all her force at her rivals back i saw the knife vanish to the hilt in her body as i thought but this cannot have been so since it fell to the ground and she who should have been dead took no hurt at all  feeling that she had failed with a movement like the sudden lurch of a ship atene thrust at ayesha proposing to hurl her to destruction in the depths beneath lo her outstretched arms went past her although ayesha never seemed to stir yes it was atene who would have fallen atene who already fell had not ayesha put out her hand and caught her by the wrist bearing all her backwardswaying weight as easily as though she were but an infant and without effort drawing her to safety  foolish woman she said in pitying tones wast thou so vexed that thou wouldst strip thyself of the pleasant shape which heaven has given thee surely this is madness atene for how knowest thou in what likeness thou mightest be sent to tread the earth again as no queen perhaps but as a peasants child deformed unsightly for such reward it is said is given to those that achieve selfmurder or even as many think shaped like a beasta snake a cat a tigress why see and she picked the dagger from the ground and cast it into the air that point was poisoned had it but pricked thee now and she smiled at her and shook her head  but atene could bear no more of this mockery more venomed than her own steel  thou art not mortal she wailed how can i prevail against thee to heaven i leave thy punishment and there upon the rocky peak atene sank down and wept  leo stood nearest to her and the sight of this royal woman in her misery proved too much for him to bear stepping to her side he stooped and lifted her to her feet muttering some kind words for a moment she rested on his arm then shook herself free of him and took the proffered hand of her old uncle simbri  i see said ayesha that as ever thou art courteous my lord leo but it is best that her own servant should take charge of her forshe may hide more daggers come the day grows and surely we need rest    chapter xvii  the betrothal  together we descended the multitudinous steps and passed the endless rockhewn passages till we came to the door of the dwelling of the highpriestess and were led through it into a hall beyond here ayesha parted from us saying that she was outworn as indeed she seemed to be with an utter weariness not of the body but of the spirit for her delicate form drooped like a rainladen lily her eyes grew dim as those of a person in a trance and her voice came in a soft sweet whisper the voice of one speaking in her sleep  goodbye she said to us oros will guard you both and lead you to me at the appointed time rest you well  so she went and the priest led us into a beautiful apartment that opened on to a sheltered garden so overcome were we also by all that we had endured and seen that we could scarcely speak much less discuss these marvellous events  my brain swims said leo to oros i desire to sleep  he bowed and conducted us to a chamber where were beds and on these we flung ourselves down and slept dreamlessly like little children  when we awoke it was afternoon we rose and bathed then saying that we wished to be alone went together into the garden where even at this altitude now at the end of august the air was still mild and pleasant behind a rock by a bed of campanulas and other mountain flowers and ferns was a bench near to the banks of a little stream on which we seated ourselves  what have you to say horace asked leo laying his hand upon my arm  say i answered that things have come about most marvellously that we have dreamed aright and laboured not in vain that you are the most fortunate of men and should be the most happy  he looked at me somewhat strangely and answeredyes of course she is lovely is she notbut and his voice dropped to its lowest whisper i wish horace that ayesha were a little more human even as human as she was in the caves of kor i dont think she is quite flesh and blood i felt it when she kissed meif you can call it a kissfor she barely touched my hair indeed how can she be who changed thus in an hour flesh and blood are not born of flame horace  are you sure that she was so born i asked like the visions on the fire may not that hideous shape have been but an illusion of our minds may she not be still the same ayesha whom we knew in kor not reborn but wafted hither by some mysterious agency  perhaps horace we do not knowi think that we shall never know but i admit that to me the thing is terrifying i am drawn to her by an infinite attraction her eyes set my blood on fire the touch of her hand is as that of a wand of madness laid upon my brain and yet between us there is some wall invisible still present or perhaps it is only fancy but horace i think that she is afraid of atene why in the old days the khania would have been dead and forgotten in an houryou remember ustane  perhaps she may have grown more gentle leo who like ourselves has learned hard lessons  yes he answered i hope that is so at any rate she has grown more divineonly horace what kind of a husband shall i be for that bright being if ever i get so far  why should you not get so far i asked angrily for his words jarred upon my tense nerves  i dont know he answered but on general principles do you think that such fortune will be allowed to a man also what did atene mean when she said that man and spirit cannot mateandother things  she meant that she hoped they could not i imagine and leo it is useless to trouble yourself with forebodings that are more fitted to my years than yours and probably are based on nothing be a philosopher leo you have striven by wonderful ways such as are unknown in the history of the world you have attained take the goods the gods provide youthe glory the love and the powerand let the future look to itself  before he could answer oros appeared from round the rock and bowing with more than his usual humility to leo said that the hesea desired our presence at a service in the sanctuary rejoiced at the prospect of seeing her again before he had hoped to do so leo sprang up and we accompanied him back to our apartment  here priests were waiting who somewhat against his will trimmed his hair and beard and would have done the same for me had i not refused their offices then they placed goldembroidered sandals on our feet and wrapped leo in a magnificent white robe also richly worked with gold and purple a somewhat similar robe but of less ornate design being given to me lastly a silver sceptre was thrust into his hand and into mine a plain wand this sceptre was shaped like a crook and the sight of it gave me some clue to the nature of the forthcoming ceremony  the crook of osiris i whispered to leo  look here he answered i dont want to impersonate any egyptian god or to be mixed up in their heathen idolatries in fact i wont  better go through with it i suggested probably it is only something symbolical  but leo who notwithstanding the strange circumstances connected with his life retained the religious principles in which i had educated him very strongly indeed refused to move an inch until the nature of this service was made clear to him indeed he expressed himself upon the subject with vigour to oros at first the priest seemed puzzled what to do then explained that the forthcoming ceremony was one of betrothal  on learning this leo raised no further objections asking only with some nervousness whether the khania would be present oros answered no as she had already departed to kaloon vowing war and vengeance  then we were led through long passages till finally we emerged into the gallery immediately in front of the great wooden doors of the apse at our approach these swung open and we entered it oros going first then leo then myself and following us the procession of attendant priests  as soon as our eyes became accustomed to the dazzling glare of the flaming pillars we saw that some great rite was in progress in the temple for in front of the divine statue of motherhood whiterobed and arranged in serried ranks stood the company of the priests to the number of over two hundred and behind these the company of the priestesses facing this congregation and a little in advance of the two pillars of fire that flared on either side of the shrine ayesha herself was seated in a raised chair so that she could be seen of all while to her right stood a similar chair of which i could guess the purpose  she was unveiled and gorgeously apparelled though save for the white beneath her robes were those of a queen rather than of a priestess about her radiant brow ran a narrow band of gold whence rose the head of a hooded asp cut out of a single crimson jewel beneath which in endless profusion the glorious waving hair flowed down and around hiding even the folds of her purple cloak  this cloak opening in front revealed an undertunic of white silk cut low upon her bosom and kept in place by a golden girdle a doubleheaded snake so like to that which she had worn in kor that it might have been the same her naked arms were bare of ornament and in her right hand she held the jewelled sistrum set with its gems and bells  no empress could have looked more royal and no woman was ever half so lovely for to ayeshas human beauty was added a spiritual glory her heritage alone seeing her we could see naught else the rhythmic movement of the bodies of the worshippers the rolling grandeur of their chant of welcome echoed from the mighty roof the fearful torches of living flame all these things were lost on us for there reborn enthroned her arms stretched out in gracious welcome sat that perfect and immortal woman the appointed bride of one of us the friend and lady of the other her divine presence breathing power mystery and love  on we marched between the ranks of hierophants till oros and the priests left us and we stood alone face to face with ayesha now she lifted her sceptre and the chant ceased in the midst of the following silence she rose from her seat and gliding down its steps came to where leo stood and touched him on the forehead with her sistrum crying in a loud sweet voicebehold the chosen of the hesea whereon all that audience echoed in a shout of thunderwelcome to the chosen of the hesea  then while the echoes of that glad cry yet rang round the rocky walls ayesha motioned to me to stand at her side and taking leo by the hand drew him towards her so that now he faced the whiterobed company holding him thus she began to speak in clear and silvery tones  priests and priestesses of hes servants with her of the mother of the world hear me now for the first time i appear among you as i am you who heretofore have looked but on a hooded shape not knowing its form or fashion learn now the reason that i draw my veil ye see this man whom ye believed a stranger that with his companion had wandered to our shrine i tell you that he is no stranger that of old in lives forgotten he was my lord who now comes to seek his love again say is it not so kallikrates  it is so answered leo  priests and priestesses of hes as ye know from the beginning it has been the right and custom of her who holds my place to choose one to be her lord is it not so  it is so o hes they answered  she paused a while then with a gesture of infinite sweetness turned to leo bent towards him thrice and slowly sank upon her knee  say thou ayesha said looking up at him with her wondrous eyes say before these here gathered and all those witnesses whom thou canst not see dost thou again accept me as thy affianced bride  aye lady he answered in a deep but shaken voice now and for ever  then while all watched in the midst of a great silence ayesha rose cast down her sistrum sceptre that rang upon the rocky floor and stretched out her arms towards him  leo also bent towards her and would have kissed her upon the lips but i who watched saw his face grow white as it drew near to hers while the radiance crept from her brow to his turning his bright hair to gold i saw also that this strong man trembled like a reed and seemed as though he were about to fall  i think that ayesha noted it too for ere ever their lips met she thrust him from her and again that grey mist of fear gathered on her face  in an instant it passed she had slipped from him and with her hand held his hand as though to support him thus they stood till his feet grew firm and his strength returned  oros restored the sceptre to her and lifting it she saido love and lord take thou the place prepared for thee where thou shalt sit for ever at my side for with myself i give thee more than thou canst know or than i will tell thee now mount thy throne o affianced of hes and receive the worship of thy priests  nay he answered with a start as that word fell upon his ears here and now i say it once and for all i am but a man who know nothing of strange gods their attributes and ceremonials none shall bow the knee to me and on earth ayesha i bow mine to thee alone  now at this bold speech some of those who heard it looked astonished and whispered to each other while a voice calledbeware thou chosen of the anger of the mother  again for a moment ayesha looked afraid then with a little laugh swept the thing aside sayingsurely with that i should be content for me o love thy adoration for thee the betrothal song no more  so having no choice leo mounted the throne where notwithstanding his splendid presence enhanced as it was by those glittering robes he looked ill enough at ease as indeed must any man of his faith and race happily however if some act of semiidolatrous homage had been proposed ayesha found a means to prevent its celebration and soon all such matters were forgotten both by the singers who sang and us who listened to the majestic chant that followed  of its words unfortunately we were able to understand but little both because of the volume of sound and of the secret priestly language in which it was given though its general purport could not be mistaken  the female voices began it singing very low and conveying a strange impression of time and distance now followed bursts of gladness alternating with melancholy chords suggesting sighs and tears and sorrows long endured and at the end a joyous triumphant paean thrown to and fro between the men and women singers terminating in one united chorus repeated again and again louder and yet louder till it culminated in a veritable crash of melody then of a sudden ceased  ayesha rose and waved her sceptre whereon all the company bowed thrice then turned and breaking into some sweet low chant that sounded like a lullaby marched rank after rank across the width of the sanctuary and through the carven doors which closed behind the last of them  when all had gone leaving us alone save for the priest oros and the priestess papave who remained in attendance on their mistress ayesha who sat gazing before her with dreaming empty eyes seemed to awake for she rose and saida noble chant is it not and an ancient it was the wedding song of the feast of isis and osiris at behbit in egypt and there i heard it before ever i saw the darksome caves of kor often have i observed my holly that music lingers longer than aught else in this changeful world though it is rare that the very words should remain unvaried come belovedtell me by what name shall i call thee thou art kallikrates and yet  call me leo ayesha he answered as i was christened in the only life of which i have any knowledge this kallikrates seems to have been an unlucky man and the deeds he did if in truth he was aught other than a tool in the hand of destiny have bred no good to the inheritors of his bodyor his spirit whichever it may beor to those women with whom his life was intertwined call me leo then for of kallikrates i have had enough since that night when i looked upon the last of him in kor  ah i remember she answered when thou sawest thyself lying in that narrow bed and i sang thee a song did i not of the past and of the future i can recall two lines of it the rest i have forgotten       onward never weary clad with splendour for a robe      till accomplished be our fate and the night is rushing down  yes my leo now indeed we are clad with splendour for a robe and now our fate draws near to its accomplishment then perchance will come the downrushing of the night and she sighed looked up tenderly and said see i am talking to thee in arabic hast thou forgotten it  no  then let it be our tongue for i love it best of all who lisped it at my mothers knee now leave me here alone awhile i would think also she added thoughtfully and speaking with a strange and impressive inflexion of the voice there are some to whom i must give audience  so we went all of us supposing that ayesha was about to receive a deputation of the chiefs of the mountain tribes who came to felicitate her upon her betrothal    chapter xviii  the third ordeal  an hour two hours passed while we strove to rest in our sleeping place but could not for some influence disturbed us  why does not ayesha come asked leo at length pausing in his walk up and down the room i want to see her again i cannot bear to be apart from her i feel as though she were drawing me to her  how can i tell you ask oros he is outside the door  so he went and asked him but oros only smiled and answered that the hesea had not entered her chamber so doubtless she must still remain in the sanctuary  then i am going to look for her come oros and you too horace  oros bowed but declined saying that he was bidden to bide at our door adding that we to whom all the paths were open could return to the sanctuary if we thought well  i do think well replied leo sharply will you come horace or shall i go without you  i hesitated the sanctuary was a public place it is true but ayesha had said that she desired to be alone there for awhile without more words however leo shrugged his shoulders and started  you will never find your way i said and followed him  we went down the long passages that were dimly lighted with lamps and came to the gallery here we found no lamps still we groped our way to the great wooden doors they were shut but leo pushed upon them impatiently and one of them swung open a little so that we could squeeze ourselves between them as we passed it closed noiselessly behind us  now we should have been in the sanctuary and in the full blaze of those awful columns of living fire but they were out or we had strayed elsewhere at least the darkness was intense we tried to work our way back to the doors again but could not we were lost  more something oppressed us we did not dare to speak we went on a few paces and stopped for we became aware that we were not alone indeed it seemed to me that we stood in the midst of a thronging multitude but not of men and women beings pressed about us we could feel their robes yet could not touch them we could feel their breath but it was cold the air stirred all round us as they passed to and fro passed in endless numbers it was as though we had entered a cathedral filled with the vast congregation of all the dead who once had worshipped there we grew afraidmy face was damp with fear the hair stood up upon my head we seemed to have wandered into a hall of the shades  at length light appeared far away and we saw that it emanated from the two pillars of fire which had burned on either side of the shrine that of a sudden became luminous so we were in the sanctuary and still near to the doors now those pillars were not bright they were low and lurid the rays from them scarcely reached us standing in the dense shadow  but if we could not be seen in them we still could see look yonder sat ayesha on a throne and oh she was awful in her deathlike majesty the blue light of the sunken columns played upon her and in it she sat erect with such a face and mien of pride as no human creature ever wore power seemed to flow from her yes it flowed from those wideset glittering eyes like light from jewels  she seemed a queen of death receiving homage from the dead more she was receiving homage from dead or livingi know not whichfor as i thought it a shadowy shape arose before the throne and bent the knee to her then another and another and another  as each vague being appeared and bowed its starry head she raised her sceptre in answering salutation we could hear the distant tinkle of the sistrum bells the only sound in all that place yes and see her lips move though no whisper reached us from them surely spirits were worshipping her  we gripped each other we shrank back and found the door it gave to our push now we were in the passages again and now we had reached our room  at its entrance oros was standing as we had left him he greeted us with his fixed smile taking no note of the terror written on our faces we passed him and entering the room stared at each other  what is she gasped leo an angel  yes i answered something of that sort but to myself i thought that there are doubtless many kinds of angels  and what were thosethose shadowsdoing he asked again  welcoming her after her transformation i suppose but perhaps they were not shadowsonly priests disguised and conducting some secret ceremonial  leo shrugged his shoulders but made no other answer  at length the door opened and oros entering said that the hesea commanded our presence in her chamber  so still oppressed with fear and wonderfor what we had seen was perhaps more dreadful than anything that had gone beforewe went to find ayesha seated and looking somewhat weary but otherwise unchanged with her was the priestess papave who had just unrobed her of the royal mantle which she wore in the sanctuary  ayesha beckoned leo to her taking his hand and searching his face with her eyes not without anxiety as i thought  now i turned purposing to leave them alone but she saw and said to me smilingwhy wouldst thou forsake us holly to go back to the sanctuary once more and she looked at me with meaning in her glance hast thou questions to ask of the statue of the mother yonder that thou lovest the place so much they say it speaks telling of the future to those who dare to kneel beside it uncompanioned from night till dawn yet i have often done so but to me it has never spoken though none long to learn the future more  i made no answer nor did she seem to expect any for she went on at oncenay bide here and let us have done with all sad and solemn thoughts we three will sup together as of old and for awhile forget our fears and cares and be happy as children who know not sin and death or that change which is death indeed oros await my lord without papave i will call thee later to disrobe me till then let none disturb us  the room that ayesha inhabited was not very large as we saw by the hanging lamps with which it was lighted it was plainly though richly furnished the rock walls being covered with tapestries and the tables and chairs inlaid with silver but the only token that here a woman had her home was that about it stood several bowls of flowers one of these i remember was filled with the delicate harebells i had admired dug up roots and all and set in moss  a poor place said ayesha yet better than that in which i dwelt those two thousand years awaiting thy coming leo for see beyond it is a garden wherein i sit and she sank down upon a couch by the table motioning to us to take our places opposite to her  the meal was simple for us eggs boiled hard and cold venison for her milk some little cakes of flour and mountain berries  presently leo rose and threw off his gorgeous purplebroidered robe which he still wore and cast upon a chair the crookheaded sceptre that oros had again thrust into his hand ayesha smiled as he did so sayingit would seem that thou holdest these sacred emblems in but small respect  very small he answered thou heardest my words in the sanctuary ayesha so let us make a pact thy religion i do not understand but i understand my own and not even for thy sake will i take part in what i hold to be idolatry  now i thought that she would be angered by this plain speaking but she only bowed her head and answered meeklythy will is mine leo though it will not be easy always to explain thy absence from the ceremonies in the temple yet thou hast a right to thine own faith which doubtless is mine also  how can that be he asked looking up  because all great faiths are the same changed a little to suit the needs of passing times and peoples what taught that of egypt which in a fashion we still follow here that hidden in a multitude of manifestations one power great and good rules all the universes that the holy shall inherit a life eternal and the vile eternal death that men shall be shaped and judged by their own hearts and deeds and here and hereafter drink of the cup which they have brewed that their real home is not on earth but beyond the earth where all riddles shall be answered and all sorrows cease say dost thou believe these things as i do  aye ayesha but hes or isis is thy goddess for hast thou not told us tales of thy dealings with her in the past and did we not hear thee make thy prayer to her who then is this goddess hes  know leo that she is what i named hernatures soul no divinity but the secret spirit of the world that universal motherhood whose symbol thou hast seen yonder and in whose mysteries lie hid all earthly life and knowledge  does then this merciful motherhood follow her votaries with death and evil as thou sayest she has followed thee for thy disobedience and meand anotherbecause of some unnatural vows broken long ago leo asked quietly  resting her arm upon the table ayesha looked at him with sombre eyes and answeredin that faith of thine of which thou speakest are there perchance two gods each having many ministers a god of good and a god of evil an osiris and a set  he nodded  i thought it and the god of ill is strong is he not and can put on the shape of good tell me then leo in the world that is today whereof i know so little hast thou ever heard of frail souls who for some earthly bribe have sold themselves to that evil one or to his minister and been paid their price in bitterness and anguish  all wicked folk do as much in this form or in that he answered  and if once there lived a woman who was mad with the thirst for beauty for life for wisdom and for love might she notoh might she not perchance  sell herself to the god called set or one of his angels ayesha dost thou meanand leo rose speaking in a voice that was full of fearthat thou art such a woman  and if so she asked also rising and drawing slowly near to him  if so he answered hoarsely if so i think that perhaps we had best fulfil our fates apart  ah she said with a little scream of pain as though a knife had stabbed her wouldst thou away to atene i tell thee that thou canst not leave me i have powerabove all men thou shouldst know it whom once i slew nay thou hast no memory poor creature of a breath and ii remember too well i will not hold thee dead againill hold thee living look now on my beauty leoand she bent her swaying form towards him compelling him with her glorious alluring eyesand begone if thou canst why thou drawest nearer to me man that is not the path of flight  nay i will not tempt thee with these common lures go leo if thou wilt go my love and leave me to my loneliness and my sin nowat once atene will shelter thee till spring when thou canst cross the mountains and return to thine own world again and to those things of common life which are thy joy see leo i veil myself that thou mayest not be tempted and she flung the corner of her cloak about her head then asked a sudden question through itdidst thou not but now return to the sanctuary with holly after i bade thee leave me there alone methought i saw the two of you standing by its doors  yes we came to seek thee he answered  and found more than ye sought as often chances to the boldis it not so well i willed that ye should come and see and protected you where others might have died  what didst thou there upon the throne and whose were those forms which we saw bending before thee he asked coldly  i have ruled in many shapes and lands leo perchance they were ancient companions and servitors of mine come to greet me once again and to hear my tidings or perchance they were but shadows of thy brain pictures like those upon the fire that it pleased me to summon to thy sight to try thy strength and constancy  leo vincey know now the truth that all things are illusions even that there exists no future and no past that what has been and what shall be already is eternally know that i ayesha am but a magic wraith foul when thou seest me foul fair when thou seest me fair a spiritbubble reflecting a thousand lights in the sunshine of thy smile grey as dust and gone in the shadow of thy frown think of the throned queen before whom the shadowy powers bowed and worship for that is i think of the hideous withered thing thou sawest naked on the rock and flee away for that is i or keep me lovely and adore knowing all evil centred in my spirit for that is i now leo thou hast the truth put me from thee for ever and for ever if thou wilt and be safe or clasp me clasp me to thy heart and in payment for my lips and love take my sin upon thy head nay holly be thou silent for now he must judge alone  leo turned as i thought at first to find the door but it was not so for he did but walk up and down the room awhile then he came back to where ayesha stood and spoke quite simply and in a very quiet voice such as men of his nature often assume in moments of great emotion  ayesha he said when i saw thee as thou wast aged andthou knowest howi clung to thee now when thou hast told me the secret of this unholy pact of thine when with my eyes at least i have seen thee reigning a mistress of spirits good or ill yet i cling to thee let thy sin great or littlewhateer it isbe my sin also in truth i feel its weight sink to my soul and become a part of me and although i have no vision or power of prophecy i am sure that i shall not escape its punishment well though i be innocent let me bear it for thy sake i am content  ayesha heard the cloak slipped from her head and for a moment she stood silent like one amazed then burst into a passion of sudden tears down she went before him and clinging to his garments she bowed her stately shape until her forehead touched the ground yes that proud being who was more than mortal whose nostrils but now had drunk the incense of the homage of ghosts or spirits humbled herself at this mans feet  with an exclamation of horror halfmaddened at the piteous sight leo sprang to one side then stooping lifted and led her still weeping to the couch  thou knowest not what thou hast done ayesha said at last let all thou sawest on the mountains crest or in the sanctuary be but visions of the night let that tale of an offended goddess be a parable a fable if thou wilt this at least is true that ages since i sinned for thee and against thee and another that ages since i bought beauty and life indefinite wherewith i might win thee and endow thee at a cost which few would dare that i have paid interest on the debt in mockery utter loneliness and daily pain which scarce could be endured until the bond fell due at last and must be satisfied  yes how i may not tell thee thou and thou alone stoodst between me and the full discharge of this most dreadful debtfor know that in mercy it is given to us to redeem one another  now he would have spoken but with a motion of her hand she bade him be silent and continuedsee now leo three great dangers has thy body passed of late upon its journey to my side the deathhounds the mountains and the precipice know that these were but types and ordained foreshadowings of the last threefold trial of thy soul from the pursuing passions of atene which must have undone us both thou hast escaped victorious thou hast endured the desert loneliness of the sands and snows starving for a comfort that never came even when the avalanche thundered round thee thy faith stood fast as it stood above the pit of flame while after bitter years of doubt a rushing flood of horror swallowed up thy hopes as thou didst descend the glaciers steep not knowing what lay beneath that fearful path so but now and of thine own choice for very love of me thou hast plunged headlong into an abyss that is deeper far to share its terrors with my spirit dost thou understand at last  something not all i think he answered slowly  surely thou art wrapped in a double veil of blindness she cried impatiently listen again  hadst thou yielded to natures crying and rejected me but yesterday in that foul shape i must perchance have lingered for uncounted time playing the poor part of priestess of a forgotten faith this was the first temptation the ordeal of thy fleshnay not the firstthe second for atene and her lurings were the first but thou wast loyal and in the magic of thy conquering love my beauty and my womanhood were reborn  hadst thou rejected me tonight when as i was bidden to do i showed thee that vision in the sanctuary and confessed to thee my souls black crime then hopeless and helpless unshielded by my earthly power i must have wandered on into the deep and endless night of solitude this was the third appointed test the trial of thy spirit and by thy steadfastness leo thou hast loosed the hand of destiny from about my throat now i am regenerate in theethrough thee may hope again for some true life beyond which thou shalt share and yet and yet if thou shouldst suffer as well may chance  then i suffer and theres an end broke in leo serenely save for a few things my mind is clear and there must be justice for us all at last if i have broken the bond that bound thee if i have freed thee from some threatening spiritual ill by taking a risk upon my head well i have not lived and if need be shall not die in vain so let us have done with all these problems or rather first answer thou me one ayesha how wast thou changed upon that peak  in flame i left thee leo and in flame i did return as in flame mayhap we shall both depart or perhaps the change was in the eyes of all of you who watched and not in this shape of mine i have answered seek to learn no more  one thing i do still seek to learn ayesha we were betrothed tonight when wilt thou marry me  not yet not yet she answered hurriedly her voice quivering as she spoke leo thou must put that hope from thy thoughts awhile and for some few months a year perchance be content to play the part of friend and lover  why so he asked with bitter disappointment ayesha those parts have been mine for many a day more i grow no younger and unlike thee shall soon be old also life is fleeting and sometimes i think that i near its end  speak no such evilomened words she said springing from the couch and stamping her sandalled foot upon the ground in anger born of fear yet thou sayest truth thou art unfortified against the accidents of time and chance oh horrible horrible thou mightest die again and leave me living  then give me of thy life ayesha  that would i gladly all of it couldst thou but repay me with the boon of death to come  oh ye poor mortals she went on with a sudden burst of passion ye beseech your gods for the gift of many years being ignorant that ye would sow a seed within your breasts whence ye must garner ten thousand miseries know ye not that this world is indeed the wide house of hell in whose chambers from time to time the spirit tarries a little while then weary and aghast speeds wailing to the peace that it has won  think then what it is to live on here eternally and yet be human to age in soul and see our beloved die and pass to lands whither we may not hope to follow to wait while drop by drop the curse of the long centuries falls upon our imperishable being like water slow dripping on a diamond that it cannot wear till they be born anew forgetful of us and again sink from our helpless arms into the void unknowable  think what it is to see the sins we sin the tempting look the word idle or unkindaye even the selfish thought or struggle multiplied ten thousandfold and more eternal than ourselves spring up upon the universal bosom of the earth to be the bane of a million destinies whilst the everlasting finger writes its endless count and a cold voice of justice cries in our consciencehaunted solitude oh soul unshriven behold the ripening harvest thy wanton hand did scatter and long in vain for the waters of forgetfulness  think what it is to have every earthly wisdom yet to burn unsatisfied for the deeper and forbidden draught to gather up all wealth and power and let them slip again like children weary of a painted toy to sweep the harp of fame and maddened by its jangling music to stamp it small beneath our feet to snatch at pleasures goblet and find its wine is sand and at length outworn to cast us down and pray the pitiless gods with whose stolen garment we have wrapped ourselves to take it back again and suffer us to slink naked to the grave  such is the life thou askest leo say wilt thou have it now  if it may be shared with thee he answered these woes are born of loneliness but then our perfect fellowship would turn them into joy  aye she said while it was permitted to endure so be it leo in the spring when the snows melt we will journey together to libya and there thou shalt be bathed in the fount of life that forbidden essence of which once thou didst fear to drink afterwards i will wed thee  that place is closed for ever ayesha  not to my feet and thine she answered fear not my love were this mountain heaped thereon i would blast a path through it with mine eyes and lay its secret bare oh would that thou wast as i am for then before tomorrows sun wed watch the rolling pillar thunder by and thou shouldst taste its glory  but it may not be hunger or cold can starve thee and waters drown swords can slay thee or sickness sap away thy strength had it not been for the false atene who disobeyed my words as it was foredoomed that she should do by this day we were across the mountains or had travelled northward through the frozen desert and the rivers now we must await the melting of the snows for winter is at hand and in it as thou knowest no man can live upon their heights  eight months till april before we can start and how long to cross the mountains and all the vast distances beyond and the seas and the swamps of kor why at the best ayesha two years must go by before we can even find the place and he fell to entreating her to let them be wed at once and journey afterwards  but she said nay and nay and nay it should not be till at length as though fearing his pleading or that of her own heart she rose and dismissed us  ah my holly she said to me as we three parted i promised thee and myself some few hours of rest and of the happiness of quiet and thou seest how my desire has been fulfilled those old egyptians were wont to share their feasts with one grizzly skeleton but here i counted four tonight that you both could see and they are named fear suspense foreboding and lovedenied doubtless also when these are buried others will come to haunt us and snatch the poor morsel from our lips  so hath it ever been with me whose feet misfortune dogs yet i hope on and now many a barrier lies behind us and leo thou hast been tried in the appointed triple fires and yet proved true sweet be thy slumbers o my love and sweeter still thy dreams for know my soul shall share them i vow to thee that tomorrow well be happy aye tomorrow without fail  why will she not marry me at once asked leo when we were alone in our chamber because she is afraid i answered    chapter xix  leo and the leopard  during the weeks that followed these momentous days often and often i wondered to myself whether a more truly wretched being had ever lived than the woman or the spirit whom we knew as she hes and ayesha whether in fact also or in our imagination only she had arisen from the ashes of her hideous age into the full bloom of perpetual life and beauty inconceivable  these things at least were certain ayesha had achieved the secret of an existence so enduring that for all human purposes it might be called unending within certain limitationssuch as her utter inability to foresee the futureundoubtedly also she was endued with powers that can only be described as supernatural  her rule over the strange community amongst whom she lived was absolute indeed its members regarded her as a goddess and as such she was worshipped after marvellous adventures the man who was her very life i might almost say her soul whose being was so mysteriously intertwined with hers whom she loved also with the intensest human passion of which woman can be capable had sought her out in this hidden corner of the world  more thrice he had proved his unalterable fidelity to her first by his rejection of the royal and beautiful if undisciplined atene secondly by clinging to ayesha when she seemed to be repulsive to every natural sense thirdly after that homage scene in the sanctuarythough with her unutterable perfections before his eyes this did not appear to be so wonderfulby steadfastness in the face of her terrible avowal true or false that she had won her gifts and him through some dim unholy pact with the powers of evil in the unknown fruits and consequences of which he must be involved as the price of her possession  yet ayesha was miserable even in her lightest moods it was clear to me that those skeletons at the feast of which she had spoken were her continual companions indeed when we were alone she would acknowledge it in dark hints and veiled allegories or allusions crushed though her rival the khania atene might be also she was still jealous of her  perhaps afraid would be a better word for some instinct seemed to warn ayesha that soon or late her hour would come to atene again and that then it would be her own turn to drink of the bitter waters of despair  what troubled her more a thousandfold however were her fears for leo as may well be understood to stand in his intimate relationship to this half divine and marvellous being and yet not to be allowed so much as to touch her lips did not conduce to his physical or mental wellbeing especially as he knew that the wall of separation must not be climbed for at least two years little wonder that leo lost appetite grew thin and pale and could not sleep or that he implored her continually to rescind her decree and marry him  but on this point ayesha was immovable instigated thereto by leo and i may add my own curiosity when we were alone i questioned her again as to the reasons of this selfdenying ordinance all she would tell me however was that between them rose the barrier of leos mortality and that until his physical being had been impregnated with the mysterious virtue of the vapour of life it was not wise that she should take him as a husband  i asked her why seeing that though a longlived one she was still a woman whereon her face assumed a calm but terrifying smile and she answeredart so sure my holly tell me do your women wear such jewels as that set upon my brow and she pointed to the faint but lambent light which glowed about her forehead  more she began slowly to stroke her abundant hair then her breast and body wherever her fingers passed the mystic light was born until in that darkened roomfor the dusk was gatheringshe shimmered from head to foot like the water of a phosphorescent sea a being glorious yet fearful to behold then she waved her hand and save for the gentle radiance on her brow became as she had been  art so sure my holly ayesha repeated nay shrink not that flame will not burn thee mayhap thou didst but imagine it as i have noted thou dost imagine many things for surely no woman could clothe herself in light and live nor has so much as the smell of fire passed upon my garments  then at length my patience was outworn and i grew angry  i am sure of nothing ayesha i answered except that thou wilt make us mad with all these tricks and changes say art thou a spirit then  we are all spirits she said reflectively and i perhaps more than some who can be certain  not i i answered yet i implore woman or spirit tell me one thing tell me the truth in the beginning what wast thou to leo and what was he to thee  she looked at me very solemnly and answereddoes my memory deceive me holly or is it written in the first book of the law of the hebrews which once i used to study that the sons of heaven came down to the daughters of men and found that they were fair  it is so written i answered  then holly might it not have chanced that once a daughter of heaven came down to a man of earth and loved him well might it not chance that for her great sin she this high fallen star who had befouled her immortal state for him was doomed to suffer till at length his love made divine by pain and faithful even to a memory was permitted to redeem her  now at length i saw light and sprang up eagerly but in a cold voice she added  nay holly cease to question me for there are things of which i can but speak to thee in figures and in parables not to mock and bewilder thee but because i must interpret them as thou wilt still atene thought me no mortal since she told us that man and spirit may not mate and there are matters in which i let her judgment weigh with me as without doubt now as in other lives she and that old shaman her uncle have wisdom aye and foresight so bid my lord press me no more to wed him for it gives me pain to say him nayah thou knowest not how much  moreover i will declare myself to thee old friend whatever else i be at least i am too womanly to listen to the pleadings of my best beloved and not myself be moved see i have set a curb upon desire and drawn it until my heart bleeds but if he pursues me with continual words and looks of burning love who knoweth but that i shall kindle in his flame and throw the reins of reason to the winds  oh then together we might race adown our passions steep together dare the torrent that rages at its foot and there perchance be whelmed or torn asunder nay nay another space of journeying but a little space and we reach the bridge my wisdom found and cross it safely and beyond for ever ride on at ease through the happy meadows of our love  then she was silent nor would she speak more upon the matter alsoand this was the worst of iteven now i was not sure that she told me the truth or at any rate all of it for to ayeshas mind truth seemed many coloured as are the rays of light thrown from the different faces of a cut jewel we never could be certain which shade of it she was pleased to present who whether by preference or of necessity as she herself had said spoke of such secrets in figures of speech and parables  it is a fact that to this hour i do not know whether ayesha is spirit or woman or as i suspect a blend of both i do not know the limits of her powers or if that elaborate story of the beginning of her love for leo was truewhich personally i doubtor but a fable invented by her mind and through it as she had hinted pictured on the flame for her own hidden purposes  i do not know whether when first we saw her on the mountain she was really old and hideous or did but put on that shape in our eyes in order to test her lover i do not know whether as the priest oros bore witnesswhich he may well have been bidden to doher spirit passed into the body of the dead priestess of hes or whether when she seemed to perish there so miserably her body and her soul were wafted straightway from the caves of kor to this central asian peak  i do not know why as she was so powerful she did not come to seek us instead of leaving us to seek her through so many weary years though i suggest that some superior force forbade her to do more than companion us unseen watching our every act reading our every thought until at length we reached the predestined place and hour also as will appear there were other things of which this is not the time to speak whereby i am still more tortured and perplexed  in short i know nothing except that my existence has been intertangled with one of the great mysteries of the world that the glorious being called ayesha won the secret of life from whatever power holds it in its keeping that she allegedalthough of this remember we have no actual proofsuch life was to be attained by bathing in a certain emanation vapour or essence that she was possessed by a passion not easy to understand but terrific in its force and immortal in its nature concentrated upon one other being and one alone that through this passion also some angry fate smote her again again and yet again making of her countless days a burden and leading the power and the wisdom which knew all but could foreknow nothing into abysses of anguish suspense and disappointment such asheaven be thankedwe common men and women are not called upon to plumb  for the rest should human eyes ever fall upon it each reader must form his own opinion of this history its true interpretation and significance these and the exact parts played by atene and myself in its development i hope to solve shortly though not here  well as i have said the upshot of it all was that ayesha was devoured with anxiety about leo except in this matter of marriage his every wish was satisfied and indeed forestalled thus he was never again asked to share in any of the ceremonies of the sanctuary though indeed stripped of its rites and spiritual symbols the religion of the college of hes proved pure and harmless enough it was but a diluted version of the osiris and isis worship of old egypt from which it had been inherited mixed with the central asian belief in the transmigration or reincarnation of souls and the possibility of drawing near to the ultimate godhead by holiness of thought and life  in fact the head priestess and oracle was only worshipped as a representative of the divinity while the temporal aims of the college in practice were confined to good works although it is true that they still sighed for their lost authority over the country of kaloon thus they had hospitals and during the long and severe winters when the tribes of the mountain slopes were often driven to the verge of starvation gave liberally to the destitute from their stores of food  leo liked to be with ayesha continually so we spent each evening in her company and much of the day also until she found that this inactivity told upon him who for years had been accustomed to endure every rigour of climate in the open air after this came home to heralthough she was always haunted by terror lest any accident should befall himayesha insisted upon his going out to kill the wild sheep and the ibex which lived in numbers on the mountain ridges placing him in the charge of the chiefs and huntsmen of the tribes with whom thus he became well acquainted in this exercise however i accompanied him but rarely as if used too much my arm still gave me pain  once indeed such an accident did happen i was seated in the garden with ayesha and watching her her head rested on her hand and she was looking with her wide eyes across which the swift thoughts passed like clouds over a windy sky or dreams through the mind of a sleeperlooking out vacantly towards the mountain snows seen thus her loveliness was inexpressible amazing merely to gaze upon it was an intoxication contemplating it i understood indeed that like to that of the fabled helen this gift of hers aloneand it was but one of manymust have caused infinite sorrows had she ever been permitted to display it to the world it would have driven humanity to madness the men with longings and the women with jealousy and hate  and yet in what did her surpassing beauty lie ayeshas face and form were perfect it is true but so are those of some other women not in these then did it live alone but rather i think especially while what i may call her human moods were on her in the soft mystery that dwelt upon her features and gathered and changed in her splendid eyes some such mystery may be seen however faintly on the faces of certain of the masterpieces of the greek sculptors but ayesha it clothed like an everpresent atmosphere suggesting a glory that was not of earth making her divine  as i gazed at her and wondered thus of a sudden she became terribly agitated and pointing to a shoulder of the mountain miles and miles away saidlook  i looked but saw nothing except a sheet of distant snow  blind fool canst thou not see that my lord is in danger of his life she cried nay i forgot thou hast no vision take it now from me and look again and laying her hand from which a strange numbing current seemed to flow upon my head she muttered some swift words  instantly my eyes were opened and not upon the distant mountain but in the air before me as it were i saw leo rolling over and over at grips with a great snowleopard whilst the chief and huntsmen with him ran round and round seeking an opportunity to pierce the savage brute with their spears and yet leave him unharmed  ayesha rigid with terror swayed to and fro at my side till presently the end came for i could see leo drive his long knife into the bowels of the leopard which at once grew limp separated from him and after a struggle or two in the bloodstained snow lay still then he rose laughing and pointing to his rent garments whilst one of the huntsmen came forward and began to bandage some wounds in his hands and thigh with strips of linen torn from his underrobe  the vision vanished suddenly as it had come and i felt ayesha leaning heavily upon my shoulder like any other frightened woman and heard her gaspthat danger also has passed by but how many are there to follow oh tormented heart how long canst thou endure  then her wrath flamed up against the chief and his huntsmen and she summoned messengers and sent them out at speed with a litter and ointments bidding them to bear back the lord leo and to bring his companions to her very presence  thou seest what days are mine my holly aye and have been these many years she said but those hounds shall pay me for this agony  nor would she suffer me to reason with her  four hours later leo returned limping after the litter in which instead of himself for whom it was sent lay a mountain sheep and the skin of the snowleopard that he had placed there to save the huntsmen the labour of carrying them ayesha was waiting for him in the hall of her dwelling and gliding to himi cannot say she walkedoverwhelmed him with mingled solicitude and reproaches he listened awhile then askedhow dost thou know anything of this matter the leopard skin has not yet been brought to thee  i know because i saw she answered the worst hurt was above thy knee hast thou dressed it with the salve i sent  not i he said but thou hast not left this sanctuary how didst thou see by thy magic  if thou wilt at least i saw and holly also saw thee rolling in the snow with that fierce brute while those curs ran round like scared children  i am weary of this magic interrupted leo crossly cannot a man be left alone for an hour even with a leopard of the mountain as for those brave men  at this moment oros entered and whispered something bowing low  as for those brave men i will deal with them said ayesha with bitter emphasis and covering herselffor she never appeared unveiled to the people of the mountainshe swept from the place  where has she gone horace asked leo to one of her services in the sanctuary  i dont know i answered but if so i think it will be that chiefs burial service  will it he exclaimed and instantly limped after her  a minute or two later i thought it wise to follow in the sanctuary a curious scene was in progress ayesha was seated in front of the statue before her very much frightened knelt a brawny redhaired chieftain and five of his followers who still carried their hunting spears while with folded arms and an exceedingly grim look upon his face leo who as i learned afterwards had already interfered and been silenced stood upon one side listening to what passed at a little distance behind were a dozen or more of the temple guards men armed with swords and picked for their strength and stature  ayesha in her sweetest voice was questioning the men as to how the leopard of which the skin lay before her had come to attack leo the chief answered that they had tracked the brute to its lair between two rocks that one of them had gone in and wounded it whereon it sprang upon him and struck him down that then the lord leo had engaged it while the man escaped and was also struck down after which rolling with it on the ground he stabbed and slew the animal that was all  no not all said ayesha for you forget cowards that you are that keeping yourselves in safety you left my lord to the fury of this beast good drive them out on to the mountain there to perish also at the fangs of beasts and make it known that he who gives them food or shelter dies  offering no prayer for pity or excuse the chief and his followers rose bowed and turned to go  stay a moment comrades said leo and chief give me your arm my scratch grows stiff i cannot walk fast we will finish this hunt together  what doest thou art mad asked ayesha  i know not whether i am mad he answered but i know that thou art wicked and unjust look now than these hunters none braver ever breathed that manand he pointed to the one whom the leopard had struck downtook my place and went in before me because i ordered that we should attack the creature and thus was felled as thou seest all thou mightest have seen this also then it sprang on me and the rest of these my friends ran round waiting a chance to strike which at first they could not do unless they would have killed me with it since i and the brute rolled over and over in the snow as it was one of them seized it with his bare hands look at the teeth marks on his arm so if they are to perish on the mountain i who am the man to blame perish with them  now while the hunters looked at him with fervent gratitude in their eyes ayesha thought a little then said cleverly enoughin truth my lord leo had i known all the tale well mightest thou have named me wicked and unjust but i knew only what i saw and out of their own mouths did i condemn them my servants my lord here has pleaded for you and you are forgiven more he who rushed in upon the leopard and he who seized it with his hands shall be rewarded and advanced go but i warn you if you suffer my lord to come into more danger you shall not escape so easily again  so they bowed and went still blessing leo with their eyes since death by exposure on the mountain snows was the most terrible form of punishment known to these people and one only inflicted by the direct order of hes upon murderers or other great criminals  when we had left the sanctuary and were alone again in the hall the storm that i had seen gathering upon leos face broke in earnest ayesha renewed her inquiries about his wounds and wished to call oros the physician to dress them and as he refused this offered to do so herself he begged that she would leave his wounds alone and then his great beard bristling with wrath asked her solmenly if he was a child in arms a query so absurd that i could not help laughing  then he scolded heryes he scolded ayesha wishing to know what she meant 1 by spying upon him with her magic an evil gift that he had always disliked and mistrusted 2 by condemning brave and excellent men his good friends to a death of fiendish cruelty upon such evidence or rather out of temper on no evidence at all and 3 by giving him into charge of them as though he were a little boy and telling them that they would have to answer for it if he were hurt he who in his time had killed every sort of big game known and passed through some perils and encounters  thus he beat her with his words and wonderful to say ayesha this being more than woman submitted to the chastisement meekly yet had any other man dared to address her with roughness even i doubt not that his speech and his life would have come to a swift and simultaneous end for i knew that now as of old she could slay by the mere effort of her will but she did not slay she did not even threaten only as any other loving woman might have done she began to cry yes great tears gathered in those lovely eyes of hers and rolling one by one down her face fellfor her head was bent humbly forwardlike heavy raindrops on the marble floor  at the sight of this touching evidence of her human loving heart all leos anger melted now it was he who grew penitent and prayed her pardon humbly she gave him her hand in token of forgiveness sayinglet others speak to me as they will sorry should i have been to try it but from thee leo i cannot bear harsh words oh thou art cruel cruel in what have i offended can i help it if my spirit keeps its watch upon thee as indeed though thou knewest it not it has done ever since we parted yonder in the place of life can i help it if like some mother who sees her little child at play upon a mountains edge my soul is torn with agony when i know thee in dangers that i am powerless to prevent or share what are the lives of a few halfwild huntsmen that i should let them weigh for a single breath against thy safety seeing that if i slew these others would be more careful of thee whereas if i slay them not they or their fellows may even lead thee into perils that would bring aboutthy death and she gasped with horror at the word  listen beloved said leo the life of the humblest of those men is of as much value to him as mine is to me and thou hast no more right to kill him than thou hast to kill me it is evil that because thou carest for me thou shouldst suffer thy love to draw thee into cruelty and crime if thou art afraid for me then clothe me with that immortality of thine which although i dread it somewhat holding it a thing unholy and on this earth not permitted by my faith i should still rejoice to inherit for thy dear sake knowing that then we could never more be parted or if as thou sayest this as yet thou canst not do then let us be wed and take what fortune gives us all men must die but at least before i die i shall have been happy with thee for a whileyes if only for a single hour  would that i dared ayesha answered with a little piteous motion of her hand oh urge me no more leo lest that at last i should take the risk and lead thee down a dreadful road leo hast thou never heard of the love which slays or of the poison that may lurk in a cup of joy too perfect  then as though she feared herself ayesha turned from him and fled  thus this matter ended in itself it was not a great one for leos hurts were mere scratches and the hunters instead of being killed were promoted to be members of his bodyguard yet it told us many things for instance that whenever she chose to do so ayesha had the power of perceiving all leos movements from afar and even of communicating her strength of mental vision to others although to help him in any predicament she appeared to have no power which of course accounted for the hideous and everpresent might of her anxiety  think what it would be to any one of us were we mysteriously acquainted with every open danger every risk of sickness every secret peril through which our bestbeloved must pass to see the rock trembling to its fall and they loitering beneath it to see them drink of water and know it full of foulest poison to see them embark upon a ship and be aware that it was doomed to sink but not to be able to warn them or to prevent them surely no mortal brain could endure such constant terrors since hour by hour the arrows of death flit unseen and unheard past the breasts of each of us till at length one finds its home there  what then must ayesha have suffered watching with her spirits eyes all the hairbreadth escapes of our journeyings when for instance in the beginning she saw leo at my house in cumberland about to kill himself in his madness and despair and by some mighty effort of her superhuman will wrung from whatever power it was that held her in its fearful thraldom the strength to hurl her soul across the world and thereby in his sleep reveal to him the secret of the hidingplace where he would find her  or to take one more example out of manywhen she saw him hanging by that slender thread of yaks hide from the face of the waterfall of ice and herself remained unable to save him or even to look forward for a single moment and learn whether or no he was about to meet a hideous death in which event she must live on alone until in some dim age he was born again  nor can her sorrows have ended with these more material fears since others as piercing must have haunted her imagine for instance the agonies of her jealous heart when she knew her lover to be exposed to the temptations incident to his solitary existence and more especially to those of her ancient rival atene who by ayeshas own account had once been his wife imagine also her fears lest time and human change should do their natural work on him so that by degrees the memory of her wisdom and her strength and the image of her loveliness faded from his thought and with them his desire for her company thus leaving her who had endured so long forgotten and alone at last  truly the power that limited our perceptions did so in purest mercy for were it otherwise with us our race would go mad and perish raving in its terrors  thus it would seem that ayesha great tormented soul thinking to win life and love eternal and most glorious was in truth but another blind pandora from her stolen casket of beauty and superhuman power had leapt into her bosom there to dwell unceasingly a hundred torturing demons of whose wings mere mortal kind do but feel the faroff icy shadowing  yes and that the parallel might be complete hope alone still lingered in that rifled chest    chapter xx  ayeshas alchemy  it was shortly after this incident of the snowleopard that one of these demon familiars of ayeshas her infinite ambition made its formidable appearance when we had dined with her in the evening ayeshas habit was to discuss plans for our mighty and unending future that awful inheritance which she had promised to us  here i must explain if i have not done so already that she had graciously informed me that notwithstanding my refusal in past years of such a priceless opportunity i also was to be allowed to bathe my superannuated self in the vital fires though in what guise i should emerge from them like herodotus when he treats of the mysteries of old egypt if she knew she did not think it lawful to reveal  secretly i hoped that my outward man might change for the better as the prospect of being fixed for ever in the shape of my present and somewhat unpleasing personality did not appeal to me as attractive in truth so far as i was concerned the matter had an academic rather than an actual interest such as we take in a fairy tale since i did not believe that i should ever put on this kind of immortality nor i may add now as before was i at all certain that i wished to do so  these plans of ayeshas were far reaching and indeed terrific her acquaintance with the modern world its political and social developments was still strictly limited for if she had the power to follow its growth and activities certainly it was one of which she made no use  in practice her knowledge seemed to be confined to what she had gathered during the few brief talks which took place between us upon this subject in past time at kor now her thirst for information proved insatiable although it is true that ours was scarcely up to date seeing that ever since we lost touch with the civilized peoples namely for the last fifteen years or so we had been as much buried as she was herself  still we were able to describe to her the condition of the nations and their affairs as they were at the period when we bade them farewell and more or less incorrectly to draw maps of the various countries and their boundaries over which she pondered long  the chinese were the people in whom she proved to be most interested perhaps because she was acquainted with the mongolian type and like ourselves understood a good many of their dialects also she had a motive for her studies which one night she revealed to us in the most matteroffact fashion  those who have read the first part of her history which i left in england to be published may remember that when we found her at kor she horrified us by expressing a determination to possess herself of great britain for the simple reason that we belonged to that country now however like her powers her ideas had grown for she purposed to make leo the absolute monarch of the world in vain did he assure her most earnestly that he desired no such empire she merely laughed at him and saidif i arise amidst the peoples i must rule the peoples for how can ayesha take a second place among mortal men and thou my leo rulest me yes mark the truth thou art my master therefore it is plain that thou wilt be the master of this earth aye and perchance of others which do not yet appear for of these also i know something and i think can reach them if i will though hitherto i have had no mind that way my true life has not yet begun its little space within this world has been filled with thought and care for thee in waiting till thou wast born again and during these last years of separation until thou didst return  but now a few more months and the days of preparation past endowed with energy eternal with all the wisdom of the ages and with a strength that can bend the mountains or turn the ocean from its bed and we begin to be oh how i sicken for that hour when first like twin stars new to the firmament of heaven we break in our immortal splendour upon the astonished sight of men it will please me i tell thee leo it will please me to see powers principalities and dominions marshalled by their kings and governors bow themselves before our thrones and humbly crave the liberty to do our will at least she added it will please me for a little time until we seek higher things  so she spoke while the radiance upon her brow increased and spread itself gleaming above her like a golden fan and her slumbrous eyes took fire from it till to my thought they became glowing mirrors in which i saw pomp enthroned and suppliant peoples pass  and how asked leo with something like a groanfor this vision of universal rule viewed from afar did not seem to charm himhow ayesha wilt thou bring these things about  how my leo why easily enough for many nights i have listened to the wise discourses of our holly here at least he thinks them wise who still has so much to learn and pored over his crooked maps comparing them with those that are written in my memory who of late have had no time for the study of such little matters also i have weighed and pondered your reports of the races of this world their various follies their futile struggling for wealth and small supremacies and i have determined that it would be wise and kind to weld them to one whole setting ourselves at the head of them to direct their destinies and cause wars sickness and poverty to cease so that these creatures of a little day ephemeridae was the word she used may live happy from the cradle to the grave  now were it not because of thy strange shrinking from bloodshed however politic and needfulfor my leo as yet thou art no true philosopherthis were quickly done since i can command a weapon which would crush their armouries and whelm their navies in the deep yes i whom even the lightnings and natures elemental powers must obey but thou shrinkest from the sight of death and thou believest that heaven would be displeased because i make myselfor am chosenthe instrument of heaven well so let it be for thy will is mine and therefore we will tread a gentler path  and how wilt thou persuade the kings of the earth to place their crowns upon thy head i asked astonished  by causing their peoples to offer them to us she answered suavely oh holly holly how narrow is thy mind how strained the quality of thine imagination set its poor gates ajar i pray and bethink thee when we appear among men scattering gold to satisfy their want clad in terrifying power in dazzling beauty and in immortality of days will they not cry be ye our monarchs and rule over us  perhaps i answered dubiously but where wilt thou appear  she took a map of the eastern hemisphere which i had drawn and placing her finger upon pekin saidthere is the place that shall be our home for some few centuries say three or five or seven should it take so long to shape this people to my liking and our purposes i have chosen these chinese because thou tellest me that their numbers are uncountable that they are brave subtle and patient and though now powerless because illruled and untaught able with their multitudes to flood the little western nations therefore among them we will begin our reign and for some few ages be at rest while they learn wisdom from us and thou my holly makest their armies unconquerable and givest their land good government wealth peace and a new religion  what the new religion was to be i did not ask it seemed unnecessary since i was convinced that in practice it would prove a form of ayeshaworship indeed my mind was so occupied with conjectures some of them quaint and absurd enough as to what would happen at the first appearance of ayesha in china that i forgot this subsidiary development of our future rule  and if the little western nations will not wait to be flooded suggested leo with irritation for her contemptuous tone angered him one of a prominent western nation if they combine for instance and attack thee first  ah she said with a flash of her eyes i have thought of it and for my part hope that it will chance since then thou canst not blame me if i put out my strength oh then the east that has slept so long shall awakeshall awake and upon battlefield after battlefield such as history cannot tell of thou shalt see my flaming standards sweep on to victory one by one thou shalt watch the nations fall and perish until at length i build thy throne upon the hecatombs of their countless dead and crown thee emperor of a world regenerate in blood and fire  leo whom this new gospel of regeneration seemed to appall who was in fact a hater of absolute monarchies and somewhat republican in his views and sympathies continued the argument but i took no further heed the thing was grotesque in its tremendous and fantastic absurdity ayeshas ambitions were such as no imperialminded madman could conceive  yethere came the rubi had not the slightest doubt but that she was well able to put them into practice and carry them to some marvellous and awful conclusion why not death could not touch her she had triumphed over death her beautythat cup of madness in her eyes as she named it once to meand her reckless will would compel the hosts of men to follow her her piercing intelligence would enable her to invent new weapons with which the most highlytrained army could not possibly compete indeed it might be as she said and as i for one believed with good reason it proved that she held at her command the elemental forces of nature such as those that lie hid in electricity which would give all living beings to her for a prey  ayesha was still woman enough to have worldly ambitions and the most dread circumstance about her superhuman powers was that they appeared to be unrestrained by any responsibility to god or man she was as we might well imagine a fallen angel to be if indeed as she herself once hinted and as atene and the old shaman believed this were not her true place in creation by only two things that i was able to discover could she be movedher love for leo and in a very small degree her friendship for myself  yet her devouring passion for this one man inexplicable in its endurance and intensity would i felt sure even then in the future as in the past prove to be her heel of achilles when ayesha was dipped in the waters of dominion and deathlessness this human love left her heart mortal that through it she might be rendered harmless as a child who otherwise would have devastated the universe  i was right  whilst i was still indulging myself in these reflections and hoping that ayesha would not take the trouble to read them in my mind i became aware that oros was bowing to the earth before her  thy business priest she asked sharply for when she was with leo ayesha did not like to be disturbed  hes the spies are returned  why didst thou send them out she asked indifferently what need have i of thy spies  hes thou didst command me  well their report  hes it is most grave the people of kaloon are desperate because of the drought which has caused their crops to fail so that starvation stares them in the eyes and this they lay to the charge of the strangers who came into their land and fled to thee the khania atene also is mad with rage against thee and our holy college labouring night and day she has gathered two great armies one of forty and one of twenty thousand men and the latter of these she sends against the mountain under the command of her uncle simbri the shaman in case it should be defeated she purposes to remain with the second and greater army on the plains about kaloon  tidings indeed said ayesha with a scornful laugh has her hate made this woman mad that she dares thus to match herself against me my holly it crossed thy mind but now that it was i who am mad boasting of what i have no power to perform well within six days thou shalt learnoh verily thou shalt learn and though the issue be so very small in such a fashion that thou wilt doubt no more for ever stay i will look though the effort of it wearies me for those spies may be but victims to their own fears or to the falsehoods of atene  then suddenly as was common with her when thus ayesha threw her sight afar which either from indolence or because as she said it exhausted her she did but rarely her lovely face grew rigid like that of a person in a trance the light faded from her brow and the great pupils of her eyes contracted themselves and lost their colour  in a little while five minutes perhaps she sighed like one awakening from a deep sleep passed her hand across her forehead and was as she had been though somewhat languid as though strength had left her  it is true enough she said and soon i must be stirring lest many of my people should be killed my lord wouldst thou see war nay thou shalt bide here in safety whilst i go forwardto visit atene as i promised  where thou goest i go said leo angrily his face flushing to the roots of his hair with shame  i pray thee not i pray thee not she answered yet without venturing to forbid him we will talk of it hereafter oros away send round the fire of hes to every chief three nights hence at the moonrise bid the tribes gathernay not all twenty thousand of their best will be enough the rest shall stay to guard the mountain and this sanctuary let them bring food with them for fifteen days i join them at the following dawn go  he bowed and went whereon dismissing the matter from her mind ayesha began to question me again about the chinese and their customs  it was in course of a somewhat similar conversation on the following night of which however i forget the exact details that a remark of leos led to another exhibition of ayeshas marvellous powers  leowho had been considering her plans for conquest and again combating them as best he could for they were entirely repugnant to his religious social and political viewssaid suddenly that after all they must break down since they would involve the expenditure of sums of money so vast that even ayesha herself would be unable to provide them by any known methods of taxation she looked at him and laughed a little  verily leo she said to thee yes and to holly here i must seem as some madcap girl blown to and fro by every wind of fancy and building me a palace wherein to dwell out of dew and vapours or from the substance of the sunset fires thinkest thou then that i would enter on this warone woman against all the worldand as she spoke her shape grew royal and in her awful eyes there came a look that chilled my bloodand make no preparation for its necessities why since last we spoke upon this matter foreseeing all i have considered in my mind and now thou shalt learn how without cost to those we ruleand for that reason alone shall they love us dearlyi will glut the treasuries of the empress of the earth  dost remember leo how in kor i found but a single pleasure during all those weary agesthat of forcing my mother nature one by one to yield me up her choicest secrets i who am a student of all things which are and of the forces that cause them to be born now follow me both of you and ye shall look on what mortal eyes have not yet beheld  what are we to see i asked doubtfully having a lively recollection of ayeshas powers as a chemist  that thou shalt learn or shalt not learn if it pleases thee to stay behind come leo my love my love and leave this wise philosopher first to find his riddle and next to guess it  then turning her back to me she smiled on him so sweetly that although really he was more loth to go than i leo would have followed her through a furnace door as indeed had he but known it he was about to do  so they started and i accompanied them since with ayesha it was useless to indulge in any foolish pride or to make oneself a victim to consistency also i was anxious to see her new marvel and did not care to rely for an account of it upon leos descriptive skill which at its best was never more than moderate  she took us down passages that we had not passed before to a door which she signed to leo to open he obeyed and from the cave within issued a flood of light as we guessed at once the place was her laboratory for about it stood metal flasks and various strangeshaped instruments moreover there was a furnace in it one of the best conceivable for it needed neither fuel nor stoking whose gaseous fires like those of the twisted columns in the sanctuary sprang from the womb of the volcano beneath our feet  when we entered two priests were at work there one of them stirring a cauldron with an iron rod and the other receiving its molten contents into a mould of clay they stopped to salute ayesha but she bade them to continue their task asking them if all went well  very well o hes they answered and we passed through that cave and sundry doors and passages to a little chamber cut in the rock there was no lamp or flame of fire in it and yet the place was filled with a gentle light which seemed to flow from the opposing wall  what were those priests doing i said more to break the silence than for any other reason  why waste breath upon foolish questions she replied are no metals smelted in thy country o holly now hadst thou sought to know what i am doingbut that without seeing thou wouldst not believe so doubter thou shalt see  then she pointed to and bade us don two strange garments that hung upon the wall made of a material which seemed to be half cloth and half wood and having headpieces not unlike a divers helmet  so under her directions leo helped me into mine lacing it up behind after which or so i gathered from the soundsfor no light came through the helmetshe did the same service for him  i seem very much in the dark i said presently for now there was silence again and beneath this extinguisher i felt alarmed and wished to be sure that i was not left alone  aye holly i heard ayeshas mocking voice make answer in the dark as thou wast ever the thick dark of ignorance and unbelief well now as ever also i will give thee light as she spoke i heard something roll back i suppose that it must have been a stone door  then indeed there was light yes even through the thicknesses of that prepared garment such light as seemed to blind me by it i saw that the wall opposite to us had opened and that we were all three of us on the threshold of another chamber at the end of it stood something like a little altar of hard black stone and on this altar lay a mass of substance of the size of a childs head but fashioned i suppose from fantasy to the oblong shape of a human eye  out of this eye there poured that blistering and intolerable light it was shut round by thick funnelshaped screens of a material that looked like firebrick yet it pierced them as though they were but muslin more the rays thus directed upwards struck full upon a lump of metal held in place above them by a massive framework  and what rays they were if all the cut diamonds of the world were brought together and set beneath a mighty burningglass the light flashed from them would not have been a thousandth part so brilliant they scorched my eyes and caused the skin of my face and limbs to smart yet ayesha stood there unshielded from them aye she even went down the length of the room and throwing back her veil bent over them as it seemed a woman of molten steel in whose body the bones were visible and examined the mass that was supported by the hanging cradle  it is ready and somewhat sooner than i thought she said then as though it were but a feather weight she lifted the lump in her bare hands and glided back with it to where we stood laughing and sayingtell me now o thou wellread holly if thou hast ever heard of a better alchemist than this poor priestess of a forgotten faith and she thrust the glowing substance up almost to the mask that hid my face  then i turned and ran or rather waddled for in that gear i could not run out of the chamber until the rock wall beyond stayed me and there with my back towards her thrust my helmeted head against it for i felt as though redhot bradawls had been plunged into my eyes so i stood while she laughed and mocked behind me until at length i heard the door close and the blessed darkness came like a gift from heaven  then ayesha began to loose leo from his rayproof armour if so it can be called and he in turn loosed me and there in that gentle radiance we stood blinking at each other like owls in the sunlight while the tears streamed down our faces  well art satisfied my holly she asked  satisfied with what i answered angrily for the smarting of my eyes was unbearable yes with burnings and bedevilments i am well satisfied  and i also grumbled leo who was swearing softly but continuously to himself in the other corner of the place  but ayesha only laughed oh she laughed until she seemed the goddess of all merriment come to earth laughed till she also wept then saidwhy what ingratitude is this thou my leo didst wish to see the wonders that i work and thou o holly didst come unbidden after i bade thee stay behind and now both of you are rude and angry aye and weeping like a child with a burnt finger here take this and she gave us some salve that stood upon a shelf and rub it on your eyes and the smart will pass away  so we did and the pain went from them though for hours afterwards mine remained red as blood  and what are these wonders i asked her presently if thou meanest that unbearable flame  nay i mean what is born of the flame as in thine ignorance thou dost call that mighty agent look now and she pointed to the metallic lump she had brought with her which still gleaming faintly lay upon the floor nay it has no heat thinkest thou that i would wish to burn my tender hands and so make them unsightly touch it holly  but i would not who thought to myself that ayesha might be well accustomed to the hottest fires and feared her impish mischief i looked however long and earnestly  well what is it holly  gold i said then corrected myself and added copper for the dull red glow might have been that of either metal  nay nay she answered it is gold pure gold  the ore in this place must be rich said leo incredulously for i would not speak any more  yes my leo the iron ore is rich  iron ore and he looked at her  surely she answered for from what mine do men dig out gold in such great masses iron ore beloved that by my alchemy i change to gold which soon shall serve us in our need  now leo stared and i groaned for i did not believe that it was gold and still less that she could make that metal then reading my thought with one of those sudden changes of mood that were common to her ayesha grew very angry  by natures self she cried wert thou not my friend holly the fool whom it pleases me to cherish i would bind that right hand of thine in those secret rays till the very bones within it were turned to gold nay why should i be vexed with thee who art both blind and deaf yet thou shalt be persuaded and leaving us she passed down the passages called something to the priests who were labouring in the workshop then returned to us  presently they followed her carrying on a kind of stretcher between them an ingot of iron ore that seemed to be as much as they could lift  now she said how wilt thou that i mark this mass which as thou must admit is only iron with the sign of life good and at her bidding the priests took coldchisels and hammers and roughly cut upon its surface the symbol of the looped crossthe crux ansata  it is not enough she said when they had finished holly lend me that knife of thine tomorrow i will return it to thee and of more value  so i drew my hunting knife an indianmade thing that had a handle of plated iron and gave it her  thou knowest the marks on it and she pointed to various dents and to the makers name upon the blade for though the hilt was indian work the steel was of sheffield manufacture  i nodded then she bade the priests put on the rayproof armour that we had discarded and told us to go without the chamber and lie in the darkness of the passage with our faces against the floor  this we did and remained so until a few minutes later she called us again we rose and returned into the chamber to find the priests who had removed the protecting garments gasping and rubbing the salve upon their eyes to find also that the lump of iron ore and my knife were gone next she commanded them to place the block of goldcoloured metal upon their stretcher and to bring it with them they obeyed and we noted that although those priests were both of them strong men they groaned beneath its weight  how came it said leo that thou a woman couldst carry what these men find so heavy  it is one of the properties of that force which thou callest fire she answered sweetly to make what has been exposed to it if for a little while only as light as thistledown else how could i who am so frail have borne yonder block of gold  quite so i understand now answered leo  well that was the end of it the lump of metal was hid away in a kind of rock pit with an iron cover and we returned to ayeshas apartments  so all wealth is thine as well as all power said leo presently for remembering ayeshas awful threat i scarcely dared to open my mouth  it seems so she answered wearily since centuries ago i discovered that great secret though until ye came i had put it to no use holly here after his common fashion believes that this is magic but i tell thee again that there is no magic only knowledge which i have chanced to win  of course said leo looked at in the right way that is in thy way the thing is simple i think he would have liked to add as lying but as the phrase would have involved explanations did not yet ayesha he went on hast thou thought that this discovery of thine will wreck the world  leo she answered is there then nothing that i can do which will not wreck this world for which thou hast such tender care who shouldst keep all thy carefor me  i smiled but remembering in time turned the smile into a frown at leo then fearing lest that also might anger her made my countenance as blank as possible  if so she continued well let the world be wrecked but what meanest thou oh my lord leo forgive me if i am so dull that i cannot always follow thy quick thoughti who have lived these many years alone without converse with nobler minds or even those to which mine own is equal  it pleases thee to mock me said leo in a vexed voice and that is not too brave  now ayesha turned on him fiercely and i looked towards the door but he did not shrink only folded his arms and stared her straight in the face she contemplated him a little then saidafter that great ordained reason which thou dost not know i think leo that why i love thee so madly is that thou alone art not afraid of me not like holly there who ever since i threatened to turn his bones to goldwhich indeed i was minded to do and she laughedtrembles at my footsteps and cowers beneath my softest glance  oh my lord how good thou art to me how patient with my moods and womans weaknesses and she made as though she were about to embrace him then suddenly remembering herself with a little start that somehow conveyed more than the most tragic gesture she pointed to the couch in token that he should seat himself when he had done so she drew a footstool to his feet and sank upon it looking up into his face with attentive eyes like a child who listens for a story  thy reasons leo give me thy reasons doubtless they are good and oh be sure ill weigh them well  here they are in brief he answered the world as thou knewest in thy and he stopped  thy earlier wanderings there she suggested  yesthy earlier wanderings there has set up gold as the standard of its wealth on it all civilizations are founded make it as common as it seems thou canst and these must fall to pieces credit will fail and like their savage forefathers men must once more take to barter to supply their needs as they do in kaloon today  why not she asked it would be more simple and bring them closer to the time when they were good and knew not luxury and greed  and smashed in each others heads with stone axes added leo  who now pierce each others hearts with steel or those leaden missiles of which thou hast told me oh leo when the nations are beggared and their golden god is down when the usurer and the fat merchant tremble and turn white as chalk because their hoards are but useless dross when i have made the bankrupt exchanges of the world my mock and laugh across the ruin of its richest markets why then will not true worth come to its heritage again  what of it if i do discomfort those who think more of pelf than of courage and of virtue those who as that hebrew prophet wrote lay field to field and house to house until the wretched whom they have robbed find no place left whereon to dwell what if i proved your sagest chapmen fools and gorge your greedy moneychangers with the gold that they desire until they loathe its very sight and touch what if i uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed against the ravening lusts of mammon why will not this world of yours be happier then  i do not know answered leo all that i know is that it would be a different world one shaped upon a new plan governed by untried laws and seeking other ends in so strange a place who can say what might or might not chance  that we shall learn in its season leo or rather if it be against thy wish we will not turn this hidden page since thou dost desire it that old evil the love of lucre shall still hold its mastery upon the earth let the peoples keep their yellow king ill not crown another in his place as i was mindedsuch as that living strength thou sawest burning eternally but now that power whereof i am the mistress which can give health to men or even change the character of metals and in truth if i so desire obedient to my word destroy a city or rend this mountain from its roots  but see holly is wearied with much wondering and needs his rest oh holly thou wast born a critic of things done not a doer of them i know thy tribe for even in my day the colleges of alexandria echoed with their wranglings and already the winds blew thick with the dust of their forgotten bones holly i tell thee that at times those who create and act are impatient of such petty doubts and cavillings yet fear not old friend nor take my anger ill already thy heart is gold without alloy so what need have i to gild thy bones  i thanked ayesha for her compliment and went to my bed wondering which was real her kindness or her wrath or if both were but assumed also i wondered in what way she had fallen foul of the critics of alexandria perhaps once she had published a poem or a system of philosophy and been roughly handled by them it is quite possible only if ayesha had ever written poetry i think that it would have endured like sapphos  in the morning i discovered that whatever else about her might be false ayesha was a true chemist the very greatest i suppose who ever lived for as i dressed myself those priests whom we had seen in the laboratory staggered into the room carrying between them a heavy burden that was covered with a cloth and directed by oros placed it upon the floor  what is that i asked of oros  a peaceoffering sent by the hesea he said with whom as i am told you dared to quarrel yesterday  then he withdrew the cloth and there beneath it shone that great lump of metal which in the presence of myself and leo had been marked with the symbol of life that still appeared upon its surface only now it was gold not iron gold so good and soft that i could write my name upon it with a nail my knife lay with it also and of that too the handle though not the blade had been changed from iron into gold  ayesha asked to see this afterwards and was but illpleased with the result of her experiment she pointed out to me that lines and blotches of gold ran for an inch or more down the substance of the steel which she feared that they might weaken or distemper whereas it had been her purpose that the hilt only should be altered        i proved in after days how real were ayeshas alchemy      and the knowledge which enabled her to solve the secret that      chemists have hunted for in vain and like natures self      to transmute the commonest into the most precious of the      metals at the first town that i reached on the frontiers of      india i took this knife to a jeweller a native who was as      clever as he proved dishonest and asked him to test the      handle he did so with acids and by other means and told me      that it was of very pure gold twentyfour carats i think      he said also he pointed out that this gold became gradually      merged into the steel of the blade in a way which was quite      inexplicable to him and asked me to clear up the matter of      course i could not but at his request i left the knife in      his shop to give him an opportunity of examining it further      the next day i was taken ill with one of the heartattacks      to which i have been liable of late and when i became able      to move about again a while afterwards i found that this      jeweller had gone none knew whither so had my knifel      h h  often since that time i have marvelled how ayesha performed this miracle and from what substances she gathered or compounded the lightninglike material which was her servant in the work also whether or no it had been impregnated with the immortalizing fire of life that burned in the caves of kor yet to this hour i have found no answer to the problem for it is beyond my guessing        recent discoveries would appear to suggest that this      mysterious fire of life which whatever else it may have      been was evidently a force and no true fire since it did      not burn owed its origin to the emanations from radium or      some kindred substance although in the year 1885 mr holly      would have known nothing of the properties of these      marvellous rays or emanations doubtless ayesha was familiar      with them and their enormous possibilities of which our      chemists and scientific men have at present but explored      the fringeeditor  i suppose that in preparation for her conquest of the inhabitants of this globeto which indeed it would have sufficed unaided by any other powerthe manufacture of gold from iron went on in the cave unceasingly  however this may be during the few days that we remained together ayesha never so much as spoke of it again it seemed to have served her purpose for the while or in the press of other and more urgent matters to have been forgotten or thrust from her mind still amongst others of which i have said nothing since it is necessary to select i record this strange incident and our conversations concerning it at length for the reason that it made a great impression upon me and furnishes a striking example of ayeshas dominion over the hidden forces of nature whereof we were soon to experience a more fearful instance    chapter xxi  the prophecy of atene  on the day following this strange experience of the iron that was turned to gold some great service was held in the sanctuary as we understood to consecrate the war we did not attend it but that night we ate together as usual ayesha was moody at the meal that is she varied from sullenness to laughter  know you she said that today i was an oracle and those fools of the mountain sent their medicinemen to ask of the hesea how the battle would go and which of them would be slain and which gain honour and ii could not tell them but juggled with my words so that they might take them as they would how the battle will go i know well for i shall direct it but the futureah that i cannot read better than thou canst my holly and that is ill indeed for me the past and all the present lie bathed in light reflected from that black wallthe future  then she fell to brooding and looking up at length with an air of entreaty said to leowilt thou not hear my prayer and bide where thou art for some few days or even go ahunting do so and i will stay with thee and send holly and oros to command the tribes in this petty fray  i will not answered leo trembling with indignation for this plan of hers that i should be sent out to war while he bided in safety in a temple moved him a man brave to rashness who although he disapproved of it in theory loved fighting for its own sake also to absolute rage  i say ayesha that i will not he repeated moreover that if thou leavest me here i will find my way down the mountain alone and join the battle  then come she answered and on thine own head be it nay not on thine beloved on mine on mine  after this by some strange reaction she became like a merry girl laughing more than i have ever seen her do and telling us many tales of the far far past but none that were sad or tragic it was very strange to sit and listen to her while she spoke of people one or two of them known as names in history and many others who never have been heard of that had trod this earth and with whom she was familiar over two thousand years ago yet she told us anecdotes of their loves and hates their strength or weaknesses all of them touched with some tinge of humorous satire or illustrating the comic vanity of human aims and aspirations  at length her talk took a deeper and more personal note she spoke of her searchings after truth of how aching for wisdom she had explored the religions of her day and refused them one by one of how she had preached in jerusalem and been stoned by the doctors of the law of how also she had wandered back to arabia and being rejected by her own people as a reformer had travelled on to egypt and at the court of the pharaoh of that time met a famous magician half charlatan and half seer who because she was farseeing clairvoyante we should call it instructed her in his art so well that soon she became his master and forced him to obey her  then as though she were unwilling to reveal too much suddenly ayeshas history passed from egypt to kor she spoke to leo of his arrival there a wanderer who was named kallikrates hunted by savages and accompanied by the egyptian amenartas whom she appeared to have known and hated in her own country and of how she entertained them yes she even told of a supper that the three of them had eaten together on the evening before they started to discover the place of life and of an evil prophecy that this royal amenartas had made as to the issue of their journey  aye ayesha said it was such a silent night as this and such a meal as this we ate and leo not so greatly changed save that he was beardless then and younger was at my side where thou sittest holly sat the royal amenartas a very fair woman yes even more beautiful than i before i dipped me in the essence foresighted also though not so learned as i had grown from the first we hated each other and more than ever now when she guessed how i had learned to look upon thee her lover leo for her husband thou never wast who didst flee too fast for marriage she knew also that the struggle between us which had begun of old and afar was for centuries and generations and that until the end should declare itself neither of us could harm the other who both had sinned to win thee that wast appointed by fate to be the lodestone of our souls then amenartas spoke and saidlo to my sight kallikrates the wine in thy cup is turned to blood and that knife in thy hand o daughter of yarabfor so she named medrips red blood aye and this place is a sepulchre and thou o kallikrates sleepest here nor can she thy murderess kiss back the breath of life into those cold lips of thine  so indeed it came about as was ordained added ayesha reflectively for i slew thee in yonder place of life yes in my madness i slew thee because thou wouldst not or couldst not understand the change that had come over me and shrankest from my loveliness like a blind bat from the splendour of flame hiding thy face in the tresses of her dusky hairwhy what is it now thou oros can i never be rid of thee for an hour  o hes a writing from the khania atene the priest said with his deprecating bow  break the seal and read she answered carelessly perchance she has repented of her folly and makes submission  so he read  to the hesea of the college on the mountain known as ayesha upon earth and in the household of the overworld whence she has been permitted to wander as starthathathfallen   a pretty sounding name forsooth broke in ayesha ah but atene set stars rise againeven from the underworld read on thou oros   greetings o ayesha thou who art very old hast gathered much wisdom in the passing of the centuries and with other powers that of making thyself seem fair in the eyes of men blinded by thine arts yet one thing thou lackest that i havevision of those happenings which are not yet know o ayesha that i and my uncle the great seer have searched the heavenly books to learn what is written there of the issue of this war  this is writtenfor me death whereat i rejoice for thee a spear cast by thine own hand for the land of kaloon blood and ruin bred of thee  atene  khania of kaloon   ayesha listened in silence but her lips did not tremble nor her cheek pale to oros she said proudlysay to the messenger of atene that i have received her message and ere long will answer it face to face with her in her palace of kaloon go priest and disturb me no more  when oros had departed she turned to us and saidthat tale of mine of long ago was well fitted to this hour for as amenartas prophesied of ill so does atene prophesy of ill and amenartas and atene are one well let the spear fall if fall it must and i will not flinch from it who know that i shall surely triumph at the last perhaps the khania does but think to frighten me with a cunning lie but if she has read aright then be sure beloved that it is still well with us since none can escape their destiny nor can our bond of union which was fashioned with the universe that bears us ever be undone  she paused awhile then went on with a sudden outburst of poetic thought and imagery  i tell thee leo that out of the confusions of our lives and deaths order shall yet be born behind the mask of cruelty shine mercys tender eyes and the wrongs of this rough and twisted world are but hot blinding sparks which stream from the allrighting sword of pure eternal justice the heavy lives we see and know are only links in a golden chain that shall draw us safe to the haven of our rest steep and painful steps are they whereby we climb to the alloted palace of our joy henceforth i fear no more and fight no more against that which must befall for i say we are but winged seeds blown down the gales of fate and change to the appointed garden where we shall grow filling its blest air with the immortal fragrance of our bloom  leave me now leo and sleep awhile for we ride at dawn  it was midday on the morrow when we moved down the mountainside with the army of the tribes fierce and savagelooking men the scouts were out before us then came the great body of their cavalry mounted on wiry horses while to right and left and behind the foot soldiers marched in regiments each under the command of its own chief  ayesha veiled nowfor she would not show her beauty to these wild folkrode in the midst of the horsemen on a white mare of matchless speed and shape with her went leo and myself leo on the khans black horse and i on another not unlike it though thicker built about us were a bodyguard of armed priests and a regiment of chosen soldiers among them those hunters that leo had saved from ayeshas wrath and who were now attached to his person  we were merry all of us for in the crisp air of late autumn flooded with sunlight the fears and forebodings that had haunted us in those gloomy firelit caves were forgotten moreover the tramp of thousands of armed men and the excitement of coming battle thrilled our nerves  not for many a day had i seen leo look so vigorous and happy of late he had grown somewhat thin and pale probably from causes that i have suggested but now his cheeks were red and his eyes shone bright again ayesha also seemed joyous for the moods of this strange woman were as fickle as those of natures self and varied as a landscape varies under the sunshine or the shadow now she was noon and now dark night now dawn now evening and now thoughts came and went in the blue depths of her eyes like vapours wafted across the summer sky and in the press of them her sweet face changed and shimmered as broken water shimmers beneath the beaming stars  too long she said with a little thrilling laugh have i been shut in the bowels of sombre mountains accompanied only by mutes and savages or by melancholy chanting priests and now i am glad to look upon the world again how beautiful are the snows above and the brown slopes below and the broad plains beyond that roll away to those bordering hills how glorious is the sun eternal as myself how sweet the keen air of heaven  believe me leo more than twenty centuries have gone by since i was seated on a steed and yet thou seest i have not forgot my horsemanship though this beast cannot match those arabs that i rode in the wide deserts of arabia oh i remember how at my fathers side i galloped down to war against the marauding bedouins and how with my own hand i speared their chieftain and made him cry for mercy one day i will tell thee of that father of mine for i was his darling and though we have been long apart i hold his memory dear and look forward to our meeting  see yonder is the mouth of that gorge where lived the catworshipping sorcerer who would have murdered both of you because thou leo didst throw his familiar to the fire it is strange but several of the tribes of this mountain and of the lands behind it make cats their gods or divine by means of them i think that the first rassen the general of alexander must have brought the practice here from egypt of this macedonian alexander i could tell thee much for he was almost a contemporary of mine and when i last was born the world still rang with the fame of his great deeds  it was rassen who on the mountain supplanted the primeval fireworship whereof the flaming pillars which light its sanctuary remain as monuments by that of hes or isis or rather blended the two in one doubtless among the priests in his army were some of pasht or sekket the catheaded and these brought with them their secret cult that today has dwindled down to the vulgar divinations of savage sorcerers indeed i remember dimly that it was so for i was the first hesea of this temple and journeyed hither with that same general rassen a relative of mine  now both leo and i looked at her wonderingly and i could see that she was watching us through her veil as usual however it was i whom she reproved since leo might think and do what he willed and still escape her anger  thou holly she said quickly who art ever of a cavilling and suspicious mind remembering what i said but now believest that i lie to thee  i protested that i was only reflecting upon an apparent variation between two statements  play not with words she answered in thy heart thou didst write me down a liar and i take that ill know foolish man that when i said that the macedonian alexander lived before me i meant before this present life of mine in the existence that preceded it though i outlasted him by thirty years we were born in the same summer and i knew him well for i was the oracle whom he consulted most upon his wars and to my wisdom he owed his victories afterwards we quarrelled and i left him and pushed forward with rassen from that day the bright star of alexander began to wane at this leo made a sound that resembled a whistle in a very agony of apprehension beating back the criticisms and certain recollections of the strange tale of the old abbot kouen which would rise within me i asked quicklyand dost thou ayesha remember well all that befell thee in this former life  nay not well she answered meditatively only the greater facts and those i have for the most part recovered by that study of secret things which thou callest vision or magic for instance my holly i recall that thou wast living in that life indeed i seem to see an ugly philosopher clad in a dirty robe and filled both with wine and the learning of others who disputed with alexander till he grew wroth with him and caused him to be banished or drowned i forget which  i suppose that i was not called diogenes i asked tartly suspecting perhaps not without cause that ayesha was amusing herself by fooling me  no she replied gravely i do not think that was thy name the diogenes thou speakest of was a much more famous man one of real if crabbed wisdom moreover he did not indulge in wine i am mindful of very little of that life however not of more indeed than are many of the followers of the prophet buddha whose doctrines i have studied and of whom thou holly hast spoken to me so much maybe we did not meet while it endured still i recollect that the valley of bones where i found thee my leo was the place where a great battle was fought between the firepriests with their vassals the tribes of the mountain and the army of rassen aided by the people of kaloon for between these and the mountain in old days as now there was enmity since in this present war history does but rewrite itself  so thou thyself wast our guide said leo looking at her sharply  aye leo who else though it is not wonderful that thou didst not know me beneath those deathly wrappings i was minded to wait and receive thee in the sanctuary yet when i learned that at length both of you had escaped atene and drew near i could restrain myself no more but came forth thus hideously disguised yes i was with you even at the rivers bank and though you saw me not there sheltered you from harm  leo i yearned to look upon thee and to be certain that thy heart had not changed although until the alloted time thou mightest not hear my voice or see my face who wert doomed to undergo that sore trial of thy faith of holly also i desired to learn whether his wisdom could pierce through my disguise and how near he stood to truth it was for this reason that i suffered him to see me draw the lock from the satchel on thy breast and to hear me wail over thee yonder in the resthouse well he did not guess so ill but thou thou knewest mein thy sleepknewest me as i am and not as i seemed to be yes she added softly and didst say certain sweet words which i remember well  then beneath that shroud was thine own face asked leo again for he was very curious on this point the same lovely face i see today  mayhapas thou wilt she answered coldly also it is the spirit that matters not the outward seeming though men in their blindness think otherwise perchance my face is but as thy heart fashions it or as my will presents it to the sight and fancy of its beholders but hark the scouts have touched  as ayesha spoke a sound of distant shouting was borne upon the wind and presently we saw a fringe of horsemen falling back slowly upon our foremost line it was only to report however that the skirmishers of atene were in full retreat indeed a prisoner whom they brought with them on being questioned by the priests confessed at once that the khania had no mind to meet us upon the holy mountain she proposed to give battle on the rivers farther bank having for a defence its waters which we must ford a decision that showed good military judgment  so it happened that on this day there was no fighting  all that afternoon we descended the slopes of the mountain more swiftly by far than we had climbed them after our long flight from the city of kaloon before sunset we came to our prepared camping ground a wide and sloping plain that ended at the crest of the valley of dead bones where in past days we had met our mysterious guide this however we did not reach through the secret mountain tunnel along which she had led us the shortest way by miles as ayesha told us now since it was unsuited to the passage of an army  bending to the left we circled round a number of unclimbable koppies beneath which that tunnel passed and so at length arrived upon the brow of the dark ravine where we could sleep safe from attack by night  here a tent was pitched for ayesha but as it was the only one leo and i with our guard bivouacked among some rocks at a distance of a few hundred yards when she found that this must be so ayesha was very angry and spoke bitter words to the chief who had charge of the food and baggage although he poor man knew nothing of tents  also she blamed oros who replied meekly that he had thought us captains accustomed to war and its hardships but most of all she was angry with herself who had forgotten this detail and until leo stopped her with a laugh of vexation went on to suggest that we should sleep in the tent since she had no fear of the rigours of the mountain cold  the end of it was that we supped together outside or rather leo and i supped for as there were guards around us ayesha did not even lift her veil  that evening ayesha was disturbed and ill at ease as though new fears which she could not overcome assailed her at length she seemed to conquer them by some effort of her will and announced that she was minded to sleep and thus refresh her soul the only part of her i think which ever needed rest her last words to us weresleep you also sleep sound but be not astonished my leo if i send to summon both of you during the night since in my slumbers i may find new counsels and need to speak of them to thee ere we break camp at dawn  thus we parted but ah little did we guess how and where the three of us would meet again  we were weary and soon fell fast asleep beside our campfire for knowing that the whole army guarded us we had no fear i remember watching the bright stars which shone in the immense vault above me until they paled in the pure light of the risen moon now somewhat past her full and hearing leo mutter drowsily from beneath his fur rug that ayesha was quite right and that it was pleasant to be in the open air again as he was tired of caves  after that i knew no more until i was awakened by the challenge of a sentry in the distance then after a pause a second challenge from the officer of our own guard another pause and a priest stood bowing before us the flickering light from the fire playing upon his shaven head and face which i seemed to recognize  iand he gave a name that was familiar to me but which i forgetam sent my lords by oros who commands me to say that the hesea would speak with you both and at once  now leo sat up yawning and asked what was the matter i told him whereon he said he wished that ayesha could have waited till daylight then addedwell there is no help for it come on horace and he rose to follow the messenger  the priest bowed again and saidthe commands of the hesea are that my lords should bring their weapons and their guard  what grumbled leo to protect us for a walk of a hundred yards through the heart of an army  the hesea explained the man has left her tent she is in the gorge yonder studying the line of advance  how do you know that i asked  i do not know it he replied oros told me so that is all and therefore the hesea bade my lords bring their guard for she is alone  is she mad ejaculated leo to wander about in such a place at midnight well it is like her  i too thought it was like her who did nothing that others would have done and yet i hesitated then i remembered that ayesha had said she might send for us also i was sure that if any trick had been intended we should not have been warned to bring an escort so we called the guardthere were twelve of themtook our spears and swords and started  we were challenged by both the first and second lines of sentries and i noticed that as we gave them the password the last picket who of course recognized us looked astonished still if they had doubts they did not dare to express them so we went on  now we began to descend the sides of the ravine by a very steep path with which the priest our guide seemed to be curiously familiar for he went down it as though it were the stairway of his own house  a strange place to take us to at night said leo doubtfully when we were near the bottom and the chief of the bodyguard that great redbearded hunter who had been mixed up in the matter of the snowleopard also muttered some words of remonstrance whilst i was trying to catch what he said of a sudden something white walked into the patch of moonlight at the foot of the ravine and we saw that it was the veiled figure of ayesha herself the chief saw her also and said contentedlyhes hes  look at her grumbled leo strolling about in that haunted hole as though it were hyde park and on he went at a run  the figure turned and beckoned to us to follow her as she glided forward picking her way through the skeletons which were scattered about upon the lava bed of the cleft thus she went on into the shadow of the opposing cliff that the moonlight did not reach here in the wet season a stream trickled down a path which it had cut through the rock in the course of centuries and the grit that it had brought with it was spread about the lava floor of the ravine so that many of the bones were almost completely buried in the sand  these i noticed as we stepped into the shadow were more numerous than usual just here for on all sides i saw the white crowns of skulls or the projecting ends of ribs and thigh bones doubtless i thought to myself that streamway made a road to the plain above and in some past battle the fighting around it was very fierce and the slaughter great  here ayesha had halted and was engaged in the contemplation of this boulderstrewn path as though she meditated making use of it that day now we drew near to her and the priest who guided us fell back with our guard leaving us to go forward alone since they dared not approach the hesea unbidden leo was somewhat in advance of me seven or eight yards perhaps and i heard him saywhy dost thou venture into such places at night ayesha unless indeed it is not possible for any harm to come to thee  she made no answer only turned and opened her arms wide then let them fall to her side again whilst i wondered what this signal of hers might mean from the shadows about us came a strange rustling sound  i looked and lo everywhere the skeletons were rising from their sandy beds i saw their white skulls their gleaming arm and leg bones their hollow ribs the longslain army had come to life again and look in their hands were the ghosts of spears  of course i knew at once that this was but another manifestation of ayeshas magic powers which some whim of hers had drawn us from our beds to witness yet i confess that i felt frightened even the boldest of men however free from superstition might be excused should their nerve fail them if when standing in a churchyard at midnight suddenly on every side they saw the dead arising from their graves also our surroundings were wilder and more eerie than those of any civilized buryingplace  what new devilment of thine is this cried leo in a scared and angry voice but ayesha made no answer i heard a noise behind me and looked round the skeletons were springing upon our bodyguard who for their part poor men paralysed with terror had thrown down their weapons and fallen some of them to their knees now the ghosts began to stab at them with their phantom spears and i saw that beneath the blows they rolled over the veiled figure above me pointed with her hand at leo and saidseize him but i charge you harm him not  i knew the voice it was that of atene  then too late i understood the trap into which we had fallen  treachery i began to cry and before the word was out of my lips a particularly ablebodied skeleton silenced me with a violent blow upon the head but though i could not speak my senses still stayed with me for a little i saw leo fighting furiously with a number of men who strove to pull him down so furiously indeed that his frightful efforts caused the blood to gush out of his mouth from some burst vessel in the lungs  then sight and hearing failed me and thinking that this was death i fell and remembered no more  why i was not killed outright i do not know unless in their hurry the disguised soldiers thought me already dead or perhaps that my life was to be spared also at least beyond the knock upon the head i received no injury    chapter xxii  the loosing of the powers  when i came to myself again it was daylight i saw the calm gentle face of qros bending over me as he poured some strong fluid down my throat that seemed to shoot through all my body and melt a curtain in my mind i saw also that beside him stood ayesha  speak man speak she said in a terrible voice what hast chanced here thou livest then where is my lord where hast thou hid my lord tell meor die  it was the vision that i saw when my senses left me in the snow of the avalanche fulfilled to the last detail  atene has taken him i answered  atene has taken him and thou art left alive  do not be wrath with me i answered it is no fault of mine little wonder we were deceived after thou hadst said that thou mightest summon us ere dawn  then as briefly as i could i told the story  she listened went to where our murdered guards lay with unstained spears and looked at them  well for these that they are dead she exclaimed now holly thou seest what is the fruit of mercy the men whose lives i gave my lord have failed him at his need  then she passed forward to the spot where leo was captured here lay a broken swordleosthat had been the khan rassens and two dead men both of these were clothed in some tightfitting black garments having their heads and faces whitened with chalk and upon their vests a rude imitation of a human skeleton also daubed in chalk  a trick fit to frighten fools with she said contemptuously but oh that atene should have dared to play the part of ayesha that she should have dared and she clenched her little hand see surprised and overwhelmed yet he fought well say was he hurt holly it comes upon meno tell me that i see amiss  not much i think i answered doubtfully a little blood was running from his mouth no more look there go the stains of it upon that rock  for every drop ill take a hundred lives by myself i swear it ayesha muttered with a groan then she cried in a ringing voice  back and to horse for i have deeds to do this day nay bide thou here holly we go a shorter path while the army skirts the gorge oros give him food and drink and bathe that hurt upon his head it is but a bruise for his hood and hair are thick  so while oros rubbed some stinging lotion on my scalp i ate and drank as best i could till my brain ceased to swim for the blow though heavy had not fractured the bone when i was ready they brought the horses to us and mounting them slowly we scrambled up the steep bed of the watercourse  see ayesha said pointing to tracks and hoofprints on the plain at its head there was a chariot awaiting him and harnessed to it were four swift horses atenes scheme was clever and well laid and i grown oversure and careless slept through it all  on this plain the army of the tribes that had broken camp before the dawn was already gathering fast indeed the cavalry if i may call them so were assembled there to the number of about five thousand men each of whom had a led horse ayesha summoned the chiefs and captains and addressed them servants of hes she said the stranger lord my betrothed and guest has been tricked by a false priest and falling into a cunning snare captured as a hostage it is necessary that i follow him fast before harm comesto him we move down to attack the army of the khania beyond the river when its passage is forced i pass on with the horsemen for i must sleep in the city of kaloon tonight what sayest thou oros that a second and greater army defends its walls man i know it and if there is need that army i will destroy nay stare not at me already they are as dead horsemen you accompany me  captains of the tribes you follow and woe be to that man who hangs back in the hour of battle for death and eternal shame shall be his portion but wealth and honour to those who bear them bravely yes i tell you theirs shall be the fair land of kaloon you have your orders for the passing of yonder river i with the horsemen take the central ford let the wings advance  the chiefs answered with a cheer for they were fierce men whose ancestors had loved war for generations moreover mad as seemed the enterprise they trusted in their oracle the hesea and like all hill peoples were easily fired by the promise of rich plunder  an hours steady march down the slopes brought the army to the edge of the marsh lands these as it chanced proved no obstacle to our progress for in that season of great drought they were quite dry and for the same reason the shrunken river was not so impassable a defence as i feared that it would be still because of its rocky bottom and steep opposing banks it looked formidable enough while on the crests of those banks in squadrons and companies of horse and foot were gathered the regiments of atene  while the wings of footmen deployed to right and left the cavalry halted in the marshes and let their horses fill themselves with the long grass now a little browned by frost that grew on this boggy soil and afterwards drink some water  all this time ayesha stood silent for she also had dismounted that the mare she rode and her two led horses might graze with the others indeed she spoke but once sayingthou thinkest this adventure mad my holly say art afraid  not with thee for captain i answered still that second army  shall melt before me like mist before the gale she replied in a low and thrilling voice holly i tell thee thou shalt see things such as no man upon the earth has ever seen remember my words when i loose the powers and thou followest the rent veil of ayesha through the smitten squadrons of kaloon onlywhat if atene should dare to murder him oh if she should dare  be comforted i replied wondering what she might mean by this loosing of the powers i think that she loves him too well  i bless thee for the words holly yeti know he will refuse her and then her hate for me and her jealous rage may overcome her love for him should this be so what will avail my vengeance eat and drink again hollynay i touch no food until i sit in the palace of kaloonand look well to girth and bridle for thou ridest far and on a wild errand mount thee on leos horse which is swift and sure if it dies the guards will bring thee others  i obeyed her as best i could and once more bathed my head in a pool and with the help of oros tied a rag soaked in the liniment on the bruise after which i felt sound enough indeed the mad excitement of those minutes of waiting and some foreshadowing of the terrible wonders that were about to befall made me forget my hurts  now ayesha was standing staring upwards so that although i could not see her veiled face i guessed that her eyes must be fixed on the sky above the mountain top i was certain also that she was concentrating her fearful will upon an unknown object for her whole frame quivered like a reed shaken in the wind  it was a very strange morningcold and clear yet curiously still and with a heaviness in the air such as precedes a great fall of snow although for much snow the season was yet too early once or twice too in that utter calm i thought that i felt everything shudder not the ordinary trembling of earthquake however for the shuddering seemed to be of the atmosphere quite as much as of the land it was as though all nature around us were a living creature which is very much afraid  following ayeshas earnest gaze i perceived that thick smoky clouds were gathering one by one in the clear sky above the peak and that they were edged each of them with a fiery rim watching these fantastic and ominous clouds i ventured to say to her that it looked as though the weather would changenot a very original remark but one which the circumstances suggested  aye she answered ere night the weather will be wilder even than my heart no longer shall they cry for water in kaloon mount holly mount the advance begins and unaided she sprang to the saddle of the mare that oros brought her  then in the midst of the five thousand horsemen we moved down upon the ford as we reached its brink i noted that the two divisions of tribesmen were already entering the stream half a mile to the right and left of us of what befell them i can tell nothing from observation although i learned later that they forced it after great slaughter on both sides  in front of us was gathered the main body of the khanias army massed by regiments upon the further bank while hundreds of picked men stood up to their middles in the water waiting to spear or hamstring our horses as we advanced  now uttering their wild whistling cry our leading companies dashed into the river leaving us upon the bank and soon were engaged hotly with the footmen in midstream while this fray went on oros came to ayesha told her a spy had reported that leo bound in a twowheeled carriage and accompanied by atene simbri and a guard had passed through the enemys camp at night galloping furiously towards kaloon  spare thy words i know it she answered and he fell back behind her  our squadrons gained the bank having destroyed most of the men in the water but as they set foot upon it the enemy charged them and drove them back with loss thrice they returned to the attack and thrice were repulsed in this fashion at length ayesha grew impatient  they need a leader and i will give them one she said come with me my holly and followed by the main body of the horsemen she rode a little way into the river and there waited until the shattered troops had fallen back upon us oros whispered to meit is madness the hesea will be slain  thinkest thou so i answered more like that we shall be slain a saying at which he smiled a little more than usual and shrugged his shoulders since for all his soft ways oros was a brave man also i believe that he spoke to try me knowing that his mistress would take no harm  ayesha held up her hand in which there was no weapon and waved it forwards a great cheer answered that signal to advance and in the midst of it this frail whiterobed woman spoke to her horse so that it plunged deep into the water  two minutes later and spears and arrows were flying about us so thickly that they seemed to darken the sky i saw men and horses fall to right and left but nothing touched me or the white robes that floated a yard or two ahead five minutes and we were gaining the further bank and there the worst fight began  it was fierce indeed yet never an inch did the white robes give back and where they went men would follow them or fall we were up the bank and the enemy was packed about us but through them we passed slowly like a boat through an adverse sea that buffets but cannot stay it yes further and further till at last the lines ahead grew thin as the living wedge of horsemen forced its path between themgrew thin broke and vanished  we had passed through the heart of the host and leaving the tribesmen who followed to deal with its flying fragments rode on half a mile or so and mustered many were dead and more were hurt but the command was issued that all sorewounded men should fall out and give their horses to replace those that had been killed  this was done and presently we moved on three thousand of us now not more heading for kaloon the trot grew to a canter and the canter to a gallop as we rushed forward across that endless plain till at midday or a little afterfor this route was far shorter than that taken by leo and myself in our devious flight from rassen and his deathhoundswe dimly saw the city of kaloon set upon its hill  now a halt was ordered for here was a reservoir in which was still some water whereof the horses drank while the men ate of the food they carried with them dried meat and barley meal here too more spies met us who said that the great army of atene was posted guarding the city bridges and that to attack it with our little force would mean destruction but ayesha took no heed of their words indeed she scarcely seemed to hear them only she ordered that all wearied horses should be abandoned and fresh ones mounted  forward again for hour after hour in perfect silence save for the thunder of our horses hoofs no word spoke ayesha nor did her wild escort speak only from time to time they looked over their shoulders and pointed with their red spears at the red sky behind  i looked also nor shall i forget its aspect the dreadful fireedged clouds had grown and gathered so that beneath their shadows the plain lay almost black they marched above us like an army in the heavens while from time to time vaporous points shot forward thin like swords or massed like charging horse  under them a vast stillness reigned it was as though the earth lay dead beneath their pall  kaloon lit in a lurid light grew nearer the pickets of the foe flew homeward before us shaking their javelins and their mocking laughter reached us in hollow echoes now we saw the vast array posted rank on rank with silken banners drooping in that stirless air flanked and screened by glittering regiments of horse  an embassy approached us and at the signal of ayeshas uplifted arm we halted it was headed by a lord of the court whose face i knew he pulled rein and spoke boldly  listen hes to the words of atene ere now the stranger lord thy darling is prisoner in her palace advance and we destroy thee and thy little band but if by any miracle thou shouldst conquer then he dies get thee gone to thy mountain fastness and the khania gives thee peace and thy people their lives what answer to the words of the khania  ayesha whispered to oros who called aloudthere is no answer go if ye love life for death draws near to you  so they went fast as their swift steeds would carry them but for a little while ayesha still sat lost in thought  presently she turned and through her thin veil i saw that her face was white and terrible and that the eyes in it glowed like those of a lioness at night she said to mehissing the words between her clenched teethholly prepare thyself to look into the mouth of hell i desired to spare them if i could i swear it but my heart bids me be bold to put off human pity and use all my secret might if i would see leo living holly i tell thee they are about to murder him  then she cried aloud fear nothing captains ye are but few yet with you goes the strength of ten thousand thousand now follow the hesea and whateer ye meet be not dismayed repeat it to the soldiers that fearing nothing they follow the hesea through yonder host and across the bridge and into the city of kaloon  so the chiefs rode hither and thither crying out her words and the savage tribesmen answeredaye we who followed through the water will follow across the plain onward hes for darkness swallows us  now some orders were given and the companies fell into a formation that resembled a great wedge ayesha herself being its very point and apex for though oros and i rode on either side of her spur as we would our horses heads never passed her saddle bow in front of that dark mass she shone a single spot of whiteone snowy feather on a black torrents breast  a screaming bugle noteand like giant arms from the shelter of some groves of poplar trees curved horns of cavalry shot out to surround us while the broad bosom of the opposing army shimmering with spears rolled forward as a wave rolls crowned with sunlit foam and behind it line upon line uncountable lay a surging sea of men  our end was near we were lost or so it seemed  ayesha tore off her veil and held it on high flowing from her like a pennon and lo upon her brow blazed that wide and mystic diadem of light which once only i had seen before  denser and denser grew the rushing clouds above brighter and brighter gleamed the unearthly star of light beneath louder and louder beat the sound of the falling hoofs of ten thousand horses from the mountain peak behind us went up sudden sheets of flame it spouted fire as a whale spouts foam  the scene was dreadful in front the towers of kaloon lurid in a monstrous sunset above a gloom as of an eclipse around the darkling sunburnt plain on it atenes advancing army and our rushing wedge of horsemen destined it would appear to inevitable doom  ayesha let fall her rein she tossed her arms waving the torn white veil as though it were a signal cast to heaven  instantly from the churning jaws of the unholy night above belched a blaze of answering flame that also wavered like a rent and shaken veil in the grasp of a black hand of cloud  then did ayesha roll the thunder of her might upon the children of kaloon then she called and the terror came such as men had never seen and perchance never more will see awful bursts of wind tore past us lifting the very stones and soil before them and with the wind went hail and level hissing rain made visible by the arrows of perpetual lightnings that leapt downwards from the sky and upwards from the earth  it was as she had warned me it was as though hell had broken loose upon the world yet through that hell we rushed on unharmed for always these furies passed before us no arrow flew no javelin was stained the jagged hail was a herald of our coming the levens that smote and stabbed were our sword and spear while ever the hurricane roared and screamed with a million separate voices which blended to one yell of sound hideous and indescribable  as for the hosts about us they melted and were gone  now the darkness was dense like to that of thickest night yet in the fierce flares of the lightnings i saw them run this way and that and amidst the volleying elemental voices i heard their shouts of horror and of agony i saw horses and riders roll confused upon the ground like stormdrifted leaves i saw their footmen piled in high and whirling heaps while the brands of heaven struck and struck them till they sank together and grew still  i saw the groves of trees bend shrivel up and vanish i saw the high walls of kaloon blown in and flee away while the houses within the walls took fire to go out beneath the torrents of the driving rain and again take fire i saw blackness sweep over us with great wings and when i looked lo those wide wings were flame floods of pulsing flame that flew upon the tormented air  blackness utter blackness turmoil doom dismay beneath me the labouring horse at my side the steady crest of light which sat on ayeshas brow and through the tumult a clear exultant voice that sangi promised thee wild weather now holly dost thou believe that i can loose the prisoned powers of the world  lo all was past and gone and above us shone the quiet evening sky and before us lay the empty bridge and beyond it the flaming city of kaloon but the armies of atene where were they go ask of those great cairns that hide their bones go ask it of her widowed land  yet of our wild company of horsemen not one was lost after us they galloped trembling whitelipped like men who face to face had fought and conquered death but triumphantah triumphant  on the high head of the bridge ayesha wheeled her horse and so for one proud moment stood to welcome them at the sight of her glorious starcrowned countenance which now her tribes beheld for the first time and the last there went up such a shout as men have seldom heard  the goddess that shout thundered worship the goddess  then she turned her horses head again and they followed on through the long straight street of the burning city up to the palace on its crest  as the sun set we sped beneath its gateway silence in the courtyard silence everywhere save for the distant roar of fire and the scared howlings of the deathhounds in their kennel  ayesha sprang from her horse and waving back all save oros and myself swept through the open doors into the halls beyond  they were empty every oneall were fled or dead yet she never paused or doubted but so swiftly that we scarce could follow her flitted up the wide stone stair that led to the topmost tower up still up until we reached the chamber where had dwelt simbri the shaman that same chamber whence he was wont to watch his stars in which atene had threatened us with death  its door was shut and barred still at ayeshas coming yes before the mere breath of her presence the iron bolts snapped like twigs the locks flew back and inward burst that massive portal  now we were within the lamplit chamber and this is what we saw seated in a chair palefaced bound yet proud and defiantlooking was leo over him a dagger in his withered handyes about to strike in the very actstood the old shaman and on the floor hard by gazing upward with wideset eyes dead and still majestic in her death lay atene khania of kaloon  ayesha waved her arm and the knife fell from simbris hand clattering on the marble while in an instant he who had held it was smitten to stillness and became like a man turned to stone  she stooped lifted the dagger and with a swift stroke severed leos bonds then as though overcome at last sank on to a bench in silence leo rose looking about him bewildered and said in the strained voice of one who is weak with much sufferingbut just in time ayesha another second and that murderous dogand he pointed to the shamanwell it was in time but how went the battle and how earnest thou here through that awful hurricane and oh horace thank heaven they did not kill you after all  the battle went ill for some ayesha answered and i came not through the hurricane but on its wings tell me now what has befallen thee since we parted  trapped overpowered bound brought here told that i must write to thee and stop thy advance or dierefused of course and then and he glanced at the dead body on the floor  and then repeated ayesha  then that fearful tempest which seemed to drive me mad oh if thou couldst have heard the wind howling round these battlements tearing off their stones as though they were dry leaves if thou hadst seen the lightnings falling thick and fast as rain  they were my messengers i sent them to save thee said ayesha simply  leo stared at her making no comment but after a pause as though he were thinking the matter over he went onatene said as much but i did not believe her i thought the end of the world had come that was all well she returned just now more mad even than i was and told me that her people were destroyed and that she could not fight against the strength of hell but that she could send me thither and took a knife to kill me  i said kill on for i knew that wherever i went thou wouldst follow and i was sick with the loss of blood from some hurt i had in that struggle and weary of it all so i shut my eyes waiting for the stroke but instead i felt her lips pressed upon my forehead and heard her saynay i will not do it fare thee well fulfil thou thine own destiny as i fulfil mine for this cast the dice have fallen against me elsewhere it may be otherwise i go to load them if i may  i opened my eyes and looked there atene stood a glass in her handsee it lies beside her  defeated yet i win she cried for i do but pass before thee to prepare the path that thou shalt tread and to make ready thy place in the underworld till we meet again i pledge thee for i am destroyed ayeshas horsemen are in my streets and clothed in lightnings at their head rides ayeshas avenging self  so she drank and fell deadbut now look her breast still quivers afterwards that old man would have murdered me for being roped i could not resist him but the door burst in and thou camest spare him he is of her blood and he loved her  then leo sank back into the chair where we had discovered him bound and seemed to fall into a kind of torpor for of a sudden he grew to look like an old man  thou art sick said ayesha anxiously oros thy medicine the draught i bade thee bring be swift i say  the priest bowed and from some pocket in his ample robe produced a phial which he opened and gave to leo sayingdrink my lord this stuff will give thee back thy health for it is strong  the stronger the better answered leo rousing himself and with something like his old cheerful laugh i am thirsty who have touched nothing since last night and have fought hard and been carried far yesand lived through that hellish storm  then he took the draught and emptied it there must have been virtue in that potion at least the change which it produced in him was wonderful within a minute his eyes grew bright again and the colour returned into his cheeks  thy medicines are very good as i have learned of old he said to ayesha but the best of all of them is to see thee safe and victorious before me and to know that i who looked for death yet live to greet thee my beloved there is food and he pointed to a board upon which were meats say may i eat of them for i starve  aye she answered softly eat and my holly eat thou also  so we fell to yes we fell to and ate even in the presence of that dead woman who looked so royal in her death of the old magician who stood there powerless like a man petrified and of ayesha the wondrous being that could destroy an army with the fearful weapons which were servant to her will  only oros ate nothing but remained where he was smiling at us benignantly nor did ayesha touch any food    chapter xxiii  the yielding of ayesha  when i had satisfied myself leo was still at his meal for loss of blood or the effects of the tremendous nerve tonic which ayesha ordered to be administered to him had made him ravenous  i watched his face and became aware of a curious change in it no immediate change indeed but one i think that had come upon him gradually although i only fully appreciated it now after our short separation in addition to the thinness of which i have spoken his handsome countenance had grown more ethereal his eyes were full of the shadows of things that were to come  his aspect pained me i knew not why it was no longer that of the leo with whom i was familiar the deepchested mightylimbed jovial upright traveller hunter and fightingman who had chanced to love and be loved of a spiritual power incarnated in a mould of perfect womanhood and armed with all the might of natures self these things were still present indeed but the man was changed and i felt sure that this change came from ayesha since the look upon his face had become exceeding like to that which often hovered upon hers at rest  she also was watching him with speculative dreamy eyes till presently as some thought swept through her i saw those eyes blaze up and the red blood pour to cheek and brow yes the mighty ayesha whose dead slain for him lay strewn by the thousand on yonder plain blushed and trembled like a maiden at her first lovers kiss  leo rose from the table i would that i had been with thee in the fray he said  at the drift there was fighting she answered afterwards none my ministers of fire earth and air smote no more i waked them from their sleep and at my command they smote for thee and saved thee  many lives to take for one mans safety leo said solemnly as though the thought pained him  had they been millions and not thousands i would have spent them every one on my head be their deaths not on thine or rather on hers and she pointed to the dead atene yes on hers who made this war at least she should thank me who have sent so royal a host to guard her through the darkness  yet it is terrible said leo to think of thee beloved red to the hair with slaughter  what reck i she answered with a splendid pride let their blood suffice to wash the stain of thy blood from off these cruel hands that once did murder thee  who am i that i should blame thee leo went on as though arguing with himself i who but yesterday killed two mento save myself from treachery  speak not of it she exclaimed in cold rage i saw the place and holly thou knowest how i swore that a hundred lives should pay for every drop of that dear blood of thine and i who lie not have kept the oath look now on that man who stands yonder struck by my will to stone dead yet living and say again what was he about to do to thee when i entered here  to take vengeance on me for the doom of his queen and of her armies answered leo and ayesha how knowest thou that a power higher than thine own will not demand it yet  as he spoke a pale shadow flickered on leos face such a shadow as might fall from deaths advancing wing and in the fixed eyes of the shaman there shone a stony smile  for a moment terror seemed to take ayesha then it was gone as quickly as it came  nay she said i ordain that it shall not be and save one who listeth not what power reigns in this wide earth that dare defy my will  so she spoke and as her words of awful pridefor they were very awfulrang round that stonebuilt chamber a vision came to meholly  i saw illimitable space peopled with shining suns and sunk in the infinite void above them one vast countenance clad in a calm so terrific that at its aspect my spirit sank to nothingness yes and i knew that this was destiny enthroned above the spheres those lips moved and obedient worlds rushed upon their course they moved again and these rolling chariots of the heavens were turned or stayed appeared or disappeared i knew also that against this calm majesty the being woman or spirit at my side had dared to hurl her passion and her strength my soul reeled i was afraid  the dread phantasm passed and when my mind cleared again ayesha was speaking in new triumphant tones  nay nay she cried past is the night of dread dawns the day of victory look and she pointed through the windowplaces shattered by the hurricane to the flaming town beneath whence rose one continual wail of misery the wail of women mourning their countless slain while the fire roared through their homes like some unchained and rejoicing demon look leo on the smoke of the first sacrifice that i offer to thy royal state and listen to its music perchance thou deemst it naught why then ill give thee others thou lovest war good we will go down to war and the rebellious cities of the earth shall be the torches of our march  she paused a moment her delicate nostrils quivering and her face alight with the prescience of ungarnered splendours then like a swooping swallow flitted to where by dead atene the gold circlet fallen from the khanias hair lay upon the floor  she stooped lifted it and coming to leo held it high above his head slowly she let her hand fall until the glittering coronet rested for an instant on his brow then she spoke in her glorious voice that rolled out rich and low a very paean of triumph and of power  by this poor earthly symbol i create thee king of earth yea in its round for thee is gathered all her rule be thou its king and mine  again the coronet was held aloft again it sank and again she said or rather chantedwith this unbroken ring token of eternity i swear to thee the boon of endless days endure thou while the world endures and be its lord and mine  a third time the coronet touched his brow  by this golden round i do endow thee with wisdoms perfect gold uncountable that is the talisman whereat all natures secret paths shall open to thy feet victorious victorious tread thou her wondrous ways with me till from her topmost peak at last she wafts us to our immortal throne whereof the columns twain are life and death  then ayesha cast away the crown and lo it fell upon the breast of the lost atene and rested there  art content with these gifts of mine my lord she cried  leo looked at her sadly and shook his head  what more wilt thou then ask and i swear it shall be thine  thou swearest but wilt thou keep the oath  aye by myself i swear by myself and by the strength that bred me if it be ought that i can grantthen if i refuse it to thee may such destruction fall upon me as will satisfy even atenes watching soul  i heard and i think that another heard also at least once more the stony smile shone in the eyes of the shaman  i ask of thee nothing that thou canst not give ayesha i ask of thee thyselfnot at some distant time when i have been bathed in a mysterious fire but now now this night  she shrank back from him a little as though dismayed  surely she said slowly i am like that foolish philosopher who walking abroad to read the destinies of nations in the stars fell down a pitfall dug by idle children and broke his bones and perished there never did i guess that with all these glories stretched before thee like mountain top on glittering mountain top making a stairway for thy mortal feet to the very dome of heaven thou wouldst still clutch at thy native earth and seek of itbut the common boon of womans love  oh leo i thought that thy soul was set upon nobler aims that thou wouldst pray me for wider powers for a more vast dominion that as though they were but yonder fallen door of wood and iron i should break for thee the bars of hades and like the eurydice of old fable draw thee living down the steeps of death or throne thee midst the fires of the furthest sun to watch its subject worlds at play  or i thought that thou wouldst bid me reveal what no woman ever told the bitter naked truthall my sins and sorrows all the wandering fancies of my fickle thought even what thou knowest not and perchance neer shalt know who i am and whence i came and how to thy charmed eyes i seemed to change from foul to fair and what is the purpose of my love for thee and what the meaning of that tale of an angry goddesswho never was except in dreams  i thoughtnay no matter what i thought save that thou wert far other than thou art my leo and in so high a moment that thou wouldst seek to pass the mystic gates my glory can throw wide and with me tread an air supernal to the hidden heart of things yet thy prayer is but the same that the whole world whispers beneath the silent moon in the palace and the cottage among the snows and on the burning deserts waste oh my love thy lips thy lips oh my love be mine now now beneath the moon beneath the moon  leo i thought better higher of thee  mayhap ayesha thou wouldest have thought worse of me had i been content with thy suns and constellations and spiritual gifts and dominations that i neither desire nor understand  if i had said to thee be thou my angel not my wife divide the ocean that i may walk its bed pierce the firmament and show me how grow the stars tell me the origins of being and of death and instruct me in their issues give up the races of mankind to my sword and the wealth of all the earth to fill my treasuries teach me also how to drive the hurricane as thou canst do and to bend the laws of nature to my purpose on earth make me half a godas thou art  but ayesha i am no god i am a man and as a man i seek the woman whom i love oh divest thyself of all these wrappings of thy powerthat power which strews thy path with dead and keeps me apart from thee if only for one short night forget the ambition that gnaws unceasingly at thy soul i say forget thy greatness and be a woman andmy wife  she made no answer only looked at him and shook her head causing her glorious hair to ripple like water beneath a gentle breeze  thou deniest me he went on with gathering strength and that thou canst not do that thou mayest not do for ayesha thou hast sworn and i demand the fulfilment of thine oath  hark thou i refuse thy gifts i will have none of thy rule who ask no pharaohs throne and wish to do good to men and not to kill themthat the world may profit i will not go with thee to kor nor be bathed in the breath of life i will leave thee and cross the mountains or perish on them nor with all thy strength canst thou hold me to thy side who indeed needest me not no longer will i endure this daily torment the torment of thy presence and thy sweet words thy loving looks thy promises for next year next yearnext year so keep thine oath or let me begone  still ayesha stood silent only now her head drooped and her breast began to heave then leo stepped forward he seized her in his arms and kissed her she broke from his embrace i know not how for though she returned it was close enough and again stood before him but at a little distance  did i not warn holly she whispered with a sigh to bid thee beware lest i should catch thy human fire man i say to thee it begins to smoulder in my heart and should it grow to flame  why then he answered laughing we will be happy for a little while  aye leo but how long why wert thou sole lord of this loveliness of mine and not set above their harming night and day a hundred jealous daggers would seek thy heart andfind it  how long ayesha a lifetime a year a month a minutei neither know nor care and while thou art true to me i fear no stabs of envy  is it so wilt take the risk i can promise thee nothing thou mightestyes in this way or in that thou mightestdie  and if i die what then shall we be separated  nay nay leo that is not possible we never can be severed of this i am sure it is sworn to me but then through other lives and other spheres higher lives and higher spheres mayhap our fates must force a painful path to their last goal of union  why then i take the hazard ayesha shall the life that i can risk to slay a leopard or a lion in the sport of an idle hour be too great a price to offer for the splendours of thy breast thine oath ayesha i claim thine oath  then it was that in ayesha there began the most mysterious and thrilling of her many changes yet how to describe it i know not unless it be by simile  once in thibet we were imprisoned for months by snows that stretched down from the mountain slopes into the valleys and oh how weary did we grow of those arid aching fields of purest white at length rain set in and blinding mists in which it was not safe to wander that made the dark nights darker yet  so it was until there came a morning when seeing the sun shine we went to our door and looked out behold a miracle gone were the snows that choked the valley and in the place of them appeared vivid springing grass starred everywhere with flowers and murmuring brooks and birds that sang and nested in the willows gone was the frowning sky and all the blue firmament seemed one tender smile gone were the austerities of winter with his harsh winds and in their place spring companioned by her zephyrs glided down the vale singing her song of love and life  there in this high chamber in the presence of the living and the dead while the last act of the great tragedy unrolled itself before me looking on ayesha that forgotten scene sprang into my mind for on her face just such a change had come hitherto with all her loveliness the heart of ayesha had seemed like that winter mountain wrapped in its unapproachable snow and before her pure brow and icy selfcommand aspirations sank abashed and desires died  she swore she loved and her love fulfilled itself in death and many a mysterious way yet it was hard to believe that this passion of hers was more than a spoken part for how can the star seek the moth although the moth may seek the star though the man may worship the goddess for all her smiles divine how can the goddess love the man  but now everything was altered look ayesha grew human i could see her heart beat beneath her robes and hear her breath come in soft sweet sobs while oer her upturned face and in her alluring eyes there spread itself that look which is born of love alone radiant and more radiant did she seem to grow sweeter and more sweet no longer the veiled hermit of the caves no longer the oracle of the sanctuary no longer the valkyrie of the battleplain but only the loveliest and most happy bride that ever gladdened a husbands eyes  she spoke and it was of little things for thus ayesha proclaimed the conquest of herself  fie she said showing her white robes torn with spears and stained by the dust and dew of war fie my lord what marriage garments are these in which at last i come to thee who would have been adorned in regal gems and raiment befitting to my state and thine  i seek the woman not her garment said leo his burning eyes fixed upon her face  thou seekest the woman ah there it lies tell me leo am i woman or spirit say that i am woman for now the prophecy of this dead atene lies heavy on my soul atene who said that mortal and immortal may not mate  thou must be woman or thou wouldst not have tormented me as thou hast done these many weeks  i thank thee for the comfort of thy words yet was it woman whose breath wrought destruction upon yonder plain was it to a woman that blast and lightning bowed and said we are here command us we obey did that dead thing and she pointed to the shattered door break inward at a womans will or could a woman charm this man to stone  oh leo would that i were woman i tell thee that id lay all my grandeur down a wedding offering at thy feet could i be sure that for one short year i should be naught but woman andthy happy wife  thou sayest that i did torment thee but it is i who have known torment i who desired to yield and dared not aye i tell thee leo were i not sure that thy little stream of life is draining dry into the great ocean of my life drawn thither as the sea draws its rivers or as the sun draws mists een now i would not yield but i know for my wisdom tells it me ere ever we could reach the shores of libya the ill work would be done and thou dead of thine own longing thou dead and i widowed who never was a wife  therefore see like lost atene i take the dice and cast them not knowing how they shall fall not knowing how they shall fall for good or ill i cast and she made a wild motion as of some desperate gamester throwing his last throw  so ayesha went on the thing is done and the number summed for aye though it be hidden from my sight i have made an end of doubts and fears and come death come life ill meet it bravely  say how shall we be wed i have it holly here must join our hands who else he that ever was our guide shall give me unto thee and thee to me this burning city is our altar the dead and living are our witnesses on earth and heaven in place of rites and ceremonials for this first time i lay my lips on thine and when tis done for music ill sing thee a nuptial chant of love such as mortal poet has not written nor have mortal lovers heard  come holly do now thy part and give this maiden to this man  like one in a dream i obeyed her and took ayeshas outstretched hand and leos as i held them thus i tell the truthit was as though some fire rushed through my veins from her to him shaking and shattering me with swift waves of burning and unearthly bliss with the fire too came glorious visions and sounds of mighty music and a sense as though my brain filled with overflowing life must burst asunder beneath its weight  i joined their hands i know not how i blessed them i know not in what words then i reeled back against the wall and watched  this is what i saw  with an abandonment and a passion so splendid and intense that it seemed more than human with a murmured cry of husband ayesha cast her arms about her lovers neck and drawing down his head to hers so that the gold hair was mingled with her raven locks she kissed him on the lips  thus they clung a little while and as they clung the gentle diadem of light from her brow spread to his brow also and through the white wrappings of her robe became visible her perfect shape shining with faint fire with a little happy laugh she left him saying  thus leo vincey oh thus for the second time do i give myself to thee and with this flesh and spirit all i swore to thee there in the dim caves of kor and here in the palace of kaloon know thou this come what may never never more shall we be separate who are ordained one whilst thou livest i live at thy side and when thou diest if die thy must ill follow thee through worlds and firmaments nor shall all the doors of heaven or hell avail against my love where thou goest thither i will go when thou sleepest with thee will i sleep and it is my voice that thou shalt hear murmuring through the dreams of life and death my voice that shall summon thee to awaken in the last hour of everlasting dawn when all this night of misery hath furled her wings for aye  listen now while i sing to thee and hear that song aright for in its melody at length thou shalt learn the truth which unwed i might not tell to thee thou shalt learn who and what i am and who and what thou art and of the high purposes of our love and this dead womans hate and of all that i have hid from thee in veiled bewildering words and visions  listen then my love and lord to the burden of the song of fate  she ceased speaking and gazed heavenwards with a rapt look as though she waited for some inspiration to fall upon her and never nevernot even in the fires of kor had ayesha seemed so divine as she did now in this moment of the ripe harvest of her love  my eyes wandered from her to leo who stood before her pale and still still as the deathlike figure of the shaman still as the khanias icy shape which stared upwards from the ground what was passing in his mind i wondered that he could remain thus insensible while in all her might and awful beauty this proud being worshipped him  hark she began to sing in a voice so rich and perfect that its honied notes seemed to cloy my blood and stop my breath       the world was not was not and in the womb of silence      slept the souls of men yet i was and thou  suddenly ayesha stopped and i felt rather than saw the horror on her face  look leo swayed to and fro as though the stones beneath him were but a rocking boat to and fro he swayed stretched out his blind arms to clasp herthen suddenly fell backwards and lay still  oh what a shriek was that she gave surely it must have wakened the very corpses upon the plain surely it must have echoed in the stars one shriek onlythen throbbing silence  i sprang to him and there withered in ayeshas kiss slain by the fire of her love leo lay deadlay dead upon the breast of dead atene    chapter xxiv  the passing of ayesha  i heard ayesha say presently and the words struck me as dreadful in their hopeless acceptance of a doom against which even she had no strength to struggle  it seems that my lord has left me for awhile i must hasten to my lord afar  after that i do not quite know what happened i had lost the man who was all in all to me friend and child in one and i was crushed as i had never been before it seemed so sad that i old and outworn should still live on whilst he in the flower of his age snatched from joy and greatness such as no man hath known lay thus asleep  i think that by an afterthought ayesha and oros tried to restore him tried without result for here her powers were of no avail indeed my conviction is that although some lingering life still kept him on his feet leo had really died at the moment of her embrace since when i looked at him before he fell his face was that of a dead man  yes i believe that last speech of hers although she knew it not was addressed to his spirit for in her burning kiss his flesh had perished  when at length i recovered myself a little it was to hear ayesha in a cold calm voiceher face i could not see for she had veiled herselfcommanding certain priests who had been summoned to bear away the body of that accursed woman and bury her as befits her rank even then i bethought me i remember of the tale of jehu and jezebel  leo looking strangely calm and happy lay now upon a couch the arms folded on his breast when the priests had tramped away carrying their royal burden ayesha who sat by his body brooding seemed to awake for she rose and saidi need a messenger and for no common journey since he must search out the habitations of the shades and she turned herself towards oros and appeared to look at him  now for the first time i saw that priest change countenance a little for the eternal smile of which even this scene had not quite rid it left his face and he grew pale and trembled  thou art afraid she said contemptuously be at rest oros i will not send one who is afraid holly wilt thou go for meand him  aye i answered i am weary of life and desire no other end only let it be swift and painless  she mused a while then saidnay thy time is not yet thou still hast work to do endure my holly tis only for a breath  then she looked at the shaman the man turned to stone who all this while had stood there as a statue stands and criedawake  instantly he seemed to thaw into life his limbs relaxed his breast heaved he was as he had always been ancient gnarled malevolent  i hear thee mistress he said bowing as a man bows to the power that he hates  thou seest simbri and she waved her hand  i see things have befallen as atene and i foretold have they not ere long the corpse of a newcrowned khan of kaloon and he pointed to the gold circlet that ayesha had set on leos brow will lie upon the brink of the pit of flameas i foretold an evil smile crept into his eyes and he went onhadst thou not smote me dumb i who watched could have warned thee that they would so befall but great mistress it pleased thee to smite me dumb and so it seems o hes that thou hast overshot thyself and liest broken at the foot of that pinnacle which step by step thou hast climbed for more than two thousand weary years see what thou hast bought at the price of countless lives that now before the throne of judgment bring accusations against thy powers misused and cry out for justice on thy head and he looked at the dead form of leo  i sorrow for them yet simbri they were well spent ayesha answered reflectively who by their forewritten doom as it was decreed held thy knife from falling and thus won me my husband aye and i am happyhappier than such blind bats as thou can see or guess for know that now with him i have rewed my wandering soul divorced by sin from me and that of our marriage kiss which burned his life away there shall still be born to us children of forgiveness and eternal grace and all things that are pure and fair  look thou simbri i will honour thee thou shalt be my messenger and beware beware i say how thou dost fulfil thine office since of every syllable thou must render an account  go thou down the dark paths of death and since even my thought may not reach to where he sleeps tonight search out my lord and say to him that the feet of his spouse ayesha are following fast bid him have no fear for me who by this last sorrow have atoned my crimes and am in his embrace regenerate tell him that thus it was appointed and thus is best since now he is dipped indeed in the eternal flame of life now for him the mortal night is done and the everlasting day arises command him that he await me in the gate of death where it is granted that i greet him presently thou hearest  i hear o queen mightyfromofold  one message more say to atene that i forgive her her heart was high and greatly did she play her part there in the gates we will balance our account thou hearest  i hear o eternal star that hath conquered night  then man begone  as the word left ayeshas lips simbri leapt from the floor grasping at the air as though he would clutch his own departing soul staggered back against the board where leo and i had eaten overthrowing it and amid a ruin of gold and silver vessels fell down and died  she looked at him then said to mesee though he ever hated me this magician who has known ayesha from the first did homage to my ancient majesty at last when lies and defiance would serve his end no more no longer now do i hear the name that his dead mistress gave to me the starthathathfallen in his lips and in very truth is become the starwhichhathburstthebondsofnight and rearisen shines for evershines with its twin immortal to set no moremy holly well he is gone and ere now those that serve me in the underworlddost rememberthou sawest their captains in the sanctuarybend the head at great ayeshas word and make her place ready near her spouse  but oh what folly has been mine when even here my wrath can show such power how could i hope that my lord would outlive the fires of my love still it was better so for he sought not the pomp i would have given him nor desired the death of men yet such pomp must have been his portion in this poor shadow of a world and the steps that encircle an usurpers throne are ever slippery with blood  thou art weary my holly go rest thee tomorrow night we journey to the mountain there to celebrate these obsequies  i crept into the room adjoiningit had been simbrisand laid me down upon his bed but to sleep i was not able its door was open and in the light of the burning city that shone through the casements i could see ayesha watching by her dead hour after hour she watched her head resting on her hand silent stirless she wept not no sigh escaped her only watched as a tender woman watches a slumbering babe that she knows will awake at dawn  her face was unveiled and i perceived that it had greatly changed all pride and anger were departed from it it was grown soft wistful yet full of confidence and quietness for a while i could not think of what it reminded me till suddenly i remembered now it was like indeed the counterpart almost of the holy and majestic semblance of the statue of the mother in the sanctuary yes with just such a look of love and power as that mother cast upon her frightened child newrisen from its dream of death did ayesha gaze upon her dead while her parted lips also seemed to whisper some tale of hope sure and immortal  at length she rose and came into my chamber  thou thinkest me fallen and dost grieve for me my holly she said in a gentle voice knowing my fears lest some such fate should overtake my lord  ay ayesha i grieve for thee as for myself  spare then thy pity holly since although the human part of me would have kept him on the earth now my spirit doth rejoice that for a while he has burst his mortal bonds for many an age although i knew it not in my proud defiance of the universal law i have fought against his true weal and mine thrice have i and the angel wrestled matching strength with strength and thrice has he conquered me yet as he bore away his prize this night he whispered wisdom in my ear this was his message that in death is loves home in death its strength that from the charnelhouse of life this love springs again glorified and pure to reign a conqueror forever therefore i wipe away my tears and crowned once more a queen of peace i go to join him whom we have lost there where he awaits us as it is granted to me that i shall do  but i am selfish and forgot thou needest rest sleep friend i bid thee sleep  and i slept wondering as my eyes closed whence ayesha drew this strange confidence and comfort i know not but it was there real and not assumed i can only suppose therefore that some illumination had fallen on her soul and that as she stated the love and end of leo in a way unknown did suffice to satisfy her court of sins  at the least those sins and all the load of death that lay at her door never seemed to trouble her at all she appeared to look upon them merely as events which were destined to occur as inevitable fruits of a seed sowed long ago by the hand of fate for whose workings she was not responsible the fears and considerations which weigh with mortals did not affect or oppress her in this as in other matters ayesha was a law unto herself  when i awoke it was day and through the windowplace i saw the rain that the people of kaloon had so long desired falling in one straight sheet i saw also that ayesha seated by the shrouded form of leo was giving orders to her priests and captains and to some nobles who had survived the slaughter of kaloon as to the new government of the land then i slept again  it was evening and ayesha stood at my bedside  all is prepared she said awake and ride with me  so we went escorted by a thousand cavalry for the rest stayed to occupy or perchance to plunder the land of kaloon in front the body of leo was borne by relays of priests and behind it rode the veiled ayesha i at her side  strange was the contrast between this departure and our arrival  then the rushing squadrons the elements that raved the perpetual sheen of lightnings seen through the swinging curtains of the hail the voices of despair from an army rolled in blood beneath the chariot wheels of thunder  now the whitedraped corpse the slowpacing horses the riders with their spears reversed and on either side seen in that melancholy moonlight the women of kaloon burying their innumerable dead  and ayesha herself yesterday a valkyrie crested with the star of flame today but a bereaved woman humbly following her husband to the tomb  yet how they feared her some widow standing on the grave mould she had dug pointed as we passed to the body of leo uttering bitter words which i could not catch thereon her companions flung themselves upon her and felling her with fist and spade prostrated themselves upon the ground throwing dust on their hair in token of their submission to the priestess of death  ayesha saw them and said to me with something of her ancient fire and pridei tread the plain of kaloon no more yet as a parting gift have i read this highstomached people a lesson that they needed long not for many a generation o holly will they dare to lift spear against the college of hes and its subject tribes  again it was night and where once lay that of the khan the man whom he had killed flanked by the burning pillars the bier of leo stood in the inmost sanctuary before the statue of the mother whose gentle unchanging eyes seemed to search his quiet face  on her throne sat the veiled hesea giving commands to her priests and priestesses  i am weary she said and it may be that i leave you for a while to restbeyond the mountains a year or a thousand yearsi cannot say if so let papave with oros as her counsellor and husband and their seed hold my place till i return again  priests and priestesses of the college of hes over new territories have i held my hand take them as an heritage from me and rule them well and gently henceforth let the hesea of the mountain be also the khania of kaloon  priests and priestesses of our ancient faith learn to look through its rites and tokens outward and visible to the informing spirit if hes the goddess never ruled on earth still pitying nature rules if the name of isis never rang through the courts of heaven still in heaven with all love fulfilled nursing her human children on her breast dwells the mighty motherhood where of this statue is the symbol that motherhood which bore us and unforgetting faithful will receive us at the end  for of the bread of bitterness we shall not always eat of the water of tears we shall not always drink beyond the night the royal suns ride on ever the rainbow shines around the rain though they slip from our clutching hands like melted snow the lives we lose shall yet be found immortal and from the burntout fires of our human hopes will spring a heavenly star  she paused and waved her hand as though to dismiss them then added by an afterthought pointing to myselfthis man is my beloved friend and guest let him be yours also it is my will that you tend and guard him here and when the snows have melted and summer is at hand that you fashion a way for him through the gulf and bring him across the mountains by which he came till you leave him in safety hear and forget not for be sure that to me you shall give account of him  the night drew towards the dawn and we stood upon the peak above the gulf of fire four of us onlyayesha and i and oros and papave for the bearers had laid down the body of leo upon its edge and gone their way the curtain of flame flared in front of us its crest bent over like a billow in the gale and to leeward one by one floated the tornoff clouds and pinnacles of fire by the dead leo knelt ayesha gazing at that icy smiling face but speaking no single word at length she rose and saiddarkness draws near my holly that deep darkness which foreruns the glory of the dawn now fare thee well for one little hour when thou art about to die but not before call me and i will come to thee stir not and speak not till all be done lest when i am no longer here to be thy guard some presence should pass on and slay thee  think not that i am conquered for now my name is victory think not that ayeshas strength is spent or her tale is done for of it thou readest but a single page think not even that i am today that thing of sin and pride the ayesha thou didst adore and fear i who in my lords love and sacrifice have again conceived my soul for know that now once more as at the beginning his soul and mine are one  she thought awhile and added  friend take this sceptre in memory of me but beware how thou usest it save at the last to summon me for it has virtues and she gave me the jewelled sistrum that she borethen said  so kiss his brow stand back and be still  now as once before the darkness gathered on the pit and presently although i heard no prayer though now no mighty music broke upon the silence through that darkness beating up the gale came the twowinged flame and hovered where ayesha stood  it appeared it vanished and one by one the long minutes crept away until the first spear of dawn lit upon the point of rock  lo it was empty utterly empty and lonesome gone was the corpse of leo and gone too was ayesha the imperial the divine  whither had she gone i know not but this i know that as the light returned and the broad sheet of flame flared out to meet it i seemed to see two glorious shapes sweeping upward on its bosom and the faces that they wore were those of leo and of ayesha  often and often during the weary months that followed whilst i wandered through the temple or amid the winter snows upon the mountain side did i seek to solve this questionwhither had she gone i asked it of my heart i asked it of the skies i asked it of the spirit of leo which often was so near to me  but no sure answer ever came nor will i hazard one as mystery wrapped ayeshas origin and livesfor the truth of these things i never learnedso did mystery wrap her deaths or rather her departings for i cannot think her dead surely she still is if not on earth then in some other sphere  so i believe and when my own hour comes and it draws near swiftly i shall know whether i believe in vain or whether she will appear to be my guide as with her last words she swore that she would do then too i shall learn what she was about to reveal to leo when he died the purposes of their being and of their love  so i can wait in patience who must not wait for long though my heart is broken and i am desolate  oros and all the priests were very good to me indeed even had it been their wish they would have feared to be otherwise who remembered and were sure that in some time to come they must render an account of this matter to their dread queen by way of return i helped them as i was best able to draw up a scheme for the government of the conquered country of kaloon and with my advice upon many other questions  and so at length the long months wore away till at the approach of summer the snows melted then i said that i must be gone they gave me of their treasures in precious stones lest i should need money for my faring since the gold of which i had such plenty was too heavy to be carried by one man alone they led me across the plains of kaloon where now the husbandmen those that were left of them ploughed the land and scattered seed and so on to its city but amidst those blackened ruins over which atenes palace still frowned unharmed i would not enter for to me it was and always must remain a home of death so i camped outside the walls by the river just where leo and i had landed after that poor mad khan set us free or rather loosed us to be hunted by his deathhounds  next day we took boat and rowed up the river past the place where we had seen atenes cousin murdered till we came to the gatehouse here once again i slept or rather did not sleep  on the following morning i went down into the ravine and found to my surprise that the rapid torrentshallow enough nowhad been roughly bridged and that in preparation for my coming rude but sufficient ladders were built on the face of the opposing precipice at the foot of these i bade farewell to oros who at our parting smiled benignantly as on the day we met  we have seen strange things together i said to him not knowing what else to say  very strange he answered  at least friend oros i went on awkwardly enough events have shaped themselves to your advantage for you inherit a royal mantle  i wrap myself in a mantle of borrowed royalty he answered with precision of which doubtless one day i shall be stripped  you mean that the great ayesha is not dead  i mean that she never dies she changes that is all as the wind blows now hence now hither so she comes and goes and who can tell at what spot upon the earth or beyond it for a while that wind lies sleeping but at sunset or at dawn at noon or at midnight it will begin to blow again and then woe to those who stand across its path  remember the dead heaped upon the plains of kaloon remember the departing of the shaman simbri with his message and the words that she spoke then remember the passing of the hesea from the mountain point stranger from the west surely as tomorrows sun must rise as she went so she will return again and in my borrowed garment i await her advent  i also await her advent i answered and thus we parted  accompanied by twenty picked men bearing provisions and arms i climbed the ladders easily enough and now that i had food and shelter crossed the mountains without mishap they even escorted me through the desert beyond till one night we camped within sight of the gigantic buddha that sits before the monastery gazing eternally across the sands and snows  when i awoke next morning the priests were gone so i took up my pack and pursued my journey alone and walking slowly came at sunset to the distant lamasery at its door an ancient figure wrapped in a tattered cloak was sitting engaged apparently in contemplation of the skies it was our old friend kouen adjusting his horn spectacles on his nose he looked at me  i was awaiting you brother of the monastery called the world he said in a voice measured very ineffectually to conceal his evident delight have you grown hungry there that you return to this poor place  aye most excellent kouen i answered hungry for rest  it shall be yours for all the days of this incarnation but say where is the other brother  dead i answered  and therefore reborn elsewhere or perhaps dreaming in devachan for a while well doubtless we shall meet him later on come eat and afterwards tell me your story  so i ate and that night i told him all kouen listened with respectful attention but the tale strange as it might seem to most people excited no particular wonder in his mind indeed he explained it to me at such length by aid of some marvellous theory of reincarnations that at last i began to doze  at least i said sleepily it would seem that we are all winning merit on the everlasting plane for i thought that favourite catchword would please him  yes brother of the monastery called the world kouen answered in a severe voice doubtless you are all winning merit but if i may venture to say so you are winning it very slowly especially the womanor the sorceressor the mighty evil spiritwhose names i understand you to tell me are she hes and ayesha upon earth and in avitchi starthathathfallen  here mr hollys manuscript ends its outer sheets having been burnt when he
