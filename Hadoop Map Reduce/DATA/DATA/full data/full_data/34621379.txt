34621379	the nigger of the narcissus  a tale of the forecastle  by joseph conrad  copyright 1897 1914  by doubleday page  company        to      edward garnett      this tale      about my friends      of the sea   to my readers in america  from that evening when james wait joined the shiplate for the muster of the crewto the moment when he left us in the open sea shrouded in sailcloth through the open port i had much to do with him he was in my watch a negro in a british forecastle is a lonely being he has no chums yet james wait afraid of death and making her his accomplice was an impostor of some charactermastering our compassion scornful of our sentimentalism triumphing over our suspicions  but in the book he is nothing he is merely the centre of the ships collective psychology and the pivot of the action yet he who in the family circle and amongst my friends is familiarly referred to as the nigger remains very precious to me for the book written round him is not the sort of thing that can be attempted more than once in a lifetime it is the book by which not as a novelist perhaps but as an artist striving for the utmost sincerity of expression i am willing to stand or fall its pages are the tribute of my unalterable and profound affection for the ships the seamen the winds and the great seathe moulders of my youth the companions of the best years of my life  after writing the last words of that book in the revulsion of feeling before the accomplished task i understood that i had done with the sea and that henceforth i had to be a writer and almost without laying down the pen i wrote a preface trying to express the spirit in which i was entering on the task of my new life that preface on advice which i now think was wrong was never published with the book but the late w e henley who had the courage at that time 1897 to serialize my nigger in the new review judged it worthy to be printed as an afterword at the end of the last instalment of the tale  i am glad that this book which means so much to me is coming out again under its proper title of the nigger of the narcissus and under the auspices of my good friends and publishers messrs doubleday page  co into the light of publicity  half the span of a generation has passed since w e henley after reading two chapters sent me a verbal message tell conrad that if the rest is up to the sample it shall certainly come out in the new review the most gratifying recollection of my writers life  and here is the suppressed preface  1914  joseph conrad    contents    preface  the nigger of the narcissus  chapter one  chapter two  chapter three  chapter four  chapter five      preface  a work that aspires however humbly to the condition of art should carry its justification in every line and art itself may be defined as a singleminded attempt to render the highest kind of justice to the visible universe by bringing to light the truth manifold and one underlying its every aspect it is an attempt to find in its forms in its colours in its light in its shadows in the aspects of matter and in the facts of life what of each is fundamental what is enduring and essentialtheir one illuminating and convincing qualitythe very truth of their existence the artist then like the thinker or the scientist seeks the truth and makes his appeal impressed by the aspect of the world the thinker plunges into ideas the scientist into factswhence presently emerging they make their appeal to those qualities of our being that fit us best for the hazardous enterprise of living they speak authoritatively to our commonsense to our intelligence to our desire of peace or to our desire of unrest not seldom to our prejudices sometimes to our fears often to our egoismbut always to our credulity and their words are heard with reverence for their concern is with weighty matters with the cultivation of our minds and the proper care of our bodies with the attainment of our ambitions with the perfection of the means and the glorification of our precious aims  it is otherwise with the artist  confronted by the same enigmatical spectacle the artist descends within himself and in that lonely region of stress and strife if he be deserving and fortunate he finds the terms of his appeal his appeal is made to our less obvious capacities to that part of our nature which because of the warlike conditions of existence is necessarily kept out of sight within the more resisting and hard qualitieslike the vulnerable body within a steel armour his appeal is less loud more profound less distinct more stirringand sooner forgotten yet its effect endures forever the changing wisdom of successive generations discards ideas questions facts demolishes theories but the artist appeals to that part of our being which is not dependent on wisdom to that in us which is a gift and not an acquisitionand therefore more permanently enduring he speaks to our capacity for delight and wonder to the sense of mystery surrounding our lives to our sense of pity and beauty and pain to the latent feeling of fellowship with all creationand to the subtle but invincible conviction of solidarity that knits together the loneliness of innumerable hearts to the solidarity in dreams in joy in sorrow in aspirations in illusions in hope in fear which binds men to each other which binds together all humanitythe dead to the living and the living to the unborn  it is only some such train of thought or rather of feeling that can in a measure explain the aim of the attempt made in the tale which follows to present an unrestful episode in the obscure lives of a few individuals out of all the disregarded multitude of the bewildered the simple and the voiceless for if any part of truth dwells in the belief confessed above it becomes evident that there is not a place of splendour or a dark corner of the earth that does not deserve if only a passing glance of wonder and pity the motive then may be held to justify the matter of the work but this preface which is simply an avowal of endeavour cannot end herefor the avowal is not yet complete fictionif it at all aspires to be artappeals to temperament and in truth it must be like painting like music like all art the appeal of one temperament to all the other innumerable temperaments whose subtle and resistless power endows passing events with their true meaning and creates the moral the emotional atmosphere of the place and time such an appeal to be effective must be an impression conveyed through the senses and in fact it cannot be made in any other way because temperament whether individual or collective is not amenable to persuasion all art therefore appeals primarily to the senses and the artistic aim when expressing itself in written words must also make its appeal through the senses if its highest desire is to reach the secret spring of responsive emotions it must strenuously aspire to the plasticity of sculpture to the colour of painting and to the magic suggestiveness of musicwhich is the art of arts and it is only through complete unswerving devotion to the perfect blending of form and substance it is only through an unremitting neverdiscouraged care for the shape and ring of sentences that an approach can be made to plasticity to colour and that the light of magic suggestiveness may be brought to play for an evanescent instant over the commonplace surface of words of the old old words worn thin defaced by ages of careless usage  the sincere endeavour to accomplish that creative task to go as far on that road as his strength will carry him to go undeterred by faltering weariness or reproach is the only valid justification for the worker in prose and if his conscience is clear his answer to those who in the fulness of a wisdom which looks for immediate profit demand specifically to be edified consoled amused who demand to be promptly improved or encouraged or frightened or shocked or charmed must run thusmy task which i am trying to achieve is by the power of the written word to make you hear to make you feelit is before all to make you see thatand no more and it is everything if i succeed you shall find there according to your deserts encouragement consolation fear charmall you demandand perhaps also that glimpse of truth for which you have forgotten to ask to snatch in a moment of courage from the remorseless rush of time a passing phase of life is only the beginning of the task the task approached in tenderness and faith is to hold up unquestioningly without choice and without fear the rescued fragment before all eyes in the light of a sincere mood it is to show its vibration its colour its form and through its movement its form and its colour reveal the substance of its truthdisclose its inspiring secret the stress and passion within the core of each convincing moment in a singleminded attempt of that kind if one be deserving and fortunate one may perchance attain to such clearness of sincerity that at last the presented vision of regret or pity of terror or mirth shall awaken in the hearts of the beholders that feeling of unavoidable solidarity of the solidarity in mysterious origin in toil in joy in hope in uncertain fate which binds men to each other and all mankind to the visible world it is evident that he who rightly or wrongly holds by the convictions expressed above cannot be faithful to any one of the temporary formulas of his craft the enduring part of themthe truth which each only imperfectly veilsshould abide with him as the most precious of his possessions but they all realism romanticism naturalism even the unofficial sentimentalism which like the poor is exceedingly difficult to get rid of all these gods must after a short period of fellowship abandon himeven on the very threshold of the templeto the stammerings of his conscience and to the outspoken consciousness of the difficulties of his work in that uneasy solitude the supreme cry of art for art itself loses the exciting ring of its apparent immorality it sounds far off it has ceased to be a cry and is heard only as a whisper often incomprehensible but at times and faintly encouraging  sometimes stretched at ease in the shade of a roadside tree we watch the motions of a labourer in a distant field and after a time begin to wonder languidly as to what the fellow may be at we watch the movements of his body the waving of his arms we see him bend down stand up hesitate begin again it may add to the charm of an idle hour to be told the purpose of his exertions if we know he is trying to lift a stone to dig a ditch to uproot a stump we look with a more real interest at his efforts we are disposed to condone the jar of his agitation upon the restfulness of the landscape and even if in a brotherly frame of mind we may bring ourselves to forgive his failure we understood his object and after all the fellow has tried and perhaps he had not the strengthand perhaps he had not the knowledge we forgive go on our wayand forget  and so it is with the workman of art art is long and life is short and success is very far off and thus doubtful of strength to travel so far we talk a little about the aimthe aim of art which like life itself is inspiring difficultobscured by mists it is not in the clear logic of a triumphant conclusion it is not in the unveiling of one of those heartless secrets which are called the laws of nature it is not less great but only more difficult  to arrest for the space of a breath the hands busy about the work of the earth and compel men entranced by the sight of distant goals to glance for a moment at the surrounding vision of form and colour of sunshine and shadows to make them pause for a look for a sigh for a smilesuch is the aim difficult and evanescent and reserved only for a very few to achieve but sometimes by the deserving and the fortunate even that task is accomplished and when it is accomplishedbeholdall the truth of life is there a moment of vision a sigh a smileand the return to an eternal rest  1897 j c    the nigger of the narcissus    chapter one  mr baker chief mate of the ship narcissus stepped in one stride out of his lighted cabin into the darkness of the quarterdeck above his head on the break of the poop the nightwatchman rang a double stroke it was nine oclock mr baker speaking up to the man above him askedare all the hands aboard knowles  the man limped down the ladder then said reflectively  i think so sir all our old chaps are there and a lot of new men has come they must be all there  tell the boatswain to send all hands aft went on mr baker and tell one of the youngsters to bring a good lamp here i want to muster our crowd  the main deck was dark aft but halfway from forward through the open doors of the forecastle two streaks of brilliant light cut the shadow of the quiet night that lay upon the ship a hum of voices was heard there while port and starboard in the illuminated doorways silhouettes of moving men appeared for a moment very black without relief like figures cut out of sheet tin the ship was ready for sea the carpenter had driven in the last wedge of the mainhatch battens and throwing down his maul had wiped his face with great deliberation just on the stroke of five the decks had been swept the windlass oiled and made ready to heave up the anchor the big towrope lay in long bights along one side of the main deck with one end carried up and hung over the bows in readiness for the tug that would come paddling and hissing noisily hot and smoky in the limpid cool quietness of the early morning the captain was ashore where he had been engaging some new hands to make up his full crew and the work of the day over the ships officers had kept out of the way glad of a little breathingtime soon after dark the few libertymen and the new hands began to arrive in shoreboats rowed by whiteclad asiatics who clamoured fiercely for payment before coming alongside the gangwayladder the feverish and shrill babble of eastern language struggled against the masterful tones of tipsy seamen who argued against brazen claims and dishonest hopes by profane shouts the resplendent and bestarred peace of the east was torn into squalid tatters by howls of rage and shrieks of lament raised over sums ranging from five annas to half a rupee and every soul afloat in bombay harbour became aware that the new hands were joining the narcissus  gradually the distracting noise had subsided the boats came no longer in splashing clusters of three or four together but dropped alongside singly in a subdued buzz of expostulation cut short by a not a pace more you go to the devil from some man staggering up the accommodationladdera dark figure with a long bag poised on the shoulder in the forecastle the newcomers upright and swaying amongst corded boxes and bundles of bedding made friends with the old hands who sat one above another in the two tiers of bunks gazing at their future shipmates with glances critical but friendly the two forecastle lamps were turned up high and shed an intense hard glare shoregoing round hats were pushed far on the backs of heads or rolled about on the deck amongst the chaincables white collars undone stuck out on each side of red faces big arms in white sleeves gesticulated the growling voices hummed steady amongst bursts of laughter and hoarse calls here sonny take that bunk dont you do it whats your last ship i know her three years ago in puget sound this here berth leaks i tell you come on give us a chance to swing that chest did you bring a bottle any of you shore toffs give us a bit of baccy i know her her skipper drank himself to death he was a dandy boy liked his lotion inside he did no hold your row you chaps i tell you you came on board a hooker where they get their moneys worth out of poor jack by  a little fellow called craik and nicknamed belfast abused the ship violently romancing on principle just to give the new hands something to think over archie sitting aslant on his seachest kept his knees out of the way and pushed the needle steadily through a white patch in a pair of blue trousers men in black jackets and standup collars mixed with men barefooted barearmed with coloured shirts open on hairy chests pushed against one another in the middle of the forecastle the group swayed reeled turning upon itself with the motion of a scrimmage in a haze of tobacco smoke all were speaking together swearing at every second word a russian finn wearing a yellow shirt with pink stripes stared upwards dreamyeyed from under a mop of tumbled hair two young giants with smooth baby facestwo scandinavianshelped each other to spread their bedding silent and smiling placidly at the tempest of goodhumoured and meaningless curses old singleton the oldest able seaman in the ship set apart on the deck right under the lamps stripped to the waist tattooed like a cannibal chief all over his powerful chest and enormous biceps between the blue and red patterns his white skin gleamed like satin his bare back was propped against the heel of the bowsprit and he held a book at arms length before his big sunburnt face with his spectacles and a venerable white beard he resembled a learned and savage patriarch the incarnation of barbarian wisdom serene in the blasphemous turmoil of the world he was intensely absorbed and as he turned the pages an expression of grave surprise would pass over his rugged features he was reading pelham the popularity of bulwer lytton in the forecastles of southerngoing ships is a wonderful and bizarre phenomenon what ideas do his polished and so curiously insincere sentences awaken in the simple minds of the big children who people those dark and wandering places of the earth what meaning can their rough inexperienced souls find in the elegant verbiage of his pages what excitementwhat forgetfulnesswhat appeasement mystery is it the fascination of the incomprehensibleis it the charm of the impossible or are those beings who exist beyond the pale of life stirred by his tales as by an enigmatical disclosure of a resplendent world that exists within the frontier of infamy and filth within that border of dirt and hunger of misery and dissipation that comes down on all sides to the waters edge of the incorruptible ocean and is the only thing they know of life the only thing they see of surrounding landthose lifelong prisoners of the sea mystery singleton who had sailed to the southward since the age of twelve who in the last fortyfive years had lived as we had calculated from his papers no more than forty months ashoreold singleton who boasted with the mild composure of long years well spent that generally from the day he was paid off from one ship till the day he shipped in another he seldom was in a condition to distinguish daylightold singleton sat unmoved in the clash of voices and cries spelling through pelham with slow labour and lost in an absorption profound enough to resemble a trance he breathed regularly every time he turned the book in his enormous and blackened hands the muscles of his big white arms rolled slightly under the smooth skin hidden by the white moustache his lips stained with tobaccojuice that trickled down the long beard moved in inward whisper his bleared eyes gazed fixedly from behind the glitter of blackrimmed glasses opposite to him and on a level with his face the ships cat sat on the barrel of the windlass in the pose of a crouching chimera blinking its green eyes at its old friend it seemed to meditate a leap on to the old mans lap over the bent back of the ordinary seaman who sat at singletons feet young charley was lean and longnecked the ridge of his backbone made a chain of small hills under the old shirt his face of a streetboya face precocious sagacious and ironic with deep downward folds on each side of the thin wide mouthhung low over his bony knees he was learning to make a lanyard knot with a bit of an old rope small drops of perspiration stood out on his bulging forehead he sniffed strongly from time to time glancing out of the corners of his restless eyes at the old seaman who took no notice of the puzzled youngster muttering at his work  the noise increased little belfast seemed in the heavy heat of the forecastle to boil with facetious fury his eyes danced in the crimson of his face comical as a mask the mouth yawned black with strange grimaces facing him a halfundressed man held his sides and throwing his head back laughed with wet eyelashes others stared with amazed eyes men sitting doubled up in the upper bunks smoked short pipes swinging bare brown feet above the heads of those who sprawling below on seachests listened smiling stupidly or scornfully over the white rims of berths stuck out heads with blinking eyes but the bodies were lost in the gloom of those places that resembled narrow niches for coffins in a whitewashed and lighted mortuary voices buzzed louder archie with compressed lips drew himself in seemed to shrink into a smaller space and sewed steadily industrious and dumb belfast shrieked like an inspired dervish so i seez to him boys seez i beggin yer pardon sorr seez i to that second mate of that steamerbeggin yourrr pardon sorr the board of trade must ave been drunk when they granted you your certificate what do you say you seez he comin at me like a mad bull all in his white clothes and i up

kind of man i am shouts i you should have seed him skip boys drowned blind with tar he was so  dont ee believe him he never upset no tar i was there shouted somebody the two norwegians sat on a chest side by side alike and placid resembling a pair of lovebirds on a perch and with round eyes stared innocently but the russian finn in the racket of explosive shouts and rolling laughter remained motionless limp and dull like a deaf man without a backbone near him archie smiled at his needle a broadchested sloweyed newcomer spoke deliberately to belfast during an exhausted lull in the noisei wonder any of the mates here are alive yet with such a chap as you on board i concloode they aint that bad now if you had the taming of them sonny  not bad not bad screamed belfast if it wasnt for us sticking together not bad they aint never bad when they aint got a chawnce blast their black arts  he foamed whirling his arms then suddenly grinned and taking a tablet of black tobacco out of his pocket bit a piece off with a funny show of ferocity another new handa man with shifty eyes and a yellow hatchet face who had been listening openmouthed in the shadow of the midship lockerobserved in a squeaky voicewell its a omeward trip anyhow bad or good i can do it on my edslong as i get ome and i can look after my rights i will show em all the heads turned towards him only the ordinary seaman and the cat took no notice he stood with arms akimbo a little fellow with white eyelashes he looked as if he had known all the degradations and all the furies he looked as if he had been cuffed kicked rolled in the mud he looked as if he had been scratched spat upon pelted with unmentionable filth and he smiled with a sense of security at the faces around his ears were bending down under the weight of his battered felt hat the torn tails of his black coat flapped in fringes about the calves of his legs he unbuttoned the only two buttons that remained and every one saw that he had no shirt under it it was his deserved misfortune that those rags which nobody could possibly be supposed to own looked on him as if they had been stolen his neck was long and thin his eyelids were red rare hairs hung about his jaws his shoulders were peaked and drooped like the broken wings of a bird all his left side was caked with mud which showed that he had lately slept in a wet ditch he had saved his inefficient carcass from violent destruction by running away from an american ship where in a moment of forgetful folly he had dared to engage himself and he had knocked about for a fortnight ashore in the native quarter cadging for drinks starving sleeping on rubbishheaps wandering in sunshine a startling visitor from a world of nightmares he stood repulsive and smiling in the sudden silence this clean white forecastle was his refuge the place where he could be lazy where he could wallow and lie and eatand curse the food he ate where he could display his talents for shirking work for cheating for cadging where he could find surely some one to wheedle and some one to bullyand where he would be paid for doing all this they all knew him is there a spot on earth where such a man is unknown an ominous survival testifying to the eternal fitness of lies and impudence a taciturn longarmed shellback with hooked fingers who had been lying on his back smoking turned in his bed to examine him dispassionately then over his head sent a long jet of clear saliva towards the door they all knew him he was the man that cannot steer that cannot splice that dodges the work on dark nights that aloft holds on frantically with both arms and legs and swears at the wind the sleet the darkness the man who curses the sea while others work the man who is the last out and the first in when all hands are called the man who cant do most things and wont do the rest the pet of philanthropists and selfseeking landlubbers the sympathetic and deserving creature that knows all about his rights but knows nothing of courage of endurance and of the unexpressed faith of the unspoken loyalty that knits together a ships company the independent offspring of the ignoble freedom of the slums full of disdain and hate for the austere servitude of the sea  some one cried at him whats your namedonkin he said looking round with cheerful effronterywhat are you asked another voicewhy a sailor like you old man he replied in a tone that meant to be hearty but was impudentblamme if you dont look a blamed sight worse than a brokendown fireman was the comment in a convinced mutter charley lifted his head and piped in a cheeky voice he is a man and a sailorthen wiping his nose with the back of his hand bent down industriously over his bit of rope a few laughed others stared doubtfully the ragged newcomer was indignantthats a fine way to welcome a chap into a focsle he snarled are you men or a lot of artless cannybalsdont take your shirt off for a word shipmate called out belfast jumping up in front fiery menacing and friendly at the same timeis that ere bloke blind asked the indomitable scarecrow looking right and left with affected surprise cant ee see i avent got no shirt  he held both his arms out crosswise and shook the rags that hung over his bones with dramatic effect  cos why he continued very loud the bloody yankees been tryin to jump my guts out cos i stood up for my rights like a good un i am an englishman i am they set upon me an i ad to run thats why ant yer never seed a man ard up yah what kind of blamed ship is this im dead broke i avent got nothink no bag no bed no blanket no shirtnot a bloomin rag but what i stand in but i ad the art to stand up agin them yankees as any of you art enough to spare a pair of old pants for a chum  he knew how to conquer the naïve instincts of that crowd in a moment they gave him their compassion jocularly contemptuously or surlily and at first it took the shape of a blanket thrown at him as he stood there with the white skin of his limbs showing his human kinship through the black fantasy of his rags then a pair of old shoes fell at his muddy feet with a cryfrom under a rolledup pair of canvas trousers heavy with tar stains struck him on the shoulder the gust of their benevolence sent a wave of sentimental pity through their doubting hearts they were touched by their own readiness to alleviate a shipmates misery voices criedwe will fit you out old man murmurs never seed seech a hard case poor beggar ive got an old singlet will that be of any use to you take it matey those friendly murmurs filled the forecastle he pawed around with his naked foot gathering the things in a heap and looked about for more unemotional archie perfunctorily contributed to the pile an old cloth cap with the peak torn off old singleton lost in the serene regions of fiction read on unheeding charley pitiless with the wisdom of youth squeakedif you want brass buttons for your new unyforms ive got two for you the filthy object of universal charity shook his fist at the youngsterill make you keep this ere focsle clean young feller he snarled viciously never you fear i will learn you to be civil to an able seaman you ignerant ass he glared harmfully but saw singleton shut his book and his little beady eyes began to roam from berth to berthtake that bunk by the door thereits pretty fair suggested belfast so advised he gathered the gifts at his feet pressed them in a bundle against his breast then looked cautiously at the russian finn who stood on one side with an unconscious gaze contemplating perhaps one of those weird visions that haunt the men of his raceget out of my road dutchy said the victim of yankee brutality the finn did not movedid not hear get out blast ye shouted the other shoving him aside with his elbow get out you blanked deaf and dumb fool get out the man staggered recovered himself and gazed at the speaker in silencethose damned furriners should be kept under opined the amiable donkin to the forecastle if you dont teach em their place they put on you like anythink he flung all his worldly possessions into the empty bedplace gauged with another shrewd look the risks of the proceeding then leaped up to the finn who stood pensive and dullill teach you to swell around he yelled ill plug your eyes for you you blooming squarehead most of the men were now in their bunks and the two had the forecastle clear to themselves the development of the destitute donkin aroused interest he danced all in tatters before the amazed finn squaring from a distance at the heavy unmoved face one or two men cried encouragingly go it whitechapel settling themselves luxuriously in their beds to survey the fight others shouted shut yer row go an put yer ed in a bag the hubbub was recommencing suddenly many heavy blows struck with a handspike on the deck above boomed like discharges of small cannon through the forecastle then the boatswains voice rose outside the door with an authoritative note in its drawldye hear below there lay aft lay aft to muster all hands  there was a moment of surprised stillness then the forecastle floor disappeared under men whose bare feet flopped on the planks as they sprang clear out of their berths caps were rooted for amongst tumbled blankets some yawning buttoned waistbands halfsmoked pipes were knocked hurriedly against woodwork and stuffed under pillows voices growledwhats up is there no rest for us donkin yelpedif thats the way of this ship well ave to change all that you leave me alone i will soon none of the crowd noticed him they were lurching in twos and threes through the doors after the manner of merchant jacks who cannot go out of a door fairly like mere landsmen the votary of change followed them singleton struggling into his jacket came last tall and fatherly bearing high his head of a weatherbeaten sage on the body of an old athlete only charley remained alone in the white glare of the empty place sitting between the two rows of iron links that stretched into the narrow gloom forward he pulled hard at the strands in a hurried endeavour to finish his knot suddenly he started up flung the rope at the cat and skipped after the black tom which went off leaping sedately over chain compressors with its tail carried stiff and upright like a small flag pole  outside the glare of the steaming forecastle the serene purity of the night enveloped the seamen with its soothing breath with its tepid breath flowing under the stars that hung countless above the mastheads in a thin cloud of luminous dust on the town side the blackness of the water was streaked with trails of light which undulated gently on slight ripples similar to filaments that float rooted to the shore rows of other lights stood away in straight lines as if drawn up on parade between towering buildings but on the other side of the harbour sombre hills arched high their black spines on which here and there the point of a star resembled a spark fallen from the sky far off byculla way the electric lamps at the dock gates shone on the end of lofty standards with a glow blinding and frigid like captive ghosts of some evil moons scattered all over the dark polish of the roadstead the ships at anchor floated in perfect stillness under the feeble gleam of their ridinglights looming up opaque and bulky like strange and monumental structures abandoned by men to an everlasting repose  before the cabin door mr baker was mustering the crew as they stumbled and lurched along past the mainmast they could see aft his round broad face with a white paper before it and beside his shoulder the sleepy head writh dropped eyelids of the boy who held suspended at the end of his raised arm the luminous globe of a lamp even before the shuffle of naked soles had ceased along the decks the mate began to call over the names he called distinctly in a serious tone befitting this rollcall to unquiet loneliness to inglorious and obscure struggle or to the more trying endurance of small privations and wearisome duties as the chief mate read out a name one of the men would answer yes sir or here and detaching himself from the shadowy mob of heads visible above the blackness of starboard bulwarks would step barefooted into the circle of light and in two noiseless strides pass into the shadows on the port side of the quarterdeck they answered in divers tones in thick mutters in clear ringing voices and some as if the whole thing had been an outrage on their feelings used an injured intonation for discipline is not ceremonious in merchant ships where the sense of hierarchy is weak and where all feel themselves equal before the unconcerned immensity of the sea and the exacting appeal of the work mr baker read on steadilyhansencampbellsmithwamibo now then wamibo why dont you answer always got to call your name twice the finn emitted at last an uncouth grunt and stepping out passed through the patch of light weird and gaudy with the face of a man marching through a dream the mate went on fastercraiksingletondonkin o lord he involuntarily ejaculated as the incredibly dilapidated figure appeared in the light it stopped it uncovered pale gums and long upper teeth in a malevolent grinis there anythink wrong with me mister mate it asked with a flavour of insolence in the forced simplicity of its tone on both sides of the deck subdued titters were heardthatll do go over growled mr baker fixing the new hand with steady blue eyes and donkin vanished suddenly out of the light into the dark group of mustered men to be slapped on the back and to hear flattering whispershe aint afeard hell give sport to em see if he dont reglar punch and judy show did ye see the mate start at him well damme if i ever the last man had gone over and there was a moment of silence while the mate peered at his listsixteen seventeen he muttered i am one hand short bosen he said aloud the big westcountryman at his elbow swarthy and bearded like a gigantic spaniard said in a rumbling basstheres no one left forward sir i had a look round he aint aboard but he may turn up before daylightay he may or he may not commented the mate cant make out that last name its all a smudge that will do men go below  the distinct and motionless group stirred broke up began to move forward  wait cried a deep ringing voice  all stood still mr baker who had turned away yawning spun round openmouthed at last furious he blurted outwhats this who said wait what  but he saw a tall figure standing on the rail it came down and pushed through the crowd marching with a heavy tread towards the light on the quarterdeck then again the sonorous voice said with insistencewait the lamplight lit up the mans body he was tall his head was away up in the shadows of lifeboats that stood on skids above the deck the whites of his eyes and his teeth gleamed distinctly but the face was indistinguishable his hands were big and seemed gloved  mr baker advanced intrepidly who are you how dare you he began  the boy amazed like the rest raised the light to the mans face it was black a surprised huma faint hum that sounded like the suppressed mutter of the word niggerran along the deck and escaped out into the night the nigger seemed not to hear he balanced himself where he stood in a swagger that marked time after a moment he said calmlymy name is waitjames wait  oh said mr baker then after a few seconds of smouldering silence his temper blazed out ah your name is wait what of that what do you want what do you mean coming shouting here  the nigger was calm cool towering superb the men had approached and stood behind him in a body he overtopped the tallest by half a head he said i belong to the ship he enunciated distinctly with soft precision the deep rolling tones of his voice filled the deck without effort he was naturally scornful unaffectedly condescending as if from his height of six foot three he had surveyed all the vastness of human folly and had made up his mind not to be too hard on it he went onthe captain shipped me this morning i couldnt get aboard sooner i saw you all aft as i came up the ladder and could see directly you were mustering the crew naturally i called out my name i thought you had it on your list and would understand you misapprehended he stopped short the folly around him was confounded he was right as ever and as ever ready to forgive the disdainful tones had ceased and breathing heavily he stood still surrounded by all these white men he held his head up in the glare of the lampa head vigorously modelled into deep shadows and shining lightsa head powerful and misshapen with a tormented and flattened facea face pathetic and brutal the tragic the mysterious the repulsive mask of a niggers soul  mr baker recovering his composure looked at the paper close oh yes thats so all right wait take your gear forward he said  suddenly the niggers eyes rolled wildly became all whites he put his hand to his side and coughed twice a cough metallic hollow and tremendously loud it resounded like two explosions in a vault the dome of the sky rang to it and the iron plates of the ships bulwarks seemed to vibrate in unison then he marched off forward with the others the officers lingering by the cabin door could hear him say wont some of you chaps lend a hand with my dunnage ive got a chest and a bag the words spoken sonorously with an even intonation were heard all over the ship and the question was put in a manner that made refusal impossible the short quick shuffle of men carrying something heavy went away forward but the tall figure of the nigger lingered by the main hatch in a knot of smaller shapes again he was heard asking is your cook a coloured gentleman then a disappointed and disapproving ah hm was his comment upon the information that the cook happened to be a mere white man yet as they went all together towards the forecastle he condescended to put his head through the galley door and boom out inside a magnificent good evening doctor that made all the saucepans ring in the dim light the cook dozed on the coal locker in front of the captains supper he jumped up as if he had been cut with a whip and dashed wildly on deck to see the backs of several men going away laughing afterwards when talking about that voyage he used to saythe poor fellow had scared me i thought i had seen the devil the cook had been seven years in the ship with the same captain he was a seriousminded man with a wife and three children whose society he enjoyed on an average one month out of twelve when on shore he took his family to church twice every sunday at sea he went to sleep every evening with his lamp turned up full a pipe in his mouth and an open bible in his hand some one had always to go during the night to put out the light take the book from his hand and the pipe from between his teeth forbelfast used to say irritated and complainingsome night you stupid cookie youll swallow your ould clay and we will have no cookah sonny i am ready for my makers call wish you all were the other would answer with a benign serenity that was altogether imbecile and touching belfast outside the galley door danced with vexation you holy fool i dont want you to die he howled looking up with furious quivering face and tender eyes whats the hurry you blessed woodenheaded ould heretic the divvle will have you soon enough think of us of us of us and he would go away stamping spitting aside disgusted and worried while the other stepping out saucepan in hand hot begrimed and placid watched with a superior cocksure smile the back of his queer little man reeling in a rage they were great friends  mr baker lounging over the afterhatch sniffed the humid night in the company of the second matethose west india niggers run fine and largesome of them ough dont they a fine big man that mr creighton feel him on a rope hey ough i will take him into my watch i think the second mate a fair gentlemanly young fellow with a resolute face and a splendid physique observed quietly that it was just about what he expected there could be felt in his tone some slight bitterness which mr baker very kindly set himself to argue away come come young man he said grunting between the words come dont be too greedy you had that big finn in your watch all the voyage i will do whats fair you may have those two young scandinavians and i ough i get the nigger and will take that ough that cheeky costermonger chap in a black frockcoat ill make him ough make him toe the mark or my ough name isnt baker ough ough ough  he grunted thriceferociously he had that trick of grunting so between his words and at the end of sentences it was a fine effective grunt that went well with his menacing utterance with his heavy bullnecked frame his jerky rolling gait with his big seamed face his steady eyes and sardonic mouth but its effect had been long ago discounted by the men they liked him belfastwho was a favourite and knew itmimicked him not quite behind his back charleybut with greater cautionimitated his rolling gait some of his sayings became established daily quotations in the forecastle popularity can go no farther besides all hands were ready to admit that on a fitting occasion the mate could jump down a fellows throat in a reglar western ocean style  now he was giving his last orders ough you knowles call all hands at four i want ough to heave short before the tug comes look out for the captain i am going to lie down in my clothes ough call me when you see the boat coming ough ough the old man is sure to have something to say when he gets aboard he remarked to creighton well goodnight ough a long day before us tomorrow ough better turn in now ough ough  upon the dark deck a band of light flashed then a door slammed and mr baker was gone into his neat cabin young creighton stood leaning over the rail and looked dreamily into the night of the east and he saw in it a long country lane a lane of waving leaves and dancing sunshine he saw stirring boughs of old trees outspread and framing in their arch the tender the caressing blueness of an english sky and through the arch a girl in a light dress smiling under a sunshade seemed to be stepping out of the tender sky  at the other end of the ship the forecastle with only one lamp burning now was going to sleep in a dim emptiness traversed by loud breathings by sudden short sighs the double row of berths yawned black like graves tenanted by uneasy corpses here and there a curtain of gaudy chintz half drawn marked the restingplace of a sybarite a leg hung over the edge very white and lifeless an arm stuck straight out with a dark palm turned up and thick fingers half closed two light snores that did not synchronise quarrelled in funny dialogue singleton stripped againthe old man suffered much from prickly heatstood cooling his back in the doorway with his arms crossed on his bare and adorned chest his head touched the beam of the deck above the nigger half undressed was busy casting adrift the lashing of his box and spreading his bedding in an upper berth he moved about in his socks tall and noiseless with a pair of braces beating about his calves amongst the shadows of stanchions and bowsprit donkin munched a piece of hard ships bread sitting on the deck with upturned feet and restless eyes he held the biscuit up before his mouth in the whole fist and snapped his jaws at it with a raging face crumbs fell between his outspread legs then he got up  wheres our watercask he asked in a contained voice  singleton without a word pointed with a big hand that held a short smouldering pipe donkin bent over the cask drank out of the tin splashing the water turned round and noticed the nigger looking at him over the shoulder with calm loftiness he moved up sideways  theres a blooming supper for a man he whispered bitterly my dorg at ome wouldnt ave it its fit enouf for you an me eres a big ships focsle not a blooming scrap of meat in the kids ive looked in all the lockers  the nigger stared like a man addressed unexpectedly in a foreign language donkin changed his tonegiv us a bit of baccy mate he breathed out confidentially i avent ad smoke or chew for the last month i am rampin mad for it come on old man  dont be familiar said the nigger donkin started and sat down on a chest near by out of sheer surprise we havent kept pigs together continued james wait in a deep undertone heres your tobacco then after a pause he inquiredwhat shipgolden state muttered donkin indistinctly biting the tobacco the nigger whistled lowran he said curtly donkin nodded one of his cheeks bulged out in course i ran

i got nothink no clothes no bed a bandylegged little hirish chap ere as give me a blanket think ill go an sleep in the fore topmast staysail tonight  he went on deck trailing behind his back a corner of the blanket singleton without a glance moved slightly aside to let him pass the nigger put away his shore togs and sat in clean working clothes on his box one arm stretched over his knees after staring at singleton for some time he asked without emphasiswhat kind of ship is this pretty fair eh  singleton didnt stir a long while after he said with unmoved faceship ships are all right it is the men in them  he went on smoking in the profound silence the wisdom of half a century spent in listening to the thunder of the waves had spoken unconsciously through his old lips the cat purred on the windlass then james wait had a fit of roaring rattling cough that shook him tossed him like a hurricane and flung him panting with staring eyes headlong on his seachest several men woke up one said sleepily out of his bunk struth what a blamed rowi have a cold on my chest gasped waitcold you call it grumbled the man should think twas something moreoh you think so said the nigger upright and loftily scornful again he climbed into his berth and began coughing persistently while he put his head out to glare all round the forecastle there was no further protest he fell back on the pillow and could be heard there wheezing regularly like a man oppressed in his sleep  singleton stood at the door with his face to the light and his back to the darkness and alone in the dim emptiness of the sleeping forecastle he appeared bigger colossal very old old as father time himself who should have come there into this place as quiet as a sepulchre to contemplate with patient eyes the short victory of sleep the consoler yet he was only a child of time a lonely relic of a devoured and forgotten generation he stood still strong as ever unthinking a ready man with a vast empty past and with no future with his childlike impulses and his mans passions already dead within his tattooed breast the men who could understand his silence were gonethose men who knew how to exist beyond the pale of life and within sight of eternity they had been strong as those are strong who know neither doubts nor hopes they had been impatient and enduring turbulent and devoted unruly and faithful wellmeaning people had tried to represent those men as whining over every mouthful of their food as going about their work in fear of their lives but in truth they had been men who knew toil privation violence debaucherybut knew not fear and had no desire of spite in their hearts men hard to manage but easy to inspire voiceless menbut men enough to scorn in their hearts the sentimental voices that bewailed the hardness of their fate it was a fate unique and their own the capacity to bear it appeared to them the privilege of the chosen their generation lived inarticulate and indispensable without knowing the sweetness of affections or the refuge of a homeand died free from the dark menace of a narrow grave they were the everlasting children of the mysterious sea their successors are the grownup children of a discontented earth they are less naughty but less innocent less profane but perhaps also less believing and if they have learned how to speak they have also learned how to whine but the others were strong and mute they were effaced bowed and enduring like stone caryatides that hold up in the night the lighted halls of a resplendent and glorious edifice they are gone nowand it does not matter the sea and the earth are unfaithful to their children a truth a faith a generation of men goesand is forgotten and it does not matter except perhaps to the few of those who believed the truth confessed the faithor loved the men  a breeze was coming the ship that had been lying tiderode swung to a heavier puff and suddenly the slack of the chain cable between the windlass and the hawsepipe clinked slipped forward an inch and rose gently off the deck with a startling suggestion as of unsuspected life that had been lurking stealthily in the iron in the hawsepipe the grinding links sent through the ship a sound like a low groan of a man sighing under a burden the strain came on the windlass the chain tautened like a string vibratedand the handle of the screwbrake moved in slight jerks singleton stepped forward  till then he had been standing meditative and unthinking reposeful and hopeless with a face grim and blanka sixtyyearold child of the mysterious sea the thoughts of all his lifetime could have been expressed in six words but the stir of those things that were as much part of his existence as his beating heart called up a gleam of alert understanding upon the sternness of his aged face the flame of the lamp swayed and the old man with knitted and bushy eyebrows stood over the brake watchful and motionless in the wild saraband of dancing shadows then the ship obedient to the call of her anchor forged ahead slightly and eased the strain the cable relieved hung down and after swaying imperceptibly to and fro dropped with a loud tap on the hard wood planks singleton seized the high lever and by a violent throw forward of his body wrung out another halfturn from the brake he recovered himself breathed largely and remained for a while glaring down at the powerful and compact engine that squatted on the deck at his feet like some quiet monstera creature amazing and tame  you hold he growled at it masterfully in the incult tangle of his white beard      chapter two  next morning at daylight the narcissus went to sea  a slight haze blurred the horizon outside the harbour the measureless expanse of smooth water lay sparkling like a floor of jewels and as empty as the sky the short black tug gave a pluck to windward in the usual way then let go the rope and hovered for a moment on the quarter with her engines stopped while the slim long hull of the ship moved ahead slowly under lower topsails the loose upper canvas blew out in the breeze with soft round contours resembling small white clouds snared in the maze of ropes then the sheets were hauled home the yards hoisted and the ship became a high and lonely pyramid gliding all shining and white through the sunlit mist the tug turned short round and went away towards the land twentysix pairs of eyes watched her low broad stern crawling languidly over the smooth swell between the two paddlewheels that turned fast beating the water with fierce hurry she resembled an enormous and aquatic black beetle surprised by the light overwhelmed by the sunshine trying to escape with ineffectual effort into the distant gloom of the land she left a lingering smudge of smoke on the sky and two vanishing trails of foam on the water on the place where she had stopped a round black patch of soot remained undulating on the swellan unclean mark of the creatures rest  the narcissus left alone heading south seemed to stand resplendent and still upon the restless sea under the moving sun flakes of foam swept past her sides the water struck her with flashing blows the land glided away slowly fading a few birds screamed on motionless wings over the swaying mastheads but soon the land disappeared the birds went away and to the west the pointed sail of an arab dhow running for bombay rose triangular and upright above the sharp edge of the horizon lingered and vanished like an illusion then the ships wake long and straight stretched itself out through a day of immense solitude the setting sun burning on the level of the water flamed crimson below the blackness of heavy rain clouds the sunset squall coming up from behind dissolved itself into the short deluge of a hissing shower it left the ship glistening from trucks to waterline and with darkened sails she ran easily before a fair monsoon with her decks cleared for the night and moving along with her was heard the sustained and monotonous swishing of the waves mingled with the low whispers of men mustered aft for the setting of watches the short plaint of some block aloft or now and then a loud sigh of wind  mr baker coming out of his cabin called out the first name sharply before closing the door behind him he was going to take charge of the deck on the homeward trip according to an old custom of the sea the chief officer takes the first nightwatchfrom eight till midnight so mr baker after he had heard the last yes sir said moodily relieve the wheel and lookout and climbed with heavy feet the poop ladder to windward soon after mr creighton came down whistling softly and went into the cabin on the doorstep the steward lounged in slippers meditative and with his shirtsleeves rolled up to the armpits  on the main deck the cook locking up the galley doors had an altercation with young charley about a pair of socks he could be heard saying impressively in the darkness amidships you dont deserve a kindness ive been drying them for you and now you complain about the holesand you swear too right in front of me if i hadnt been a christianwhich you aint you young ruffiani would give you a clout on the head go away men in couples or threes stood pensive or moved silently along the bulwarks in the waist the first busy day of a homeward passage was sinking into the dull peace of resumed routine aft on the high poop mr baker walked shuffling and grunted to himself in the pauses of his thoughts forward the lookout man erect between the flukes of the two anchors hummed an endless tune keeping his eyes fixed dutifully ahead in a vacant stare a multitude of stars coming out into the clear night peopled the emptiness of the sky they glittered as if alive above the sea they surrounded the running ship on all sides more intense than the eyes of a staring crowd and as inscrutable as the souls of men  the passage had begun and the ship a fragment detached from the earth went on lonely and swift like a small planet round her the abysses of sky and sea met in an unattainable frontier a great circular solitude moved with her ever changing and ever the same always monotonous and always imposing now and then another wandering white speck burdened with life appeared far offdisappeared intent on its own destiny the sun looked upon her all day and every morning rose with a burning round stare of undying curiosity she had her own future she was alive with the lives of those beings who trod her decks like that earth which had given her up to the sea she had an intolerable load of regrets and hopes on her lived timid truth and audacious lies and like the earth she was unconscious fair to seeand condemned by men to an ignoble fate the august loneliness of her path lent dignity to the sordid inspiration of her pilgrimage she drove foaming to the southward as if guided by the courage of a high endeavour the smiling greatness of the sea dwarfed the extent of time the days raced after one another brilliant and quick like the flashes of a lighthouse and the nights eventful and short resembled fleeting dreams  the men had shaken into their places and the halfhourly voice of the bells ruled their life of unceasing care night and day the head and shoulders of a seaman could be seen aft by the wheel outlined high against sunshine or starlight very steady above the stir of revolving spokes the faces changed passing in rotation youthful faces bearded faces dark faces faces serene or faces moody but all akin with the brotherhood of the sea all with the same attentive expression of eyes carefully watching the compass or the sails captain allistoun serious and with an old red muffler round his throat all day long pervaded the poop at night many times he rose out of the darkness of the companion such as a phantom above a grave and stood watchful and mute under the stars his nightshirt fluttering like a flagthen without a sound sank down again he was born on the shores of the pentland firth in his youth he attained the rank of harpooner in peterhead whalers when he spoke of that time his restless grey eyes became still and cold like the loom of ice afterwards he went into the east indian trade for the sake of change he had commanded the narcissus since she was built he loved his ship and drove her unmercifully for his secret ambition was to make her accomplish some day a brilliantly quick passage which would be mentioned in nautical papers he pronounced his owners name with a sardonic smile spoke but seldom to his officers and reproved errors in a gentle voice with words that cut to the quick his hair was irongrey his face hard and of the colour of pumpleather he shaved every morning of his lifeat sixbut once being caught in a fierce hurricane eighty miles southwest of mauritius he had missed three consecutive days he feared naught but an unforgiving god and wished to end his days in a little house with a plot of ground attachedfar in the countryout of sight of the sea  he the ruler of that minute world seldom descended from the olympian heights of his poop below himat his feet so to speakcommon mortals led their busy and insignificant lives along the main deck mr baker grunted in a manner bloodthirsty and innocuous and kept all our noses to the grindstone beingas he once remarkedpaid for doing that very thing the men working about the deck were healthy and contentedas most seamen are when once well out to sea the true peace of god begins at any spot a thousand miles from the nearest land and when he sends there the messengers of his might it is not in terrible wrath against crime presumption and folly but paternally to chasten simple heartsignorant hearts that know nothing of life and beat undisturbed by envy or greed  in the evening the cleared decks had a reposeful aspect resembling the autumn of the earth the sun was sinking to rest wrapped in a mantle of warm clouds forward on the end of the spare spars the boatswain and the carpenter sat together with crossed arms two men friendly powerful and deepchested beside them the short dumpy sailmakerwho had been in the navyrelated between the whiffs of his pipe impossible stories about admirals couples tramped backwards and forwards keeping step and balance without effort in a confined space pigs grunted in the big pigstye belfast leaning thoughtfully on his elbow above the bars communed with them through the silence of his meditation fellows with shirts open wide on sunburnt breasts sat upon the mooring bits and all up the steps of the forecastle ladders by the foremast a few discussed in a circle the characteristics of a gentleman one saidits money as does it another maintainedno its the way they speak lame knowles stumped up with an unwashed face he had the distinction of being the dirty man of the forecastle and showing a few yellow fangs in a shrewd smile explained craftily that he had seen some of their pants the backsides of themhe had observedwere thinner than paper from constant sitting down in offices yet otherwise they looked firstrate and would last for years it was all appearance it was he said bloomin easy to be a gentleman when you had a clean job for life they disputed endlessly obstinate and childish they repeated in shouts and with inflamed faces their amazing arguments while the soft breeze eddying down the enormous cavity of the foresail distended above their bare heads stirred the tumbled hair with a touch passing and light like an indulgent caress  they were forgetting their toil they were forgetting themselves the cook approached to hear and stood by beaming with the inward consciousness of his faith like a conceited saint unable to forget his glorious reward donkin solitary and brooding over his wrongs on the forecastlehead moved closer to catch the drift of the discussion below him he turned his sallow face to the sea and his thin nostrils moved sniffing the breeze as he lounged negligently by the rail in the glow of sunset faces shone with interest teeth flashed eyes sparkled the walking couples stood still suddenly with broad grins a man bending over a washtub sat up entranced with the soapsuds flecking his wet arms even the three petty officers listened leaning back comfortably propped and with superior smiles belfast left off scratching the ear of his favourite pig and open mouthed tried with eager eyes to have his say he lifted his arms grimacing and baffled from a distance charley screamed at the ringi know about gentlemen moren any of you ive been intermit with em ive blacked their boots the cook craning his neck to hear better was scandalised keep your mouth shut when your elders speak you impudent young heathenyou all right old hallelujah im done answered charley soothingly at some opinion of dirty knowles delivered with an air of supernatural cunning a ripple of laughter ran along rose like a wave burst with a startling roar they stamped with both feet they turned their shouting faces to the sky many spluttering slapped their thighs while one or two bent double gasped hugging themselves with both arms like men in pain the carpenter and the boatswain without changing their attitude shook with laughter where they sat the sailmaker charged with an anecdote about a commodore looked sulky the cook was wiping his eyes with a greasy rag and lame knowles astonished at his own success stood in their midst showing a slow smile  suddenly the face of donkin leaning highshouldered over the afterrail became grave something like a weak rattle was heard through the forecastle door it became a murmur it ended in a sighing groan the washerman plunged both his arms into the tub abruptly the cook became more crestfallen than an exposed backslider the boatswain moved his shoulders uneasily the carpenter got up with a spring and walked awaywhile the sailmaker seemed mentally to give his story up and began to puff at his pipe with sombre determination in the blackness of the doorway a pair of eyes glimmered white and big and staring then james waits head protruding became visible as if suspended between the two hands that grasped a doorpost on each side of the face the tassel of his blue woollen nightcap cocked forward danced gaily over his left eyelid he stepped out in a tottering stride he looked powerful as ever but showed a strange and affected unsteadiness in his gait his face was perhaps a trifle thinner and his eyes appeared rather startlingly prominent he seemed to hasten the retreat of departing light by his very presence the setting sun dipped sharply as though fleeing before our nigger a black mist emanated from him a subtle and dismal influence a something cold and gloomy that floated out and settled on all the faces like a mourning veil the circle broke up the joy of laughter died on stiffened lips there was not a smile left among all the ships company not a word was spoken many turned their backs trying to look unconcerned others with averted heads sent halfreluctant glances out of the corners of their eyes they resembled criminals conscious of misdeeds more than honest men distracted by doubt only two or three stared frankly but stupidly with lips slightly open all expected james wait to say something and at the same time had the air of knowing beforehand what he would say he leaned his back against the doorpost and with heavy eyes swept over them a glance domineering and pained like a sick tyrant overawing a crowd of abject but untrustworthy slaves  no one went away they waited in fascinated dread he said ironically with gasps between the words  thank you chaps you are nice and quiet you are yelling so before the door  he made a longer pause during which he worked his ribs in an exaggerated labour of breathing it was intolerable feet were shuffled belfast let out a groan but donkin above blinked his red eyelids with invisible eyelashes and smiled bitterly over the niggers head  the nigger went on again with surprising ease he gasped no more and his voice rang hollow and loud as though he had been talking in an empty cavern he was contemptuously angry  i tried to get a wink of sleep you know i cant sleep o nights and you come jabbering near the door here like a blooming lot of old women you think yourselves good shipmates do you much you care for a dying man  belfast spun away from the pigstye jimmy he cried tremulously if you hadnt been sick i would  he stopped the nigger waited awhile then said in a gloomy toneyou would what go an fight another such one as yourself leave me alone it wont be for long ill soon die its coming right enough  men stood around very still and with exasperated eyes it was just what they had expected and hated to hear that idea of a stalking death thrust at them many times a day like a boast and like a menace by this obnoxious nigger he seemed to take a pride in that death which so far had attended only upon the ease of his life he was overbearing about it as if no one else in the world had ever been intimate with such a companion he paraded it unceasingly before us with an affectionate persistence that made its presence indubitable and at the same time incredible no man could be suspected of such monstrous friendship was he a realityor was he a shamthis everexpected visitor of jimmys we hesitated between pity and mistrust while on the slightest provocation he shook before our eyes the bones of his bothersome and infamous skeleton he was for ever trotting him out he would talk of that coming death as though it had been already there as if it had been walking the deck outside as if it would presently come in to sleep in the only empty bunk as if it had sat by his side at every meal it interfered daily with our occupations with our leisure with our amusements we had no songs and no music in the evening because jimmy we all lovingly called him jimmy to conceal our hate of his accomplice had managed with that prospective decease of his to disturb even archies mental balance archie was the owner of the concertina but after a couple of stinging lectures from jimmy he refused to play any more he saidyons an uncanny joker i dinna ken whats wrang wi him but theres something verra wrang verra wrang its nae manner of use asking me i wont play our singers became mute because jimmy was a dying man for the same reason no chapas knowles remarkedcould drive in a nail to hang his few poor rags upon without being made aware of the enormity he committed in disturbing jimmys interminable last moments at night instead of the cheerful yell one bell turn out do you hear there hey hey hey show leg the watches were called man by man in whispers so as not to interfere with jimmys possibly last slumber on earth true he was always awake and managed as we sneaked out on deck to plant in our backs some cutting remark that for the moment made us feel as if we had been brutes and afterwards made us suspect ourselves of being fools we spoke in low tones within that focsle as though it had been a church we ate our meals in silence and dread for jimmy was capricious with his food and railed bitterly at the salt meat at the biscuits at the tea as at articles unfit for human consumptionlet alone for a dying man he would saycant you find a better slice of meat for a sick man whos trying to get home to be curedor buried but there if i had a chance you fellows would do away with it you would poison me look at what you have given me we served him in his bed with rage and humility as though we had been the base courtiers of a hated prince and he rewarded us by his unconciliating criticism he had found the secret of keeping for ever on the run the fundamental imbecility of mankind he had the secret of life that confounded dying man and he made himself master of every moment of our existence we grew desperate and remained submissive emotional little belfast was for ever on the verge of assault or on the verge of tears one evening he confided to archiefor a hapenny i would knock his ugly black head offthe skulking dodger and the straightforward archie pretended to be shocked such was the infernal spell which that casual st kitts nigger had cast upon our guileless manhood but the same night belfast stole from the galley the officers sunday fruit pie to tempt the fastidious appetite of jimmy he endangered not only his long friendship with the cook but alsoas it appearedhis eternal welfare the cook was overwhelmed with grief he did not know the culprit but he knew that wickedness flourished he knew that satan was abroad amongst those men whom he looked upon as in some way under his spiritual care whenever he saw three or four of us standing together he would leave his stove to run out and preach we fled from him and only charley who knew the thief affronted the cook with a candid gaze which irritated the good man its you i believe he groaned sorrowful and with a patch of soot on his chin its you you are a brand for the burning no more of your socks in my galley soon unofficially the information was spread about that should there be another case of stealing our marmalade an extra allowance half a pound per man would be stopped mr baker ceased to heap jocular abuse upon his favourites and grunted suspiciously at all the captains cold eyes high up on the poop glittered mistrustful as he surveyed us trooping in a small mob from halyards to braces for the usual evening pull at all the ropes such stealing in a merchant ship is difficult to check and may be taken as a declaration by men of their dislike for their officers it is a bad symptom it may end in god knows what trouble the narcissus was still a peaceful ship but mutual confidence was shaken donkin did not conceal his delight we were dismayed  then illogical belfast reproached our nigger with great fury james wait with his elbow on the pillow choked gasped outdid i ask you to bone the dratted thing blow your blamed pie it has made me worseyou little irish lunatic you belfast with scarlet face and trembling lips made a dash at him every man in the forecastle rose with a shout there was a moment of wild tumult some one shrieked piercinglyeasy belfast easy we expected belfast to strangle wait without more ado dust flew we heard through it the niggers cough metallic and explosive like a gong next moment we saw belfast hanging over him he was saying plaintivelydont dont jimmy dont be like that an angel couldnt put up with yesick as ye are he looked round at us from jimmys bedside his comical mouth twitching and through tearful eyes then he tried to put straight the disarranged blankets the unceasing whisper of the sea filled the forecastle was james wait frightened or touched or repentant he lay on his back with a hand to his side and as motionless as if his expected visitor had come at last belfast fumbled about his feet repeating with emotionyes we know ye are bad but just say what ye want done and we all know ye are badvery bad no decidedly james wait was not touched or repentant truth to say he seemed rather startled he sat up with incredible suddenness and ease ah you think i am bad do you he said gloomily in his clearest baritone voice to hear him speak sometimes you would never think there was anything wrong with that man do you well act according some of you havent sense enough to put a blanket shipshape over a sick man there leave it alone i can die anyhow belfast turned away limply with a gesture of discouragement in the silence of the forecastle full of interested men donkin pronounced distinctlywell im blowed and sniggered wait looked at him he looked at him in a quite friendly manner nobody could tell what would please our incomprehensible invalid but for us the scorn of that snigger was hard to bear  donkins position in the forecastle was distinguished but unsafe he stood on the bad eminence of a general dislike he was left alone and in his isolation he could do nothing but think of the gales of the cape of good hope and envy us the possession of warm clothing and waterproofs our seaboots our oilskin coats our wellfilled seachests were to him so many causes for bitter meditation he had none of those things and he felt instinctively that no man when the need arose would offer to share them with him he was impudently cringing to us and systematically insolent to the officers he anticipated the best results for himself from such a line of conductand was mistaken such natures forget that under extreme provocation men will be justwhether they want to be so or not donkins insolence to longsuffering mr baker became at last intolerable to us and we rejoiced when the mate one dark night tamed him for good  it was done neatly with great decency and decorum and with little noise we had been calledjust before midnightto trim the yards and donkinas usualmade insulting remarks we stood sleepily in a row with the forebrace in our hands waiting for the next order and heard in the darkness a scuffly trampling of feet an exclamation of surprise sounds of cuffs and slaps suppressed hissing whispersah will you dont dont then behave oh oh afterwards there were soft thuds mixed with the rattle of iron things as if a mans body had been tumbling helplessly amongst the mainpump rods before we could realise the situation mr bakers voice was heard very near and a little impatienthaul away men lay back on that rope and we did lay back on the rope with great alacrity as if nothing had happened the chief mate went on trimming the yards with his usual and exasperating fastidiousness we didnt at the time see anything of donkin and did not care had the chief officer thrown him overboard no man would have said as much as hallo hes gone but in truth no great harm was doneeven if donkin did lose one of his front teeth we perceived this in the morning and preserved a ceremonious silence the etiquette of the forecastle commanded us to be blind and dumb in such a case and we cherished the decencies of our life more than ordinary landsmen respect theirs charley with unpardonable want of savoir vivre yelled outave you been to your dentyst hurt ye didnt it he got a box on the ear from one of his best friends the boy was surprised and remained plunged in grief for at least three hours we were sorry for him but youth requires even more discipline than age donkin grinned venomously from that day he became pitiless told jimmy that he was a black fraud hinted to us that we were an imbecile lot daily taken in by a vulgar nigger and jimmy seemed to like the fellow  singleton lived untouched by human emotions taciturn and unsmiling he breathed amongst usin that alone resembling the rest of the crowd we were trying to be decent chaps and found it jolly difficult we oscillated between the desire of virtue and the fear of ridicule we wished to save ourselves from the pain of remorse but did not want to be made the contemptible dupes of our sentiment jimmys hateful accomplice seemed to have blown with his impure breath undreamt of subtleties into our hearts we were disturbed and cowardly that we knew singleton seemed to know nothing understand nothing we had thought him till then as wise as he looked but now we dared at times suspect him of being stupidfrom old age one day however at dinner as we sat on our boxes round a tin dish that stood on the deck within the circle of our feet jimmy expressed his general disgust with men and things in words that were particularly disgusting singleton lifted his head we became mute the old man addressing jimmy askedare you dying thus interrogated james wait appeared horribly startled and confused we all were startled mouths remained open hearts thumped eyes blinked a dropped tin fork rattled in the dish a man rose as if to go out and stood still in less than a minute jimmy pulled himself togetherwhy cant you see i am he answered shakily singleton lifted a piece of soaked biscuit his teethhe declaredhad no edge on them now to his lipswell get on with your dying he said with venerable mildness dont raise a blamed fuss with us over that job we cant help you jimmy fell back in his bunk and for a long time lay very still wiping the perspiration off his chin the dinnertins were put away quickly on deck we discussed the incident in whispers some showed a chuckling exultation many looked grave wamibo after long periods of staring dreaminess attempted abortive smiles and one of the young scandinavians much tormented by doubt ventured in the second dogwatch to approach singleton the old man did not encourage us much to speak to him and ask sheepishlyyou think he will die singleton looked upwhy of course he will die he said deliberately this seemed decisive it was promptly imparted to every one by him who had consulted the oracle shy and eager he would step up and with averted gaze recite his formulaold singleton says he will die it was a relief at last we knew that our compassion would not be misplaced and we could again smile without misgivingsbut we reckoned without donkin donkin didnt want to ave no truck with em dirty furriners when nilsen came to him with the news singleton says he will die he answered him by a spiteful and so will youyou fatheaded dutchman wish you dutchmen were all deadstead comin takin our money inter your starvin country we were appalled we perceived that after all singletons answer meant nothing we began to hate him for making fun of us all our certitudes were going we were on doubtful terms with our officers the cook had given us up for lost we had overheard the boatswains opinion that we were a crowd of softies we suspected jimmy one another and even our very selves we did not know what to do at every insignificant turn of our humble life we met jimmy overbearing and blocking the way arminarm with his awful and veiled familiar it was a weird servitude  it began a week after leaving bombay and came on us stealthily like any other great misfortune every one had remarked that jimmy from the first was very slack at his work but we thought it simply the outcome of his philosophy of life donkin saidyou put no more weight on a rope than a bloody sparrer he disdained him belfast ready for a fight exclaimed provokinglyyou dont kill yourself old manwould you he retorted with extreme scornand belfast retired one morning as we were washing decks mr baker called to himbring your broom over here wait he strolled languidly  move yourself ough grunted mr baker whats the matter with your hind legs he stopped dead short he gazed slowly with eyes that bulged out with an expression audacious and sadit isnt my legs he said its my lungs everybody listenedwhats ough whats wrong with them inquired mr baker all the watch stood around on the wet deck grinning and with brooms or buckets in their hands he said mournfullygoingor gone cant you see im a dying man i know it mr baker was disgustedthen why the devil did you ship aboard herei must live till i diemustnt i he replied the grins became audiblego off my deckget out of my sight said mr baker he was nonplussed it was a unique experience james wait obedient dropped his broom and walked slowly forward a burst of laughter followed him it was too funny all hands laughed they laughed alas  he became the tormentor of all our moments he was worse than a nightmare you couldnt see that there was anything wrong with him a nigger does not show he was not very fatcertainlybut then he was no leaner than other niggers we had known he coughed often but the most prejudiced person could perceive that mostly he coughed when it suited his purpose he wouldnt or couldnt do his workand he wouldnt lieup one day he would skip aloft with the best of them and next time we would be obliged to risk our lives to get his limp body down he was reported he was examined he was remonstrated with threatened cajoled lectured he was called into the cabin to interview the captain there were wild rumours it was said he had cheeked the old man it was said he had frightened him charley maintained that the skipper weepin as giv im is blessin an a pot of jam knowles had it from the steward that the unspeakable jimmy had been reeling against the cabin furniture that he had groaned that he had complained of general brutality and disbelief and had ended by coughing all over the old mans meteorological journals which were then spread on the table at any rate wait returned forward supported by the steward who in a pained and shocked voice entreated ushere catch hold of him one of you he is to lieup jimmy drank a tin mugful of coffee and after bullying first one and then another went to bed he remained there most of the time but when it suited him would come on deck and appear amongst us he was scornful and brooding he looked ahead upon the sea and no one could tell what was the meaning of that black man sitting apart in a meditative attitude and as motionless as a carving  he refused steadily all medicine he threw sago and cornflour overboard till the steward got tired of bringing it to him he asked for paregoric they sent him a big bottle enough to poison a wilderness of babies he kept it between his mattress and the deal lining of the ships side and nobody ever saw him take a dose donkin abused him to his face jeered at him while he gasped and the same day wait would lend him a warm jersey once donkin reviled him for half an hour reproached him with the extra work his malingering gave to the watch and ended by calling him a blackfaced swine under the spell of our accursed perversity we were horrorstruck but jimmy positively seemed to revel in that abuse it made him look cheerfuland donkin had a pair of old sea boots thrown at him here you eastend trash boomed wait you may have that  at last mr baker had to tell the captain that james wait was disturbing the peace of the ship knock discipline on the headhe will ough grunted mr baker as a matter of fact the starboard watch came as near as possible to refusing duty when ordered one morning by the boatswain to wash out their forecastle it appears jimmy objected to a wet floorand that morning we were in a compassionate mood we thought the boatswain a brute and practically told him so only mr bakers delicate tact prevented an allfired row he refused to take us seriously he came bustling forward and called us many unpolite names but in such a hearty and seamanlike manner that we began to feel ashamed of ourselves in truth we thought him much too good a sailor to annoy him willingly and after all jimmy might have been a fraudprobably was the forecastle got a clean up that morning but in the afternoon a sickbay was fitted up in the deckhouse it was a nice little cabin opening on deck and with two berths jimmys belongings were transported there and thennotwithstanding his protestsjimmy himself he said he couldnt walk four men carried him on a blanket he complained that he would have to die there alone like a dog we grieved for him and were delighted to have him removed from the forecastle we attended him as before the galley was next door and the cook looked in many times a day wait became a little more cheerful knowles affirmed having heard him laugh to himself in peals one day others had seen him walking about on deck at night his little place with the door ajar on a long hook was always full of tobacco smoke we spoke through the crack cheerfully sometimes abusively as we passed by intent on our work he fascinated us he would never let doubt die he overshadowed the ship invulnerable in his promise of speedy corruption he trampled on our selfrespect he demonstrated to us daily our want of moral courage he tainted our lives had we been a miserable gang of wretched immortals unhallowed alike by hope and fear he could not have lorded it over us with a more pitiless assertion of his sublime privilege      chapter three  meantime the narcissus with square yards ran out of the fair monsoon she drifted slowly swinging round and round the compass through a few days of baffling light airs under the patter of short warm showers grumbling men whirled the heavy yards from side to side they caught hold of the soaked ropes with groans and sighs while their officers sulky and dripping with rain water unceasingly ordered them about in wearied voices during the short respites they looked with disgust into the smarting palms of their stiff hands and asked one another bitterlywho would be a sailor if he could be a farmer all the tempers were spoilt and no man cared what he said one black night when the watch panting in the heat and halfdrowned with the rain had been through four mortal hours hunted from brace to brace belfast declared that he would chuck the sea for ever and go in a steamer this was excessive no doubt captain allistoun with great selfcontrol would mutter sadly to mr bakerit is not so badnot so bad when he had managed to shove and dodge and manoeuvre his smart ship through sixty miles in twentyfour hours from the doorstep of the little cabin jimmy chin in hand watched our distasteful labours with insolent and melancholy eyes we spoke to him gentlyand out of his sight exchanged sour smiles  then again with a fair wind and under a clear sky the ship went on piling up the south latitude she passed outside madagascar and mauritius without a glimpse of the land extra lashings were put on the spare spars hatches were looked to the steward in his leisure moments and with a worried air tried to fit washboards to the cabin doors stout canvas was bent with care anxious eyes looked to the westward towards the cape of storms the ship began to dip into a southwest swell and the softly luminous sky of low latitudes took on a harder sheen from day to day above our heads it arched high above the ship vibrating and pale like an immense dome of steel resonant with the deep voice of freshening gales the sunshine gleamed cold on the white curls of black waves before the strong breath of westerly squalls the ship with reduced sail lay slowly over obstinate and yielding she drove to and fro in the unceasing endeavour to fight her way through the invisible violence of the winds she pitched headlong into dark smooth hollows she struggled upwards over the snowy ridges of great running seas she rolled restless from side to side like a thing in pain enduring and valiant she answered to the call of men and her slim spars waving for ever in abrupt semicircles seemed to beckon in vain for help towards the stormy sky  it was a bad winter off the cape that year the relieved helmsmen came off flapping their arms or ran stamping hard and blowing into swollen red fingers the watch on deck dodged the sting of cold sprays or crouching in sheltered corners watched dismally the high and merciless seas boarding the ship time after time in unappeasable fury water tumbled in cataracts over the forecastle doors you had to dash through a waterfall to get into your damp bed the men turned in wet and turned out stiff to face the redeeming and ruthless exactions of their glorious and obscure fate far aft and peering watchfully to windward the officers could be seen through the mist of squalls they stood by the weatherrail holding on grimly straight and glistening in their long coats and in the disordered plunges of the harddriven ship they appeared high up attentive tossing violently above the grey line of a clouded horizon in motionless attitudes  they watched the weather and the ship as men on shore watch the momentous chances of fortune captain allistoun never left the deck as though he had been part of the ships fittings now and then the steward shivering but always in shirt sleeves would struggle towards him with some hot coffee half of which the gale blew out of the cup before it reached the masters lips he drank what was left gravely in one long gulp while heavy sprays pattered loudly on his oilskin coat the seas swishing broke about his high boots and he never took his eyes off the ship he kept his gaze riveted upon her as a loving man watches the unselfish toil of a delicate woman upon the slender thread of whose existence is hung the whole meaning and joy of the world we all watched her she was beautiful and had a weakness we loved her no less for that we admired her qualities aloud we boasted of them to one another as though they had been our own and the consciousness of her only fault we kept buried in the silence of our profound affection she was born in the thundering peal of hammers beating upon iron in black eddies of smoke under a grey sky on the banks of the clyde the clamorous and sombre stream gives birth to things of beauty that float away into the sunshine of the world to be loved by men the narcissus was one of that perfect brood less perfect than many perhaps but she was ours and consequently incomparable we were proud of her in bombay ignorant landlubbers alluded to her as that pretty grey ship pretty a scurvy meed of commendation we knew she was the most magnificent seaboat ever launched we tried to forget that like many good seaboats she was at times rather crank she was exacting she wanted care in loading and handling and no one knew exactly how much care would be enough such are the imperfections of mere men the ship knew and sometimes would correct the presumptuous human ignorance by the wholesome discipline of fear we had heard ominous stories about past voyages the cook technically a seaman but in reality no sailorthe cook when unstrung by some misfortune such as the rolling over of a saucepan would mutter gloomily while he wiped the floorthere look at what she has done some voyge she will drown all hands youll see if she wont to which the steward snatching in the galley a moment to draw breath in the hurry of his worried life would remark philosophicallythose that see wont tell anyhow i dont want to see it we derided those fears our hearts went out to the old man when he pressed her hard so as to make her hold her own hold to every inch gained to windward when he made her under reefed sails leap obliquely at enormous waves the men knitted together aft into a ready group by the first sharp order of an officer coming to take charge of the deck in bad weatherkeep handy the watch stood admiring her valiance their eyes blinked in the wind their dark faces were wet with drops of water more salt and bitter than human tears beards and moustaches soaked hung straight and dripping like fine seaweed they were fantastically misshapen in high boots in hats like helmets and swaying clumsily stiff and bulky in glistening oilskins they resembled men strangely equipped for some fabulous adventure whenever she rose easily to a towering green sea elbows dug ribs faces brightened lips murmureddidnt she do it cleverly and all the heads turning like one watched with sardonic grins the foiled wave go roaring to leeward white with the foam of a monstrous rage but when she had not been quick enough and struck heavily lay over trembling under the blow we clutched at ropes and looking up at the narrow bands of drenched and strained sails waving desperately aloft we thought in our heartsno wonder poor thing  the thirtysecond day out of bombay began inauspiciously in the morning a sea smashed one of the galley doors we dashed in through lots of steam and found the cook very wet and indignant with the shipshes getting worse every day shes trying to drown me in front of my own stove he was very angry we pacified him and the carpenter though washed away twice from there managed to repair the door through that accident our dinner was not ready till late but it didnt matter in the end because knowles who went to fetch it got knocked down by a sea and the dinner went over the side captain allistoun looking more hard and thinlipped than ever hung on to full topsails and foresail and would not notice that the ship asked to do too much appeared to lose heart altogether for the first time since we knew her she refused to rise and bored her way sullenly through the seas twice running as though she had been blind or weary of life she put her nose deliberately into a big wave and swept the decks from end to end as the boatswain observed with marked annoyance while we were splashing about in a body to try and save a worthless washtubevery blooming thing in the ship is going overboard this afternoon venerable singleton broke his habitual silence and said with a glance aloftthe old mans in a temper with the weather but its no good bein angry with the winds of heaven jimmy had shut his door of course we knew he was dry and comfortable within his little cabin and in our absurd way were pleased one moment exasperated the next by that certitude donkin skulked shamelessly uneasy and miserable he grumbledim perishin with cold outside in bloomin wet rags an that ere black sojer sits dry on a blamed chest full of bloomin clothes blank his black soul we took no notice of him we hardly gave a thought to jimmy and his bosom friend there was no leisure for idle probing of hearts sails blew adrift things broke loose cold and wet we were washed about the deck while trying to repair damages the ship tossed about shaken furiously like a toy in the hand of a lunatic just at sunset there was a rush to shorten sail before the menace of a sombre hail cloud the hard gust of wind came brutal like the blow of a fist the ship relieved of her canvas in time received it pluckily she yielded reluctantly to the violent onset then coming up with a stately and irresistible motion brought her spars to windward in the teeth of the screeching squall out of the abysmal darkness of the black cloud overhead white hail streamed on her rattled on the rigging leaped in handfuls off the yards rebounded on the deckround and gleaming in the murky turmoil like a shower of pearls it passed away for a moment a livid sun shot horizontally the last rays of sinister light between the hills of steep rolling waves then a wild night rushed instamped out in a great howl that dismal remnant of a stormy day  there was no sleep on board that night most seamen remember in their life one or two such nights of a culminating gale nothing seems left of the whole universe but darkness clamour furyand the ship and like the last vestige of a shattered creation she drifts bearing an anguished remnant of sinful mankind through the distress tumult and pain of an avenging terror no one slept in the forecastle the tin oillamp suspended on a long string smoking described wide circles wet clothing made dark heaps on the glistening floor a thin layer of water rushed to and fro in the bedplaces men lay booted resting on elbows and with open eyes hungup suits of oilskin swung out and in lively and disquieting like reckless ghosts of decapitated seamen dancing in a tempest no one spoke and all listened outside the night moaned and sobbed to the accompaniment of a continuous loud tremor as of innumerable drums beating far off shrieks passed through the air tremendous dull blows made the ship tremble while she rolled under the weight of the seas toppling on her deck at times she soared up swiftly as if to leave this earth for ever then during interminable moments fell through a void with all the hearts on board of her standing still till a frightful shock expected and sudden started them off again with a big thump after every dislocating jerk of the ship wamibo stretched full length his face on the pillow groaned slightly with the pain of his tormented universe now and then for the fraction of an intolerable second the ship in the fiercer burst of a terrible uproar remained on her side vibrating and still with a stillness more appalling than the wildest motion then upon all those prone bodies a stir would pass a shiver of suspense a man would protrude his anxious head and a pair of eyes glistened in the sway of light glaring wildly some moved their legs a little as if making ready to jump out but several motionless on their backs and with one hand gripping hard the edge of the bunk smoked nervously with quick puffs staring upwards immobilised in a great craving for peace  at midnight orders were given to furl the fore and mizen topsails with immense efforts men crawled aloft through a merciless buffeting saved the canvas and crawled down almost exhausted to bear in panting silence the cruel battering of the seas perhaps for the first time in the history of the merchant service the watch told to go below did not leave the deck as if compelled to remain there by the fascination of a venomous violence at every heavy gust men huddled together whispered to one anotherit can blow no harder and presently the gale would give them the lie with a piercing shriek and drive their breath back into their throats a fierce squall seemed to burst asunder the thick mass of sooty vapours and above the wrack of torn clouds glimpses could be caught of the high moon rushing backwards with frightful speed over the sky right into the winds eye many hung their heads muttering that it turned their inwards out to look at it soon the clouds closed up and the world again became a raging blind darkness that howled flinging at the lonely ship salt sprays and sleet  about halfpast seven the pitchy obscurity round us turned a ghastly grey and we knew that the sun had risen this unnatural and threatening daylight in which we could see one anothers wild eyes and drawn faces was only an added tax on our endurance the horizon seemed to have come on all sides within arms length of the ship into that narrowed circle furious seas leaped in struck and leaped out a rain of salt heavy drops flew aslant like mist the maintopsail had to be goosewinged and with stolid resignation every one prepared to go aloft once more but the officers yelled pushed back and at last we understood that no more men would be allowed to go on the yard than were absolutely necessary for the work as at any moment the masts were likely to be jumped out or blown overboard we concluded that the captain didnt want to see all his crowd go over the side at once that was reasonable the watch then on duty led by mr creighton began to struggle up the rigging the wind flattened them against the ratlines then easing a little would let them ascend a couple of steps and again with a sudden gust pin all up the shrouds the whole crawling line in attitudes of crucifixion the other watch plunged down on the main deck to haul up the sail mens heads bobbed up as the water flung them irresistibly from side to side mr baker grunted encouragingly in our midst spluttering and blowing amongst the tangled ropes like an energetic porpoise favoured by an ominous and untrustworthy lull the work was done without any one being lost either off the deck or from the yard for the moment the gale seemed to take off and the ship as if grateful for our efforts plucked up heart and made better weather of it  at eight the men off duty watching their chance ran forward over the flooded deck to get some rest the other half of the crew remained aft for their turn of seeing her through her trouble as they expressed it the two mates urged the master to go below mr baker grunted in his earough surely now ough confidence in us nothing more to do she must lay it out or go  ough ough tall young mr creighton smiled down at him cheerfullyshes as right as a trivet take a spell sir he looked at them stonily with bloodshot sleepless eyes the rims of his eyelids were scarlet and he moved his jaws unceasingly with a slow effort as though he had been masticating a lump of indiarubber he shook his head he repeatednever mind me i must see it outi must see it out but he consented to sit down for a moment on the skylight with his hard face turned unflinchingly to windward the sea spat at itand stoical it streamed with water as though he had been weeping on the weather side of the poop the watch hanging on to the mizen rigging and to one another tried to exchange encouraging words singleton at the wheel yelled outlook out for yourselves his voice reached them in a warning whisper they were startled  a big foaming sea came out of the mist it made for the ship roaring wildly and in its rush it looked as mischievous and discomposing as a madman with an axe one or two shouting scrambled up the rigging most with a convulsive catch of the breath held on where they stood singleton dug his knees under the wheelbox and carefully eased the helm to the headlong pitch of the ship but without taking his eyes off the coming wave it towered closeto and high like a wall of green glass topped with snow the ship rose to it as though she had soared on wings and for a moment rested poised upon the foaming crest as if she had been a great seabird before we could draw breath a heavy gust struck her another roller took her unfairly under the weather bow she gave a toppling lurch and filled her decks captain allistoun leaped up and fell archie rolled over him screamingshe will rise  she gave another lurch to leeward the lower deadeyes dipped heavily the mens feet flew from under them and they hung kicking above the slanting poop they could see the ship putting her side in the water and shouted all togethershes going forward the forecastle doors flew open and the watch below were seen leaping out one after another throwing their arms up and falling on hands and knees scrambled aft on all fours along the high side of the deck sloping more than the roof of a house from leeward the seas rose pursuing them they looked wretched in a hopeless struggle like vermin fleeing before a flood they fought up the weather ladder of the poop one after another half naked and staring wildly and as soon as they got up they shot to leeward in clusters with closed eyes till they brought up heavily with their ribs against the iron stanchions of the rail then groaning they rolled in a confused mass the immense volume of water thrown forward by the last scend of the ship had burst the lee door of the forecastle they could see their chests pillows blankets clothing come out floating upon the sea while they struggled back to windward they looked in dismay the straw beds swam high the blankets spread out undulated while the chests waterlogged and with a heavy list pitched heavily like dismasted hulks before they sank archies big coat passed with outspread arms resembling a drowned seaman floating with his head under water men were slipping down while trying to dig their fingers into the planks others jammed in corners rolled enormous eyes they all yelled unceasinglythe masts cut cut a black squall howled low over the ship that lay on her side with the weather yardarms pointing to the clouds while the tall masts inclined nearly to the horizon seemed to be of an immeasurable length the carpenter let go his hold rolled against the skylight and began to crawl to the cabin entrance where a big axe was kept ready for just such an emergency at that moment the topsail sheet parted the end of the heavy chain racketed aloft and sparks of red fire streamed down through the flying sprays the sail flapped once with a jerk that seemed to tear our hearts out through our teeth and instantly changed into a bunch of fluttering narrow ribbons that tied themselves into knots and became quiet along the yard captain allistoun struggled managed to stand up with his face near the deck upon which men swung on the ends of ropes like nest robbers upon a cliff one of his feet was on somebodys chest his face was purple his lips moved he yelled also he yelled bending downno no mr baker one leg over the binnaclestand roared outdid you say no not cut he shook his head madly no no between his legs the crawling carpenter heard collapsed at once and lay full length in the angle of the skylight voices took up the shoutno no then all became still they waited for the ship to turn over altogether and shake them out into the sea and upon the terrific noise of wind and sea not a murmur of remonstrance came out from those men who each would have given ever so many years of life to see them damned sticks go overboard they all believed it their only chance but a little hardfaced man shook his grey head and shouted no without giving them as much as a glance they were silent and gasped they gripped rails they had wound ropesends under their arms they clutched ringbolts they crawled in heaps where there was foothold they held on with both arms hooked themselves to anything to windward with elbows with chins almost with their teeth and some unable to crawl away from where they had been flung felt the sea leap up striking against their backs as they struggled upwards singleton had stuck to the wheel his hair flew out in the wind the gale seemed to take its lifelong adversary by the beard and shake his old head he wouldnt let go and with his knees forced between the spokes flew up and down like a man on a bough as death appeared unready they began to look about donkin caught by one foot in a loop of some rope hung head down below us and yelled with his face to the deckcut cut two men lowered themselves cautiously to him others hauled on the rope they caught him up shoved him into a safer place held him he shouted curses at the master shook his fist at him with horrible blasphemies called upon us in filthy words to cut dont mind that murdering fool cut some of you one of his rescuers struck him a backhanded blow over the mouth his head banged on the deck and he became suddenly very quiet with a white face breathing hard and with a few drops of blood trickling from his cut lip on the lee side another man could be seen stretched out as if stunned only the washboard prevented him from going over the side it was the steward we had to sling him up like a bale for he was paralysed with fright he had rushed up out of the pantry when he felt the ship go over and had rolled down helplessly clutching a china mug it was not broken with difficulty we tore it away from him and when he saw it in our hands he was amazed where did you get that thing he kept on asking us in a trembling voice his shirt was blown to shreds the ripped sleeves flapped like wings two men made him fast and doubled over the rope that held him he resembled a bundle of wet rags mr baker crawled along the line of men askingare you all there and looking them over some blinked vacantly others shook convulsively wamibos head hung over his breast and in painful attitudes cut by lashings exhausted with clutching screwed up in corners they breathed heavily their lips twitched and at every sickening heave of the overturned ship they opened them wide as if to shout the cook embracing a wooden stanchion unconsciously repeated a prayer in every short interval of the fiendish noises around he could be heard there without cap or slippers imploring in that storm the master of our lives not to lead him into temptation soon he also became silent in all that crowd of cold and hungry men waiting wearily for a violent death not a voice was heard they were mute and in sombre thoughtfulness listened to the horrible imprecations of the gale  hours passed they were sheltered by the heavy inclination of the ship from the wind that rushed in one long unbroken moan above their heads but cold rain showers fell at times into the uneasy calm of their refuge under the torment of that new infliction a pair of shoulders would writhe a little teeth chattered the sky was clearing and bright sunshine gleamed over the ship after every burst of battering seas vivid and fleeting rainbows arched over the drifting hull in the flick of sprays the gale was ending in a clear blow which gleamed and cut like a knife between two bearded shellbacks charley fastened with somebodys long muffler to a deck ringbolt wept quietly with rare tears wrung out by bewilderment cold hunger and general misery one of his neighbours punched him in the ribs asking roughlywhats the matter with your cheek in fine weather theres no holding you youngster turning about with prudence he worked himself out of his coat and threw it over the boy the other man closed up mutteringtwill make a bloomin man of you sonny they flung their arms over and pressed against him charley drew his feet up and his eyelids dropped sighs were heard as men perceiving that they were not to be drowned in a hurry tried easier positions mr creighton who had hurt his leg lay amongst us with compressed lips some fellows belonging to his watch set about securing him better without a word or a glance he lifted his arms one after another to facilitate the operation and not a muscle moved in his stern young face they asked him with solicitudeeasier now sir he answered with a curtthatll do he was a hard young officer but many of his watch used to say they liked him well enough because he had such a gentlemanly way of damning us up and down the deck others unable to discern such fine shades of refinement respected him for his smartness for the first time since the ship had gone on her beam ends captain allistoun gave a short glance down at his men he was almost uprightone foot against the side of the skylight one knee on the deck and with the end of the vang round his waist swung back and forth with his gaze fixed ahead watchful like a man looking out for a sign before his eyes the ship with half her deck below water rose and fell on heavy seas that rushed from under her flashing in the cold sunshine we began to think she was wonderfully buoyantconsidering confident voices were heard shoutingshell do boys belfast exclaimed with fervouri would giv a months pay for a draw at a pipe one or two passing dry tongues on their salt lips muttered something about a drink of water the cook as if inspired scrambled up with his breast against the poop watercask and looked in there was a little at the bottom he yelled waving his arms and two men began to crawl backwards and forwards with the mug we had a good mouthful all round the master shook his head impatiently refusing when it came to charley one of his neighbours shoutedthat bloomin boys asleep he slept as though he had been dosed with narcotics they let him be singleton held to the wheel with one hand while he drank bending down to shelter his lips from the wind wamibo had to be poked and yelled at before he saw the mug held before his eyes knowles said sagaciouslyits bettern a tot o rum mr baker gruntedthank ye mr creighton drank and nodded donkin gulped greedily glaring over the rim belfast made us laugh when with grimacing mouth he shoutedpass it this way were all taytottlers here the master presented with the mug again by a crouching man who screamed up at himwe all had a drink captain groped for it without ceasing to look ahead and handed it back stiffly as though he could not spare half a glance away from the ship faces brightened we shouted to the cookwell done doctor he sat to leeward propped by the watercask and yelled back abundantly but the seas were breaking in thunder just then and we only caught snatches that sounded like providence and born again he was at his old game of preaching we made friendly but derisive gestures at him and from below he lifted one arm holding on with the other moved his lips he beamed up to us straining his voiceearnest and ducking his head before the sprays  suddenly some one criedwheres jimmy and we were appalled once more on the end of the row the boatswain shouted hoarselyhas any one seed him come out voices exclaimed dismallydrownedis he no in his cabin good lord caught like a bloomin rat in a trap couldnt open his door aye she went over too quick and the water jammed it poor beggar no help for im lets go and see damn him who could go screamed donkinnobody expects you to growled the man next to him youre only a thingis there half a chance to get at im inquired two or three men together belfast untied himself with blind impetuosity and all at once shot down to leeward quicker than a flash of lightning we shouted all together with dismay but with his legs overboard he held and yelled for a rope in our extremity nothing could be terrible so we judged him funny kicking there and with his scared face some one began to laugh and as if hysterically infected with screaming merriment all those haggard men went off laughing wildeyed like a lot of maniacs tied up on a wall mr baker swung off the binnaclestand and tendered him one leg he scrambled up rather scared and consigning us with abominable words to the divvle you are ough youre a foulmouthed beggar craik grunted mr baker he answered stuttering with indignationlook at em sorr the bloomin dirty images laughing at a chum going overboard call themselves men too but from the break of the poop the boatswain called outcome along and belfast crawled away in a hurry to join him the five men poised and gazing over the edge of the poop looked for the best way to get forward they seemed to hesitate the others twisting in their lashings turning painfull stared with open lips captain allistoun saw nothing he seemed with his eyes to hold the ship up in a superhuman concentration of effort the wind screamed loud in sunshine columns of spray rose straight up and in the glitter of rainbows bursting over the trembling hull the men went over cautiously disappearing from sight with deliberate movements  they went swinging from belaying pin to cleat above the seas that beat the halfsubmerged deck their toes scraped the planks lumps of green cold water toppled over the bulwark and on their heads they hung for a moment on strained arms with the breath knocked out of them and with closed eyesthen letting go with one hand balanced with lolling heads trying to grab some rope or stanchion further forward the longarmed and athletic boatswain swung quickly gripping things with a fist hard as iron and remembering suddenly snatches of the last letter from his old woman little belfast scrambled in a rage spluttering cursed nigger wamibos tongue hung out with excitement and archie intrepid and calm watched his chance to move with intelligent coolness  when above the side of the house they let go one after another and falling heavily sprawled pressing their palms to the smooth teak wood round them the backwash of waves seethed white and hissing all the doors had become trapdoors of course the first was the galley door the galley extended from side to side and they could hear the sea splashing with hollow noises in there the next door was that of the carpenters shop they lifted it and looked down the room seemed to have been devastated by an earthquake everything in it had tumbled on the bulkhead facing the door and on the other side of that bulkhead there was jimmy dead or alive the bench a halffinished meatsafe saws chisels wire rods axes crowbars lay in a heap besprinkled with loose nails a sharp adze stuck up with a shining edge that gleamed dangerously down there like a wicked smile the men clung to one another peering a sickening sly lurch of the ship nearly sent them overboard in a body belfast howled here goes and leaped down archie followed cannily catching at shelves that gave way with him and eased himself in a great crash of ripped wood there was hardly room for three men to move and in the sunshiny blue square of the door the boatswains face bearded and dark wamibos face wild and pale hung overwatching  together they shouted jimmy jim from above the boatswain contributed a deep growl you wait in a pause belfast entreated jimmy darlin are ye aloive the boatswain said again all together boys all yelled excitedly wamibo made noises resembling loud barks belfast drummed on the side of the bulkhead with a piece of iron all ceased suddenly the sound of screaming and hammering went on thin and distinctlike a solo after a chorus he was alive he was screaming and knocking below us with the hurry of a man prematurely shut up in a coffin we went to work we attacked with desperation the abominable heap of things heavy of things sharp of things clumsy to handle the boatswain crawled away to find somewhere a flying end of a rope and wamibo held back by shoutsdont jump dont come in here muddleheadremained glaring above usall shining eyes gleaming fangs tumbled hair resembling an amazed and halfwitted fiend gloating over the extraordinary agitation of the damned the boatswain adjured us to bear a hand and a rope descended we made things fast to it and they went up spinning never to be seen by man again a rage to fling things overboard possessed us we worked fiercely cutting our hands and speaking brutally to one another jimmy kept up a distracting row he screamed piercingly without drawing breath like a tortured woman he banged with hands and feet the agony of his fear wrung our hearts so terribly that we longed to abandon him to get out of that place deep as a well and swaying like a tree to get out of his hearing back on the poop where we could wait passively for death in incomparable repose we shouted to him to shut up for gods sake he redoubled his cries he must have fancied we could not hear him probably he heard his own clamour but faintly we could picture him crouching on the edge of the upper berth letting out with both fists at the wood in the dark and with his mouth wide open for that unceasing cry those were loathsome moments a cloud driving across the sun would darken the doorway menacingly every movement of the ship was pain we scrambled about with no room to breathe and felt frightfully sick the boatswain yelled down at usbear a hand bear a hand we two will be washed away from here directly if you aint quick three times a sea leaped over the high side and flung bucketfuls of water on our heads then jimmy startled by the shock would stop his noise for a momentwaiting for the ship to sink perhapsand began again distressingly loud as if invigorated by the gust of fear at the bottom the nails lay in a layer several inches thick it was ghastly every nail in the world not driven in firmly somewhere seemed to have found its way into that carpenters shop there they were of all kinds the remnants of stores from seven voyages tintacks copper tacks sharp as needles pump nails with big heads like tiny iron mushrooms nails without any heads horrible french nails polished and slim they lay in a solid mass more inabordable than a hedgehog we hesitated yearning for a shovel while jimmy below us yelled as though he had been flayed groaning we dug our fingers in and very much hurt shook our hands scattering nails and drops of blood we passed up our hats full of assorted nails to the boatswain who as if performing a mysterious and appeasing rite cast them wide upon a raging sea  we got to the bulkhead at last those were stout planks she was a ship well finished in every detailthe narcissus was they were the stoutest planks ever put into a ships bulkheadwe thoughtand then we perceived that in our hurry we had sent all the tools overboard absurd little belfast wanted to break it down with his own weight and with both feet leaped straight up like a springbok cursing the clyde shipwrights for not scamping their work incidentally he reviled all north britain the rest of the earth the seaand all his companions he swore as he alighted heavily on his heels that he would never never any more associate with any fool that hadnt savee enough to know his knee from his elbow he managed by his thumping to scare the last remnant of wits out of jimmy we could hear the object of our exasperated solicitude darting to and fro under the planks he had cracked his voice at last and could only squeak miserably his back or else his head rubbed the planks now here now there in a puzzling manner he squeaked as he dodged the invisible blows it was more heartrending even than his yells suddenly archie produced a crowbar he had kept it back also a small hatchet we howled with satisfaction he struck a mighty blow and small chips flew at our eyes the boatswain above shoutedlook out look out there dont kill the man easy does it wamibo maddened with excitement hung head down and insanely urged ushoo strookim hoo hoo we were afraid he would fall in and kill one of us and hurriedly we entreated the boatswain to shove the blamed finn overboard then all together we yelled down at the planksstand from under get forward and listened we only heard the deep hum and moan of the wind above us the mingled roar and hiss of the seas the ship as if overcome with despair wallowed lifelessly and our heads swam with that unnatural motion belfast clamouredfor the love of god jimmy where are ye knock jimmy darlint knock you bloody black beast knock he was as quiet as a dead man inside a grave and like men standing above a grave we were on the verge of tearsbut with vexation the strain the fatigue with the great longing to be done with it to get away and lie down to rest somewhere where we could see our danger and breathe archie shoutedgie me room we crouched behind him guarding our heads and he struck time after time in the joint of planks they cracked suddenly the crowbar went halfway in through a splintered oblong hole it must have missed jimmys head by less than an inch archie withdrew it quickly and that infamous nigger rushed at the hole put his lips to it and whispered help in an almost extinct voice he pressed his head to it trying madly to get out through that opening one inch wide and three inches long in our disturbed state we were absolutely paralysed by his incredible action it seemed impossible to drive him away even archie at last lost his composure if ye dont clear oot ill drive the crowbar thro your head he shouted in a determined voice he meant what he said and his earnestness seemed to make an impression on jimmy he disappeared suddenly and we set to prising and tearing at the planks with the eagerness of men trying to get at a mortal enemy and spurred by the desire to tear him limb from limb the wood split cracked gave way belfast plunged in head and shoulders and groped viciously ive got im got im he shouted oh there hes gone ive got im pull at my legs pull wamibo hooted unceasingly the boatswain shouted directionscatch hold of his hair belfast pull straight up you two pull fair we pulled fair we pulled belfast out with a jerk and dropped him with disgust in a sitting posture purplefaced he sobbed despairinglyhow can i hold on to is blooming short wool suddenly jimmys head and shoulders appeared he stuck halfway and with rolling eyes foamed at our feet we flew at him with brutal impatience we tore the shirt off his back we tugged at his ears we panted over him and all at once he came away in our hands as though somebody had let go his legs with the same movement without a pause we swung him up his breath whistled he kicked our upturned faces he grasped two pairs of arms above his head and he squirmed up with such precipitation that he seemed positively to escape from our hands like a bladder full of gas streaming with perspiration we swarmed up the rope and coming into the blast of cold wind gasped like men plunged into icy water with burning faces we shivered to the very marrow of our bones never before had the gale seemed to us more furious the sea more mad the sunshine more merciless and mocking and the position of the ship more hopeless and appalling every movement of her was ominous of the end of her agony and of the beginning of ours we staggered away from the door and alarmed by a sudden roll fell down in a bunch it appeared to us that the side of the house was more smooth than glass and more slippery than ice there was nothing to hang on to but a long brass hook used sometimes to keep back an open door wamibo held on to it and we held on to wamibo clutching our jimmy he had completely collapsed now he did not seem to have the strength to close his hand we stuck to him blindly in our fear we were not afraid of wamibo letting go we remembered that the brute was stronger than any three men in the ship but we were afraid of the hook giving way and we also believed that the ship had made up her mind to turn over at last but she didnt a sea swept over us the boatswain splutteredup and away theres a lull away aft with you or we will all go to the devil here we stood up surrounding jimmy we begged him to hold up to hold on at least he glared with his bulging eyes mute as a fish and with all the stiffening knocked out of him he wouldnt stand he wouldnt even as much as clutch at our necks he was only a cold black skin loosely stuffed with soft cotton wool his arms and legs swung jointless and pliable his head rolled about the lower lip hung down enormous and heavy we pressed round him bothered and dismayed sheltering him we swung here and there in a body and on the very brink of eternity we tottered all together with concealing and absurd gestures like a lot of drunken men embarrassed with a stolen corpse  something had to be done we had to get him aft a rope was tied slack under his armpits and reaching up at the risk of our lives we hung him on the foresheet cleet he emitted no sound he looked as ridiculously lamentable as a doll that had lost half its sawdust and we started on our perilous journey over the main deck dragging along with care that pitiful that limp that hateful burden he was not very heavy but had he weighed a ton he could not have been more awkward to handle we literally passed him from hand to hand now and then we had to hang him up on a handy belayingpin to draw a breath and reform the line had the pin broken he would have irretrievably gone into the southern ocean but he had to take his chance of that and after a little while becoming apparently aware of it he groaned slightly and with a great effort whispered a few words we listened eagerly he was reproaching us with our carelessness in letting him run such risks now after i got myself out from there he breathed out weakly there was his cabin and he got himself out we had nothing to do with it apparently no matter we went on and let him take his chances simply because we could not help it for though at that time we hated him more than evermore than anything under heavenwe did not want to lose him we had so far saved him and it had become a personal matter between us and the sea we meant to stick to him had we by an incredible hypothesis undergone similar toil and trouble for an empty cask that cask would have become as precious to us as jimmy was more precious in fact because we would have had no reason to hate the cask and we hated james wait we could not get rid of the monstrous suspicion that this astounding blackman was shamming sick had been malingering heartlessly in the face of our toil of our scorn of our patienceand now was malingering in the face of our devotionin the face of death our vague and imperfect morality rose with disgust at his unmanly lie but he stuck to it manfullyamazingly no it couldnt be he was at all extremity his cantankerous temper was only the result of the provoking invincibleness of that death he felt by his side any man may be angry with such a masterful chum but then what kind of men were wewith our thoughts indignation and doubt grappled within us in a scuffle that trampled upon the finest of our feelings and we hated him because of the suspicion we detested him because of the doubt we could not scorn him safelyneither could we pity him without risk to our dignity so we hated him and passed him carefully from hand to hand we cried got himyes all right let go  and he swung from one enemy to another showing about as much life as an old bolster would do his eyes made two narrow white slits in the black face the air escaped through his lips with a noise like the sound of bellows we reached the poop ladder at last and it being a comparatively safe place we lay for a moment in an exhausted heap to rest a little he began to mutter we were always incurably anxious to hear what he had to say this time he mumbled peevishly it took you some time to come i began to think the whole smart lot of you had been washed overboard what kept you back hey funk we said nothing with sighs we started again to drag him up the secret and ardent desire of our hearts was the desire to beat him viciously with our fists about the head and we handled him as tenderly as though he had been made of glass  the return on the poop was like the return of wanderers after many years amongst people marked by the desolation of time eyes were turned slowly in their sockets glancing at us faint murmurs were heard have you got im after all the wellknown faces looked strange and familiar they seemed faded and grimy they had a mingled expression of fatigue and eagerness they seemed to have become much thinner during our absence as if all these men had been starving for a long time in their abandoned attitudes the captain with a round turn of a rope on his wrist and kneeling on one knee swung with a face cold and stiff but with living eyes he was still holding the ship up heeding no one as if lost in the unearthly effort of that endeavour we fastened up james wait in a safe place mr baker scrambled along to lend a hand mr creighton on his back and very pale muttered well done and gave us jimmy and the sky a scornful glance then closed his eyes slowly here and there a man stirred a little but most of them remained apathetic in cramped positions muttering between shivers the sun was setting a sun enormous unclouded and red declining low as if bending down to look into their faces the wind whistled across long sunbeams that resplendent and cold struck full on the dilated pupils of staring eyes without making them wink the wisps of hair and the tangled beards were grey with the salt of the sea the faces were earthy and the dark patches under the eyes extended to the ears smudged into the hollows of sunken cheeks the lips were livid and thin and when they moved it was with difficulty as though they had been glued to the teeth some grinned sadly in the sunlight shaking with cold others were sad and still charley subdued by the sudden disclosure of the insignificance of his youth darted fearful glances the two smoothfaced norwegians resembled decrepit children staring stupidly to leeward on the edge of the horizon black seas leaped up towards the glowing sun it sank slowly round and blazing and the crests of waves splashed on the edge of the luminous circle one of the norwegians appeared to catch sight of it and after giving a violent start began to speak his voice startling the others made them stir they moved their heads stiffly or turning with difficulty looked at him with surprise with fear or in grave silence he chattered at the setting sun nodding his head while the big seas began to roll across the crimson disc and over miles of turbulent waters the shadows of high waves swept with a running darkness the faces of men a crested roller broke with a loud hissing roar and the sun as if put out disappeared the chattering voice faltered went out together with the light there were sighs in the sudden lull that follows the crash of a broken sea a man said wearily heres that blooming dutchman gone off his chump a seaman lashed by the middle tapped the deck with his open hand with unceasing quick flaps in the gathering greyness of twilight a bulky form was seen rising aft and began marching on all fours with the movements of some big cautious beast it was mr baker passing along the line of men he grunted encouragingly over every one felt their fastenings some with halfopen eyes puffed like men oppressed by heat others mechanically and in dreamy voices answered him aye aye sir he went from one to another grunting ough see her through it yet and unexpectedly with loud angry outbursts blew up knowles for cutting off a long piece from the fall of the relieving tackle oughashamed of yourselfrelieving tackledont you know betteroughable seaman ough the lame man was crushed he muttered get somthink for a lashing for myself sirough lashingyourself are you a tinker or a sailorwhat oughmay want that tackle directlyoughmore use to the ship than your lame carcass oughkeep itkeep it now youve done it  he crawled away slowly muttering to himself about some men being worse than children it had been a comforting row low exclamations were heard hallo hallo those who had been painfully dozing asked with convulsive starts whats up what is it the answers came with unexpected cheerfulness the mate is going baldheaded for lame jack about something or other no what as he done some one even chuckled it was like a whiff of hope like a reminder of safe days donkin who had been stupefied with fear revived suddenly and began to shoutear im thats the way they tawlk to us vy donch ee it imone ov yer it im it im comin the mate over us we are as good men as ee were all goin to ell now we ave been starved in this rotten ship an now were goin to be drowned for them black earted bullies it im he shrieked in the deepening gloom he blubbered and sobbed screamingit im it im the rage and fear of his disregarded right to live tried the steadfastness of hearts more than the menacing shadows of the night that advanced through the unceasing clamour of the gale from aft mr baker was heardis one of you men going to stop himmust i come along shut up keep quiet cried various voices exasperated trembling with coldyoull get one across the mug from me directly said an invisible seaman in a weary tone i wont let the mate have the trouble he ceased and lay still with the silence of despair on the black sky the stars coming out gleamed over an inky sea that speckled with foam flashed back at them the evanescent and pale light of a dazzling whiteness born from the black turmoil of the waves remote in the eternal calm they glittered hard and cold above the uproar of the earth they surrounded the vanquished and tormented ship on all sides more pitiless than the eyes of a triumphant mob and as unapproachable as the hearts of men  the icy south wind howled exultingly under the sombre splendour of the sky the cold shook the men with a resistless violence as though it had tried to shake them to pieces short moans were swept unheard off the stiff lips some complained in mutters of not feeling themselves below the waist while those who had closed their eyes imagined they had a block of ice on their chests others alarmed at not feeling any pain in their fingers beat the deck feebly with their handsobstinate and exhausted wamibo stared vacant and dreamy the scandinavians kept on a meaningless mutter through chattering teeth the spare scotchmen with determined efforts kept their lower jaws still the westcountry men lay big and stolid in an invulnerable surliness a man yawned and swore in turns another breathed with a rattle in his throat two elderly hardweather shellbacks fast side by side whispered dismally to one another about the landlady of a boardinghouse in sunderland whom they both knew they extolled her motherliness and her liberality they tried to talk about the joint of beef and the big fire in the downstairs kitchen the words dying faintly on their lips ended in light sighs a sudden voice cried into the cold night o lord no one changed his position or took any notice of the cry one or two passed with a repeated and vague gesture their hand over their faces but most of them kept very still in the benumbed immobility of their bodies they were excessively wearied by their thoughts which rushed with the rapidity and vividness of dreams now and then by an abrupt and startling exclamation they answered the weird hail of some illusion then again in silence contemplated the vision of known faces and familiar things they recalled the aspect of forgotten shipmates and heard the voice of dead and gone skippers they remembered the noise of gaslit streets the steamy heat of taprooms or the scorching sunshine of calm days at sea  mr baker left his insecure place and crawled with stoppages along the poop in the dark and on all fours he resembled some carnivorous animal prowling amongst corpses at the break propped to windward of a stanchion he looked down on the main deck it seemed to him that the ship had a tendency to stand up a little more the wind had eased a little he thought but the sea ran as high as ever the waves foamed viciously and the lee side of the deck disappeared under a hissing whiteness as of boiling milk while the rigging sang steadily with a deep vibrating note and at every upward swing of the ship the wind rushed with a longdrawn clamour amongst the spars mr baker watched very still a man near him began to make a blabbing noise with his lips all at once and very loud as though the cold had broken brutally through him he went onbabababrrrbrrbabastop that cried mr baker groping in the dark stop it he went on shaking the leg he found under his handwhat is it sir called out belfast in the tone of a man awakened suddenly we are looking after that ere jimmyare you ough dont make that row then whos that near youits methe boatswain sir growled the westcountry man we are trying to keep life in that poor devilaye aye said mr baker do it quietly cant youhe wants us to hold him up

us all a chance said some one with a sighthe old man wouldnt have it much he cares for us whispered anothercare for you exclaimed mr baker angrily why should he care for you are you a lot of women passengers to be taken care of we are here to take care of the shipand some of you aint up to that ough what have you done so very smart to be taken care of ough some of you cant stand a bit of a breeze without crying over itcome sorr we aint so bad protested belfast in a voice shaken by shivers we aint brragain shouted the mate grabbing at the shadowy form again why youre in your shirt what

vigorouslyyou brrr you wouldnt be white if you were ever so well i will fight you brrrr in fine weather brrr  with one hand tied behind my back brrrrrri dont want your ragsi want air gasped out the other faintly as if suddenly exhausted  the sprays swept over whistling and pattering men disturbed in their peaceful torpor by the pain of quarrelsome shouts moaned muttering curses mr baker crawled off a little way to leeward where a watercask loomed up big with something white against it is it you podmore asked mr baker he had to repeat the question twice before the cook turned coughing feeblyyes sir ive been praying in my mind for a quick deliverance for i am prepared for any call ilook here cook interrupted mr baker the men are perishing with coldcold said the cook mournfully they will be warm enough before longwhat asked mr baker looking along the deck into the faint sheen of frothing waterthey are a wicked lot continued the cook solemnly but in an unsteady voice about as wicked as any ships company in this sinful world now ihe trembled so that he could hardly speak his was an exposed place and in a cotton shirt a thin pair of trousers and with his knees under his nose he received quaking the flicks of stinging salt drops his voice sounded exhaustednow iany time  my eldest youngster mr baker a clever boy last sunday on shore before this voyage he wouldnt go to church sir says i you go and clean yourself or ill know the reason why what does he do pond mr bakerfell into the pond in his best rig sir accident nothing will save you fine scholar though you are says i accident i whopped him sir till i couldnt lift my arm his voice faltered i whopped im he repeated rattling his teeth then after a while let out a mournful sound that was half a groan half a snore mr baker shook him by the shoulders hey cook hold up podmore tell meis there any fresh water in the galley tank the ship is lying along less i think i would try to get forward a little water would do them good hallo look out look out the cook strugglednot you sirnot you he began to scramble to windward galley my business he shoutedcooks going crazy now said several voices he yelledcrazy am i i am more ready to die than any of you officers incloosivethere as long as she swims i will cook i will get you coffeecook ye are a gentleman cried belfast but the cook was already going over the weatherladder he stopped for a moment to shout back on the poopas long as she swims i will cook and disappeared as though he had gone overboard the men who had heard sent after him a cheer that sounded like a wail of sick children an hour or more afterwards some one said distinctly hes gone for goodvery likely assented the boatswain even in fine weather he was as smart about the deck as a milchcow on her first voyage we ought to go and see nobody moved as the hours dragged slowly through the darkness mr baker crawled back and forth along the poop several times some men fancied they had heard him exchange murmurs with the master but at that time the memories were incomparably more vivid than anything actual and they were not certain whether the murmurs were heard now or many years ago they did not try to find out a mutter more or less did not matter it was too cold for curiosity and almost for hope they could not spare a moment or a thought from the great mental occupation of wishing to live and the desire of life kept them alive apathetic and enduring under the cruel persistence of wind and cold while the bestarred black dome of the sky revolved slowly above the ship that drifted bearing their patience and their suffering through the stormy solitude of the sea  huddled close to one another they fancied themselves utterly alone they heard sustained loud noises and again bore the pain of existence through long hours of profound silence in the night they saw sunshine felt warmth and suddenly with a start thought that the sun would never rise upon a freezing world some heard laughter listened to songs others near the end of the poop could hear loud human shrieks and opening their eyes were surprised to hear them still though very faint and far away the boatswain saidwhy its the cook hailing from forward i think he hardly believed his own words or recognised his own voice it was a long time before the man next to him gave a sign of life he punched hard his other neighbour and saidthe cooks shouting many did not understand others did not care the majority further aft did not believe but the boatswain and another man had the pluck to crawl away forward to see they seemed to have been gone for hours and were very soon forgotten then suddenly men who had been plunged in a hopeless resignation became as if possessed with a desire to hurt they belaboured one another with fists in the darkness they struck persistently anything soft they could feel near and with a greater effort than for a shout whispered excitedlytheyve got some hot coffee bossen got it no where its coming cook made it james wait moaned donkin scrambled viciously caring not where he kicked and anxious that the officers should have none of it it came in a pot and they drank in turns it was hot and while it blistered the greedy palates it seemed incredible the men sighed out parting with the mughow as he done it some cried weaklybully for you doctor  he had done it somehow afterwards archie declared that the thing was meeraculous for many days we wondered and it was the one everinteresting subject of conversation to the end of the voyage we asked the cook in fine weather how he felt when he saw his stove reared up on end we inquired in the northeast trade and on serene evenings whether he had to stand on his head to put things right somewhat we suggested he had used his breadboard for a raft and from there comfortably had stoked his grate and we did our best to conceal our admiration under the wit of fine irony he affirmed not to know anything about it rebuked our levity declared himself with solemn animation to have been the object of a special mercy for the saving of our unholy lives fundamentally he was right no doubt but he need not have been so offensively positive about ithe need not have hinted so often that it would have gone hard with us had he not been there meritorious and pure to receive the inspiration and the strength for the work of grace had we been saved by his recklessness or his agility we could have at length become reconciled to the fact but to admit our obligation to anybodys virtue and holiness alone was as difficult for us as for any other handful of mankind like many benefactors of humanity the cook took himself too seriously and reaped the reward of irreverence we were not unungrateful however he remained heroic his sayingthe saying of his lifebecame proverbial in the mouth of men as are the sayings of conquerors or sages later whenever one of us was puzzled by a task and advised to relinquish it he would express his determination to persevere and to succeed by the wordsas long as she swims i will cook  the hot drink helped us through the bleak hours that precede the dawn the sky low by the horizon took on the delicate tints of pink and yellow like the inside of a rare shell and higher where it glowed with a pearly sheen a small black cloud appeared like a forgotten fragment of the night set in a border of dazzling gold the beams of light skipped on the crests of waves the eyes of men turned to the eastward the sunlight flooded their weary faces they were giving themselves up to fatigue as though they had done for ever with their work on singletons black oilskin coat the dried salt glistened like hoar frost he hung on by the wheel with open and lifeless eyes captain allistoun unblinking faced the rising sun his lips stirred opened for the first time in twentyfour hours and with a fresh firm voice he cried wear ship  the commanding sharp tones made all these torpid men start like a sudden flick of a whip then again motionless where they lay the force of habit made some of them repeat the order in hardly audible murmurs captain allistoun glanced down at his crew and several with fumbling fingers and hopeless movements tried to cast themselves adrift he repeated impatiently wear ship now then mr baker get the men along whats the matter with themwear ship do you hear therewear ship thundered out the boatswain suddenly his voice seemed to break through a deadly spell men began to stir and crawli want the foretopmast staysail run up smartly said the master very loudly if you cant manage it standing up you must do it lying downthats all bear a handcome along lets give the old girl a chance urged the boatswainaye aye wear ship exclaimed quavering voices the forecastle men with reluctant faces prepared to go forward mr baker pushed ahead grunting on all fours to show the way and they followed him over the break the others lay still with a vile hope in their hearts of not being required to move till they got saved or drowned in peace  after some time they could be seen forward appearing on the forecastle head one by one in unsafe attitudes hanging on to the rails clambering over the anchors embracing the crosshead of the windlass or hugging the forecapstan they were restless with strange exertions waved their arms knelt lay flat down staggered up seemed to strive their hardest to go overboard suddenly a small white piece of canvas fluttered amongst them grew larger beating its narrow head rose in jerksand at last it stood distended and triangular in the sunshinethey have done it cried the voices aft captain allistoun let go the rope he had round his wrist and rolled to leeward headlong he could be seen casting the lee main braces off the pins while the backwash of waves splashed over himsquare the main yard he shouted up to uswho stared at him in wonder we hesitated to stir the main brace men haul haul anyhow lay on your backs and haul he screeched half drowned down there we did not believe we could move the main yard but the strongest and the less discouraged tried to execute the order others assisted halfheartedly singletons eyes blazed suddenly as he took a fresh grip of the spokes captain allistoun fought his way up to windwardhaul men try to move it haul and help the ship his hard face worked suffused and furious is she going off singleton he criednot a move yet sir croaked the old seaman in a horribly hoarse voicewatch the helm singleton spluttered the master haul men have you no more strength than rats haul and earn your salt mr creighton on his back with a swollen leg and a face as white as a piece of paper blinked his eyes his bluish lips twitched in the wild scramble men grabbed at him crawled over his hurt leg knelt on his chest he kept perfectly still setting his teeth without a moan without a sigh the masters ardour the cries of that silent man inspired us we hauled and hung in bunches on the rope we heard him say with violence to donkin who sprawled abjectly on his stomachi will brain you with this belaying pin if you dont catch hold of the brace and that victim of mens injustice cowardly and cheeky whimperedare you goin to murder us now while with sudden desperation he gripped the rope men sighed shouted hissed meaningless words groaned the yards moved came slowly square against the wind that hummed loudly on the yardarmsgoing off sir shouted singleton shes just startedcatch a turn with that brace catch a turn clamoured the master mr creighton nearly suffocated and unable to move made a mighty effort and with his left hand managed to nip the rope  all fast cried some one he closed his eyes as if going off into a swoon while huddled together about the brace we watched with scared looks what the ship would do now  she went off slowly as though she had been weary and disheartened like the men she carried she paid off very gradually making us hold our breath till we choked and as soon as she had brought the wind abaft the beam she started to move and fluttered our hearts it was awful to see her nearly overturned begin to gather way and drag her submerged side through the water the deadeyes of the rigging churned the breaking seas the lower half of the deck was full of mad whirlpools and eddies and the long line of the lee rail could be seen showing black now and then in the swirls of a field of foam as dazzling and white as a field of snow the wind sang shrilly amongst the spars and at every slight lurch we expected her to slip to the bottom sideways from under our backs when dead before it she made the first distinct attempt to stand up and we encouraged her with a feeble and discordant howl a great sea came running up aft and hung for a moment over us with a curling top then crashed down under the counter and spread out on both sides into a great sheet of bursting froth above its fierce hiss we heard singletons croakshe is steering he had both his feet now planted firmly on the grating and the wheel spun fast as he eased the helmbring the wind on the port quarter and steady her called out the master staggering to his feet the first man up from amongst our prostrate heap one or two screamed with excitementshe rises far away forward mr baker and three others were seen erect and black on the clear sky lifting their arms and with open mouths as though they had been shouting all together the ship trembled trying to lift her side lurched back seemed to give up with a nerveless dip and suddenly with an unexpected jerk swung violently to windward as though she had torn herself out from a deadly grasp the whole immense volume of water lifted by her deck was thrown bodily across to starboard loud cracks were heard iron ports breaking open thundered with ringing blows the water topped over the starboard rail with the rush of a river falling over a dam the sea on deck and the seas on every side of her mingled together in a deafening roar she rolled violently we got up and were helplessly run or flung about from side to side men rolling over and over yelledthe house will goshe clears herself lifted by a towering sea she ran along with it for a moment spouting thick streams of water through every opening of her wounded sides the lee braces having been carried away or washed off the pins all the ponderous yards on the fore swung from side to side and with appalling rapidity at every roll the men forward were seen crouching here and there with fearful glances upwards at the enormous spars that whirled about over their heads the torn canvas and the ends of broken gear streamed in the wind like wisps of hair through the clear sunshine over the flashing turmoil and uproar of the seas the ship ran blindly dishevelled and headlong as if fleeing for her life and on the poop we spun we tottered about distracted and noisy we all spoke at once in a thin babble we had the aspect of invalids and the gestures of maniacs eyes shone large and haggard in smiling meagre faces that seemed to have been dusted over with powdered chalk we stamped clapped our hands feeling ready to jump and do anything but in reality hardly able to keep on our feet  captain allistoun hard and slim gesticulated madly from the poop at mr baker steady these foreyards steady them the best you can on the main deck men excited by his cries splashed dashing aimlessly here and there with the foam swirling up to their waists apart far aft and alone by the helm old singleton had deliberately tucked his white beard under the top button of his glistening coat swaying upon the din and tumult of the seas with the whole battered length of the ship launched forward in a rolling rush before his steady old eyes he stood rigidly still forgotten by all and with an attentive face in front of his erect figure only the two arms moved crosswise with a swift and sudden readiness to check or urge again the rapid stir of circling spokes he steered with care      chapter four  on men reprieved by its disdainful mercy the immortal sea confers in its justice the full privilege of desired unrest through the perfect wisdom of its grace they are not permitted to meditate at ease upon the complicated and acrid savour of existence they must without pause justify their life to the eternal pity that commands toil to be hard and unceasing from sunrise to sunset from sunset to sunrise till the weary succession of nights and days tainted by the obstinate clamour of sages demanding bliss and an empty heaven is redeemed at last by the vast silence of pain and labour by the dumb fear and the dumb courage of men obscure forgetful and enduring  the master and mr baker coming face to face stared for a moment with the intense and amazed looks of men meeting unexpectedly after years of trouble their voices were gone and they whispered desperately at one anotherany one missing asked captain allistounno all thereanybody hurtonly the second matei will look after him directly were luckyvery articulated mr baker faintly he gripped the rail and rolled bloodshot eyes the little grey man made an effort to raise his voice above a dull mutter and fixed his chief mate with a cold gaze piercing like a dartget sail on the ship he said speaking authoritatively and with an inflexible snap of his thin lips get sail on her as soon as you can this is a fair wind at once sirdont give the men time to feel themselves they will get done up and stiff and we will never we must get her along now he reeled to a long heavy roll the rail dipped into the glancing hissing water he caught a shroud swung helplessly against the mate now we have a fair wind at lastmakesail his head rolled from shoulder to shoulder his eyelids began to beat rapidly and the pumpspumps mr baker he peered as though the face within a foot of his eyes had been half a mile off keep the men on the move toto get her along he mumbled in a drowsy tone like a man going off into a doze he pulled himself together suddenly mustnt stand wont do he said with a painful attempt at a smile he let go his hold and propelled by the dip of the ship ran aft unwillingly with small steps till he brought up against the binnacle stand hanging on there he looked up in an aimless manner at singleton who unheeding him watched anxiously the end of the jibboomsteering gear works all right he asked there was a noise in the old seamans throat as though the words had been rattling together before they could come outsteers like a little boat he said at last with hoarse tenderness without giving the master as much as half a glancethen watchfully spun the wheel down steadied flung it back again captain allistoun tore himself away from the delight of leaning against the binnacle and began to walk the poop swaying and reeling to preserve his balance  the pumprods clanking stamped in short jumps while the flywheels turned smoothly with great speed at the foot of the mainmast flinging back and forth with a regular impetuosity two limp clusters of men clinging to the handles they abandoned themselves swaying from the hip with twitching faces and stony eyes the carpenter sounding from time to time exclaimed mechanically shake her up keep her going mr baker could not speak but found his voice to shout and under the goad of his objurgations men looked to the lashings dragged out new sails and thinking themselves unable to move carried heavy blocks aloftoverhauled the gear they went up the rigging with faltering and desperate efforts their heads swam as they shifted their hold stepped blindly on the yards like men in the dark or trusted themselves to the first rope at hand with the negligence of exhausted strength the narrow escapes from falls did not disturb the languid beat of their hearts the roar of the seas seething far below them sounded continuous and faint like an indistinct noise from another world the wind filled their eyes with tears and with heavy gusts tried to push them off from where they swayed in insecure positions with streaming faces and blowing hair they flew up and down between sky and water bestriding the ends of yardarms crouching on footropes embracing lifts to have their hands free or standing up against chain ties their thoughts floated vaguely between the desire of rest and the desire of life while their stiffened fingers cast off headearrings fumbled for knives or held with tenacious grip against the violent shocks of beating canvas they glared savagely at one another made frantic signs with one hand while they held their life in the other looked down on the narrow strip of flooded deck shouted along to leeward lightto haul out make fast their lips moved their eyes started furious and eager with the desire to be understood but the wind tossed their words unheard upon the disturbed sea in an unendurable and unending strain they worked like men driven by a merciless dream to toil in an atmosphere of ice or flame they burnt and shivered in turns their eyeballs smarted as if in the smoke of a conflagration their heads were ready to burst with every shout hard fingers seemed to grip their throats at every roll they thought now i must let go it will shake us all offand thrown about aloft they cried wildly look out therecatch the end reeve clear turn this block they nodded desperately shook infuriated faces no no from down up they seemed to hate one another with a deadly hate the longing to be done with it all gnawed their breasts and the wish to do things well was a burning pain they cursed their fate contemned their life and wasted their breath in deadly imprecations upon one another the sailmaker with his bald head bared worked feverishly forgetting his intimacy with so many admirals the boatswain climbing up with marlinspikes and bunches of spunyarn rovings or kneeling on the yard and ready to take a turn with the midshipstop had acute and fleeting visions of his old woman and the youngsters in a moorland village mr baker feeling very weak tottered here and there grunting and inflexible like a man of iron he waylaid those who coming from aloft stood gasping for breath he ordered encouraged scolded now thento the main topsail now tally on to that gantline dont stand about thereis there no rest for us muttered voices he spun round fiercely with a sinking heartno no rest till the work is done work till you drop thats what youre here for a bowed seaman at his elbow gave a short laughdo or die he croaked bitterly then spat into his broad palms swung up his long arms and grasping the rope high above his head sent out a mournful wailing cry for a pull all together a sea boarded the quarterdeck and sent the whole lot sprawling to leeward caps handspikes floated clenched hands kicking legs with here and there a spluttering face stuck out of the white hiss of foaming water mr baker knocked down with the rest screameddont let go that rope hold on to it hold and sorely bruised by the brutal fling they held on to it as though it had been the fortune of their life the ship ran rolling heavily and the topping crests glanced past port and starboard flashing their white heads pumps were freed braces were rove the three topsails and foresail were set she spurted faster over the water outpacing the swift rush of waves the menacing thunder of distanced seas rose behind herfilled the air with the tremendous vibrations of its voice and devastated battered and wounded she drove foaming to the northward as though inspired by the courage of a high endeavour  the forecastle was a place of damp desolation they looked at their dwelling with dismay it was slimy dripping it hummed hollow with the wind and was strewn with shapeless wreckage like a halftide cavern in a rocky and exposed coast many had lost all they had in the world but most of the starboard watch had preserved their chests thin streams of water trickled out of them however the beds were soaked the blankets spread out and saved by some nail squashed under foot they dragged wet rags from evilsmelling corners and wringing the water out recognised their property some smiled stiffly others looked round blank and mute there were cries of joy over old waistcoats and groans of sorrow over shapeless things found among the splinters of smashed bed boards one lamp was discovered jammed under the bowsprit charley whimpered a little knowles stumped here and there sniffing examining dark places for salvage he poured dirty water out of a boot and was concerned to find the owner those who overwhelmed by their losses sat on the forepeak hatch remained elbows on knees and with a fist against each cheek disdained to look up he pushed it under their noses heres a good boot yours they snarled noget out one snapped at him take it to hell out of this he seemed surprised why its a good boot but remembering suddenly that he had lost every stitch of his clothing he dropped his find and began to swear in the dim light cursing voices clashed a man came in and dropping his arms stood still repeating from the doorstep heres a bloomin old go heres a bloomin old go a few rooted anxiously in flooded chests for tobacco they breathed hard clamoured with heads down look at that jack here sam heres my shoregoing rig spoilt for ever one blasphemed tearfully holding up a pair of dripping trousers no one looked at him the cat came out from somewhere he had an ovation they snatched him from hand to hand caressed him in a murmur of pet names they wondered where he had weathered it out disputed about it a squabbling argument began two men brought in a bucket of fresh water and all crowded round it but tom lean and mewing came up with every hair astir and had the first drink a couple of hands went aft for oil and biscuits  then in the yellow light and in the intervals of mopping the deck they crunched hard bread arranging to worry through somehow men chummed as to beds turns were settled for wearing boots and having the use of oilskin coats they called one another old man and sonny in cheery voices friendly slaps resounded jokes were shouted one or two stretched on the wet deck slept with heads pillowed on their bent arms and several sitting on the hatch smoked their weary faces appeared through a thin blue haze pacified and with sparkling eyes the boatswain put his head through the door relieve the wheel one of youhe shouted insideits six blamme if that old singleton hasnt been there moren thirty hours you are a fine lot he slammed the door again mates watch on deck said some one hey donkin its your relief shouted three or four together he had crawled into an empty bunk and on wet planks lay still donkin your wheel he made no sound donkins dead guffawed some one sell is bloomin clothes shouted another donkin if ye dont go to the bloomin wheel they will sell your clothesdye hear jeered a third he groaned from his dark hole he complained about pains in all his bones he whimpered pitifully he wont go exclaimed a contemptuous voice your turn davis the young seaman rose painfully squaring his shoulders donkin stuck his head out and it appeared in the yellow light fragile and ghastly i will giv yer a pound of tobaccer he whined in a conciliating voice so soon as i draw it from aft i willselp me davis swung his arm backhanded and the head vanished ill go he said but you will pay for it he walked unsteady but resolute to the door so i will yelped donkin popping out behind him so i willselp me a pound three bob they chawrge davis flung the door open you will pay my price in fine weather he shouted over his shoulder one of the men unbuttoned his wet coat rapidly threw it at his head here taffytake that you thief thank you he cried from the darkness above the swish of rolling water he could be heard splashing a sea came on board with a thump hes got his bath already remarked a grim shellback aye aye grunted others then after a long silence wamibo made strange noises hallo whats up with you said some one grumpily he says he would have gone for davy explained archie who was the finns interpreter generally i believe him cried voices never mind dutchy youll do muddlehead your turn will come soon enough you dont know when yere well off they ceased and all together turned their faces to the door singleton stepped in advanced two paces and stood swaying slightly the sea hissed flowed roaring past the bows and the forecastle trembled full of deep murmurs the lamp flared swinging like a pendulum he looked with a dreamy and puzzled stare as though he could not distinguish the still men from their restless shadows there were awestruck exclamationshallo hallo how does it look outside now singleton those who sat on the hatch lifted their eyes in silence and the next oldest seaman in the ship those two understood one another though they hardly exchanged three words in a day gazed up at his friend attentively for a moment then taking a short clay pipe out of his mouth offered it without a word singleton put out his arm towards it missed staggered and suddenly fell forward crashing down stiff and headlong like an uprooted tree there was a swift rush men pushed cryinghes done turn him over stand clear there under a crowd of startled faces bending over him he lay on his back staring upwards in a continuous and intolerable manner in the breathless silence of a general consternation he said in a grating murmuri am all right and clutched with his hands they helped him up he mumbled despondentlyi am getting old oldnot you cried belfast with ready tact supported on all sides he hung his headare you better they asked he glared at them from under his eyebrows with large black eyes spreading over his chest the bushy whiteness of a beard long and thickold old he repeated sternly helped along he reached his bunk there was in it a slimy soft heap of something that smelt as does at dead low water a muddy foreshore it was his soaked straw bed with a convulsive effort he pitched himself on it and in the darkness of the narrow place could be heard growling angrily like an irritated and savage animal uneasy in its denbit of breeze small thing cant stand up old he slept at last highbooted souwester on head and his oilskin clothes rustled when with a deep sighing groan he turned over men conversed about him in quiet concerned whispers this will breakim up strong as a horse aye but he aint what he used to be in sad murmurs they gave him up yet at midnight he turned out to duty as if nothing had been the matter and answered to his name with a mournful here he brooded alone more than ever in an impenetrable silence and with a saddened face for many years he had heard himself called old singleton and had serenely accepted the qualification taking it as a tribute of respect due to a man who through half a century had measured his strength against the favours and the rages of the sea he had never given a thought to his mortal self he lived unscathed as though he had been indestructible surrendering to all the temptations weathering many gales he had panted in sunshine shivered in the cold suffered hunger thirst debauch passed through many trialsknown all the furies old it seemed to him he was broken at last and like a man bound treacherously while he sleeps he woke up fettered by the long chain of disregarded years he had to take up at once the burden of all his existence and found it almost too heavy for his strength old he moved his arms shook his head felt his limbs getting old and then he looked upon the immortal sea with the awakened and groping perception of its heartless might he saw it unchanged black and foaming under the eternal scrutiny of the stars he heard its impatient voice calling for him out of a pitiless vastness full of unrest of turmoil and of terror he looked afar upon it and he saw an immensity tormented and blind moaning and furious that claimed all the days of his tenacious life and when life was over would claim the wornout body of its slave  this was the last of the breeze it veered quickly changed to a black southeaster and blew itself out giving the ship a famous shove to the northward into the joyous sunshine of the trade rapid and white she ran homewards in a straight path under a blue sky and upon the plain of a blue sea she carried singletons completed wisdom donkins delicate susceptibilities and the conceited folly of us all the hours of ineffective turmoil were forgotten the fear and anguish of these dark moments were never mentioned in the glowing peace of fine days yet from that time our life seemed to start afresh as though we had died and had been resuscitated all the first part of the voyage the indian ocean on the other side of the cape all that was lost in a haze like an ineradicable suspicion of some previous existence it had endedthen there were blank hours a livid blurrand again we lived singleton was possessed of sinister truth mr creighton of a damaged leg the cook of fameand shamefully abused the opportunities of his distinction donkin had an added grievance he went about repeating with insistencee said e would brain medid yer ear they are goin to murder us now for the least little thing we began at last to think it was rather awful and we were conceited we boasted of our pluck of our capacity for work of our energy we remembered honourable episodes our devotion our indomitable perseveranceand were proud of them as though they had been the outcome of our unaided impulses we remembered our danger our toiland conveniently forgot our horrible scare we decried our officerswho had done nothingand listened to the fascinating donkin his care for our rights his disinterested concern for our dignity were not discouraged by the invariable contumely of our words by the disdain of our looks our contempt for him was unboundedand we could not but listen with interest to that consummate artist he told us we were good mena bloomin condemned lot of good men who thanked us who took any notice of our wrongs didnt we lead a dorgs loife for two poun ten a month did we think that miserable pay enough to compensate us for the risk to our lives and for the loss of our clothes weve lost every rag he cried he made us forget that he at any rate had lost nothing of his own the younger men listened thinkingthis ere donkins a longheaded chap though no kind of man anyhow the scandinavians were frightened at his audacities wamibo did not understand and the older seamen thoughtfully nodded their heads making the thin gold earrings glitter in the fleshy lobes of hairy ears severe sunburnt faces were propped meditatively on tattooed forearms veined brown fists held in their knotted grip the dirty white clay of smouldering pipes they listened impenetrable broadbacked with bent shoulders and in grim silence he talked with ardour despised and irrefutable his picturesque and filthy loquacity flowed like a troubled stream from a poisoned source his beady little eyes danced glancing right and left ever on the watch for the approach of an officer sometimes mr baker going forward to take a look at the head sheets would roll with his uncouth gait through the sudden stillness of the men or mr creighton limped along smoothfaced youthful and more stern than ever piercing our short silence with a keen glance of his clear eyes behind his back donkin would begin again darting stealthy sidelong lookseres one of em some of yer as made im fast that day much thanks yer got for it aint ee adrivin yer wussen ever let im slip overboard vy not it would ave been less trouble vy not he advanced confidentially backed away with great effect he whispered he screamed waved his miserable arms no thicker than pipestemsstretched his lean neckspluttered squinted in the pauses of his impassioned orations the wind sighed quietly aloft the calm sea unheeded murmured in a warning whisper along the ships side we abominated the creature and could not deny the luminous truth of his contentions it was all so obvious we were indubitably good men our deserts were great and our pay small through our exertions we had saved the ship and the skipper would get the credit of it what had he done we wanted to know donkin askedwhat ee could do without hus and we could not answer we were oppressed by the injustice of the world surprised to perceive how long we had lived under its burden without realising our unfortunate state annoyed by the uneasy suspicion of our undiscerning stupidity donkin assured us it was all our good eartedness but we would not be consoled by such shallow sophistry we were men enough to courageously admit to ourselves our intellectual shortcomings though from that time we refrained from kicking him tweaking his nose or from accidentally knocking him about which last after we had weathered the cape had been rather a popular amusement davis ceased to talk at him provokingly about black eyes and flattened noses charley much subdued since the gale did not jeer at him knowles deferentially and with a crafty air propounded questions such ascould we all have the same grub as the mates could we all stop ashore till we got it what would be the next thing to try for if we got that he answered readily with contemptuous certitude he strutted with assurance in clothes that were much too big for him as though he had tried to disguise himself these were jimmys clothes mostlythough he would accept anything from anybody but nobody except jimmy had anything to spare his devotion to jimmy was unbounded he was for ever dodging in the little cabin ministering to jimmys wants humouring his whims submitting to his exacting peevishness often laughing with him nothing could keep him away from the pious work of visiting the sick especially when there was some heavy hauling to be done on deck mr baker had on two occasions jerked him out from there by the scruff of the neck to our inexpressible scandal was a sick chap to be left without attendance were we to be illused for attending a shipmatewhat growled mr baker turning menacingly at the mutter and the whole halfcircle like one man stepped back a pace set the topmast stunsail away aloft donkin overhaul the gear ordered the mate inflexibly fetch the sail along bend the downhaul clear bear a hand then the sail set he would go slowly aft and stand looking at the compass for a long time careworn pensive and breathing hard as if stifled by the taint of unaccountable illwill that pervaded the ship whats up amongst them he thought cant make out this hanging back and growling a good crowd too as they go nowadays on deck the men exchanged bitter words suggested by a silly exasperation against something unjust and irremediable that would not be denied and would whisper into their ears long after donkin had ceased speaking our little world went on its curved and unswerving path carrying a discontented and aspiring population they found comfort of a gloomy kind in an interminable and conscientious analysis of their unappreciated worth and inspired by donkins hopeful doctrines they dreamed enthusiastically of the time when every lonely ship would travel over a serene sea manned by a wealthy and wellfed crew of satisfied skippers  it lookedas if it would be a long passage the southeast trades light and unsteady were left behind and then on the equator and under a low grey sky the ship in close heat floated upon a smooth sea that resembled a sheet of ground glass thunder squalls hung on the horizon circled round the ship far off and growling angrily like a troop of wild beasts afraid to charge home the invisible sun sweeping above the upright masts made on the clouds a blurred stain of rayless light and a similar patch of faded radiance kept pace with it from east to west over the unglittering level of the waters at night through the impenetrable darkness of earth and heaven broad sheets of flame waved noiselessly and for half a second the becalmed craft stood out with its masts and rigging with every sail and every rope distinct and black in the centre of a fiery outburst like a charred ship enclosed in a globe of fire and again for long hours she remained lost in a vast universe of night and silence where gentle sighs wandering here and there like forlorn souls made the still sails flutter as in sudden fear and the ripple of a beshrouded ocean whisper its compassion afarin a voice mournful immense and faint  when the lamp was put out and through the door thrown wide open jimmy turning on his pillow could see vanishing beyond the straight line of topgallant rail the quick repeated visions of a fabulous world made up of leaping fire and sleeping water the lightning gleamed in his big sad eyes that seemed in a red flicker to burn themselves out in his black face and then he would lie blinded and invisible in the midst of an intense darkness he could hear on the quiet deck soft footfalls the breathing of some man lounging on the doorstep the low creak of swaying masts or the calm voice of the watchofficer reverberating aloft hard and loud amongst the unstirring sails he listened with avidity taking a rest in the attentive perception of the slightest sound from the fatiguing wanderings of his sleeplessness he was cheered by the rattling of blocks reassured by the stir and murmur of the watch soothed by the slow yawn of some sleepy and weary seaman settling himself deliberately for a snooze on the planks life seemed an indestructible thing it went on in darkness in sunshine in sleep tireless it hovered affectionately round the imposture of his ready death it was bright like the twisted flare of lightning and more full of surprises than the dark night it made him safe and the calm of its overpowering darkness was as precious as its restless and dangerous light  but in the evening in the dogwatches and even far into the first nightwatch a knot of men could always be seen congregated before jimmys cabin they leaned on each side of the door peacefully interested and with crossed legs they stood astride the doorstep discoursing or sat in silent couples on his seachest while against the bulwark along the spare topmast three or four in a row stared meditatively with their simple faces lit up by the projected glare of jimmys lamp the little place repainted white had in the night the brilliance of a silver shrine where a black idol reclining stiffly under a blanket blinked its weary eyes and received our homage donkin officiated he had the air of a demonstrator showing a phenomenon a manifestation bizarre simple and meritorious that to the beholders should be a profound and an everlasting lesson just look at im ee knows whats whatnever fear he exclaimed now and then flourishing a hand hard and fleshless like the claw of a snipe jimmy on his back smiled with reserve and without moving a limb he affected the languor of extreme weakness so as to make it manifest to us that our delay in hauling him out from his horrible confinement and then that night spent on the poop among our selfish neglect of his needs had done for him he rather liked to talk about it and of course we were always interested he spoke spasmodically in fast rushes with long pauses between as a tipsy man walks cook had just given me a pannikin of hot coffee slapped it down there on my chestbanged the door to i felt a heavy roll coming tried to save my coffee burnt my fingers and fell out of my bunk she went over so quick water came in through the ventilator i couldnt move the door dark as a grave tried to scramble up into the upper berth rats a rat bit my finger as i got up i could hear him swimming below me i thought you would never come i thought you were all gone overboard of course could hear nothing but the wind then you came to look for the corpse i suppose a little more and  man but ye made a rare lot of noise in here observed archie thoughtfully  you chaps kicked up such a confounded row above enough to scare any one i didnt know what you were up to bash in the blamed planks my head just what a silly scary gang of fools would do not much good to me anyhow just as well drown pah  he groaned snapped his big white teeth and gazed with scorn belfast lifted a pair of dolorous eyes with a brokenhearted smile clenched his fists stealthily blueeyed archie caressed his red whiskers with a hesitating hand the boatswain at the door stared a moment and brusquely went away with a loud guffaw wamibo dreamed donkin felt all over his sterile chin for the few rare hairs and said triumphantly with a sidelong glance at jimmylook at im wish i was arf has ealthy as ee isi do he jerked a short thumb over his shoulder towards the after end of the ship thats the blooming way to do em he yelped with forced heartiness jimmy saiddont be a dam fool in a pleasant voice knowles rubbing his shoulder against the doorpost remarked shrewdlywe cant all go an be took sickit would be mutinymutinygawn jeered

kept a good lookout toobut he topped his boom directly he was outside the court yes they got six weeks hard  they listened full of curiosity nodding in the pauses their rough pensive faces donkin opened his mouth once or twice but restrained himself jimmy lay still with open eyes and not at all interested a seaman emitted the opinion that after a verdict of atrocious partiality the bloomin beaks go an drink at the skippers expense others assented it was clear of course donkin saidwell six weeks aint much trouble you sleep all night in reglar in chokey do it on my ead you are used to it

his pipe discreetly amused knowles turned about bewildered stammered first at one then at anotherno i never cant talk sensible sense midst you always on the kid he retired bashfullymuttering and pleased they laughed hooting in the crude light around jimmys bed where on a white pillow his hollowed black face moved to and fro restlessly a puff of wind came made the flame of the lamp leap and outside high up the sails fluttered while near by the block of the foresheet struck a ringing blow on the iron bulwark a voice far off cried helm up another more faint answered hardup sir they became silentwaited expectantly the greyhaired seaman knocked his pipe on the doorstep and stood up the ship leaned over gently and the sea seemed to wake up murmuring drowsily heres a little wind comin said some one very low jimmy turned over slowly to face the breeze the voice in the night cried loud and commandinghaul the spanker out the group before the door vanished out of the light they could be heard tramping aft while they repeated with varied intonationsspanker out out spanker sir donkin remained alone with jimmy there was a silence jimmy opened and shut his lips several times as if swallowing draughts of fresher air donkin moved the toes of his bare feet and looked at them thoughtfully  aint you going to give them a hand with the sail asked jimmy  no if six ov em aint nough beef to set that blamed rotten spanker they aint fit to live answered donkin in a bored faraway voice as though he had been talking from the bottom of a hole jimmy considered the conical fowllike profile with a queer kind of interest he was leaning out of his bunk with the calculating uncertain expression of a man who reflects how best to lay hold of some strange creature that looks as though it could sting or bite but he said onlythe mate will miss youand there will be ructions  donkin got up to go i will do for im some dark night see if i dont he said over his shoulder  jimmy went on quicklyyoure like a pollparrot like a screechin pollparrot donkin stopped and cocked his head attentively on one side his big ears stood out transparent and veined resembling the thin wings of a bat  yuss he said with his back towards jimmy  yes chatter out all you knowlike like a dirty white cockatoo  donkin waited he could hear the others breathing long and slow the breathing of a man with a hundredweight or so on the breastbone then he asked calmlywhat do i know  what what i tell you not much what do you want to talk about my health so  its a blooming imposyshun a bloomin stinkin firstclass imposyshunbut

affirmed donkindont you let on too much admonished jimmy in an exhausted voiceyour little gyme eh commented donkin jovially then with sudden disgust yer all for yerself slong as yere right  so charged with egoism james wait pulled the blanket up to his chin and lay still for a while his heavy lips protruded in an everlasting black pout why are you so hot on making trouble he asked without much interest  cos its a bloomin shayme we are put upon bad food bad pay i want us to kick up a bloomin row a blamed owling row that would make em remember knocking people about brain us indeed aint we men

friendly eagernessbring em in i will put them away myself answered james wait with severity donkin looked down muttering what dyou say what dyou say inquired wait anxiouslynothink the nights dry let

took a stride over the doorstepgit it yerself he replied in a surly tone you can do it unless you are sickof course i can do it said wait only well then do it said donkin viciously if yer can look after yer clothes yer can look after yerself he went on deck without a look back  jimmy reached out for the mug not a drop he put it back gently with a faint sighand closed his eyes he thoughtthat lunatic belfast will bring me some water if i ask fool i am very thirsty it was very hot in the cabin and it seemed to turn slowly round detach itself from the ship and swing out smoothly into a luminous arid space where a black sun shone spinning very fast a place without any water no water a policeman with the face of donkin drank a glass of beer by the side of an empty well and flew away flapping vigorously a ship whose mastheads protruded through the sky and could not be seen was discharging grain and the wind whirled the dry husks in spirals along the quay of a dock with no water in it he whirled along with the husksvery tired and light all his inside was gone he felt lighter than the husksand more dry he expanded his hollow chest the air streamed in carrying away in its rush a lot of strange things that resembled houses trees people lampposts no more there was no more airand he had not finished drawing his long breath but he was in jail they were locking him up a door slammed they turned the key twice flung a bucket of water over himphoo what for  he opened his eyes thinking the fall had been very heavy for an empty manemptyempty he was in his cabin ah all right his face was streaming with perspiration his arms heavier than lead he saw the cook standing in the doorway a brass key in one hand and a bright tin hookpot in the other  i have locked up the galley for the night said the cook beaming benevolently eight bells just gone i brought you a pot of cold tea for your nights drinking jimmy i sweetened it with some white cabin sugar too wellit wont break the ship  he came in hung the pot on the edge of the bunk asked perfunctorily how goes it and sat down on the boxhm grunted wait inhospitably the cook wiped his face with a dirty cotton rag which afterwards he tied round his neckthats how them firemen do in steamboats he said serenely and much pleased with himself my work is as heavy as theirsim thinkingand longer hours did you ever see them down the stokehold like fiends they lookfiringfiringfiringdown there  he pointed his forefinger at the deck some gloomy thought darkened his shining face fleeting like the shadow of a travelling cloud over the light of a peaceful sea the relieved watch tramped noisily forward passing in a body across the sheen of the doorway some one cried goodnight belfast stopped for a moment and looked at jimmy quivering and speechless with repressed emotion he gave the cook a glance charged with dismal foreboding and vanished the cook cleared his throat jimmy stared upwards and kept as still as a man in hiding  the night was clear with a gentle breeze above the mastheads the resplendent curve of the milky way spanned the sky like a triumphal arch of eternal light thrown over the dark pathway of the earth on the forecastle head a man whistled with loud precision a lively jig while another could be heard faintly shuffling and stamping in time there came from forward a confused murmur of voices laughtersnatches of song the cook shook his head glanced obliquely at jimmy and began to mutter aye dance and sing thats all they think of i am surprised that providence dont get tired they forget the day thats sure to come but you  jimmy drank a gulp of tea hurriedly as though he had stolen it and shrank under his blanket edging away towards the bulkhead the cook got up closed the door then sat down again and said distinctly  whenever i poke my galley fire i think of you chapsswearing stealing lying and worseas if there was no such thing as another world not bad fellows either in a way he conceded slowly then after a pause of regretful musing he went on in a resigned tonewell well they will have a hot time of it hot did i say the furnaces of one of them white star boats aint nothing to it  he kept very quiet for a while there was a great stir in his brain an addled vision of bright outlines an exciting row of rousing songs and groans of pain he suffered enjoyed admired approved he was delighted frightened exaltedas on that evening the only time in his lifetwentyseven years ago he loved to recall the number of years when as a young man he hadthrough keeping bad companybecome intoxicated in an eastend musichall a tide of sudden feeling swept him clean out of his body he soared he contemplated the secret of the hereafter it commended itself to him it was excellent he loved it himself all hands and jimmy his heart overflowed with tenderness with comprehension with the desire to meddle with anxiety for the soul of that black man with the pride of possessed eternity with the feeling of might snatch him up in his arms and pitch him right into the middle of salvation the black soulblackerbodyrotdevil no talkstrengthsamson there was a great din as of cymbals in his ears he flashed through an ecstatic jumble of shining faces lilies prayerbooks unearthly joy white skirts gold harps black coats wings he saw flowing garments clean shaved faces a sea of lighta lake of pitch there were sweet scent a smell of sulphurred tongues of flame licking a white mist an awesome voice thundered it lasted three seconds  jimmy he cried in an inspired tone then he hesitated a spark of human pity glimmered yet through the infernal fog of his supreme conceit  what said james wait unwillingly there was a silence he turned his head just the least bit and stole a cautious glance the cooks lips moved without a sound his face was rapt his eyes turned up he seemed to be mentally imploring deck beams the brass hook of the lamp two cockroaches  look here said wait i want to go to sleep i think i could  this is no time for sleep exclaimed the cook very loud he had prayerfully divested himself of the last vestige of his humanity he was a voicea fleshless and sublime thing as on that memorable nightthe night when he went walking over the sea to make coffee for perishing sinners this is no time for sleeping he repeated with exaltation i cant sleep  dont care damn said wait with factitious energy i can go an turn in  swear in the very jaws in the very jaws dont you see the everlasting fire dont you feel it blind chockfull of sin repent repent i cant bear to think of you i hear the call to save you night and day jimmy let me save you the words of entreaty and menace broke out of him in a roaring torrent the cockroaches ran away jimmy perspired wriggling stealthily under his blanket the cook yelled your days are numbered get out of this boomed wait courageouslypray with me i wont the little cabin was as hot as an oven it contained an immensity of fear and pain an atmosphere of shrieks and moans prayers vociferated like blasphemies and whispered curses outside the men called by charley who informed them in tones of delight that there was a holy row going on in jimmys place crowded before the closed door too startled to open it all hands were there the watch below had jumped out on deck in their shirts as after a collision men running up askedwhat is it others saidlisten the muffled screaming went onon your knees on your kneesshut upnever you are delivered into my hands your life has been saved purpose mercy repentyou are a crazy foolaccount of you

moanings low mutters a few sobs  whats the matter now said a seldomheard voicefall back men fall back there repeated mr creighton sternly pushing throughheres the old man whispered somethe cooks in there sir exclaimed several backing away the door clattered open a broad stream of light darted out on wondering faces a warm whiff of vitiated air passed the two mates towered head and shoulders above the spare greyhaired man who stood revealed between them in shabby clothes stiff and angular like a small carved figure and with a thin composed face the cook got up from his knees jimmy sat high in the bunk clasping his drawnup legs the tassel of the blue nightcap almost imperceptibly trembled over his knees they gazed astonished at his long curved back while the white corner of one eye gleamed blindly at them he was afraid to turn his head he shrank within himself and there was an aspect astounding and animallike in the perfection of his expectant immobility a thing of instinctthe unthinking stillness of a scared brute what are you doing here asked mr baker sharplymy duty said the cook with ardouryour what began the mate captain allistoun touched his arm lightlyi know his caper he said in a low voice come out of that podmore he ordered aloud  the cook wrung his hands shook his fists above his head and his arms dropped as if too heavy for a moment he stood distracted and speechlessnever he stammered i he i  whatdoyousay pronounced captain allistoun come out at onceori am going said the cook with a hasty and sombre resignation he strode over the doorstep firmlyhesitatedmade a few steps they looked at him in silencei make you responsible he cried desperately turning half round that man is dying i make you you there yet called the master in a threatening toneno sir he exclaimed hurriedly in a startled voice the boatswain led him away by the arm some one laughed jimmy lifted his head for a stealthy glance and in one unexpected leap sprang out of his bunk mr baker made a clever catch and felt him very limp in his arms the group at the door grunted with surprisehe lies gasped wait he talked about black devilshe is a devila white devili am all right he stiffened himself and mr baker experimentally let him go he staggered a pace or two captain allistoun watched him with a quiet and penetrating gaze belfast ran to his support he did not appear to be aware of any one near him he stood silent for a moment battling singlehanded with a legion of nameless terrors amidst the eager looks of excited men who watched him far off utterly alone in the impenetrable solitude of his fear the sea gurgled through the scuppers as the ship heeled over to a short puff of wind  keep him away from me said james wait at last in his fine baritone voice and leaning with all his weight on belfasts neck ive been better this last week i am well i was going back to duty tomorrownow if you likecaptain belfast hitched his shoulders to keep him upright  no said the master looking at him fixedly under jimmys armpit belfasts red face moved uneasily a row of eyes gleaming stared on the edge of light they pushed one another with elbows turned their heads whispered wait let his chin fall on his breast and with lowered eyelids looked round in a suspicious manner  why not cried a voice from the shadows the mans all right sir  i am all right said wait with eagerness been sick better turnto now he sighedhowly mother exclaimed belfast with a heave of the shoulders stand up jimmykeep away from me then said wait giving belfast a petulant push and reeling fetched against the doorpost his cheekbones glistened as though they had been varnished he snatched off his nightcap wiped his perspiring face with it flung it on the deck i am coming out he declared without stirring  no you dont said the master curtly bare feet shuffled disapproving voices murmured all round he went on as if he had not heardyou have been skulking nearly all the passage and now you want to come out you think you are near enough to the paytable now smell the shore hey  ive been sick nowbetter mumbled wait glaring in the lightyou have been shamming sick retorted captain allistoun with severity why he hesitated for less than half a second why anybody can see that theres nothing the matter with you but you choose to lieup to please yourselfand now you shall lieup to please me mr baker my orders are that this man is not to be allowed on deck to the end of the passage  there were exclamations of surprise triumph indignation the dark group of men swung across the light what for told you so bloomin shameweve got to say somethink about that screeched donkin from the rearnever mind jimwe will see you righted cried several together an elderly seaman stepped to the front dye mean to say sir he asked ominously that a sick chap aint allowed to get well in this ere hooker behind him donkin whispered excitedly amongst a staring crowd where no one spared him a glance but captain allistoun shook a forefinger at the angry bronzed face of the speakeryouyou hold your tongue he said warninglythis isnt the way clamoured two or three younger menare we bloomin masheens inquired donkin in a piercing tone and dived under the elbows of the front ranksoon show im we aint boysthe mans a man if he is blackwe aint goin to work this bloomin ship shorthanded if snowballs all righthe says he iswell then strike boys strikethats the bloomin ticket captain allistoun said sharply to the second mate keep quiet mr creighton and stood composed in the tumult listening with profound attention to mixed growls and screeches to every exclamation and every curse of the sudden outbreak somebody slammed the cabin door to with a kick the darkness full of menacing mutters leaped with a short clatter over the streak of light and the men became gesticulating shadows that growled hissed laughed excitedly mr baker whisperedget away from them sir the big shape of mr creighton hovered silently about the slight figure of the masterwe have been hymposed upon all this voyage said a gruff voice but this ere fancy takes the cakethat man is a shipmateare we bloomin kidsthe port watch will refuse duty charley carried away by his feeling whistled shrilly then yelpedgiv us our jimmy this seemed to cause a variation in the disturbance there was a fresh burst of squabbling uproar a lot of quarrels were set going at onceyesnonever been sickgo for them to onceshut yer mouth youngsterthis is mens workis it muttered captain allistoun bitterly mr baker grunted ough theyre gone silly theyve been simmering for the last monthi did notice said the masterthey have started a row amongst themselves now said mr creighton with disdain better get aft sir we will soothe themkeep your temper creighton said the master and the three men began to move slowly towards the cabin door  in the shadows of the fore rigging a dark mass stamped eddied advanced retreated there were words of reproach encouragement unbelief execration the elder seamen bewildered and angry growled their determination to go through with something or other but the younger school of advanced thought exposed their and jimmys wrongs with confused shouts arguing amongst themselves they clustered round that moribund carcass the fit emblem of their aspirations and encouraging one another they swayed they tramped on one spot shouting that they would not be put upon inside the cabin belfast helping jimmy into his bunk twitched all over in his desire not to miss all the row and with difficulty restrained the tears of his facile emotion james wait flat on his back under the blanket gasped complaintswe will back you up never fear assured belfast busy about his feet  ill come out tomorrow morningtake my chanceyou fellows must mumbled wait i come out tomorrowskipper or no skipper he lifted one arm with great difficulty passed the hand over his face dont you let that cook he breathed outno no said belfast turning his back on the bunk i will put a head on him if he comes near youi will smash his mug exclaimed faintly wait enraged and weak i dont want to kill a man but he panted fast like a dog after a run in sunshine some one just outside the door shouted hes as fit as any ov us belfast put his hand on the doorhandlehere called james wait hurriedly and in such a clear voice that the other spun round with a start james wait stretched out black and deathlike in the dazzling light turned his head on the pillow his eyes stared at belfast appealing and impudent i am rather weak from lyingup so long he said distinctly belfast nodded getting quite well now insisted waityes i noticed you getting better this last month said belfast looking down hallo whats this he shouted and ran out  he was flattened directly against the side of the house by two men who lurched against him a lot of disputes seemed to be going on all round he got clear and saw three indistinct figures standing along in the fainter darkness under the arched foot of the mainsail that rose above their heads like a convex wall of a high edifice donkin hissedgo for them its dark the crowd took a short run aft in a bodythen there was a check donkin agile and thin flitted past with his right arm going like a windmilland then stood still suddenly with his arm pointing rigidly above his head the hurtling flight of some heavy object was heard it passed between the heads of the two mates bounded heavily along the deck struck the after hatch with a ponderous and deadened blow the bulky shape of mr baker grew distinct come to your senses men he cried advancing at the arrested crowd come back mr baker called the masters quiet voice he obeyed unwillingly there was a minute of silence then a deafening hubbub arose above it archie was heard energeticallyif ye do oot ageen i wull tell there were shouts dont drop itwe aint that kind the black cluster of human forms reeled against the bulwark back again towards the house ringbolts rang under stumbling feetdrop it let menocurse you hah then sounds as of some ones face being slapped a piece of iron fell on the deck a short scuffle and some ones shadowy body scuttled rapidly across the main hatch before the shadow of a kick a raging voice sobbed out a torrent of filthy languagethrowing thingsgood god grunted mr baker in dismaythat was meant for me said the master quietly i felt the wind of that thing what was itan iron belayingpinby jove muttered mr creighton the confused voices of men talking amidships mingled with the wash of the sea ascended between the silent and distended sailsseemed to flow away into the night further than the horizon higher than the sky the stars burned steadily over the inclined mastheads trails of light lay on the water broke before the advancing hull and after she had passed trembled for a long time as if in awe of the murmuring sea  meantime the helmsman anxious to know what the row was about had let go the wheel and bent double ran with long stealthy footsteps to the break of the poop the narcissus left to herself came up gently in to the wind without any one being aware of it she gave a slight roll and the sleeping sails woke suddenly coming all together with a mighty flap against the masts then filled again one after another in a quick succession of loud reports that ran down the lofty spars till the collapsed mainsail flew out last with a violent jerk the ship trembled from trucks to keel the sails kept on rattling like a discharge of musketry the chain sheets and loose shackles jingled aloft in a thin peal the gin blocks groaned it was as if an invisible hand had given the ship an angry shake to recall the men that peopled her decks to the sense of reality vigilance and dutyhelm up cried the master sharply run aft mr creighton and see what that fool there is up toflatten in the head sheets stand by the weather forebraces growled mr baker startled men ran swiftly repeating the orders the watch below abandoned all at once by the watch on deck drifted towards the forecastle in twos and threes arguing noisily as they wentwe shall see tomorrow cried a loud voice as if to cover with a menacing hint an inglorious retreat and then only orders were heard the falling of heavy coils of rope the rattling of blocks singletons white head flitted here and there in the night high above the deck like the ghost of a birdgoing off sir shouted mr creighton from aftfull againall right ease off the head sheets that will do the braces coil the ropes up grunted mr baker bustling about  gradually the tramping noises the confused sound of voices died out and the officers coming together on the poop discussed the events mr baker was bewildered and grunted mr creighton was calmly furious but captain allistoun was composed and thoughtful he listened to mr bakers growling argumentation to creightons interjected and severe remarks while looking down on the deck he weighed in his hand the iron belayingpinthat a moment ago had just missed his headas if it had been the only tangible fact of the whole transaction he was one of those commanders who speak little seem to hear nothing look at no oneand know everything hear every whisper see every fleeting shadow of their ships life his two big officers towered above his lean short figure they talked over his head they were dismayed surprised and angry while between them the little quiet man seemed to have found his taciturn serenity in the profound depths of a larger experience lights were burning in the forecastle now and then a loud gust of babbling chatter came from forward swept over the decks and became faint as if the unconscious ship gliding gently through the great peace of the sea had left behind and for ever the foolish noise of turbulent mankind but it was renewed again and again gesticulating arms profiles of heads with open mouths appeared for a moment in the illuminated squares of doorways black fists dartedwithdrew yes it was most damnable to have such an unprovoked row sprung on one assented the master  a tumult of yells rose in the light abruptly ceased he didnt think there would be any further trouble just then a bell was struck aft another forward answered in a deeper tone and the clamour of ringing metal spread round the ship in a circle of wide vibrations that ebbed away into the immeasurable night of an empty sea didnt he know them didnt he in past years better men too real men to stand by one in a tight place worse than devils too sometimesdownright horned devils pah this nothing a miss as good as a mile the wheel was being relieved in the usual wayfull and by said very loud the man going offfull and by repeated the other catching hold of the spokesthis head wind is my trouble exclaimed the master stamping his foot in sudden anger head wind all the rest is nothing he was calm again in a moment keep them on the move tonight gentlemen just to let them feel weve got hold all the timequietly you know mind you keep your hands off them creighton tomorrow i will talk to them like a dutch uncle a crazy crowd of tinkers yes tinkers i could count the real sailors amongst them on the fingers of one hand nothing will do but a rowifyouplease he paused did you think i had gone wrong there mr baker he tapped his forehead laughed short when i saw him standing there three parts dead and so scaredblack amongst that gaping lotno grit to face whats coming to us allthe notion came to me all at once before i could think sorry for himlike you would be for a sick brute if ever creature was in a mortal funk to die  i thought i would let him go out in his own way kind of impulse it never came into my head those fools hm stand to it nowof course he stuck the belayingpin in his pocket seemed ashamed of himself then sharplyif you see podmore at his tricks again tell him i will have him put under the pump had to do it once before the fellow breaks out like that now and then good cook tho he walked away quickly came back to the companion the two mates followed him through the starlight with amazed eyes he went down three steps and changing his tone spoke with his head near the decki shant turn in tonight in case of anything just call out if did you see the eyes of that sick nigger mr baker i fancied he begged me for something what past all help one lone black beggar amongst the lot of us and he seemed to look through me into the very hell fancy this wretched podmore well let him die in peace i am master here after all let him be he might have been half a man once keep a good lookout he disappeared down below leaving his mates facing one another and more impressed than if they had seen a stone image shed a miraculous tear of compassion over the incertitudes of life and death  in the blue mist spreading from twisted threads that stood upright in the bowls of pipes the forecastle appeared as vast as a hall between the beams a heavy cloud stagnated and the lamps surrounded by halos burned each at the core of a purple glow in two lifeless flames without rays wreaths drifted in denser wisps men sprawled about on the deck sat in negligent poses or bending a knee drooped with one shoulder against a bulkhead lips moved eyes flashed waving arms made sudden eddies in the smoke the murmur of voices seemed to pile itself higher and higher as if unable to run out quick enough through the narrow doors the watch below in their shirts and striding on long white legs resembled raving somnambulists while now and then one of the watch on deck would rush in looking strangely overdressed listen a moment fling a rapid sentence into the noise and run out again but a few remained near the door fascinated and with one ear turned to the deck stick together boys roared davis belfast tried to make himself heard knowles grinned in a slow dazed way a short fellow with a thick clipped beard kept on yelling periodicallywhos afeard whos afeard another one jumped up excited with blazing eyes sent out a string of unattached curses and sat down quietly two men discussed familiarly striking one anothers breast in turn to clinch arguments three others with their heads in a bunch spoke all together with a confidential air and at the top of their voices it was a stormy chaos of speech where intelligible fragments tossing struck the ear one could hearin the last shipwho cares try it on any one of us if  knock undernot a hands turnhe says he is all righti always thoughtnever mind donkin crouching all in a heap against the bowsprit hunched his shoulderblades as high as his ears and hanging a peaked nose resembled a sick vulture with ruffled plumes belfast straddling his legs had a face red with yelling and with arms thrown up figured a maltese cross the two scandinavians in a corner had the dumbfounded and distracted aspect of men gazing at a cataclysm and beyond the light singleton stood in the smoke monumental indistinct with his head touching the beam like a statue of heroic size in the gloom of a crypt  he stepped forward impassive and big the noise subsided like a broken wave but belfast cried once more with uplifted armsthe man is dying i tell ye then sat down suddenly on the hatch and took his head between his hands all looked at singleton gazing upwards from the deck staring out of dark corners or turning their heads with curious glances they were expectant and appeased as if that old man who looked at no one had possessed the secret of their uneasy indignations and desires a sharper vision a clearer knowledge and indeed standing there amongst them he had the uninterested appearance of one who had seen multitudes of ships had listened many times to voices such as theirs had already seen all that could happen on the wide seas they heard his voice rumble in his broad chest as though the words had been rolling towards them out of a rugged past what do you want to do he asked no one answered only knowles mutteredaye aye and somebody said lowits a bloomin shame he waited made a contemptuous gesturei have seen rows aboard ship before some of you were born he said slowly for something or nothing but never for such a thingthe man is dying i tell ye repeated belfast woefully sitting at singletons feetand a black fellow too went on the old seaman i have seen them die like flies he stopped thoughtful as if trying to recollect gruesome things details of horrors hecatombs of niggers they looked at him fascinated he was old enough to remember slavers bloody mutinies pirates perhaps who could tell through what violences and terrors he had lived what would he say he saidyou cant help him die he must he made another pause his moustache and beard stirred he chewed words mumbled behind tangled white hairs incomprehensible and exciting like an oracle behind a veilstop ashoresickinsteadbringing all this head wind afraid the sea will have her owndie in sight of land always so they know itlong passagemore days more dollarsyou  he seemed to wake up from a dream you cant help yourselves he said austerely skippers no fool he has something in his mind look outsay i know em with eyes fixed in front he turned his head from right to left from left to right as if inspecting a long row of astute skippersee said ee would brain me cried donkin in a heartrending tone singleton peered downwards with puzzled attention as though he couldnt find himdamn you he said vaguely giving it up he radiated unspeakable wisdom hard unconcern the chilling air of resignation round him all the listeners felt themselves somehow completely enlightened by their disappointment and mute they lolled about with the careless ease of men who can discern perfectly the irremediable aspect of their existence he profound and unconscious waved his arm once and strode out on deck without another word  belfast was lost in a roundeyed meditation one or two vaulted heavily into upper berths and once there sighed others dived head first inside lower bunksswift and turning round instantly upon themselves like animals going into lairs the grating of a knife scraping burnt clay was heard knowles grinned no more davis said in a tone of ardent conviction then our skippers looney archie muttered my faith we havent heard the last of it yet four bells were struckhalf our watch below gone cried knowles in alarm then reflected well two hours sleep is something towards a rest he observed consolingly some already pretended to slumber and charley sound asleep suddenly said a few slurred words in an arbitrary blank voicethis blamed boy has worrums commented knowles from under a blanket in a learned manner belfast got up and approached archies berthwe pulled him out he whispered sadlywhat said the other with sleepy discontentand now we will have to chuck him overboard went on belfast whose lower lip trembledchuck what asked archiepoor jimmy breathed out belfasthe be blowed said archie with untruthful brutality and sat up in his bunk its all through him if it hadnt been for me there would have been murder on board this shiptaint his fault is it argued belfast in a murmur ive put him to bed an he aint no heavier than an empty beefcask he added with tears in his eyes archie looked at him steadily then turned his nose to the ships side with determination belfast wandered about as though he had lost his way in the dim forecastle and nearly fell over donkin he contemplated him from on high for a while aint ye going to turn in he asked donkin looked up hopelesslythat blackearted scotch son of a thief kicked me he whispered from the floor in a tone of utter desolationand a good job too said belfast still very depressed you were as near hanging as damnit tonight sonny dont you play any of your murthering games around my jimmy you havent pulled him out you just mind cos if i start to kick youhe brightened up a bitif i start to kick you it will be yankee fashionto break something he tapped lightly with his knuckles the top of the bowed head you moind that my bhoy he concluded cheerily donkin let it passwill they split on me he asked with pained anxietywhosplit hissed belfast coming back a step i would split your nose this minyt if i hadnt jimmy to look after who dye think we are donkin rose and watched belfasts back lurch through the doorway on all sides invisible men slept breathing calmly he seemed to draw courage and fury from the peace around him venomous and thinfaced he glared from the ample misfit of borrowed clothes as if looking for something he could smash his heart leaped wildly in his narrow chest they slept he wanted to wring necks gouge eyes spit on faces he shook a dirty pair of meagre fists at the smoking lights yere no men he cried in a deadened tone no one moved yer avent the pluck of a mouse his voice rose to a husky screech wamibo darted out a dishevelled head and looked at him wildly yere sweepings ov ships i ope you will all rot before you die wamibo blinked uncomprehending but interested donkin sat down heavily he blew with force through quivering nostrils he ground and snapped his teeth and with the chin pressed hard against the breast he seemed busy gnawing his way through it as if to get at the heart within  in the morning the ship beginning another day of her wandering life had an aspect of sumptuous freshness like the springtime of the earth the washed decks glistened in a long clear stretch the oblique sunlight struck the yellow brasses in dazzling splashes darted over the polished rods in lines of gold and the single drops of salt water forgotten here and there along the rail were as limpid as drops of dew and sparkled more than scattered diamonds the sails slept hushed by a gentle breeze the sun rising lonely and splendid in the blue sky saw a solitary ship gliding closehauled on the blue sea  the men pressed three deep abreast of the mainmast and opposite the cabindoor they shuffled pushed had an irresolute mien and stolid faces at every slight movement knowles lurched heavily on his short leg donkin glided behind backs restless and anxious like a man looking for an ambush captain allistoun came out on the quarterdeck suddenly he walked to and fro before the front he was grey slight alert shabby in the sunshine and as hard as adamant he had his right hand in the sidepocket of his jacket and also something heavy in there that made folds all down that side one of the seamen cleared his throat ominouslyi havent till now found fault with you men said the master stopping short he faced them with his worn steely gaze that by a universal illusion looked straight into every individual pair of the twenty pairs of eyes before his face at his back mr baker gloomy and bullnecked grunted low mr creighton fresh as paint had rosy cheeks and a ready resolute bearing and i dont now continued the master but i am here to drive this ship and keep every manjack aboard of her up to the mark if you knew your work as well as i do mine there would be no trouble youve been braying in the dark about see tomorrow morning well you see me now what do you want he waited stepping quickly to and fro giving them searching glances what did they want they shifted from foot to foot they balanced their bodies some pushing back their caps scratched their heads what did they want jimmy was forgotten no one thought of him alone forward in his cabin fighting great shadows clinging to brazen lies chuckling painfully over his transparent deceptions no not jimmy he was more forgotten than if he had been dead they wanted great things and suddenly all the simple words they knew seemed to be lost for ever in the immensity of their vague and burning desire they knew what they wanted but they could not find anything worth saying they stirred on one spot swinging at the end of muscular arms big tarry hands with crooked fingers a murmur died outwhat is itfood asked the master you know the stores have been spoiled off the capewe know that sir said a bearded shellback in the front rankwork too hardeh too much for your strength he asked again there was an offended silencewe dont want to go shorthanded sir began at last davis in a wavering voice and this ere blackenough cried the master he stood scanning them for a moment then walking a few steps this way and that began to storm at them coldly in gusts violent and cutting like the gales of those icy seas that had known his youthtell you whats the matter too big for your boots think yourselves damn good men know half your work do half your duty think it too much if you did ten times as much it wouldnt be enoughwe did our best by her sir cried some one with shaky exasperationyour best stormed on the master you hear a lot on shore dont you they dont tell you there your best isnt much to boast of i tell youyour best is no better than bad  you can do no more no i know and say nothing but you stop your caper or i will stop it for you i am ready for you stop it he shook a finger at the crowd as to that man he raised his voice very much as to that man if he puts his nose out on deck without my leave i will clap him in irons there the cook heard him forward ran out of the galley lifting his arms horrified unbelieving amazed and ran in again there was a moment of profound silence during which a bowlegged seaman stepping aside expectorated decorously into the scupper there is another thing said the master calmly he made a quick stride and with a swing took an iron belayingpin out of his pocket this his movement was so unexpected and sudden that the crowd stepped back he gazed fixedly at their faces and some at once put on a surprised air as though they had never seen a belayingpin before he held it up this is my affair i dont ask you any questions but you all know it it has got to go where it came from his eyes became angry the crowd stirred uneasily they looked away from the piece of iron they appeared shy they were embarrassed and shocked as though it had been something horrid scandalous or indelicate that in common decency should not have been flourished like this in broad daylight the master watched them attentively donkin he called out in a short sharp tone  donkin dodged behind one then behind another but they looked over their shoulders and moved aside the ranks kept on opening before him closing behind till at last he appeared alone before the master as though he had come up through the deck captain allistoun moved close to him they were much of a size and at short range the master exchanged a deadly glance with the beady eyes they waveredyou know this asked the masterno i dont answered the other with cheeky trepidationyou are a cur take it ordered the master donkins arms seemed glued to his thighs he stood eyes front as if drawn on parade take it repeated the master and stepped closer they breathed on one another take it said captain allistoun again making a menacing gesture donkin tore away one arm from his sidevy are yer down on me he mumbled with effort and as if his mouth had been full of doughif you dont began the master donkin snatched at the pin as though his intention had been to run away with it and remained stock still holding it like a candle put it back where you took it from said captain allistoun looking at him fiercely donkin stepped back opening wide eyes go you blackguard or i will make you cried the master driving him slowly backwards by a menacing advance he dodged and with the dangerous iron tried to guard his head from a threatening fist mr baker ceased grunting for a momentgood by jove murmured appreciatively mr creighton in the tone of a connoisseurdont tech me snarled donkin backing awaythen go go fasterdont yer it me i will pull yer up afore the magistryt ill show yer up captain allistoun made a long stride and donkin turning his back fairly ran off a little then stopped and over his shoulder showed yellow teethfurther on forerigging urged the master pointing with his armare yer goin to stand by and see me bullied screamed donkin at the silent crowd that watched him captain allistoun walked at him smartly he started off again with a leap dashed at the forerigging rammed the pin into its hole violently ill be even with yer yet he screamed at the ship at large and vanished beyond the foremast captain allistoun spun round and walked back aft with a composed face as though he had already forgotten the scene men moved out of his way he looked at no onethat will do mr baker send the watch below he said quietly and you men try to walk straight for the future he added in a calm voice he looked pensively for a while at the backs of the impressed and retreating crowd breakfast steward he called in a tone of relief through the cabin doori didnt like to see yououghgive that pin to that chap sir observed mr baker he could have bustoughbust your head like an eggshell with ito he muttered the master absently queer lot he went on in a low voice i suppose its all right now can never tell tho nowadays with such a years ago i was a young master thenone china voyage i had a mutiny real mutiny baker different men tho i knew what they wanted they wanted to broach the cargo and get at the liquor very simple we knocked them about for two days and when they had enoughgentle as lambs good crew and a smart trip i made he glanced aloft at the yards braced sharp up head wind day after day he exclaimed bitterly shall we never get a decent slant this passageready sir said the steward appearing before them as if by magic and with a stained napkin in his handah all right come along mr bakerits latewith all this nonsense      chapter five  a heavy atmosphere of oppressive quietude pervaded the ship in the afternoon men went about washing clothes and hanging them out to dry in the unprosperous breeze with the meditative languor of disenchanted philosophers very little was said the problem of life seemed too voluminous for the narrow limits of human speech and by common consent it was abandoned to the great sea that had from the beginning enfolded it in its immense grip to the sea that knew all and would in time infallibly unveil to each the wisdom hidden in all the errors the certitude that lurks in doubts the realm of safety and peace beyond the frontiers of sorrow and fear and in the confused current of impotent thoughts that set unceasingly this way and that through bodies of men jimmy bobbed up upon the surface compelling attention like a black buoy chained to the bottom of a muddy stream falsehood triumphed it triumphed through doubt through stupidity through pity through sentimentalism we set ourselves to bolster it up from compassion from recklessness from a sense of fun jimmys steadfastness to his untruthful attitude in the face of the inevitable truth had the proportions of a colossal enigmaof a manifestation grand and incomprehensible that at times inspired a wondering awe and there was also to many something exquisitely droll in fooling him thus to the top of his bent the latent egoism of tenderness to suffering appeared in the developing anxiety not to see him die his obstinate nonrecognition of the only certitude whose approach we could watch from day to day was as disquieting as the failure of some law of nature he was so utterly wrong about himself that one could not but suspect him of having access to some source of supernatural knowledge he was absurd to the point of inspiration he was unique and as fascinating as only something inhuman could be he seemed to shout his denials already from beyond the awful border he was becoming immaterial like an apparition his cheekbones rose the forehead slanted more the face was all hollows patches of shade and the fleshless head resembled a disinterred black skull fitted with two restless globes of silver in the sockets of eyes he was demoralising through him we were becoming highly humanised tender complex excessively decadent we understood the subtlety of his fear sympathised with all his repulsions shrinkings evasions delusionsas though we had been overcivilised and rotten and without any knowledge of the meaning of life we had the air of being initiated in some infamous mysteries we had the profound grimaces of conspirators exchanged meaning glances significant short words we were inexpressibly vile and very much pleased with ourselves we lied to him with gravity with emotion with unction as if performing some moral trick with a view to an eternal reward we made a chorus of affirmation to his wildest assertions as though he had been a millionaire a politician or a reformerand we a crowd of ambitious lubbers when we ventured to question his statements we did it after the manner of obsequious sycophants to the end that his glory should be augmented by the flattery of our dissent he influenced the moral tone of our world as though he had it in his power to distribute honours treasures or pain and he could give us nothing but his contempt it was immense it seemed to grow gradually larger as his body day by day shrank a little more while we looked it was the only thing about himof himthat gave the impression of durability and vigour it lived within him with an unquenchable life it spoke through the eternal pout of his black lips it looked at us through the impertinent mournfulness of his languid and enormous stare we watched him intently he seemed unwilling to move as if distrustful of his own solidity the slightest gesture must have disclosed to him it could not surely be otherwise his bodily weakness and caused a pang of mental suffering he was chary of movements he lay stretched out chin on blanket in a kind of sly cautious immobility only his eyes roamed over faces his eyes disdainful penetrating and sad  it was at that time that belfasts devotionand also his pugnacitysecured universal respect he spent every moment of his spare time in jimmys cabin he tended him talked to him was as gentle as a woman as tenderly gay as an old philanthropist as sentimentally careful of his nigger as a model slaveowner but outside he was irritable explosive as gunpowder sombre suspicious and never more brutal than when most sorrowful with him it was a tear and a blow a tear for jimmy a blow for any one who did not seem to take a scrupulously orthodox view of jimmys case we talked about nothing else the two scandinavians even discussed the situationbut it was impossible to know in what spirit because they quarrelled in their own language belfast suspected one of them of irreverence and in this incertitude thought that there was no option but to fight them both they became very much terrified by his truculence and henceforth lived amongst us dejected like a pair of mutes wamibo never spoke intelligibly but he was as smileless as an animalseemed to know much less about it all than the catand consequently was safe moreover he had belonged to the chosen band of jimmys rescuers and was above suspicion archie was silent generally but often spent an hour or so talking to jimmy quietly with an air of proprietorship at any time of the day and often through the night some man could be seen sitting on jimmys box in the evening between six and eight the cabin was crowded and there was an interested group at the door every one stared at the nigger  he basked in the warmth of our interest his eye gleamed ironically and in a weak voice he reproached us with our cowardice he would say if you fellows had stuck out for me i would be now on deck we hung our heads yes but if you think i am going to let them put me in irons just to show you sport well no it ruins my health this lyingup it does you dont care we were as abashed as if it had been true his superb impudence carried all before it we would not have dared to revolt we didnt want to really we wanted to keep him alive till hometo the end of the voyage  singleton as usual held aloof appearing to scorn the insignificant events of an ended life once only he came along and unexpectedly stopped in the doorway he peered at jimmy in profound silence as if desirous to add that black image to the crowd of shades that peopled his old memory we kept very quiet and for a long time singleton stood there as though he had come by appointment to call for some one or to see some important event james wait lay perfectly still and apparently not aware of the gaze scrutinising him with a steadiness full of expectation there was a sense of a contest in the air we felt the inward strain of men watching a wrestling bout at last jimmy with perceptible apprehension turned his head on the pillowgood evening he said in a conciliating tonehm answered the old seaman grumpily for a moment longer he looked at jimmy with severe fixity then suddenly went away it was a long time before any one spoke in the little cabin though we all breathed more freely as men do after an escape from some dangerous situation we all knew the old mans ideas about jimmy and nobody dared to combat them they were unsettling they caused pain and what was worse they might have been true for all we knew only once did he condescend to explain them fully but the impression was lasting he said that jimmy was the cause of head winds mortally sick menhe maintainedlinger till the first sight of land and then die and jimmy knew that the very first land would draw his life from him it is so in every ship didnt we know it he asked us with austere contempt what did we know what would we doubt next jimmys desire encouraged by us and aided by wamibos he was a finnwasnt he very well by wamibos spells delayed the ship in the open sea only lubberly fools couldnt see it whoever heard of such a run of calms and head winds it wasnt natural we could not deny that it was strange we felt uneasy the common saying more days more dollars did not give the usual comfort because the stores were running short much had been spoiled off the cape and we were on half allowance of biscuit peas sugar and tea had been finished long ago salt meat was giving out we had plenty of coffee but very little water to make it with we took up another hole in our belts and went on scraping polishing painting the ship from morning to night and soon she looked as though she had come out of a bandbox but hunger lived on board of her not dead starvation but steady living hunger that stalked about the decks slept in the forecastle the tormentor of waking moments the disturber of dreams we looked to windward for signs of change every few hours of night and day we put her round with the hope that she would come up on that tack at last she didnt she seemed to have forgotten the way home she rushed to and fro heading northwest heading east she ran backwards and forwards distracted like a timid creature at the foot of a wall sometimes as if tired to death she would wallow languidly for a day in the smooth swell of an unruffled sea all up the swinging masts the sails thrashed furiously through the hot stillness of the calm we were weary hungry thirsty we commenced to believe singleton but with unshaken fidelity dissembled to jimmy we spoke to him with jocose allusiveness like cheerful accomplices in a clever plot but we looked to the westward over the rail with longing eyes for a sign of hope for a sign of fair wind even if its first breath should bring death to our reluctant jimmy in vain the universe conspired with james wait light airs from the northward sprang up again the sky remained clear and round our weariness the glittering sea touched by the breeze basked voluptuously in the great sunshine as though it had forgotten our life and trouble  donkin looked out for a fair wind along with the rest no one knew the venom of his thoughts now he was silent and appeared thinner as if consumed slowly by an inward rage at the injustice of men and of fate he was ignored by all and spoke to no one but his hate for every man dwelt in his furtive eyes he talked with the cook only having somehow persuaded the good man that hedonkinwas a much calumniated and persecuted person together they bewailed the immorality of the ships company there could be no greater criminals than we who by our lies conspired to send the unprepared soul of a poor ignorant black man to everlasting perdition podmore cooked what there was to cook remorsefully and felt all the time that by preparing the food of such sinners he imperilled his own salvation as to the captainhe had sailed with him for seven years now he said and would not have believed it possible that such a man well well there it was cant get out of it judgment capsized all in a minute struck in all his pride more like a sudden visitation than anything else donkin perched sullenly on the coallocker swung his legs and concurred he paid in the coin of spurious assent for the privilege to sit in the galley he was disheartened and scandalised he agreed with the cook could find no words severe enough to criticise our conduct and when in the heat of reprobation he swore at us podmore who would have liked to swear also if it hadnt been for his principles pretended not to hear so donkin unrebuked cursed enough for two cadged for matches borrowed tobacco and loafed for hours very much at home before the stove from there he could hear us on the other side of the bulkhead talking to jimmy the cook knocked the saucepans about slammed the oven door muttered prophesies of damnation for all the ships company and donkin who did not admit of any hereafter except for purposes of blasphemy listened concentrated and angry gloating fiercely over a calledup image of infinite tormentas men gloat over the accursed images of cruelty and revenge of greed and of power  on clear evenings the silent ship under the cold sheen of the dead moon took on a false aspect of passionless repose resembling the winter of the earth under her a long band of gold barred the black disc of the sea footsteps echoed on her quiet decks the moonlight clung to her like a frosted mist and the white sails stood out in dazzling cones as of stainless snow in the magnificence of the phantom rays the ship appeared pure like a vision of ideal beauty illusive like a tender dream of serene peace and nothing in her was real nothing was distinct and solid but the heavy shadows that filled her decks with their unceasing and noiseless stir the shadows darker than the night and more restless than the thoughts of men  donkin prowled spiteful and alone amongst the shadows thinking that jimmy too long delayed to die that evening land had been reported from aloft and the master while adjusting the tubes of the long glass had observed with quiet bitterness to mr baker that after fighting our way inch by inch to the western islands there was nothing to expect now but a spell of calm the sky was clear and the barometer high the light breeze dropped with the sun and an enormous stillness forerunner of a night without wind descended upon the heated waters of the ocean as long as daylight lasted the hands collected on the forecastlehead watched on the eastern sky the island of flores that rose above the level expanse of the sea with irregular and broken outlines like a sombre ruin upon a vast and deserted plain it was the first land seen for nearly four months charley was excited and in the midst of general indulgence took liberties with his betters men strangely elated without knowing why talked in groups and pointed with bared arms for the first time that voyage jimmys sham existence seemed for a moment forgotten in the face of a solid reality we had got so far anyhow belfast discoursed quoting imaginary examples of short homeward runs from the islands them smart fruit schooners do it in five days he affirmed what do you wantonly a good little breeze archie maintained that seven days was the record passage and they disputed amicably with insulting words knowles declared he could already smell home from there and with a heavy list on his short leg laughed fit to split his sides a group of grizzled seadogs looked out for a time in silence and with grim absorbed faces one said suddenlytaint far to london nowmy first night ashore blamme if i havent steak and onions for supper and a pint of bitter said anothera barrel ye mean shouted someoneham an eggs three times a day thats the way i live cried an excited voice there was a stir appreciative murmurs eyes began to shine jaws champed short nervous laughs were heard archie smiled with reserve all to himself singleton came up gave a careless glance and went down again without saying a word indifferent like a man who had seen flores an incalculable number of times the night travelling from the east blotted out of the limpid sky the purple stain of the high land dead calm said somebody quietly the murmur of lively talk suddenly wavered died out the clusters broke up men began to drift away one by one descending the ladders slowly and with serious faces as if sobered by that reminder of their dependence upon the invisible and when the big yellow moon ascended gently above the sharp rim of the clear horizon it found the ship wrapped up in a breathless silence a fearless ship that seemed to sleep profoundly dreamlessly on the bosom of the sleeping and terrible sea  donkin chafed at the peaceat the shipat the sea that stretching away on all sides merged into the illimitable silence of all creation he felt himself pulled up sharp by unrecognised grievances he had been physically cowed but his injured dignity remained indomitable and nothing could heal his lacerated feelings here was land alreadyhome very soona bad paydayno clothesmore hard work how offensive all this was land the land that draws away life from sick sailors that nigger there had moneyclotheseasy times and would not die land draws life away he felt tempted to go and see whether it did perhaps already it would be a bit of luck there was money in the beggars chest he stepped briskly out of the shadows into the moonlight and instantly his craving hungry face from sallow became livid he opened the door of the cabin and had a shock sure enough jimmy was dead he moved no more than a recumbent figure with clasped hands carved on the lid of a stone coffin donkin glared with avidity then jimmy without stirring blinked his eyelids and donkin had another shock those eyes were rather startling he shut the door behind his back with gentle care looking intently the while at james wait as though he had come in there at a great risk to tell some secret of startling importance jimmy did not move but glanced languidly out of the corners of his eyescalm he askedyuss said donkin very disappointed and sat down on the box  jimmy was used to such visits at all times of night of day men succeeded one another they spoke in clear voices pronounced cheerful words repeated old jokes listened to him and each going out seemed to leave behind a little of his own vitality surrender some of his own strength renew the assurance of lifethe indestructible thing he did not like to be alone in his cabin because when he was alone it seemed to him as if he hadnt been there at all there was nothing no pain not now perfectly rightbut he couldnt enjoy his healthful repose unless some one was by to see it this man would do as well as anybody donkin watched him stealthilysoon home now observed waitvy dyer whisper asked donkin with interest cant yer speak up jimmy looked annoyed and said nothing for a while then in a lifeless unringing voicewhy should i shout you aint deaf that i knowoh i can ear right enough answered donkin in a low tone and looked down he was thinking sadly of going out when jimmy spoke againtime we did get home to get something decent to eat i am always hungry donkin felt angry all of a suddenwhat about me he hissed i am ungry too an got ter work you ungryyour work wont kill you commented wait feebly theres a couple of biscuits in the lower bunk thereyou may have one i cant eat them donkin dived in groped in the corner and when he came up again his mouth was full he munched with ardour jimmy seemed to doze with open eyes donkin finished his hard bread and got upyoure not going asked jimmy staring at the ceilingno said donkin impulsively and instead of going out leaned his back against the closed door he looked at james wait and saw him long lean dried up as though all his flesh had shrivelled on his bones in the heat of a white furnace the meagre fingers of one hand moved lightly upon the edge of the bunk playing an endless tune to look at him was irritating and fatiguing he could last like this for days he was outrageousbelonging wholly neither to death nor life and perfectly invulnerable in his apparent ignorance of both donkin felt tempted to enlighten himwhat are yer thinkin of he asked surlily james wait had a grimacing smile that passed over the deathlike impassiveness of his bony face incredible and frightful as would in a dream have been the sudden smile of a corpse  there is a girl whispered wait canton street girlshe chucked a third engineer of a rennie boatfor me cooks oysters just as i like she saysshe would chuckany tofflouder  donkin could hardly believe his ears he was scandalisedwould she yer wouldnt be any good to er he said with unrestrained disgust wait was not there to hear him he was swaggering up the east india dock road saying kindly come along for a treat pushing glass swingdoors posing with superb assurance in the gaslight above a mahogany counterdyer think yer will ever get ashore asked donkin angrily wait came back with a startten days he said promptly and returned at once to the regions of memory that know nothing of time he felt untired calm and safely withdrawn within himself beyond the reach of every grave incertitude there was something of the immutable quality of eternity in the slow moments of his complete restfulness he was very quiet and easy amongst his vivid reminiscences which he mistook joyfully for images of an undoubted future he cared for no one donkin felt this vaguely like a blind man feeling in his darkness the fatal antagonism of all the surrounding existences that to him shall for ever remain irrealisable unseen and enviable he had a desire to assert his importance to break to crush to be even with everybody for everything to tear the veil unmask expose leave no refugea perfidious desire of truthfulness he laughed in a mocking splutter and said  ten days strike me blind if ever you will be dead by this time tomorrow praps ten days he waited for a while dye ear me blamme if yer dont look dead already  wait must have been collecting his strength for he said almost aloudyoure a stinking cadging liar every one knows you and sitting up against all probability startled his visitor horribly but very soon donkin recovered himself he blustered what what whos a liar you arethe crowd arethe skippereverybody i aint putting on airs whos yer he nearly choked himself with indignation whos yer to put on airs he repeated trembling ave oneave one says eean cawnt eat em isself now ill ave both by gawdi will yer nobody  he plunged into the lower bunk rooted in there and brought to light another dusty biscuit he held it up before jimmythen took a bite defiantly  what now he asked with feverish impudence yer may take onesays yer why not giv me both no im a mangy dorg one fur a mangy dorg ill tyke both can yer stop me try come on try  jimmy was clasping his legs and hiding his face on the knees his shirt clung to him every rib was visible his emaciated back was shaken in repeated jerks by the panting catches of his breath  yer wont yer cant what did i say went on donkin fiercely he swallowed another dry mouthful with a hasty effort the others silent helplessness his weakness his shrinking attitude exasperated him yere done he cried whos yer to be lied to to be waited on and an foot like a bloomin ymperor yer nobody yer no one at all he spluttered with such a strength of unerring conviction that it shook him from head to foot in coming out and left him vibrating like a released string  james wait rallied again he lifted his head and turned bravely at donkin who saw a strange face an unknown face a fantastic and grimacing mask of despair and fury its lips moved rapidly and hollow moaning whistling sounds filled the cabin with a vague mutter full of menace complaint and desolation like the faroff murmur of a rising wind wait shook his head rolled his eyes he denied cursed threatenedand not a word had the strength to pass beyond the sorrowful pout of those black lips it was incomprehensible and disturbing a gibberish of emotions a frantic dumb show of speech pleading for impossible things promising a shadowy vengeance it sobered donkin into a scrutinising watchfulness  yer cant oller see what did i tell yer he said slowly after a moment of attentive examination the other kept on headlong and unheard nodding passionately grinning with grotesque and appalling flashes of big white teeth donkin as if fascinated by the dumb eloquence and anger of that black phantom approached stretching his neck out with distrustful curiosity and it seemed to him suddenly that he was looking only at the shadow of a man crouching high in the bunk on the level with his eyeswhat what he said he seemed to catch the shape of some words in the continuous panting hiss yer will tell belfast will yer are yer a bloomin kid he trembled with alarm and rage tell yer granmother yer afeard whos yer ter be afeard moren any one his passionate sense of his own importance ran away with a last remnant of caution tell an be damned tell if yer can he cried ive been treated worsern a dorg by your

me yer will pay fur it with yer money im goin ter ave it in a minyte as soon has yere dead yer bloomin useless fraud thats the man i am an yere a thinga bloody thing yahyou corpse he flung at jimmys head the biscuit he had been all the time clutching hard but it only grazed and striking with a loud crack the bulkhead beyond burst like a handgrenade into flying pieces james wait as if wounded mortally fell back on the pillow his lips ceased to move and the rolling eyes became quiet and stared upwards with an intense and steady persistence donkin was surprised he sat suddenly on the chest and looked down exhausted and gloomy after a moment he began to mutter to himself die you beggardie somebodyll come in i wish i was drunk ten days oysters he looked up and spoke louder no no more for yer no more bloomin gals that cook oysters whos yer its my turn now i wish i was drunk i would soon giv you a leg up thats where yer bound to go feet fust through a port splash never see yer any more overboard good nuff fur yer jimmys head moved slightly and he turned his eyes to donkins face a gaze unbelieving desolated and appealing of a child frightened by the menace of being shut up alone in the dark donkin observed him from the chest with hopeful eyes then without rising tried the lid locked i wish i was drunk he muttered and getting up listened anxiously to the distant sound of footsteps on the deck they approachedceased some one yawned interminably just outside the door and the footsteps went away shuffling lazily donkins fluttering heart eased its pace and when he looked towards the bunk again jimmy was staring as before at the white beamow dyer feel now he askedbad breathed out jimmy  donkin sat down patient and purposeful every halfhour the bells spoke to one another ringing along the whole length of the ship jimmys respiration was so rapid that it couldnt be counted so faint that it couldnt be heard his eyes were terrified as though he had been looking at unspeakable horrors and by his face one could see that he was thinking of abominable things suddenly with an incredibly strong and heartbreaking voice he sobbed out  overboard i my god donkin writhed a little on the box he looked unwillingly james wait was mute his two long bony hands smoothed the blanket upwards as though he had wished to gather it all up under his chin a tear a big solitary tear escaped from the corner of his eye and without touching the hollow cheek fell on the pillow his throat rattled faintly  and donkin watching the end of that hateful nigger felt the anguishing grasp of a great sorrow on his heart at the thought that he himself some day would have to go through it alljust like thisperhaps his eyes became moist poor beggar he murmured the night seemed to go by in a flash it seemed to him he could hear the irremediable rush of precious minutes how long would this blooming affair last too long surely no luck he could not restrain himself he got up and approached the bunk wait did not stir only his eyes appeared alive and his hands continued their smoothing movement with a horrible and tireless industry donkin bent over  jimmy he called low there was no answer but the rattle stopped dyer see me he asked trembling jimmys chest heaved donkin looking away bent his ear to jimmys lips and heard a sound like the rustle of a single dry leaf driven along the smooth sand of a beach it shaped itself  light the lamp and go breathed out wait  donkin instinctively glanced over his shoulder at the brilliant flame then still looking away felt under the pillow for a key he got it at once and for the next few minutes remained on his knees shakily but swiftly busy inside the box when he got up his facefor the first time in his lifehad a pink flushperhaps of triumph  he slipped the key under the pillow again avoiding to glance at jimmy who had not moved he turned his back squarely from the bunk and started to the door as though he were going to walk a mile at his second stride he had his nose against it he clutched the handle cautiously but at that moment he received the irresistible impression of something happening behind his back he spun round as though he had been tapped on the shoulder he was just in time to see waits eyes blaze up and go out at once like two lamps overturned together by a sweeping blow something resembling a scarlet thread hung down his chin out of the corner of his lipsand he had ceased to breathe  donkin closed the door behind him gently but firmly sleeping men huddled under jackets made on the lighted deck shapeless dark mounds that had the appearance of neglected graves nothing had been done all through the night and he hadnt been missed he stood motionless and perfectly astounded to find the world outside as he had left it there was the sea the shipsleeping men and he wondered absurdly at it as though he had expected to find the men dead familiar things gone for ever as though like a wanderer returning after many years he had expected to see bewildering changes he shuddered a little in the penetrating freshness of the air and hugged himself forlornly the declining moon drooped sadly in the western board as if withered by the cold touch of a pale dawn the ship slept and the immortal sea stretched away immense and hazy like the image of life with a glittering surface and lightless depths donkin gave it a defiant glance and slunk off noiselessly as if judged and cast out by the august silence of its might  jimmys death after all came as a tremendous surprise we did not know till then how much faith we had put in his delusions we had taken his chances of life so much at his own valuation that his death like the death of an old belief shook the foundations of our society a common bond was gone the strong effective and respectable bond of a sentimental lie all that day we mooned at our work with suspicious looks and a disabused air in our hearts we thought that in the matter of his departure jimmy had acted in a perverse and unfriendly manner he didnt back us up as a shipmate should in going he took away with himself the gloomy and solemn shadow in which our folly had posed with humane satisfaction as a tender arbiter of fate and now we saw it was no such thing it was just common foolishness a silly and ineffectual meddling with issues of majestic importthat is if podmore was right perhaps he was doubt survived jimmy and like a community of banded criminals disintegrated by a touch of grace we were profoundly scandalised with each other men spoke unkindly to their best chums others refused to speak at all singleton only was not surprised deadis he of course he said pointing at the island right abeam for the calm still held the ship spellbound within sight of flores deadof course he wasnt surprised here was the land and there on the forehatch and waiting for the sailmakerthere was that corpse cause and effect and for the first time that voyage the old seaman became quite cheery and garrulous explaining and illustrating from the stores of experience how in sickness the sight of an island even a very small one is generally more fatal than the view of a continent but he couldnt explain why  jimmy was to be buried at five and it was a long day till thena day of mental disquiet and even of physical disturbance we took no interest in our work and very properly were rebuked for it this in our constant state of hungry irritation was exasperating donkin worked with his brow bound in a dirty rag and looked so ghastly that mr baker was touched with compassion at the sight of this plucky sufferingough you donkin put down your work and go layup this watch you look illi am bad sirin my ead he said in a subdued voice and vanished speedily this annoyed many and they thought the mate bloomin soft today captain allistoun could be seen on the poop watching the sky to the southwest and it soon got to be known about the decks that the barometer had begun to fall in the night and that a breeze might be expected before long this by a subtle association of ideas led to violent quarrelling as to the exact moment of jimmys death was it before or after that ere glass started down it was impossible to know and it caused much contemptuous growling at one another all of a sudden there was a great tumult forward pacific knowles and goodtempered davis had come to blows over it the watch below interfered with spirit and for ten minutes there was a noisy scrimmage round the hatch where in the balancing shade of the sails jimmys body wrapped up in a white blanket was watched over by the sorrowful belfast who in his desolation disdained the fray when the noise had ceased and the passions had calmed into surly silence he stood up at the head of the swathed body lifting both arms on high cried with pained indignationyou ought to be ashamed of yourselves we were  belfast took his bereavement very hard he gave proofs of unextinguishable devotion it was he and no other man who would help the sailmaker to prepare what was left of jimmy for a solemn surrender to the insatiable sea he arranged the weights carefully at the feet two holystones an old anchorshackle without its pin some broken links of a wornout stream cable he arranged them this way then that bless my soul you arent afraid he will chafe his heel said the sailmaker who hated the job he pushed the needle purring furiously with his head in a cloud of tobacco smoke he turned the flaps over pulled at the stitches stretched at the canvaslift his shoulders pull to you a bit sooo steady belfast obeyed pulled lifted overcome with sorrow dropping tears on the tarred twine dont you drag the canvas too taut over his poor face sails he entreated tearfullywhat are you fashing yourself for he will be comfortable enough assured the sailmaker cutting the thread after the last stitch which came about the middle of jimmys forehead he rolled up the remaining canvas put away the needles what makes you take on so he asked belfast looked down at the long package of grey sailclothi pulled him out he whispered and he did not want to go if i had sat up with him last night he would have kept alive for me but something made me tired the sailmaker took vigorous draws at his pipe and mumbledwhen i west india station in the blanche frigate yellow jack sewed in twenty men a week portsmouthdevonport mentowniesknew their fathers mothers sistersthe whole boiling of em thought nothing of it and these niggers like this oneyou dont know where it comes from got nobody no use to nobody who will miss himi doi pulled him out mourned belfast dismally  on two planks nailed together and apparently resigned and still under the folds of the union jack with a white border james wait carried aft by four men was deposited slowly with his feet pointing at an open port a swell had set in from the westward and following on the roll of the ship the red ensign at halfmast darted out and collapsed again on the grey sky like a tongue of flickering fire charley tolled the bell and at every swing to starboard the whole vast semicircle of steely waters visible on that side seemed to come up with a rush to the edge of the port as if impatient to get at our jimmy every one was there but donkin who was too ill to come the captain and mr creighton stood bareheaded on the break of the poop mr baker directed by the master who had said to him gravelyyou know more about the prayer book than i do came out of the cabin door quickly and a little embarrassed all the caps went off he began to read in a low tone and with his usual harmlessly menacing utterance as though he had been for the last time reproving confidentially that dead seaman at his feet the men listened in scattered groups they leaned on the fife rail gazing on the deck they held their chins in their hands thoughtfully or with crossed arms and one knee slightly bent hung their heads in an attitude of upright meditation wamibo dreamed mr baker read on grunting reverently at the turn of every page the words missing the unsteady hearts of men rolled out to wander without a home upon the heartless sea and james wait silenced for ever lay uncritical and passive under the hoarse murmur of despair and hopes  two men made ready and waited for those words that send so many of our brothers to their last plunge mr baker began the passage stand by muttered the boatswain mr baker read out to the deep and paused the men lifted the inboard end of the planks the boatswain snatched off the union jack and james wait did not movehigher muttered the boatswain angrily all the heads were raised every man stirred uneasily but james wait gave no sign of going in death and swathed up for all eternity he yet seemed to cling to the ship with the grip of an undying fear higher lift whispered the boatswain fiercelyhe wont go stammered one of the men shakily and both appeared ready to drop everything mr baker waited burying his face in the book and shuffling his feet nervously all the men looked profoundly disturbed from their midst a faint humming noise spread outgrowing louder jimmy cried belfast in a wailing tone and there was a second of shuddering dismay  jimmy be a man he shrieked passionately every mouth was wide open not an eyelid winked he stared wildly twitching all over he bent his body forward like a man peering at an horror go he shouted and sprang out of the crowd with his arm extended go jimmyjimmy go go his fingers touched the head of the body and the grey package started reluctantly to whizz off the lifted planks all at once with the suddenness of a flash of lightning the crowd stepped forward like one man a deep ahhh came out vibrating from the broad chests the ship rolled as if relieved of an unfair burden the sails flapped belfast supported by archie gasped hysterically and charley who anxious to see jimmys last dive leaped headlong on the rail was too late to see anything but the faint circle of a vanishing ripple  mr baker perspiring abundantly read out the last prayer in a deep rumour of excited men and fluttering sails amen he said in an unsteady growl and closed the book  square the yards thundered a voice above his head all hands gave a jump one or two dropped their caps mr baker looked up surprised the master standing on the break of the poop pointed to the westward breeze coming he said man the weather braces mr baker crammed the book hurriedly into his pocket forward therelet go the foretack he hailed joyfully bareheaded and brisk square the foreyard you portwatchfair windfair wind muttered the men going to the braceswhat did i tell you mumbled old singleton flinging down coil after coil with hasty energy i knowed ithes gone and here it comes  it came with the sound of a lofty and powerful sigh the sails filled the ship gathered way and the waking sea began to murmur sleepily of home to the ears of men  that night while the ship rushed foaming to the northward before a freshening gale the boatswain unbosomed himself to the petty officers berththe chap was nothing but trouble he said from the moment he came aboarddye rememberthat night in bombay been bullying all that softy crowdcheeked the old manwe had to go fooling all over a halfdrowned ship to save him dam nigh a mutiny all for himand now the mate abused me like a pickpocket for forgetting to dab a lump of grease on them planks so i did but you ought to have known better too than to leave a nail sticking uphey chips  and you ought to have known better than to chuck all my tools overboard for im like a skeary greenhorn retorted the morose carpenter wellhes gone after em now he added in an unforgiving toneon the china station i remember once the admiral he says to me began the sailmaker  a week afterwards the narcissus entered the chops of the channel  under white wings she skimmed low over the blue sea like a great tired bird speeding to its nest the clouds raced with her mastheads they rose astern enormous and white soared to the zenith flew past and falling down the wide curve of the sky seemed to dash headlong into the seathe clouds swifter than the ship more free but without a home the coast to welcome her stepped out of space into the sunshine the lofty headlands trod masterfully into the sea the wide bays smiled in the light the shadows of homeless clouds ran along the sunny plains leaped over valleys without a check darted up the hills rolled down the slopes and the sunshine pursued them with patches of running brightness on the brows of dark cliffs white lighthouses shone in pillars of light the channel glittered like a blue mantle shot with gold and starred by the silver of the capping seas the narcissus rushed past the headlands and the bays outwardbound vessels crossed her track lying over and with their masts stripped for a slogging fight with the hard souwester and inshore a string of smoking steamboats waddled hugging the coast like migrating and amphibious monsters distrustful of the restless waves  at night the headlands retreated the bays advanced into one unbroken line of gloom the lights of the earth mingled with the lights of heaven and above the tossing lanterns of a trawling fleet a great lighthouse shone steadily like an enormous riding light burning above a vessel of fabulous dimensions below its steady glow the coast stretching away straight and black resembled the high side of an indestructible craft riding motionless upon the immortal and unresting sea the dark land lay alone in the midst of waters like a mighty ship bestarred with vigilant lightsa ship carrying the burden of millions of livesa ship freighted with dross and with jewels with gold and with steel she towered up immense and strong guarding priceless traditions and untold suffering sheltering glorious memories and base forgetfulness ignoble virtues and splendid transgressions a great ship for ages had the ocean battered in vain her enduring sides she was there when the world was vaster and darker when the sea was great and mysterious and ready to surrender the prize of fame to audacious men a ship mother of fleets and nations the great flagship of the race stronger than the storms and anchored in the open sea  the narcissus heeling over to offshore gusts rounded the south foreland passed through the downs and in tow entered the river shorn of the glory of her white wings she wound obediently after the tug through the maze of invisible channels as she passed them the redpainted lightvessels swung at their moorings seemed for an instant to sail with great speed in the rush of tide and the next moment were left hopelessly behind the big buoys on the tails of banks slipped past her sides very low and dropping in her wake tugged at their chains like fierce watchdogs the reach narrowed from both sides the land approached the ship she went steadily up the river on the riverside slopes the houses appeared in groupsseemed to stream down the declivities at a run to see her pass and checked by the mud of the foreshore crowded on the banks further on the tall factory chimneys appeared in insolent bands and watched her go by like a straggling crowd of slim giants swaggering and upright under the black plummets of smoke cavalierly aslant she swept round the bends an impure breeze shrieked a welcome between her stripped spars and the land closing in stepped between the ship and the sea  a low cloud hung before hera great opalescent and tremulous cloud that seemed to rise from the steaming brows of millions of men long drifts of smoky vapours soiled it with livid trails it throbbed to the beat of millions of hearts and from it came an immense and lamentable murmurthe murmur of millions of lips praying cursing sighing jeeringthe undying murmur of folly regret and hope exhaled by the crowds of the anxious earth the narcissus entered the cloud the shadows deepened on all sides there was the clang of iron the sound of mighty blows shrieks yells black barges drifted stealthily on the murky stream a mad jumble of begrimed walls loomed up vaguely in the smoke bewildering and mournful like a vision of disaster the tugs backed and filled in the stream to hold the ship steady at the dockgates from her bows two lines went through the air whistling and struck at the land viciously like a pair of snakes a bridge broke in two before her as if by enchantment big hydraulic capstans began to turn all by themselves as though animated by a mysterious and unholy spell she moved through a narrow lane of water between two low walls of granite and men with checkropes in their hands kept pace with her walking on the broad flagstones a group waited impatiently on each side of the vanished bridge rough heavy men in caps sallowfaced men in high hats two bareheaded women ragged children fascinated and with wide eyes a cart coming at a jerky trot pulled up sharply one of the women screamed at the silent shiphallo jack without looking at any one in particular and all hands looked at her from the forecastle headstand clear stand clear of that rope cried the dockmen bending over stone posts the crowd murmured stamped where they stoodlet go your quarterchecks let go sang out a ruddyfaced old man on the quay the ropes splashed heavily falling in the water and the narcissus entered the dock  the stony shores ran away right and left in straight lines enclosing a sombre and rectangular pool brick walls rose high above the watersoulless walls staring through hundreds of windows as troubled and dull as the eyes of overfed brutes at their base monstrous iron cranes crouched with chains hanging from their long necks balancing cruellooking hooks over the decks of lifeless ships a noise of wheels rolling over stones the thump of heavy things falling the racket of feverish winches the grinding of strained chains floated on the air between high buildings the dust of all the continents soared in short flights and a penetrating smell of perfumes and dirt of spices and hides of things costly and of things filthy pervaded the space made for it an atmosphere precious and disgusting the narcissus came gently into her berth the shadows of soulless walls fell upon her the dust of all the continents leaped upon her deck and a swarm of strange men clambering up her sides took possession of her in the name of the sordid earth she had ceased to live  a toff in a black coat and high hat scrambled with agility came up to the second mate shook hands and saidhallo herbert it was his brother a lady appeared suddenly a real lady in a black dress and with a parasol she looked extremely elegant in the midst of us and as strange as if she had fallen there from the sky mr baker touched his cap to her it was the masters wife and very soon the captain dressed very smartly and in a white shirt went with her over the side we didnt recognise him at all till turning on the quay he called to mr bakerdont forget to wind up the chronometers tomorrow morning an underhand lot of seedylooking chaps with shifty eyes wandered in and out of the forecastle looking for a jobthey saidmore likely for something to steal commented knowles cheerfully poor beggars who cared werent we home but mr baker went for one of them who had given him some cheek and we were delighted everything was delightfulive finished aft sir called out mr creightonno water in the well sir reported for the last time the carpenter soundingrod in hand mr baker glanced along the decks at the expectant group of sailors glanced aloft at the yardsough that will do men he grunted the group broke up the voyage was ended  rolledup beds went flying over the rail lashed chests went sliding down the gangwaymighty few of both at that the rest is having a cruise off the cape explained knowles enigmatically to a dockloafer with whom he had struck a sudden friendship men ran calling to one another hailing utter strangers to lend a hand with the dunnage then with sudden decorum approached the mate to shake hands before going ashoregoodbye sir they repeated in various tones mr baker grasped hard palms grunted in a friendly manner at every one his eyes twinkledtake care of your money knowles ough soon get a nice wife if you do the lame man was delightedgoodbye sir said belfast with emotion wringing the mates hand and looked up with swimming eyes i thought i would take im ashore with me he went on plaintively mr baker did not understand but said kindlytake care of yourself craik and the bereaved belfast went over the rail mourning and alone  mr baker in the sudden peace of the ship moved about solitary and grunting trying doorhandles peering into dark places never donea model chief mate no one waited for him ashore mother dead father and two brothers yarmouth fishermen drowned together on the dogger bank sister married and unfriendly quite a lady married to the leading tailor of a little town and its leading politician who did not think his sailor brotherinlaw quite respectable enough for him quite a lady quite a lady he thought sitting down for a moments rest on the quarterhatch time enough to go ashore and get a bite and sup and a bed somewhere he didnt like to part with a ship no one to think about then the darkness of a misty evening fell cold and damp upon the deserted deck and mr baker sat smoking thinking of all the successive ships to whom through many long years he had given the best of a seamans care and never a command in sight not oncei havent somehow the cut of a skipper about me he meditated placidly while the shipkeeper who had taken possession of the galley a wizened old man with bleared eyes cursed him in whispers for hanging about sonow creighton he pursued the unenvious train of thought quite a gentleman swell friends will get on fine young fellow a little more experience he got up and shook himself ill be back first thing tomorrow morning for the hatches dont you let them touch anything before i come shipkeeper he called out then at last he also went ashorea model chief mate  the men scattered by the dissolving contact of the land came together once more in the shipping officethe narcissus pays off shouted outside a glazed door a brassbound old fellow with a crown and the capitals b t on his cap a lot trooped in at once but many were late the room was large whitewashed and bare a counter surmounted by a brasswire grating fenced off a third of the dusty space and behind the grating a pastyfaced clerk with his hair parted in the middle had the quick glittering eyes and the vivacious jerky movements of a caged bird poor captain allistoun also in there and sitting before a little table with piles of gold and notes on it appeared subdued by his captivity another board of trade bird was perching on a high stool near the door an old bird that did not mind the chaff of elated sailors the crew of the narcissus broken up into knots pushed in the corners they had new shore togs smart jackets that looked as if they had been shaped with an axe glossy trousers that seemed made of crumpled sheetiron collarless flannel shirts shiny new boots they tapped on shoulders buttonholed one another asked where did you sleep last night whispered gaily slapped their thighs with bursts of subdued laughter most had clean radiant faces only one or two turned up dishevelled and sad the twoyoung norwegians looked tidy meek and altogether of a promising material for the kind ladies who patronise the scandinavian home wamibo still in his working clothes dreamed upright and burly in the middle of the room and when archie came in woke up for a smile but the wideawake clerk called out a name and the payingoff business began  one by one they came up to the paytable to get the wages of their glorious and obscure toil they swept the money with care into broad palms rammed it trustfully into trousers pockets or turning their backs on the table reckoned with difficulty in the hollow of their stiff handsmoney right sign the release therethere repeated the clerk impatiently how stupid those sailors are he thought singleton came up venerableand uncertain as to daylight brown drops of tobacco juice hung in his white beard his hands that never hesitated in the great light of the open sea could hardly find the small pile of gold in the profound darkness of the shore cant write said the clerk shocked make a mark then singleton painfully sketched in a heavy cross blotted the page what a disgusting old brute muttered the clerk somebody opened the door for him and the patriarchal seaman passed through unsteadily without as much as a glance at any of us  archie displayed a pocketbook he was chaffed belfast who looked wild as though he had already luffed up through a publichouse or two gave signs of emotion and wanted to speak to the captain privately the master was surprised they spoke through the wires and we could hear the captain sayingive given it up to the board of trade i should ve liked to get something of his mumbled belfast but you cant my man its given up locked and sealed to the marine office expostulated the master and belfast stood back with drooping mouth and troubled eyes in a pause of the business we heard the master and the clerk talking we caught james waitdeceasedfound no papers of any kindno relationsno tracethe office must hold his wages then donkin entered he seemed out of breath was grave full of business he went straight to the desk talked with animation to the clerk who thought him an intelligent man they discussed the account dropping hs against one another as if for a wagervery friendly captain allistoun paid i give you a bad discharge he said quietly donkin raised his voicei dont want your bloomin dischargekeep it im goin ter ave a job ashore he turned to us no more bloomin sea fur me he said aloud all looked at him he had better clothes had an easy air appeared more at home than any of us he stared with assurance enjoying the effect of his declaration yuss i ave friends well off thats moren you got but i am a man yer shipmates for all that whos comin fur a drink  no one moved there was a silence a silence of blank faces and stony looks he waited a moment smiled bitterly and went to the door there he faced round once more you wont you bloomin lot of yrpocrits no what ave i done to yer did i bully yer did i urt yer did i you wont drink no then may ye die of thirst every mothers son of yer not one of yer as the sperrit of a bug yere the scum of the world work and starve  he went out and slammed the door with such violence that the old board of trade bird nearly fell off his perch  hes mad declared archie no no hes drunk insisted belfast lurching about and in a maudlin tone captain allistoun sat smiling thoughtfully at the cleared paytable  outside on tower hill they blinked hesitated clumsily as if blinded by the strange quality of the hazy light as if discomposed by the view of so many men and they who could hear one another in the howl of gales seemed deafened and distracted by the dull roar of the busy earthto the black horse to the black horse cried some let us have a drink together before we part they crossed the road clinging to one another only charley and belfast wandered off alone as i came up i saw a redfaced blowsy woman in a grey shawl and with dusty fluffy hair fall on charleys neck it was his mother she slobbered over himo my boy my boyleggo of me said charley leggo mother i was passing him at the time and over the untidy head of the blubbering woman he gave me a humorous smile and a glance ironic courageous and profound that seemed to put all my knowledge of life to shame i nodded and passed on but heard him say again goodnaturedlyif you leggo of me this minytye shall ave a bob for a drink out of my pay in the next few steps i came upon belfast he caught my arm with tremulous enthusiasmi couldnt go wi em he stammered indicating by a nod our noisy crowd that drifted slowly along the other sidewalk when i think of jimmy poor jim when i think of him i have no heart for drink you were his chum too but i pulled him out didnt i short wool he had yes and i stole the blooming pie he wouldnt go he wouldnt go for nobody he burst into tears i never touched himnevernever he sobbed he went for me like like  a lamb  i disengaged myself gently belfasts crying fits generally ended in a fight with some one and i wasnt anxious to stand the brunt of his inconsolable sorrow moreover two bulky policemen stood near by looking at us with a disapproving and incorruptible gazeso long i said and went on my way  but at the corner i stopped to take my last look at the crew of the narcissus they were swaying irresolute and noisy on the broad flagstones before the mint they were bound for the black horse where men in fur caps with brutal faces and in shirt sleeves dispense out of varnished barrels the illusions of strength mirth happiness the illusion of splendour and poetry of life to the paidoff crews of southerngoing ships from afar i saw them discoursing with jovial eyes and clumsy gestures while the sea of life thundered into their ears ceaseless and unheeded and swaying about there on the white stones surrounded by the hurry and clamour of men they appeared to be creatures of another kindlost alone forgetful and doomed they were like castaways like reckless and joyous castaways like mad castaways making merry in the storm and upon an insecure ledge of a treacherous rock the roar of the town resembled the roar of topping breakers merciless and strong with a loud voice and cruel purpose but overhead the clouds broke a flood of sunshine streamed down the walls of grimy houses the dark knot of seamen drifted in sunshine to the left of them the trees in tower gardens sighed the stones of the tower gleaming seemed to stir in the play of light as if remembering suddenly all the great joys and sorrows of the past the fighting prototypes of these men pressgangs mutinous cries the wailing of women by the riverside and the shouts of men welcoming victories the sunshine of heaven fell like a gift of grace on the mud of the earth on the remembering and mute stones on greed selfishness on the anxious faces of forgetful men and to the right of the dark group the stained front of the mint cleansed by the flood of light stood out for a moment dazzling and white like a marble palace in a fairy tale the crew of the narcissus drifted out of sight  i never saw them again the sea took some the steamers took others the graveyards of the earth will account for the rest singleton has no doubt taken with him the long record of his faithful work into the peaceful depths of an hospitable sea and donkin who never did a decent days work in his life no doubt earns his living by discoursing with filthy eloquence upon the right of labour to live so be it let the earth and the sea each have its own  a gone shipmate like any other man is gone for ever and i never met one of them again but at times the springflood of memory sets with force up the dark river of the nine bends then on the waters of the forlorn stream drifts a shipa shadowy ship manned by a crew of shades they pass and make a sign in a shadowy hail havent we together and upon the immortal sea wrung out a meaning from our sinful lives goodbye brothers you were a good crowd as good a crowd as ever fisted with wild cries the beating canvas of a heavy foresail or tossing aloft invisible in the night gave back yell for yell to a westerly gale  the end
