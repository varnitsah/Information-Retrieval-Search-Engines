of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and where is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversations so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisychain was worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her  there was nothing very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself dear dear i shall be too late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch to take out of it and full of curiosity she hurried across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbithole under the hedge in a moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again  the rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed a deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what would happen next first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves here and there were maps and pictures hung on pegs she took a jar down off one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it  well thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyll all think me at home why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house which was most likely true  down down down would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time she said aloud i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity of showing off her knowledge as there was no one to hear her still it was good practice to say it over yes thats the right distance but then what longitude or latitudeline shall i be in alice had no idea what longitude was or latitude either but she thought they were nice grand words to say  presently she began again i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny itll be to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know please maam is this new zealand or australiaand she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as youre falling through the air do you think you could manage it and what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking no itll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere  down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again dinah will miss me very much tonight i should think dinah was the cat i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at teatime oh dear dinah i wish i had you here there are no mice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know my dear but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy and kept on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes do bats eat cats for as she couldnt answer either question it didnt much matter which way she put it she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and was saying to her very earnestly now dinah my dear tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenly bump bump down she came upon a heap of sticks and shavings and the fall was over  alice was not a bit hurt and jumped on to her feet directly she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and just heard it say as it turned a corner my ears and whiskers how late its getting she turned the corner after it and instantly found herself in a long low hall lit up by a row of lamps which hung from the roof  illustration  there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all round it and tried them all she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of solid glass there was nothing lying upon it but a tiny golden key and alices first idea was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or the key too small but at any rate it would open none of them however on the second time round she came to a low curtain behind which was a door about eighteen inches high she tried the little key in the keyhole and it fitted alice opened the door and looked down a small passage not larger than a rathole into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only knew how to begin for you see so many outoftheway things had happened lately that alice began to think very few things indeed were really impossible  there was nothing else to do so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting up people like telescopes this time there was a little bottle on itwhich certainly was not there before said aliceand tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters  it was all very well to say drink me but ill look first said the wise little alice and see whether the bottles marked poison or not for alice had read several nice little stories about children that got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had given them such as that if you get into the fire it will burn you and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it generally bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later  however this bottle was not marked poison so alice tasted it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey toffy and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off                                       what a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up like a telescope  it was so indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up as it occurred to her that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden first however she waited for a few minutes to see whether she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle and what should i be like then i wonder and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember having ever seen one however nothing more happened so she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for the key she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it plainly enough through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried  illustration  come theres no use in crying said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice and sometimes scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered boxing her own ears for having been unkind to herself in a game of croquet she was playing with herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people but its no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people why theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person  soon her eyes fell on a little ebony box lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which was lying a card with the words eat me beautifully printed on it in large letters ill eat said alice and if it makes me larger i can reach the key and if it makes me smaller i can creep under the door so either way ill get into the garden and i dont care which happens  she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way which way and laid her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this is what generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got into the way of expecting nothing but outofthe way things to happen and it seemed quite dull and stupid for things to go on in the common way  so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake                                       curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so surprised that she quite forgot how to speak good english now im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was goodbye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed almost out of sight they were getting so far off oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears im sure i cant i shall be a great deal too far off to bother myself about you you must manage the best way you canbut i must be kind to them thought alice or perhaps they wont walk the way i want to go let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas  illustration  and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it they must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll seem sending presents to ones own feet and how odd the directions will look alices right foot esq                             the carpet                               with alices love  oh dear what nonsense i am talking  just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now rather more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door  poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and cried again  you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to cry in this way stop this instant i tell you but she cried on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool about four inches deep all round her and reaching half way across the hall after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and dried her eyes to see what was coming it was the white rabbit coming back again splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a nosegay in the other alice was ready to ask help of any one she felt so desperate and as the rabbit passed her she said in a low timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently looked up once into the roof of the hall from which the voice seemed to come and then dropped the nosegay and the white kid gloves and skurried away into the darkness as hard as it could go  illustration  alice took up the nosegay and gloves and found the nosegay so delicious that she kept smelling at it all the time she went on talking to herselfdear dear how queer everything is today and yesterday everything happened just as usual i wonder if i was changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up this morning i think i remember feeling rather different but if im not the same who in the world am i ah thats the great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them  im sure im not gertrude she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at alland im sure i cant be florence for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little besides shes she and im i andoh dear how puzzling it all is ill try if i know all the things i used to know let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is fourteenoh dear i shall never get to twenty at this rate but the multiplication table dont signifylets try geography london is the capital of france and rome is the capital of yorkshire and parisoh dear dear thats all wrong im certain i must have been changed for florence ill try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap and began but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not sound the same as they used to do      how doth the little crocodile       improve its shining tail     and pour the waters of the nile       on every golden scale      how cheerfully it seems to grin       how neatly spreads its claws     and welcomes little fishes in       with gentlysmiling jaws  im sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears as she thought i must be florence after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn no ive made up my mind about it if im florence ill stay down here itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up dear i shall only look up and say who am i then answer me that first and then if i like being that person ill come up if not ill stay down here till im somebody elsebut oh dear cried alice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down i am so tired of being all alone here  as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to find she had put on one of the rabbits little gloves while she was talking how can i have done that thought she i must be growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly soon she found out that the reason of it was the nosegay she held in her hand she dropped it hastily just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether and found that she was now only three inches high  now for the garden cried alice as she hurried back to the little door but the little door was locked again and the little gold key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor little girl for i never was as small as this before never and i declare its too bad it is  illustration  at this moment her foot slipped and splash she was up to her chin in salt water her first idea was that she had fallen into the sea then she remembered that she was under ground and she soon made out that it was the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet high i wish i hadnt cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears well thatll be a queer thing to be sure however every thing is queer today very soon she saw something splashing about in the pool near her at first she thought it must be a walrus or a hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was herself and soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself  would it be any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse the rabbit is something quite outoftheway no doubt and so have i been ever since i came down here but that is no reason why the mouse should not be able to talk i think i may as well try  so she began oh mouse do you know how to get out of this pool i am very tired of swimming about here oh mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing  illustration  perhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice i daresay its a french mouse come over with william the conqueror for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened so she began again où est ma chatte which was the first sentence out of her french lessonbook the mouse gave a sudden jump in the pool and seemed to quiver with fright oh i beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings i quite forgot you didnt like cats  not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice would you like cats if you were me  well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone dont be angry about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her she is such a dear quiet thing said alice half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and shes such a capital one for catching miceoh i beg your pardon cried poor alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain that it was really offended have i offended you  offended indeed cried the mouse who seemed to be positively trembling with rage our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things dont talk to me about them any more  i wont indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the conversation are youare youfond ofdogs the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you a little brighteyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair and itll fetch things when you throw them and itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsi cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer and he says it kills all the rats andoh dear said alice sadly im afraid ive offended it again for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went  so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we wont talk about cats and dogs any more if you dont like them when the mouse heard this it turned and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a trembling low voice lets get to the shore and then ill tell you my history and youll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs  it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite full of birds and animals that had fallen into it there was a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore  illustration     chapter ii  illustration   they were indeed a curious looking party that assembled on the bankthe birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to themall dripping wet cross and uncomfortable the first question of course was how to get dry they had a consultation about this and alice hardly felt at all surprised at finding herself talking familiarly with the birds as if she had known them all her life indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than you and must know best and this alice would not admit without knowing how old the lory was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was nothing more to be said  at last the mouse who seemed to have some authority among them called out sit down all of you and attend to me ill soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once shivering in a large ring alice in the middle with her eyes anxiously fixed on the mouse for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon  ahem said the mouse with a selfimportant air are you all ready this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please  william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria  ugh said the lory with a shiver  i beg your pardon said the mouse frowning but very politely did you speak  not i said the lory hastily  i thought you did said the mouse i proceed edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown williams conduct was at first moderatehow are you getting on now dear said the mouse turning to alice as it spoke  as wet as ever said poor alice it doesnt seem to dry me at all  in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to his feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies  speak english said the duck i dont know the meaning of half those long words and whats more i dont believe you do either and the duck quacked a comfortable laugh to itself some of the other birds tittered audibly  i only meant to say said the dodo in a rather offended tone that i know of a house near here where we could get the young lady and the rest of the party dried and then we could listen comfortably to the story which i think you were good enough to promise to tell us bowing gravely to the mouse  the mouse made no objection to this and the whole party moved along the river bank for the pool had by this time began to flow out of the hall and the edge of it was fringed with rushes and forgetmenots in a slow procession the dodo leading the way after a time the dodo became impatient and leaving the duck to bring up the rest of the party moved on at a quicker pace with alice the lory and the eaglet and soon brought them to a little cottage and there they sat snugly by the fire wrapped up in blankets until the rest of the party had arrived and they were all dry again  then they all sat down again in a large ring on the bank and begged the mouse to begin his story  mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and sighing  it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouses tail which was coiled nearly all round the party but why do you call it sad and she went on puzzling about this as the mouse went on speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this  we lived beneath the mat        warm and snug and fat               but one woe  that                        was the cat                            to our joys                             a clog in                            our eyes a                        fog on our                   hearts a log                was the dog               when the        cats away      then    the mice    will      play        but alas          one day so they say               came the dog and                         cat hunting                                 for a                                   rat                              crushed                           the mice                       all flat                       each                      one                      as                      he                      sat                        u                         n                          d                           e                            r

u n s         t a f     t h i n k o f t h a t  you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely what are you thinking of  i beg your pardon said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think  i had not cried the mouse sharply and very angrily  a knot said alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her oh do let me help to undo it  i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up and walking away from the party you insult me by talking such nonsense  i didnt mean it pleaded poor alice but youre so easily offended you know  the mouse only growled in reply  please come back and finish your story alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook its ears and walked quickly away and was soon out of sight  what a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the lory and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to its daughter ah my dear let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper hold your tongue ma said the young crab a little snappishly youre enough to try the patience of an oyster  i wish i had our dinah here i know i do said alice aloud addressing no one in particular shed soon fetch it back  and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question said the lory  illustration  alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet dinahs our cat and shes such a capital one for catching mice you cant think and oh i wish you could see her after the birds why shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it  this answer caused a remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be getting home the night air does not suit my throat and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away from her my dears shes no fit company for you on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone  illustration  she sat for some while sorrowful and silent but she was not long before she recovered her spirits and began talking to herself again as usual i do wish some of them had stayed a little longer and i was getting to be such friends with themreally the lory and i were almost like sisters and so was that dear little eaglet and then the duck and the dodo how nicely the duck sang to us as we came along through the water and if the dodo hadnt known the way to that nice little cottage i dont know when we should have got dry again and there is no knowing how long she might have prattled on in this way if she had not suddenly caught the sound of pattering feet  it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about it as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the marchioness the marchioness oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers shell have me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the nosegay and the pair of white kid gloves and she began hunting for them but they were now nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and her walk along the riverbank with its fringe of rushes and forgetmenots and the glass table and the little door had vanished  soon the rabbit noticed alice as she stood looking curiously about her and at once said in a quick angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here go home this moment and look on my dressingtable for my gloves and nosegay and fetch them here as quick as you can run do you hear and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once without saying a word in the direction which the rabbit had pointed out  she soon found herself in front of a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit esq she went in and hurried upstairs for fear she should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the gloves she knew that one pair had been lost in the hall but of course thought alice it has plenty more of them in its house how queer it seems to be going messages for a rabbit i suppose dinahll be sending me messages next and she began fancying the sort of things that would happen miss alice come here directly and get ready for your walk coming in a minute nurse but ive got to watch this mousehole till dinah comes back and see that the mouse doesnt get out only i dont think alice went on that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that  illustration  by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window on which was a lookingglass and as alice had hoped two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up a pair of gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the lookingglass there was no label on it this time with the words drink me but nonetheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips i know something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so ill see what this bottle does i do hope itll make me grow larger for im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing  illustration  it did so indeed and much sooner than she expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and she stooped to save her neck from being broken and hastily put down the bottle saying to herself thats quite enoughi hope i shant grow any morei wish i hadnt drunk so much  illustration  alas it was too late she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down in another minute there was not room even for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no morewhat will become of me  luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbitsi almost wish i hadnt gone down that rabbithole and yet and yetits rather curious you know this sort of life i do wonder what can have happened to me when i used to read fairytales i fancied that sort of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of one there out to be a book written about me that there ought and when i grow up ill write onebut im grown up now said she in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more here  illustration  but then thought alice shall i never get any older than i am now thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old womanbut thenalways to have lessons to learn oh i shouldnt like that  oh you foolish alice she said again how can you learn lessons in here why theres hardly room for you and no room at all for any lessonbooks  and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside which made her stop to listen  mary ann mary ann said the voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it presently the rabbit came to the door and tried to open it but as it opened inwards and alices elbow was against it the attempt proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then ill go round and get in at the window  that you wont thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of breaking glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something of the sort  illustration  next came an angry voicethe rabbitspat pat where are you and then a voice she had never heard before shure then im here digging for apples anyway yer honour  digging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily here come and help me out of thissound of more breaking glass  now tell me pat what is that coming out of the window  shure its an arm yer honour he pronounced it arrum  an arm you goose who ever saw an arm that size why it fills the whole window dont you see  shure it does yer honour but its an arm for all that  well its no business there go and take it away  there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as shure i dont like it yer honour at all at all do as i tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and more breaking glasswhat a number of cucumberframes there must be thought alice i wonder what theyll do next as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could im sure i dont want to stop in here any longer  she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words wheres the other ladderwhy i hadnt to bring but one bills got the otherhere put em up at this cornerno tie em together firstthey dont reach high enough yetoh theyll do well enough dont be particularhere bill catch hold of this ropewill the roof bearmind that loose slateoh its coming down heads below a loud crash now who did thatit was bill i fancywhos to go down the chimneynay i shant you do itthat i wont thenbills got to go downhere bill the master says youve to go down the chimney  oh so bills got to come down the chimney has he said alice to herself why they seem to put everything upon bill i wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal the fireplace is a pretty tight one but i think i can kick a little  she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess what sort it was scratching and scrambling in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited again to see what would happen next  illustration  the first thing was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbits voice alone catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices how was it old fellow what happened to you tell us all about it  last came a little feeble squeaking voice thats bill thought alice which said well i hardly knowim all of a fluster myselfsomething comes at me like a jackinthebox and the next minute up i goes like a rocket and so you did old fellow said the other voices  we must burn the house down said the voice of the rabbit and alice called out as loud as she could if you do ill set dinah at you this caused silence again and while alice was thinking but how can i get dinah here she found to her great delight that she was getting smaller very soon she was able to get up out of the uncomfortable position in which she had been lying and in two or three minutes more she was once more three inches high  she ran out of the house as quick as she could and found quite a crowd of little animals waiting outsideguineapigs white mice squirrels and bill a little green lizard that was being supported in the arms of one of the guineapigs while another was giving it something out of a bottle they all made a rush at her the moment she appeared but alice ran her hardest and soon found herself in a thick wood  illustration     chapter iii  illustration   the first thing ive got to do said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i think that will be the best plan  it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering anxiously among the trees round her a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry  an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to reach her poor thing said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly alarmed all the while at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would probably devour her in spite of all her coaxing hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once and with a yelp of delight rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared at the other side the puppy made another dart at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy begin a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut  this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape she set off at once and ran till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance and till she was quite tired and out of breath  and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with her hat i should have liked teaching it tricks ifif id only been the right size to do it oh id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again let me see how is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what  the great question certainly was what alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat under the circumstances there was a large mushroom near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her to look and see what was on the top of it  she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar which was sitting with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the least notice of her or of anything else  illustration  for some time they looked at each other in silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and languidly addressed her  who are you said the caterpillar  this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation alice replied rather shyly ii hardly know sir just at presentat least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since that  what do you mean by that said the caterpillar explain yourself  i cant explain myself im afraid sir said alice because im not myself you see  i dont see said the caterpillar  im afraid i cant put it more clearly alice replied very politely for i cant understand it myself and really to be so many different sizes in one day is very confusing  it isnt said the caterpillar  well perhaps you havent found it so yet said alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you know and then after that into a butterfly i should think itll feel a little queer dont you think so  not a bit said the caterpillar  all i know is said alice it would feel queer to me  you said the caterpillar contemptuously who are you  which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first  why said the caterpillar  here was another puzzling question and as alice had no reason ready and the caterpillar seemed to be in a very bad temper she turned round and walked away  come back the caterpillar called after her ive something important to say  this sounded promising alice turned and came back again  keep your temper said the caterpillar  is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could  no said the caterpillar  alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all the caterpillar might tell her something worth hearing for some minutes it puffed away at its hookah without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think youre changed do you  yes sir said alice i cant remember the things i used to knowive tried to say how doth the little busy bee and it came all different  try and repeat you are old father william said the caterpillar  alice folded her hands and began  illustration  1      you are old father william the young man said         and your hair is exceedingly white     and yet you incessantly stand on your head         do you think at your age it is right  2      in my youth father william replied to his son         i feared it might injure the brain     but now that im perfectly sure i have none         why i do it again and again  illustration  3      you are old said the youth as i mentioned before         and have grown most uncommonly fat     yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door         pray what is the reason of that  4      in my youth said the sage as he shook his gray locks         i kept all my limbs very supple     by the use of this ointment five shillings the box         allow me to sell you a couple  illustration  5      you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak         for anything tougher than suet     yet you eat all the goose with the bones and the beak         pray how did you manage to do it  6      in my youth said the old man i took to the law         and argued each case with my wife     and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw         has lasted the rest of my life  illustration  7      you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose         that your eye was as steady as ever     yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose         what made you so awfully clever  8      i have answered three questions and that is enough         said his father dont give yourself airs     do you think i can listen all day to such stuff         be off or ill kick you down stairs  that is not said right said the caterpillar  not quite right im afraid said alice timidly some of the words have got altered  it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes the caterpillar was the first to speak  what size do you want to be it asked  oh im not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one doesnt like changing so often you know  are you content now said the caterpillar  well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldnt mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to be  it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar loudly and angrily rearing itself straight up as it spoke it was exactly three inches high  but im not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone and she thought to herself i wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offended  youll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again  this time alice waited quietly until it chose to speak again in a few minutes the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and got down off the mushroom and crawled away into the grass merely remarking as it went the top will make you grow taller and the stalk will make you grow shorter  the top of what the stalk of what thought alice  of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment was out of sight  alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute and then picked it and carefully broke it in two taking the stalk in one hand and the top in the other  illustration  which does the stalk do she said and nibbled a little bit of it to try the next moment she felt a violent blow on her chin it had struck her foot  she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but as she did not shrink any further and had not dropped the top of the mushroom she did not give up hope yet there was hardly room to open her mouth with her chin pressing against her foot but she did it at last and managed to bite off a little bit of the top of the mushroom                                       come my heads free at last said alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be seen she looked down upon an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her  illustration  what can all that green stuff be said alice and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i cant see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little rustling among the leaves then she tried to bring her head down to her hands and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in every direction like a serpent she had just succeeded in bending it down in a beautiful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be the tops of the trees of the wood she had been wandering in when a sharp hiss made her draw back a large pigeon had flown into her face and was violently beating her with its wings  illustration  serpent screamed the pigeon  im not a serpent said alice indignantly let me alone  ive tried every way the pigeon said desperately with a kind of sob nothing seems to suit em  i havent the least idea what you mean said alice  ive tried the roots of trees and ive tried banks and ive tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but them serpents theres no pleasing em  alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything till the pigeon had finished  as if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon without being on the look out for serpents day and night why i havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks  im very sorry youve been annoyed said alice beginning to see its meaning  and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood said the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and was just thinking i was free of em at last they must needs come down from the sky ugh serpent  but im not a serpent said alice im aim a  well what are you said the pigeon i see youre trying to invent something  iim a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through  a likely story indeed said the pigeon ive seen a good many of them in my time but never one with such a neck as yours no youre a serpent i know that well enough i suppose youll tell me next that you never tasted an egg  i have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a very truthful child but indeed i dont want any of yours i dont like them raw  well be off then said the pigeon and settled down into its nest again alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could as her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and several times she had to stop and untwist it soon she remembered the pieces of mushroom which she still held in her hands and set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual size  it was so long since she had been of the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got quite used to it in a minute or two and began talking to herself as usual well theres half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes are im never sure what im going to be from one minute to another however ive got to my right size again the next thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow is that to be done i wonder  just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a doorway leading right into it thats very curious she thought but everythings curious today i may as well go in and in she went  once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table now ill manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden then she set to work eating the pieces of mushroom till she was about fifteen inches high then she walked down the little passage and thenshe found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains  illustration     chapter iv  illustration   a large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red this alice thought a very curious thing and she went near to watch them and just as she came up she heard one of them say look out five dont go splashing paint over me like that  i couldnt help it said five in a sulky tone seven jogged my elbow  on which seven lifted up his head and said thats right five always lay the blame on others  youd better not talk said five i heard the queen say only yesterday she thought of having you beheaded  what for said the one who had spoken first  thats not your business two said seven  yes it is his business said five and ill tell him it was for bringing in tuliproots to the cook instead of potatoes  seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust things when his eye fell upon alice and he stopped suddenly the others looked round and all of them took off their hats and bowed low  would you tell me please said alice timidly why you are painting those roses  five and seven looked at two but said nothing two began in a low voice why miss the fact is this ought to have been a red rose tree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off so you see were doing our best before she comes to at this moment five who had been looking anxiously across the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queen  first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners flat and oblong with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were all ornamented with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did after these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts next came the guests mostly kings and queens among whom alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her then followed the knave of hearts carrying the kings crown on a cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts  illustration  when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply  idiot said the queen turning up her nose and asked alice whats your name  my name is alice so please your majesty said alice boldly for she thought to herself why theyre only a pack of cards i neednt be afraid of them  who are these said the queen pointing to the three gardeners lying round the rose tree for as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children  how should i know said alice surprised at her own courage its no business of mine  the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a minute began in a voice of thunder off with her  nonsense said alice very loudly and decidedly and the queen was silent  the king laid his hand upon her arm and said timidly remember my dear she is only a child  the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over  the knave did so very carefully with one foot  get up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else  leave off that screamed the queen you make me giddy and then turning to the rose tree she went on what have you been doing here  may it please your majesty said two very humbly going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying  i see said the queen who had meantime been examining the roses off with their heads and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the three unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection  you shant be beheaded said alice and she put them into her pocket the three soldiers marched once round her looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others  are their heads off shouted the queen  their heads are gone the soldiers shouted in reply if it please your majesty  thats right shouted the queen can you play croquet  the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her  yes shouted alice at the top of her voice  come on then roared the queen and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next  itsits a very fine day said a timid little voice she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face  very said alice wheres the marchioness  hush hush said the rabbit in a low voice shell hear you the queens the marchioness didnt you know that  no i didnt said alice what of  queen of hearts said the rabbit in a whisper putting its mouth close to her ear and marchioness of mock turtles  what are they said alice but there was no time for the answer for they had reached the croquetground and the game began instantly  alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in all her life it was all in ridges and furrows the croquetballs were live hedgehogs the mallets live ostriches and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their feet and hands to make the arches  illustration  illustration  the chief difficulty which alice found at first was to manage her ostrich she got its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck straightened out nicely and was going to give a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up into her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or a furrow in her way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed  the players all played at once without waiting for turns and quarrelled all the while at the tops of their voices and in a very few minutes the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head of off with her head about once in a minute all those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution  then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle  no said alice i dont even know what a mock turtle is  come on then said the queen and it shall tell you its history  as they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you are all pardoned  come thats a good thing thought alice who had felt quite grieved at the number of executions which the queen had ordered  illustration  they very soon came upon a gryphon which lay fast asleep in the sun if you dont know what a gryphon is look at the picture up lazy thing said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear its history i must go back and see after some executions i ordered and she walked off leaving alice with the gryphon alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it quite as safe to stay as to go after that savage queen so she waited  the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled what fun said the gryphon half to itself half to alice  what is the fun said alice  why she said the gryphon its all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know come on  everybody says come on here thought alice as she walked slowly after the gryphon i never was ordered about so before in all my lifenever  they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could here it sighing as if its heart would break she pitied it deeply what is its sorrow she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before its all its fancy that it hasnt got no sorrow you know come on  illustration  so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing  this here young lady said the gryphon wants for to know your history she do  ill tell it said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone sit down and dont speak till ive finished  so they sat down and no one spoke for some minutes alice thought to herself i dont see how it can ever finish if it doesnt begin but she waited patiently  once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a real turtle  these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing  when we were little the mock turtle went on more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea the master was an old turtlewe used to call him tortoise  why did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one asked alice  we called him tortoise because he taught us said the mock turtle angrily really you are very dull  you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle get on old fellow dont be all day and the mock turtle went on in these words  you may not have lived much under the sea i havent said alice and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster alice began to say i once tasted but hastily checked herself and said no never instead so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is  no indeed said alice what sort of a thing is it  why said the gryphon you form into a line along the sea shore  two lines cried the mock turtle seals turtles salmon and so onadvance twice  each with a lobster as partner cried the gryphon  illustration  of course the mock turtle said advance twice set to partners  change lobsters and retire in same order interrupted the gryphon  then you know continued the mock turtle you throw the  the lobsters shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air  as far out to sea as you can  swim after them screamed the gryphon  turn a somersault in the sea cried the mock turtle capering wildly about  change lobsters again yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice and then  thats all said the mock turtle suddenly dropping its voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice  it must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly  would you like to see a little of it said the mock turtle  very much indeed said alice  come lets try the first figure said the mock turtle to the gryphon we can do it without lobsters you know which shall sing  oh you sing said the gryphon ive forgotten the words  illustration  so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her toes when they came too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang slowly and sadly these words      beneath the waters of the sea     are lobsters thick as thick can be     they love to dance with you and me       my own my gentle salmon  the gryphon joined in singing the chorus which was      salmon come up salmon go down     salmon come twist your tail around     of all the fishes of the sea       theres none so good as salmon  thank you said alice feeling very glad that the figure was over  shall we try the second figure said the gryphon or would you prefer a song  oh a song please alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm no accounting for tastes sing her mock turtle soup will you old fellow  the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this      beautiful soup so rich and green     waiting in a hot tureen     who for such dainties would not stoop     soup of the evening beautiful soup     soup of the evening beautiful soup         beauootiful soooop         beauootiful soooop     soooop of the eeevening         beautiful beautiful soup  chorus again cried the gryphon and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trials beginning was heard in the distance  come on cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand he hurried off without waiting for the end of the song  what trial is it panted alice as she ran but the gryphon only answered come on and ran the faster and more and more faintly came borne on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words      soooop of the eeevening     beautiful beautiful soup  the king and queen were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled around them the knave was in custody and before the king stood the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other  herald read the accusation said the king  on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows  illustration      the queen of hearts she made some tarts       all on a summer day     the knave of hearts he stole those tarts       and took them quite away  illustration  now for the evidence said the king and then the sentence  no said the queen first the sentence and then the evidence  nonsense cried alice so loudly that everybody jumped the idea of having the sentence first  hold your tongue said the queen  i wont said alice youre nothing but a pack of cards who cares for you  at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream of fright and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some leaves that had fluttered down from the trees on to her face  wake up alice dear said her sister what a nice long sleep youve had  oh ive had such a curious dream said alice and she told her sister all her adventures under ground as you have read them and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea its getting late  so alice ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been                                       but her sister sat there some while longer watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and her adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream  she saw an ancient city and a quiet river winding near it along the plain and up the stream went slowly gliding a boat with a merry party of children on boardshe could hear their voices and laughter like music over the waterand among them was another little alice who sat listening with bright eager eyes to a tale that was being told and she listened for the words of the tale and lo it was the dream of her own little sister so the boat wound slowly along beneath the bright summerday with its merry crew and its music of voices and laughter till it passed round one of the many turnings of the stream and she saw it no more  then she thought in a dream within the dream as it were how this same little alice would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather around her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a wonderful tale perhaps even with these very adventures of the little alice of longago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days  illustration  happy summer days   the end                                          postscript   the profits if any of this book will be given to childrens hospitals and convalescent homes for sick children and the accounts down to june 30 in each year will be published in the st jamess gazette on the second tuesday of the following december  ppsthe thought so prettily expressed by the little boy is also to be found in longfellows hiawatha where he appeals to those who believe      that the feeble hands and helpless     groping blindly in the darkness     touch gods right hand in that darkness     and are lifted up and strengthened                                          who will riddle me the how and the why   so questions one of englands sweetest singers the how has already been told after a fashion in the verses prefixed to alice in wonderland and some other memories of that happy summer day are set down for those who care to see them in this little bookthe germ that was to grow into the published volume but the why cannot and need not be put into words those for whom a childs mind is a sealed book and who see no divinity in a childs smile would read such words in vain while for any one that has ever loved one true child no words are needed for he will have known the awe that falls on one in the presence of a spirit fresh from gods hands on whom no shadow of sin and but the outermost fringe of the shadow of sorrow has yet fallen he will have felt the bitter contrast between the haunting selfishness that spoils his best deeds and the life that is but an overflowing lovefor i think a childs first attitude to the world is a simple love for all living things and he will have learned that the best work a man can do is when he works for loves sake only with no thought of name or gain or earthly reward no deed of ours i suppose on this side the grave is really unselfish yet if one can put forth all ones powers in a task where nothing of reward is hoped for but a little childs whispered thanks and the airy touch of a little childs pure lips one seems to come somewhere near to this  there was no idea of publication in my mind when i wrote this little book that was wholly an afterthought pressed on me by the perhaps too partial friends who always have to bear the blame when a writer rushes into print and i can truly say that no praise of theirs has ever given me one hundredth part of the pleasure it has been to think of the sick children in hospitals where it has been a delight to me to send copies forgetting for a few bright hours their pain and wearinessperhaps thinking lovingly of the unknown writer of the taleperhaps even putting up a childish prayer and oh how much it needs for one who can but dimly hope to stand some day not quite out of sight of those pure young faces before the great white throne i am very sure writes a ladyvisitor at a home for sick children that there will be many loving earnest prayers for you on easter morning from the children  i would like to quote further from her letters as embodying a suggestion that may perhaps thus come to the notice of some one able and willing to carry it out  i want you to send me one of your easter greetings for a very dear child who is dying at our home she is just fading away and alice has brightened some of the weary hours in her illness and i know that letter would be such a delight to herespecially if you would put minnie at the top and she could know you had sent it for her she knows you and would so value it she suffers so much that i long for what i know would so please her  thank you very much for sending me the letter and for writing minnies name i am quite sure that all these children will say a loving prayer for the aliceman on easter day and i am sure the letter will help the little ones to the real easter joy how i do wish that you who have won the hearts and confidence of so many children would do for them what is so very near my heart and yet what no one will do viz write a book for children about god and themselves which is not goody and which begins at the right end about religion to make them see what it really is i get quite miserable very often over the children i come across hardly any of them have an idea of really knowing that god loves them or of loving and confiding in him they will love and trust me and be sure that i want them to be happy and will not let them suffer more than is necessary but as for going to him in the same way they would never think of it they are dreadfully afraid of him if they think of him at all which they generally only do when they have been naughty and they look on all connected with him as very grave and dull and when they are full of fun and thoroughly happy i am sure they unconsciously hope he is not looking i am sure i dont wonder they think of him in this way for people never talk of him in connection with what makes their little lives the brightest if they are naughty people put on solemn faces and say he is very angry or shocked or something which frightens them and for the rest he is talked about only in a way that makes them think of church and having to be quiet as for being taught that all joy and all gladness and brightness is his joythat he is wearying for them to be happy and is not hard and stern but always doing things to make their days brighter and caring for them so tenderly and wanting them to run to him with all their little joys and sorrows they are not taught that i do so long to make them trust him as they trust us to feel that he will take their part as they do with us in their little woes and to go to him in their plays and enjoyments and not only when they say their prayers i was quite grateful to one little dot a short time ago who said to his mother when i am in bed i put out my hand to see if i can feel jesus and my angel i thought perhaps in the dark theyd touch me but they never have yet i do so want them to want to go to him and to feel how if he is there it must be happy  let me addfor i feel i have drifted into far too serious a vein for a preface to a fairytalethe deliciously naïve remark of a very dear childfriend whom i asked after an acquaintance of two or three days if she had read alice and the lookingglass oh yes she replied readily ive read both of them and i think this more slowly and thoughtfully i think through the lookingglass is more stupid than alices adventures dont you think so but this was a question i felt it would be hardly discreet for me to enter upon  lewis carroll  dec 1886                                          an easter greeting  to  every child who loves  alice   dear child  please to fancy if you can that you are reading a real letter from a real friend whom you have seen and whose voice you can seem to yourself to hear wishing you as i do now with all my heart a happy easter  do you know that delicious dreamy feeling when one first wakes on a summer morning with the twitter of birds in the air and the fresh breeze coming in at the open windowwhen lying lazily with eyes half shut one sees as in a dream green boughs waving or waters rippling in a golden light it is a pleasure very near to sadness bringing tears to ones eyes like a beautiful picture or poem and is not that a mothers gentle hand that undraws your curtains and a mothers sweet voice that summons you to rise to rise and forget in the bright sunlight the ugly dreams that frightened you so when all was darkto rise and enjoy another happy day first kneeling to thank that unseen friend who sends you the beautiful sun  are these strange words from a writer of such tales as alice and is this a strange letter to find in a book of nonsense it may be so some perhaps may blame me for thus mixing together things grave and gay others may smile and think it odd that any one should speak of solemn things at all except in church and on a sunday but i thinknay i am surethat some children will read this gently and lovingly and in the spirit in which i have written it  for i do not believe god means us thus to divide life into two halvesto wear a grave face on sunday and to think it outofplace to even so much as mention him on a weekday do you think he cares to see only kneeling figures and to hear only tones of prayerand that he does not also love to see the lambs leaping in the sunlight and to hear the merry voices of the children as they roll among the hay surely their innocent laughter is as sweet in his ears as the grandest anthem that ever rolled up from the dim religious light of some solemn cathedral  and if i have written anything to add to those stores of innocent and healthy amusement that are laid up in books for the children i love so well it is surely something i may hope to look back upon without shame and sorrow as how much of life must then be recalled when my turn comes to walk through the valley of shadows  this easter sun will rise on you dear child feeling your life in every limb and eager to rush out into the fresh morning airand many an easterday will come and go before it finds you feeble and grayheaded creeping wearily out to bask once more in the sunlightbut it is good even now to think sometimes of that great morning when the sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings  surely your gladness need not be the less for the thought that you will one day see a brighter dawn than thiswhen lovelier sights will meet your eyes than any waving trees or rippling waterswhen angelhands shall undraw your curtains and sweeter tones than ever loving mother breathed shall wake you to a new and glorious dayand when all the sadness and the sin that darkened life on this little earth shall be forgotten like the dreams of a night that is past  your affectionate friend  lewis carroll  easter 1876                                          christmas greetings
