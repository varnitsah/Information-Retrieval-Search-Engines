applied it to his pipe and sat smoking thoughtfully  the young fellow is pretending that his arm is at the back of her by accident he continued and shes pretending not to know that its there  when hes allowed to put it round er waist whenever he wishes he wont want to do it  shes artful enough to know that and thats why they are all so standoffish until the thing is settled  shell move forward arf an inch presently and arf a minute arterwards shell lean back agin without thinking  shes a nicelooking gal and what she can see in a tailors dummy like that i cant think  he leaned back on his box and folding his arms emitted a cloud of smoke  human naturs a funny thing  ive seen a lot of it in my time and if i was to ave my life all over agin i expect i should be just as silly as them two in

eye it was too when he appened to be out o temper  id often took a bit o notice o the gal just giving er a kind smile now and then as she sat on deck and sometimeswhen er father wasnt lookingshed smile back  once when e was down below she laughed right out  she was afraid of im and by and by i noticed that she darent even get off the ship and walk up and down the wharf without asking im  when she went out e was with er and from one or two nasty little snacks i appened to overhear when the skipper thought i was too far away i began to see that something was up  it all came out one evening and it only came out because the skipper wanted my help  i was standing leaning on my broom to get my breath back arter a bit o sweeping when he came up to me and i knew at once by the nice way e spoke that he wanted me to do something for im  come and ave a pint bill he ses  i put my broom agin the wall and we walked round to the bulls head like a couple o brothers  we ad two pints apiece and

dont know im out and winnie thinks im just going out for arf an hour so itll be all right so long  i watched im up the road and i must say i began to wish i adnt taken the job on  arter all i ad ony had two pints and a bit o flattery and i knew wot ud appen if anything went wrong  built like a bull he was and fond o using his strength  i locked the wicket careful and putting the key in my pocket began to walk up and down the wharf  for about ten minutes the gal went on reading and didnt look up once then as i passed she gave me a nice smile and shook er little fist at the cook wot ad got is back towards er  i smiled back o course and by and by she put her book down and climbed on to the side o the ship and held out her and for me to elp her ashore  im so tired of the ship she ses in a soft voice its like a prison  dont you get tired of the wharf  sometimes i ses but its my dooty  yes she ses  yes of course  but youre a big strong man and you can put up with things better  she gave a little sigh and we walked up and down for a time without saying anything  and its all fathers foolishness she ses at last thats wot makes it so tiresome  i cant help a pack of silly young men writing to me can i  no i spose not i ses  thank you she ses putting er little and on my arm  i knew that you were sensible  ive often watched you when ive been sitting alone on the schooner longing for somebody to speak to  and im a good judge of character  i can read you like a book  she turned and looked up at me  beautiful blue eyes shed got with long curling lashes and teeth like pearls  father is so silly she ses shaking her ead and looking down and its so unreasonable because as a matter of fact i dont like young men  oh i beg your pardon i didnt mean that  i didnt mean to be rude  rude i ses staring at her  of course it was a rude thing for me to say she ses smiling because you are still a young man yourself  i shook my ead  youngish i ses  young she ses stamping er little foot  she gave me another look and this time er blue eyes seemed large and solemn  she walked along like one in a dream and twice she tripped over the planks and would ave fallen if i hadnt caught er round the waist  thank you she ses  im very clumsy  how strong your arm is  we walked up and down agin and every time we went near the edge of the jetty she eld on to my arm for fear of stumbling agin  and there was that silly cook standing about on the schooner on tiptoe and twisting his silly old neck till i wonder it didnt twist off  wot a beautiful evening it is she ses at last in a low voice  i ope father isnt coming back early  do you know wot time he is coming home  about twelve i ses but dont tell im i told you so  o course not she ses squeezing my arm  poor father i hope he is enjoying himself as much as i am  we walked down to the jetty agin arter that and sat side by side looking acrost the river  and she began to talk about life and wot a strange thing it was and ow the river would go on flowing down to the sea thousands and thousands o years arter we was both dead and forgotten  if it hadnt ha been for her little ead leaning agin my shoulder i should have ad the creeps  lets go down into the cabin she ses at last with a little shiver it makes me melancholy sitting here and thinking of the mighthave beens  i got up first and elped her up and arter both staring hard at the cook wot didnt seem to know is place we went down into the cabin it was a comfortable little place and arter she ad poured me out a glass of er fathers whisky and filled my pipe for me i wouldnt ha changed places with a king  even when the pipe wouldnt draw i didnt mind  may i write a letter she ses at last  sartainly i ses  she got out her pen and ink and paper and wrote  i shant be long she ses looking up and nibbling er pen  its a letter to my dressmaker she promised my dress by six oclock this afternoon and i am just writing to tell her that if i dont have it by ten in the morning she can keep it  quite right i ses its the ony way to get things done  its my way she ses sticking the letter in an envelope and licking it down  nice name isnt it  she passed it over to me and i read the name and address miss minnie miller 17 john street mile end road  thatll wake her up she ses smiling  will you ask joe to take it for me  hehes on guard i ses smiling back at er and shaking my ead  i know she ses in a low voice  but i dont want any guardonly you  i dont like guards that peep down skylights  i looked up just in time to see joes ead disappear  then i nipped up and arter i ad told im part of wot i thought about im i gave im the letter and told im to sheer off  the skipper told me to stay ere he ses looking obstinate  you do as youre told i ses  im in charge and i take full responsibility  i shall lock the gate arter you  wot are you worrying about  and heres a shilling joe for a bus fare ses the gal smiling you can keep the change  joe took off is cap and scratched is

long as you dont tell the skipper i dont mind  if anything appens youll catch it too bill  he climbed ashore and i follered im to the gate and unlocked it  he was screwing up is eye ready for a wink but i give im such a look that he thought better of it and arter rubbing his eye with is finger as though he ad got a bit o dust in it he went off  i locked the gate and went back to the cabin and for some time we sat talking about fathers and the foolish ideas they got into their eads and things o that sort  so far as i remember i ad two more goes o whisky and one o the skippers cigars and i was just thinking wot a beautiful thing it was to be alive and ealthy and in good spirits talking to a nice gal that understood wot you said amost afore you said it when i eard three blows on a whistle  wots that i ses starting up  police whistle  i dont think so ses miss butt putting her and on my shoulder sit down and stay where you are  i dont want you to get hurt if it is  let somebody i dont like go  i sat down agin and listened but there was no more whistling  boy in the street i expect ses the gal going into the stateroom oh ive got something to show you  wait a minute  i eard her moving about and then she comes back into the cabin  i cant find the key of my box she ses and its in there  i wonder whether youve got a key that would open it  its a padlock  i put my and in my pocket and pulled out my keys  shall i come and try i ses  no thank you she ses taking the keys  this looks about the size what key is it  its the key of the gate i ses but i dont suppose itll fit  she went back into the stateroom agin and i eard her fumbling at a lock  then she came back into the cabin breathing rather hard and stood thinking  ive just remembered she ses pinching her chin  yes  she stepped to the door and went up the companionladder and the next moment i eard a sliding noise and a key turn in a lock  i jumped to the foot of the ladder and ardly able to believe my senses saw that the hatch was closed  when i found that it was locked too you might ha knocked me down with a feather  i went down to the cabin agin and standing on the locker pushed the skylight up with my ead and tried to lookout  i couldnt see the gate but i eard voices and footsteps and a little while arterwards i see that gal coming along the wharf arm in arm with the young man she ad told me she didnt like and dancing for joy  they climbed on to the schooner and then they both stooped down with their hands on their knees and looked at me  wot is it ses the young man grinning  its a watchman ses the gal  its here to take charge of the wharf you know and see that nobody comes on  we ought to ha brought some buns for it ses the young man look at it opening its mouth  they both laughed fit to kill themselves but i didnt move a muscle  you open the companion i ses or itll be the worse for you  dye hear  open it   oh alfred ses the gal hes losing is temper  wotever shall we do  i dont want no more nonsense i ses trying to fix er with my eye if you dont let me out itll be the worse for you  dont you talk to my young lady like that ses the young man  your young lady i ses  hmm  you should ha

untidy cook ad left leaning agin the side and afore i ad any idea of wot e was up to he shoved the beastly thing straight in my face  next time he ses ill tear you limb from limb  i couldnt speak for a time and when i could e stopped me with the mop agin  it was like a chained lion being tormented by a monkey  i stepped down on to the cabin floor and then i told em both wot i thought of em  come

waited but i kept quite quiet with my back towards im  come along ses miss butt  im coming he ses  hi  you down there  when the capn comes back tell im that im taking miss butt to an aunt o mine in the country and tellim that in a week or two hell ave the largest and nicest piece of weddingcake he as ever ad in his life  so long  goodbye watchman ses the gal  they moved off without another wordfrom them i mean  i heard the wicket slam and then i eard a cab drive off over the stones  i couldnt believe it at first  i couldnt believe a gal with such beautiful blue eyes could be so hardearted and for a long time i stood listening and hoping to ear the cab come back  then i stepped up to the companion and tried to shift it with my shoulders  i went back to the cabin at last and arter lighting the lamp i ad another sup o the skippers whisky to clear my ead and sat down to try and think wot tale i was to tell im  i sat for pretty near three hours without thinking of one and then i eard the crew come on to the wharf  they was a bit startled when they saw my ead at the skylight and then they all started at the same time asking me wot i was doing  i told em to let me out fust and then id tell em and one of em ad just stepped round to the companion when the skipper come on to the wharf and stepped aboard  he stooped down and peeped at me through the skylight as though he couldnt believe is eyesight and then arter sending the hands forard and telling em to stay there wotever appened he unlocked the companion and came down
