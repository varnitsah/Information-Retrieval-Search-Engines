sunnier clime  the seal of harvard university     a sketch of the life of james russell lowell  i  elmwood   about half a mile from the craigie house in cambridge massachusetts on the road leading to the old town of watertown is elmwood a spacious square house set amongst lilac and syringa bushes and overtopped by elms pleasant fields are on either side and from the windows one may look out on the charles river winding its way among the marshes the house itself is one of a group which before the war for independence belonged to boston merchants and officers of the crown who refused to take the side of the revolutionary party tory row was the name given to the broad winding road on which the houses stood great farms and gardens were attached to them and some sign of their roomy ease still remains the estates fell into the hands of various persons after the war and in process of time longfellow came to occupy craigie house elmwood at that time was the property of the reverend charles lowell minister of the west church in boston and when longfellow thus became his neighbor james russell lowell was a junior in harvard college he was born at elmwood february 22 1819 any one who will read an indian summer reverie will discover how affectionately lowell dwelt on the scenes of nature and life amidst which he grew up indeed it would be a pleasant task to draw from the full storehouse of his poetry the golden phrases with which he characterizes the trees meadows brooks flowers birds and human companions that were so near to him in his youth and so vivid in his recollection in his prose works also a lively paper cambridge thirty years ago contains many reminiscences of his early life  to know any one well it is needful to inquire into his ancestry and two or three hints may be given of the currents that met in this poet on his fathers side he came from a succession of new england men who for the previous three generations had been in professional life the lowells traced their descent from percival lowella name which survives in the familyof bristol england who settled in newbury massachusetts in 1639 the greatgrandfather was a minister in newburyport one of those as dr hale says who preached sermons when young men went out to fight the french and preached sermons again in memory of their death when they had been slain in battle the grandfather was john lowell a member of the constitutional convention of massachusetts in 1780 it was he who introduced into the bill of rights a phrase from the bill of rights of virginia all men are created free and equal with the purpose which it effected of setting free every man then held as a slave in massachusetts a son of john lowell and brother of the rev charles lowell was francis cabot lowell who gave a great impetus to new england manufactures and from whom the city of lowell took its name another son and thus also an uncle of the poet was john lowell jr whose wise and farsighted provision gave to boston that powerful centre of intellectual influence the lowell institute of the rev charles lowell his son said in a letter written in 1844 he is doctor primrose in the comparative degree the very simplest and charmingest of sexagenarians and not without a great deal of the truest magnanimity it was characteristic of lowell thus to go to the vicar of wakefield for a portrait of his father dr lowell lived till 1861 when his son was fortytwo  illustration elmwood mr lowells home in cambridge  mrs harriet spence lowell the poets mother was of scotch origin a native of portsmouth new hampshire she is described as having a great memory an extraordinary aptitude for language and a passionate fondness for ancient songs and ballads it pleased her to fancy herself descended from the hero of one of the most famous ballads sir patrick spens and at any rate she made a genuine link in the poetic succession in a letter to his mother written in 1837 lowell says i am engaged in several poetical effusions one of which i have dedicated to you who have always been the patron and encourager of my youthful muse the russell in his name seems to intimate a strain of jewish ancestry at any rate lowell took pride in the name on this account for he was not slow to recognize the intellectual power of the hebrew race he was the youngest of a family of five two daughters and three sons an older brother who outlived him a short time was the rev robert traill spence lowell who wrote besides a novel the new priest in conception bay which contains a delightful study of a yankee some poems and a story of schoolboy life  not long before his death lowell wrote to an english friend a description of elmwood and as he was very fond of the house in which he lived and died it is agreeable to read words which strove to set it before the eyes of one who had never seen it tis a pleasant old house just about twice as old as i am four miles from boston in what was once the country and is now a populous suburb but it still has some ten acres of open about it and some fine old trees when the worst comes to the worst if i live so long i shall still have four and a half acres left with the house the rest belonging to my brothers and sisters or their heirs it is a square house with four rooms on a floor like some houses of the georgian era i have seen in english provincial towns only they are of brick and this is of wood but it is solid with its heavy oaken beams the spaces between which in the four outer walls are filled in with brick though you mustnt fancy a brickandtimber house for outwardly it is sheathed with wood inside there is much wainscot of deal painted white in the fashion of the time when it was built it is very sunny the sun rising so as to shine at an acute angle to be sure through the northern windows and going round the other three sides in the course of the day there is a pretty staircase with the quaint old twisted banisterswhich they call balusters now but mine are banisters my library occupies two rooms opening into each other by arches at the sides of the ample chimneys the trees i look out on are the earliest things i remember there you have me in my newold quarters but you must not fancy a large houserooms sixteen feet square and on the ground floor nine high it was large as things went here when it was built and has a certain air of amplitude about it as from some inward sense of dignity in an earlier letter he wrote here i am in my garret i slept here when i was a little curlyheaded boy and used to see visions between me and the ceiling and dream the so often recurring dream of having the earth put into my hand like an orange in it i used to be shut up without a lampmy mother saying that none of her children should be afraid of the darkto hide my head under the pillow and then not be able to shut out the shapeless monsters that thronged around me minted in my brain in winter my view is a wide one taking in a part of boston i can see one long curve of the charles and the wide fields between me and cambridge and the flat marshes beyond the river smooth and silent with glittering snow as the spring advances and one after another of our trees puts forth the landscape is cut off from me piece by piece till by the end of may i am closeted in a cool and rustling privacy of leaves in two of his papers especially my garden acquaintance and a good word for winter has lowell given glimpses of the outdoor life in the midst of which he grew up     ii  education   his acquaintance with books and his schooling began early he learned his letters at a dame school mr william wells an englishman opened a classical school in one of the spacious tory row houses near elmwood and bringing with him english public school thoroughness and severity gave the boy a drilling in latin which he must have made almost a native speech to judge by the ease with which he handled it afterward in mock heroics of course he went to harvard college he lived at his fathers house more than a mile away from the college yard but this could have been no great privation to him for he had the freedom of his friends rooms and he loved the open air the rev edward everett hale has given a sketch of their common life in college he was a little older than i he says and was one class in advance of me my older brother with whom i lived in college and he were most intimate friends he had no room within the college walls and was a great deal with us the fashion of cambridge was then literary now the fashion of cambridge runs to social problems but then we were interested in literature we read byron and shelley and keats and we began to read tennyson and browning i first heard of tennyson from lowell who had borrowed from mr emerson the little first volume of tennyson we actually passed about tennysons poems in manuscript carlyles essays were being printed at the time and his french revolution in such a communitynot two hundred and fifty students all toldliterary effort was as i say the fashion and literary men among whom lowell was recognized from the very first were special favorites indeed there was that in him which made him a favorite everywhere  lowell was but fifteen years old when he entered college in the class which graduated in 1838 he was a reader as so many of his fellows were and the letters which he wrote shortly after leaving college show how intent he had been on making acquaintance with the best things in literature he began also to scribble verse and he wrote both poems and essays for college magazines his class chose him their poet for class day and he wrote his poem but he was careless about conforming to college regulations respecting attendance at morning prayers and for this was suspended from college the last term of his last year and not allowed to come back to read his poem i have heard in later years says dr hale what i did not know then that he rode down from concord in a canvascovered wagon and peeped out through the chinks of the wagon to see the dancing around the tree i fancy he received one or two visits from his friends in the wagon but in those times it would have been treason to speak of this he was sent to concord for his rustication and so passed a few weeks of his youth amongst scenes dear to every lover of american letters     iii  first venture   after his graduation he set about the study of law and for a short time even was a clerk in a countingroom but his bent was strongly toward literature there was at that time no magazine of commanding importance in america and young men were given to starting magazines with enthusiasm and very little other capital such a one was the boston miscellany launched by nathan hale lowells college friend and for this lowell wrote gaily it lived a year and shortly after lowell himself with robert carter essayed the pioneer in 1843 it lived just three months but in that time printed contributions by lowell hawthorne whittier story poe and dr parsonsa group which it would be hard to match in any of the little magazines that hop across the worlds path today lowell had already collected in 1841 the poems which he had written and sometimes contributed to periodicals into a volume entitled a years life but he retained very little of the contents in later editions of his poems the book has a special interest however from its dedication in veiled phrase to maria white he became engaged to this lady in the fall of 1840 and the next twelve years of his life were profoundly affected by her influence herself a poet of delicate power she brought into his life an intelligent sympathy with his work it was however her strong moral enthusiasm her lofty conception of purity and justice which kindled his spirit and gave force and direction to a character which was ready to respond and yet might otherwise have delayed active expression they were not married until 1844 but they were not far apart in their homes and during these years lowell was making those early ventures in literature and first raids upon political and moral evil which foretold the direction of his later work and gave some hint of its abundance  about the time of his marriage he published two books which by their character show pretty well the divided interest of his life his bent from the beginning was more decidedly literary than that of any contemporary american poet that is to say the history and art of literature divided his interest with the production of literature and he carried the unusual gift of a rare critical power joined to hearty spontaneous creation it may indeed be guessed that the keenness of judgment and incisiveness of wit which characterize his examination of literature sometimes interfered with his poetic power and made him liable to question his art when he would rather have expressed it unchecked one of the two books was a volume of poems the other was a prose work conversations on some of the old poets he did not keep this book alive but it is interesting as marking the enthusiasm of a young scholar treading a way then almost wholly neglected in america and intimating a line of thought and study in which he afterward made most noteworthy venture another series of poems followed in 1848 and in the same year the vision of sir launfal perhaps it was in reaction from the marked sentiment of his poetry that he issued now a jeu desprit a fable for critics in which he hit off with a rough and ready wit the characteristics of the writers of the day not forgetting himself in these lines      there is lowell whos striving parnassus to climb     with a whole bale of isms tied together with rhyme     he might get on alone spite of brambles and boulders     but he cant with that bundle he has on his shoulders     the top of the hill he will neer come nigh reaching     till he learns the distinction twixt singing and preaching     his lyre has some chords that would ring pretty well     but hed rather by half make a drum of the shell     and rattle away till hes old as methusalem     at the head of a march to the last new jerusalem  this of course is but a half serious portrait of himself and it touches but a single feature others can say better that lowells ardent nature showed itself in the series of satirical poems which made him famous the biglow papers written in a spirit of indignation and fine scorn when the mexican war was causing many americans to blush with shame at the use of the country by a class for its own ignoble ends lowell and his wife who brought a fervid antislavery temper as part of her marriage portion were both contributors to the liberty bell and lowell was a frequent contributor to the antislavery standard and was indeed for a while a corresponding editor in june 1846 there appeared one day in the boston courier a letter from mr ezekiel biglow of jaalam to the editor hon joseph t buckingham inclosing a poem of his son mr hosea biglow it was no new thing to seek to arrest the public attention with the vernacular applied to public affairs major jack downing and sam slick had been notable examples and they had many imitators but the reader who laughed over the racy narrative of the unlettered ezekiel and then took up hoseas poem and caught the gust of yankee wrath and humor blown fresh in his face knew that he was in at the appearance of something new in american literature the force which lowell displayed in these satires made his book at once a powerful ally of an antislavery sentiment which heretofore had been ridiculed     iv  verse and prose   a year in europe 18511852 with his wife whose health was then precarious stimulated his scholarly interests and gave substance to his study of dante and italian literature in october 1853 his wife died she had borne him three children the firstborn blanche died in infancy the second walter also died young the third a daughter mrs burnett survived her parents in 1855 he was chosen successor to longfellow as smith professor of the french and spanish languages and literature and professor of belles lettres in harvard college he spent two years in europe in further preparation for the duties of his office and in 1857 was again established in cambridge and installed in his academic chair he married also at this time miss frances dunlap of portland maine  lowell was now in his thirtyninth year as a scholar in his professional work he had acquired a versatile knowledge of the romance languages and was an adept in old french and provençal poetry he had given a course of twelve lectures on english poetry before the lowell institute in boston which had made a strong impression on the community and his work on the series of british poets in connection with professor child especially his biographical sketch of keats had been recognized as of a high order in poetry he had published the volumes already mentioned in general literature he had printed in magazines the papers which he afterward collected into his volume fireside travels not long after he entered on his college duties the atlantic monthly was started and the editorship given to him he held the office for a year or two only but he continued to write for the magazine and in 1862 he was associated with mr charles eliot norton in the conduct of the north american review and continued in this charge for ten years much of his prose was contributed to this periodical any one reading the titles of the papers which comprise the volumes of his prose writings will readily see how much literature and especially poetic literature occupied his attention shakespeare dryden lessing rousseau dante spenser wordsworth milton keats carlyle percival thoreau swinburne chaucer emerson pope graythese are the principal subjects of his prose and the range of topics indicates the catholicity of his taste  in these papers when studying poetry he was very alive to the personality of the poets and it was the strong interest in humanity which led lowell when he was most diligent in the pursuit of literature to apply himself also to history and politics several of his essays bear witness to this such as witchcraft new england two centuries ago a great public character josiah quincy abraham lincoln and his great political essays but the most remarkable of his writings of this order was the second series of the biglow papers published during the war for the union in these with the wit and fun of the earlier series there was mingled a deeper strain of feeling and a larger tone of patriotism the limitations of his style in these satires forbade the fullest expression of his thought and emotion but afterward in a succession of poems occasioned by the honors paid to student soldiers in cambridge the death of agassiz and the celebration of national anniversaries during the years 1875 and 1876 he sang in loftier more ardent strains the most famous of these poems was his noble commemoration ode     v  public life   it was at the close of this period when he had done incalculable service to the republic that lowell was called on to represent the country first in madrid where he was sent in 1877 and then in london to which he was transferred in 1880 eight years were thus spent by him in the foreign service of the country he had a good knowledge of the spanish language and literature when he went to spain but he at once took pains to make his knowledge fuller and his accent more perfect so that he could have intimate relations with the best spanish men of the time in england he was at once a most welcome guest and was in great demand as a public speaker no one can read his dispatches from madrid and london without being struck by his sagacity his readiness in emergencies his interest in and quick perception of the political situation in the country where he was resident and his unerring knowledge as a man of the world above all he was through and through an american true to the principles which underlie american institutions his address on democracy which he delivered in england is one of the great statements of human liberty a few years later after his return to america he gave another address to his own countrymen on the place of the independent in politics it was a noble defense of his own position not without a trace of discouragement at the apparently sluggish movement in american selfgovernment of recent years but with that faith in the substance of his countrymen which gave him the right to use words of honest warning  the public life of mr lowell made him more of a figure before the world he received honors from societies and universities he was decorated by the highest honors which harvard could pay officially and oxford and cambridge st andrews and edinburgh and bologna gave gowns he established warm personal relations with englishmen and after his release from public office he made several visits to england there too was buried his wife who died in 1885 the closing years of his life in his own country though touched with domestic loneliness and diminished by growing physical infirmities that predicted his death were rich also with the continued expression of his large personality he delivered the public address in commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the founding of harvard university he gave a course of lectures on the old english dramatists before the lowell institute he collected a volume of his poems he wrote and spoke on public affairs and the year before his death revised rearranged and carefully edited a definitive series of his writings in ten volumes he died at elmwood august 12 1891 since his death three small volumes have been added to his collected writings and mr norton has published letters of james russell lowell in two volumes     the vision of sir launfal  introductory note   lowell was in his thirtieth year when he wrote and published the vision of sir launfal it appeared when he had just dashed off his fable for critics and when he was in the thick of the antislavery fight writing poetry and prose for the antislavery standard and sending out his witty biglow papers he had married four years before and was living in the homestead at elmwood walking in the country about and full of eagerness at the prospect which lay before him in a letter to his friend charles f briggs written in december 1848 he says last night  i walked to watertown over the snow with the new moon before me and a sky exactly like that in pages evening landscape orion was rising behind me and as i stood on the hill just before you enter the village the stillness of the fields around me was delicious broken only by the tinkle of a little brook which runs too swiftly for frost to catch it my picture of the brook in sir launfal was drawn from it but why do i send you this descriptionlike the bones of a chicken i had picked simply because i was so happy as i stood there and felt so sure of doing something that would justify my friends but why do i not say that i have done something i believe that i have done better than the world knows yet but the past seems so little compared with the future i am the first poet who has endeavored to express the american idea and i shall be popular by and by  it is not very likely that lowell was thinking of sir launfal when he wrote this last sentence yet it is not straining language too far to say that when he took up an arthurian story he had a different attitude toward the whole cycle of legends from that of tennyson who had lately been reviving the legends for the pleasure of englishreading people the exuberance of the poet as he carols of june in the prelude to part first is an expression of the joyous spring which was in the veins of the young american glad in the sense of freedom and hope as tennyson threw into his retelling of arthurian romance a moral sense so lowell also a moralist in his poetic apprehension made a parable of his tale and in the broadest interpretation of democracy sang of the leveling of all ranks in a common divine humanity there is a subterranean passage connecting the biglow papers with sir launfal it is the holy zeal which attacks slavery issuing in this fable of a beautiful charity christ in the guise of a beggar  the invention is a very simple one and appears to have been suggested by tennysons sir galahad though lowell had no doubt read sir thomas malorys morte darthur the following is the note which accompanied the vision when first published in 1848 and retained by lowell in all subsequent editions       according to the mythology of the romancers the san greal      or holy grail was the cup out of which jesus christ partook      of the last supper with his disciples it was brought into      england by joseph of arimathea and remained there an      object of pilgrimage and adoration for many years in the      keeping of his lineal descendants it was incumbent upon      those who had charge of it to be chaste in thought word      and deed but one of the keepers having broken this      condition the holy grail disappeared from that time it was      a favorite enterprise of the knights of arthurs court to go      in search of it sir galahad was at last successful in      finding it as may be read in the seventeenth book of the      romance of king arthur tennyson has made sir galahad the      subject of one of the most exquisite of his poems       the plot if i may give that name to anything so slight of      the following poem is my own and to serve its purposes i      have enlarged the circle of competition in search of the      miraculous cup in such a manner as to include not only other      persons than the heroes of the round table but also a      period of time subsequent to the date of king arthurs      reign     prelude to part first       over his keys

passion and woe     lie deep neath a silence pure and smooth       like burntout craters healed with snow     what wonder if sir launfal now     remembered the keeping of his vow

green and broad was every tent                                  125       and out of each a murmur went     till the breeze fell off at night     iii       the drawbridge dropped with a surly clang

gathered all     those shafts the fierce sun had shot over its wall       in his siege of three hundred summers long     and binding them all in one blazing sheaf                        135       had cast them forth so young and strong     and lightsome as a locustleaf     sir launfal flashed forth in his unscarred mail     to seek in all climes for the holy grail     iv       it was morning on

his soul with a thrill       the flesh neath his armor gan shrink and crawl     and midway its leap his heart stood still       like a frozen waterfall     for this man so foul and bent of stature                         155     rasped harshly against his dainty nature     and seemed the one blot on the summer morn     so he tossed him a piece of gold in scorn     vi       the leper raised not the gold from the dust       better to me the poor mans crust                              160     better the blessing of the poor     though i turn me empty from his door     that is no true alms which

is out of sight       that thread of the allsustaining beauty     which runs through all and doth all unite     the hand cannot clasp the whole of his alms                       170     the heart

black and small                      265     then nearer and nearer till one by one     he can count the camels in the sun     as over the redhot sands they pass     to where in its slender necklace

in search of the holy grail     the heart within him was ashes and dust     he parted in twain his single crust                               295     he broke the ice on the streamlets brink     and gave the leper to eat and drink     t was a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread       t was water out of a wooden bowl     yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed                     300

the sky doth now     all night have i heard voices deeper yet     the deep low breathing of the silence grew                         15     while all about muffled in awe there stood     shadows or forms or both clearfelt at heart     but when i turned to front them far along     only a shudder through the midnight ran     and the dense stillness walled me closer round                     20     but still i heard them wander up and down     that solitude and flappings of dusk wings     did mingle with them whether of those hags     let slip upon me once from hades deep     or of yet direr torments if such be                               25     i could but guess and then toward me came     a shape as of a woman very pale     it was and calm its cold eyes did not move     and mine moved not but only stared on them     their fixéd awe went through my brain like ice                     30     a skeleton hand seemed clutching at my heart     and a sharp chill as if a dank night fog     suddenly closed me in was all i felt     and then methought i heard a freezing sigh     a long deep shivering sigh as from blue lips                     35     stiffening in death close to mine ear i thought     some doom was close upon me and i looked     and saw the red moon through the heavy mist     just setting and it seemed as it were falling     or reeling to its fall so dim and dead                             40     and palsystruck it looked then all sounds merged     into the rising surges of the pines     which leagues below me clothing the gaunt loins     of ancient caucasus with hairy strength     sent up a murmur in the morning wind                               45     sad as the wail that from the populous earth     all day and night to high olympus soars     fit incense to thy wicked throne o jove        thy hated name is tossed once more in scorn     from off my lips for i will tell thy doom                         50     and are these tears nay do not triumph jove     they are wrung from me but by the agonies     of prophecy like those sparse drops which fall     from clouds in travail of the lightning when     the great wave of the storm highcurled and black                   55     rolls steadily onward to its thunderous break     why art thou made a god of thou poor type     of anger and revenge and cunning force     true power was never born of brutish strength     nor sweet truth suckled at the shaggy dugs                          60     of that old shewolf are thy thunderbolts     that quell the darkness for a space so strong     as the prevailing patience of meek light     who with the invincible tenderness of peace     wins it to be a portion of herself                                 65     why art thou made a god of thou who hast     the neversleeping terror at thy heart     that birthright of all tyrants worse to bear     than this thy ravening bird on which i smile     thou swearst to free me if i will unfold

thy nature is thy doom at which thy heart     trembles behind the thick wall of thy might                        80     let man but hope and thou art straightway chilled     with thought of that drear silence and deep night     which like a dream shall swallow thee and thine     let man but will and thou art god no more     more capable of ruin than the gold                                  85

seemed musical and low                                      20      men called him but a shiftless youth       in whom no good they saw     and yet unwittingly in truth     they made his careless words their law      they knew not how he learned at all                                25       for idly hour by hour     he sat and watched the dead leaves fall     or mused upon a common flower

which it would give to slavery and the south desired it for the same reason       when a deed is done for freedom through the broad earths aching breast     runs a thrill of joy prophetic trembling on from east to west     and the slave whereer he cowers feels the soul within him climb     to the awful verge of manhood as the energy sublime     of a century bursts fullblossomed on the thorny stem of time       5      through the walls of hut and palace shoots the instantaneous throe     when the travail of the ages wrings earths systems to and fro     at the birth of each new era with a

terror and a chill     under continent to continent the sense of coming ill     and the slave whereer he cowers feels his sympathies with god     in hot teardrops ebbing earthward to be drunk up by the sod     till a corpse crawls round unburied delving in the nobler clod    15      for mankind are one in spirit and an instinct bears along     round the earths electric circle the swift flash of
