79733501	the albany depot  a farce   by w d howells   new york  harper and brothers  1892  copyright 1891 by harper  brothers    the action passes in boston     i mr and mrs edward roberts the chorewoman   mrs roberts with many proofs of an afternoons shopping in her hands and arms appears at the door of the ladies room opening from the public hall and studies the interior with a searching gaze which develops a few suburban shoppers scattered over the settees with their bags and packages and two or three old ladies in the rockingchairs the chorewoman is going about with a saturday afternoon pail and mop and profiting by the disoccupation of the place in the hour between the departures of two great expresses to wipe up the floor she passes near the door where mrs roberts is standing and mrs roberts appeals to her in the anxiety which her failure to detect the object of her search has awakened oh i was just looking for my husband he was to meet me here at ten minutes past three but there dont seem to be any gentlemen  the chorewoman mem  mrs roberts i was just looking for my husband he was to meet me here at ten minutes past three but there dont seem to be any gentlemen you havent happened to notice  the chorewoman theres a gentleman over there beyant readin thats just come in he seemed to be lukun for somebody she applies the mop to the floor close to mrs robertss skirts  mrs roberts bending to the right and to the left and then by standing on tiptoe catching sight of a hat round a pillar then its mr roberts of course ill just go right over to him thank you ever so much dont disturb yourself she picks her way round the area of damp left by the mop and approaches the hat from behind it is you edward what a horrid idea i had i was just going to touch your hat from behind for fun but i kept myself from it in time  roberts looking up with a dazed air from the magazine in his hand why what would have happened  mrs roberts oh you know it mightnt have been you  roberts but it was i  mrs roberts yes i know and i was perfectly sure of it youre always so prompt and i always wonder at it such an absentminded creature as you are but you came near spoiling everything by getting here behind this pillar and burying yourself in your book that way if it hadnt been for my principle of always asking questions i never should have found you in the world but just as i was really beginning to despair the chorewoman came by and i asked her if she had seen any gentleman here lately and she said there was one now over here and i stretched up and saw you i had such a fright for a moment not seeing you for i left my little plush bag with my purse in it at stearnss and ive got to hurry right back though im afraid theyll be shut when i get there saturday afternoon this way but im going to rattle at the front door and perhaps theyll comethey always stay some of them to put the goods away and i can tell them i dont want to buy anything but i left my bag with my purse in it and i guess theyll let me in i want you to keep these things for me edward and ill leave my shoppingbag i shant want it any more dont lose any of them better keep them all in your lap here together and then nobody will come and sit on them she disburdens herself of her packages and parcels and arranges them on her husbands knees while she goes on talking im almost ready to drop im so tired and i do believe i should let you go up to stearnss for me but you couldnt describe the bag so they would recognize it let alone what was in it and they wouldnt give it to you even if they would let you in to inquire theyre much more likely to let a lady in than a gentleman but i shall take a coupe and tell the driver simply to fly though theres plenty of time to go to the ends of the earth and back before our train starts only i should like to be here to receive the campbells and keep willis from buying tickets for amy and himself and us too for that matter he has that vulgar passioni dont know where hes picked it upfor wanting to pay everybodys way and youd never think of your hundredtrip ticketbook till it was too late do take your book out and hold it in your hand so youll be sure to remember it as soon as you see willis you had better keep saying over to yourself willishundredtrip ticketswillishundredtrip tickets thats the way i do where is the book i have to remember everything do keep your ticketbook in your hand edward till willis comes  roberts but i want to read agnes and ive got to hold my pop sci with one hand and keep your traps in my lap with the other did you find a cook  mrs roberts with rapturous admiration of him well edward you have got a brain i declare the cook had utterly gone out of my mind forgetting that plush bag makes me forget everything ive got a splendid onea perfect treasure she wont do any of the wash and well have to put that out and shes been used to having a kitchenmaid but she said we were such a small family that she could shell the pease herself shes the most respectablelooking old thing you ever saw and shes been having ten dollars a week from the last family she was in but shell come the summer with us for six i was very fortunate to get her all the good girls are snapped up for the seaside in may and they wont go into the country for love or money it was the greatest chance shes such a neat quiet ladylike person and all the better for being irish and a catholic catholics do give so much more of a flavor and i never could associate that nova scotia sunkencheeked leanness of marias with a cook this ones name iswell i forget what her name is bridget or norah or something like thatand shes a perfect little butterball shes coming to go out on the same train with us and shell get the dinner tonight and i shant have the mortification of sitting down to a pickup meal with amy campbell the first time she has visited us shes conceited enough about her housekeeping as it is im sure and i wouldnt have her patronizing and pitying me for worlds the cook will be here at halfpast three precisely i had to pretend the train started a little earlier than it does so as to make her punctual they are such uncertain things and i dont suppose i shall be back by that time quite edward and so you must receive her let me see she glances up at the clock on the wall its just quarterpast now and our train goes at ten minutes to fourmy goodness ill have to hurry  the colored man who cries the trains walking halfway into the room and then out cars ready for cottage farms longwood chestnut hill brookline newton centre newton highlands waban riverside and all stations between riverside and boston circuit line train now ready on track no 3  mrs roberts in extreme agitation good gracious edward thats our train  roberts jumping to his feet and dropping all her packages no no it isnt my dear thats the circuit line train didnt you hear ours doesnt go till ten to four on the main line  mrs roberts oh yes so it does how ridiculous but now i must run away and leave you or i never shall get back in time be sure to speak to the cook as soon as she comes in or shell get discouraged and go away again you cant depend on them for an instant i told her you would be here to meet her if i wasnti thought i might be late and you mustnt let her slip and if the campbells happen to get here before im back dont you give them the least inkling of our having just engaged a cook im going to smuggle her into the house without amys knowing it i wouldnt have her know it for the world she prides herself on keeping that impudent spoiled thing of hers with her two soups and she would simply never stop crowing if she knew id had to change cooks in the middle of the summer  roberts picking up and dropping the multitudinous packages and finally sitting down with them all in his lap very red and heated ill be careful my dear  mrs roberts how flushed you are bending over youre so stout now you ought to bend sidewise its perfect folly your trying to bend straight over youll get apoplexy but now i must run or i shall never be back in the world dont forget to look out for the cook  roberts at whom she glances with misgiving as she runs out holding the parcels on his knees with both elbows and one hand and contriving with the help of his chin to get his magazine open again no no i wont my dear he loses himself in his reading while people come and go restlessly a gentleman finally drops into the seat beside him and contemplates his absorption with friendly amusement     ii roberts and willis campbell  campbell dont mind me roberts  roberts looking up heigh what why willis glad to see you  campbell now that you do see me yes i suppose you are what have you got there that makes you

that interests me were you expecting to find her in the pop sci  roberts oh id only been reading a minute when you came in  campbell i dont believe you know how long youd been reading very likely your cooks come and gone  roberts with some alarm she couldnt id only just opened the book  campbell i dare say you think so but youd better cast your eagle eye over this assemblage now and see if she isnt here though probably shes gone what sort of looking woman is she  roberts staring at him in consternation bless my soul i dont know i never saw her  campbell never saw her  roberts no agnes engaged her at the intelligenceoffice and told her we should meet her here and she had to go back for her purse and left me to explain  campbell ha ha ha ha ha ha how did she expect you to recognize her  roberts ii dont know im sure sheshe was very anxious i shouldnt let her get away  campbell laughing you poor old fellow what are you going to do  roberts im sure ive no idea agnes  campbell agnes ought to have a keeper you know what ive always thought of your presence of mind roberts but agnesim really surprised at agnes this is too good i must tell amy this shell never get over this ah ha ha ha  roberts no no you mustnt willis agnes would be very much provoked with me if you told amy she had been engaging a cook she expects to smuggle her into the house without amys knowing  campbell and she left you to meet her here and keep hera cook youd never set eyes on ha ha ha ha ah ha ha ha whats her name  roberts agnes couldnt remember her last nameone never remembers a cooks last name her first name is norah or bridget  campbell maggie perhaps they all sound alike ah ha ha ha ha ha this improves  roberts dont willis youll attract attention whatwhat shall i do if agnes comes back and finds ive let the cook get away shell be terribly put out  campbell perfectly furious you poor old fellowthe rage of a disappointed pigeon i wouldnt be in your shoes for anything oh my i wish amy was here diddidagneshe struggles with his laughter and explodes from time to time between syllablesdid she tell you how the woman looked  roberts she said she was a very respectablelooking old thinga perfect butterball i suppose she was stout  campbell that covers the ground of a great many cooks theyre apt to look respectable when theyre off duty and theyre not in liquor and theyre apt to be perfect butterballs any other distinctive traits  roberts ruefully i dont know shes irish and a catholic  campbell theyre apt to be irish and catholics too well roberts i dont see what you can ask better all youve got to do is to pick out a respectable butterball of that religion and nationality and tell her youre mrs robertss husband and youre to keep her from slipping away till mrs roberts gets here  roberts oh pshaw now willis what would you do  campbell theres a respectable butterball over in the corner by the window there youd better go and speak to her shes got a gingham bundle like a cooks in her lap and she keeps looking about in a fidgety way as if she expected somebody i guess thats your woman roberts better not let her give you the slip youll never hear the last of it from agnes if you do and wholl get our dinner tonight  roberts looking over at the woman in the corner with growing conviction she does answer to the description  campbell yes and she looks tired of waiting if i know anything of that womans character roberts she thinks shes been trifled with and shes not going to stay to be made a fool of any longer  roberts getting to his feet do you think so what makes you think so would you go and speak to her  campbell i dont know she seems to be looking this way perhaps she thinks she recognizes you as she never saw you before  roberts there cant be any harm in asking her she does seem to be looking this way  campbell pretty blackly too i guess shes lost faith in you it wouldnt be any use to speak to her now roberts  roberts i dont know im afraid id better i must how would you introduce the matter willis  campbell oh i wouldnt undertake to say i must leave that entirely to you  roberts do you think id better go at it boldly and ask her if shes the one ororapproach it more gradually  campbell with a few remarks about the weather or the last novel or a little society gossip oh decidedly  roberts oh come now willis what would you advise you must see its very embarrassing  campbell not the least embarrassing simplest thing in the world  the colored man who calls the trains coming and going as before cars for newton newtonville west newton auburndale riverside wellesley hills wellesley natick and south framingham express to newton track no 5  campbell ah shes off shes going to take the wrong train shes gathering her traps together roberts  roberts ill go and speak to her he makes a sudden dash for the woman in the corner campbell takes up his magazine and watches him over the top of it as he stops before the woman in a confidential attitude in a moment she rises and with a dumb show of offence gathers up her belongings and marches past roberts to the door with an angry glance backward at him over her shoulder he returns crestfallen to campbell  campbell looking up from his magazine in affected surprise wheres your cook you dont mean to say she was the wrong woman  roberts gloomily she wasnt the right one  campbell how do you know what did you say to her  roberts i asked her if she had an appointment to meet a gentleman here  campbell you did and what did she say  roberts she said no very sharply she seemed to take it in dudgeon she fired up  campbell i should think so sounded like an improper advertisement  roberts in great distress dont willis for heavens sake  campbell why you must see it had a very clandestine look how did you get out of it  roberts i didnt i got into it further i told her my wife had made an appointment for me to meet a cook here that shed engaged  campbell you added insult to injury go on  roberts and that she corresponded somewhat to the description andand  campbell well  roberts and she told me she was no more a cook than my wife was and she said shed teach me to be playing my jokes on ladies and she grabbed up her things and flew out of the room  campbell waddled i should have said but this is pretty serious roberts she may be a relation of john l sullivans i guess we better get out of here or no we cant weve got to wait for amy and agnes  roberts whatwhat would you do  campbell i dont know look here roberts would you mind sitting a little way off so as to look as if i didnt belong with you i dont want to be involved in this little row of yours unnecessarily  roberts oh come now willis you dont think shell make any trouble i apologized i said everything i could think of she must think i was sincere  campbell in taking her for a cook ive no doubt she did but i dont see how that would help matters i dont suppose shes gone for an officer but i suspect shes looking up the largest irishman of her acquaintance to come back and interview you i should advise you to go out and get on some train id willingly wait here for amy and agnes but you see the real cook might come here after you went and i shouldnt know her from adamor eve see  roberts desperately i seegood heavens here comes that woman back and a man with her willis you must help me out roberts gets falteringly to his feet and stands in helpless apprehension while mr and mrs mcilheny bear down upon him from the door mr mcilheny a small and wiry irishman is a little more vivid for the refreshment he has taken he is in his best black suit and the silk hat which he wears at a threatening slant gives dignified impressiveness to his figure and carriage with some dumbshow of inquiry and assurance between himself and his wife he plants himself in front of roberts in an attitude equally favorable for offence and defence     iii the mcilhenys roberts and campbell  mcilheny and are ye the mahn thats after takun my wife for yer cuke  mrs mcilheny indicating campbell absorbed in his magazine and theres the other wan i saw jokun wid um and puttun um up to it  mcilheny after a swift glance at campbells proportions and selfpossession thats what yere after thinkun mary but i havent got annything to do with what yere after thinkun all i wannt to know is what this mahn meant by preshumin to speak to a lady he didnt know and takun her for a cuke to roberts will ye tell me that ye  roberts in extreme embarrassment yes yes certainly i shall be very glad to explain if youll just step here to the corner were attracting attention where we are  mcilheny attintion do ye suppose i care for attintion when its me wife thats been insulted he follows roberts up with mrs mcilheny as he retires to the corner where she had been sitting out of the way of the people coming and going campbell after a moment closes his magazine and joins them  roberts insulted by no manner of means nothing was further from my thoughts iican explain it all in a moment my dear sir if you will have patience i can indeed i have the highest respect for the lady and im quite incapable of offering her an affront the fact isi hardly know how to begin  mcilheny go ahn sor or ill have to do the beginnun meself pretty soon he shifts himself from one foot to another with a saltatory briskness  roberts the fact is my wife had engaged a cook uptown and she had sent her down here to meet me and go out with me to our summer place at weston  mcilheny an fwhat has all that rigamarole to do wid your speakin to a lady yed never been inthrojuced to fwhat had yer wifes cuke to do with mrs mcilheny  roberts why i didnt know the cook by sight you see my wife had engaged her uptown and appointed her to meet me here without reflecting that i had never seen her and wouldnt know who she was when i did see her she partly expected to be here herself and so i didnt reflect either  mcilheny with signs of an amicable interest an she lift ye to mate a lady ye never had seen before and expicted ye to know her by soight  roberts precisely  mcilheny smiling well thats loike a wooman mary ye cant say it aint  mrs mcilheny grinning its loike a mahn too mike by the same token  mcilheny sure its no bad joke on ye sor  campbell interposing i was having my laugh at him when your good lady here noticed us you see i know his wifeshes my sisterand i could understand just how she would do such a thing andah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha i dont think i shall ever get over it  mcilheny sure it is good hu hu hu hu mary its what yed call a bull if it was irish im thinkun an its no bad bull as it is my dear  mrs mcilheny laughing yere right there mike its as fine a bull as ever there was  campbell and my friend here insisted on going over and speaking to the lady in hopes she could help him out of the difficulty i suppose he bungled it he only wanted to ask her if shed seen a cook here who had an appointment to go out of town with a gentleman id been joking him about it and he thought he must do something and i fancy he made a mess of it he was a good deal worked up ha ha ha ah ha ha ha mr and mrs mcilheny join in his laugh and finally roberts himself  the colored man who calls the trains coming and going cars for auburndale riverside pine grove and newton lower falls express to auburndale track no 7  mrs mcilheny theres our train mike come  mcilheny so tis mary well im hawpy to make yer acquaintance gentlemen and if yere ever in the city hahl when the council is sittun and yell send in yer names to mike mcilheny ill be plased to show ye ahl the attintion in me power ye must excuse me now were jist runnun out to the fahls to pass sunday at a cousins of mrs mcilhenys he snakes hands with roberts and campbell and runs out followed by his wife     iv roberts and campbell  campbell distinguished public character well were out of that roberts i had to crowd the truth a little for you but i fetched the belligerent mcilheny what are you going in for next  roberts iupon my word i havent the least idea i think i shall give up trying to identify the cook agnes must do it herself when she comes here  campbell oh no that wont do old fellow the cook may come here and give you the slip before agnes gets back  roberts what would you do  campbell well i dont know i dont like to advise exactly but it seems to me youve got to keep trying youve got to keep your eye out for respectable butterballs and not let them slip through your fingers  roberts you mean go up and speak to them i couldnt do that again  campbell well of course you didnt make a howling success with mrs mcilheny but it wasnt a deadfailure either but you must use a little more diplomacylead up to the subject gently dont go and ask a woman if shes a cook or had an appointment to meet a gentleman here that wont do ill tell you you might introduce the business by asking if she had happened to see a lady coming in or going out and then describe agnes and say you had expected to meet her here and shell say she hadnt seen her here but such a lady had just engaged her as a cook and then youll say youre the ladys husband and youre sure shell be in in a moment and there you are thats the way you ought to have worked it with mrs mcilheny then it would have come out all right  roberts pessimistically i dont see how it would have made her the cook  campbell it couldnt have done that of course but it would have done everything short of that but were well enough out of it anyway it was mighty lucky i came in with my little amendment just when i did theres all the difference in the world between asking a lady whether she is a cook and whether shes seen a cook that difference just saved the selfrespect of the mcilhenys and saved your life it gave the truth a slight twist in the right direction you cant be too careful about the truth roberts you cant offer it to people in the crude state its got to be prepared if youd carried it through the way i wanted you to the night you and old bemis garroted each other youd have come out perfectly triumphant what you want is not the real truth but the ideal truth not what you did but what you ought to have done heigh now you see those mcilhenys have gone off with their susceptibilities in perfect repair simply because i substituted a for for an if and made you inquire for a cook instead of if she was a cook perhaps you did ask for instead of ask if  roberts no no i asked her if she was a cook  campbell well im glad the mcilhenys had too much sense to believe that theyre happy anyway theyre enjoying the hobble that you and agnes are in with lofty compassion theyhello heres that fellow coming back again  roberts who which where he starts nervously about and confronts mr mcilheny bearing down upon him with a countenance of provisional severity  mcilheny just wan word more wid you sor mrs mcilheny has been thinkun it oover and she says you didnt ask her if she was after seeun a cuke but whether she was after beun a cuke now sor which wahs ut out wfd ut dont be thinkun ye can throw dust in our eyes because were irishmen a threatening tone prevails in mr mcilhenys address at the mounting confusion and hesitation in roberts come are ye deef mahn  roberts in spite of campbells dumbshow inciting him to fiction iiif you will kindly step apart here i can explain i was very confused when i spoke to mrs mcilheny  mcilheny following him and willis into the corner fwhat made ye take my wife for a cuke did she luke anny more like a cuke than yer own wife her family is the best in county mayo her father kept six cows and she never put her hands in wather and ye come up to her in a public place like this where yere afraid to spake aboove yer own breath and ask her if shes after beun the cuke yer wifes engaged fwhat do ye mane by ut  roberts my dear sir i knowi can understand how it seems offensive but i can assure you that i had no intentionnono he falters with an imploring glance at campbell who takes the word  campbell look here mr mcilheny you can appreciate the feelings of a gentleman situated as my friend was here he had to meet a lady whom he had never seen before and didnt know by sight and we decidedmrs mcilheny was so pleasant and kindly lookingthat he should go and ask her if she had seen a lady of the description he was looking for and  mcilheny yessor i can appreciate ahl that but fwhy did he ask her if she was the lady fwhy did he ask her if she was a cuke thats what i wannt to know  campbell well now im sure you can understand that he was naturally a good deal embarrassed at having to address a strange lady his mind was full of his wifes cook and instead of asking her if shed seen a cook he bungled and he blundered and asked heri supposeif she was a cook cant you see that how it would happen  mcilheny with conviction yessor i can and ill feel it an hannor if you gintlemen will join me in a glass of wine on the carner across the way  campbell but your train  mcilheny oh domn the thrain but ill just stip aboord and tell mrs mcilheny ive met a frind an ill be out by the next thrain an ill be back wid you in a jiffy he runs out and campbell turns to roberts  roberts good heavens willis what are we going to do surely we cant go out and drink with this man  campbell im afraid we shant have the pleasure im afraid mrs mcilheny is of a suspicious nature and when mr mac comes back itll be to offer renewed hostility instead of renewed hospitality i dont see anything for us but flight roberts or you cant fly you poor old fellow youve got to stay and look out for that cook id be glad to stay for you but you see i should not know her  roberts i dont know her either willis i was just thinking whether you couldnt manage this wretched man rather better alone iim afraid i confuse you and he gets things out of meadmissions you know  campbell no no your moral support is everything that lie of mine is getting whittled away to nothing we shall soon be down to the bare truth if it hadnt been for these last admissions of yours i dont know what i should have done they were a perfect inspiration ill tell you what roberts i believe you can manage this business twice as well without me but you must keep your eye out for the cook you mustnt let any respectable butterball leave the room without asking her if shes the one youll know how to put it more delicately now and i wont complicate you with mcilheny any more ill just step out here  roberts no no no you mustnt go willis you mustnt indeed i shouldnt know what to do with that tipsy nuisance ah here he comes again  campbell cheerily to the approaching mcilheny i hope you didnt lose your train mr mcilheny  mcilheny darkly never moind my thrain sor my wife says it was a putup jahb between ye she says ye were afther laughun and lukun and winkun at her before this mahn slipped up to spake to her now what do ye make of that  campbell we were laughing of course i had been laughing at my friends predicament in being left to meet a lady hed never seen before you laughed at it yourself  mcilheny i did sor  roberts basely truckling to him it was certainly a ludicrous position  campbell and when we explained it it amused your good lady too she laughed as much as yourself  mcilheny she did sor yere right sure it would make a cow laugh well gintlemen ye must excuse me mrs mcilheny says i mustnt stop for the next thrain and ill have to ask you to join me in that glass of wine some other toime  campbell oh its all right mr mcilheny youve only got about half a minute he glances at the clock and mcilheny runs out profusely waving his hand in adieu  roberts taking out his handkerchief and wiping his forehead well thank heaven were rid of him at last  campbell im not so sure of that hell probably miss the train you may be sure mrs mcilheny is waiting for him outside of it and then we shall have them both on our hands indefinitely we shall have to explain and explain fiction has entirely failed us and i feel that the truth is giving way under our feet ill tell you what roberts  roberts in despair what  campbell why if mcilheny should happen to come back alone we mustnt wait for him to renew his invitation to drink we must take him out ourselves and get him drunk so drunk he cant remember anything stone drunk dead drunk or that is you must i havent got anything to do with him i wash my hands of the whole affair  roberts you mustnt willis you know i cant manage without you and you know i cant take the man out and get him drunk i couldnt i shouldnt feel that it was right  campbell yes i know youd have to drink with him and youve got no head at all youd probably get drunk first and i dont know what i should say to agnes  roberts that isnt the point willis i couldnt ask the man to drink i should consider it immoral besides what should you do if the cook came while i was away you wouldnt know her  campbell well neither would you if you stayed  roberts thats true there doesnt seem to be any end of it or any way out of it i must just stay and bear it  campbell of course you must stay and when mcilheny comes back youd better ask him out to look upon the wine when it is red  roberts no thats impossible quite i shouldnt mind the associationthough it isnt very pleasant but to offer drink to a man alreadydo you suppose it would do to ask him out for a glass of soda plain soda would be good for him or i could order claret in it if the worst came to the worst  campbell claret what mr mcilheny requires is fortyrod whiskey in a solution of sulphuric acid you must take that or fourthproof brandy straight with him  roberts miserably i couldnt you know i couldnt  campbell what are you going to do then  roberts i dont know i dont know iill give him in charge to a policeman  campbell and make a scandal here  roberts of course it cant be done  campbell of course it cant give a councilman in charge the policeman will be irish too and then whatll you do youre more likely to be carried off yourself when the facts are explained theyll have an ugly look in the police report  roberts oh it cant be done nothing can be done i wish agnes would come  the colored man who calls the trains cars ready for south framingham whitneys east holliston holliston metcalfs braggville and milford express to framingham milford branch track no 3     v mrs roberts mrs campbell roberts and campbell then the cook and mcilheny  mrs roberts rushing in and looking about in a flutter till she discovers her husband good gracious edward is that our train i ran all the way from the station door as fast as i could run and im perfectly out of breath did you ever hear of anything like my meeting amy on the very instant she was getting out of her coupe just as i was getting out of mine and i saw her the first thing as soon as i looked up it was the most wonderful chance and the moment we pushed our way through the door and got inside the outer hall i heard the man calling the trainhe calls so distinctlyand i told her i was sure it was our train and then we just simply flew both of us i had the greatest time getting my plush bag they were all locked up at stearnss as tight as a drum but i saw somebody inside moving about and i rattled the door and made signs till he came and then i said i had left my plush bag and he said it was against the rules and id have to come monday and i told him i knew it was and i didnt expect him to transgress the rules but i wished very much to have my plush bag because there were some things in it that i wished to have as well as my purse for id brought away my keys in it and i knew willishow dye do williswould want wine with his dinner and youd have to break the closet open if i didnt get the key and so he said he would see if the person who kept the pickedup things was there yet and it turned out he was and he asked me for a description of the bag and its contents and i described them all down to the very last thing and he said i had the greatest memory he ever saw and now i think everything is going off perfectly and i shall be able to show amy that theres something inland as well as at the seaside why dont you speak to her edward what is the matter what are you looking at she detects him in the act of craning his neck to this side and that and peering over peoples heads and shoulders in the direction of the door hasnt norahbridget i meancome yet she frowns significantly and cautions him concerning mrs campbell by pressing her finger to her lip  roberts yesyes shes here i suppose shesshes here how do you do amy so glad he continues his furtive inspection of the doorway and willis turns away with a snicker  mrs campbell willis what are you laughing at is there anything wrong with my bonnet agnes is there he would let me go about looking like a perfect auk did i bang it getting out of the coupe do tell me willis  mrs roberts to her husband you dont mean to say you havent seen her yet  roberts desperately seen her how should i know whether ive seen her i

wild shriek of laughter  mrs roberts imploringly willis what does it mean  mrs campbell threateningly willis if you dont behave yourself  mrs roberts with the calm of despair well then she isnt coming

told edward not to let willis know go on willis  mrs campbell and i understand just how you felt about it agnes you knew hed laugh go on willis  campbell and she sent her down here and told roberts to keep her till she came herself  both ladies well  campbell and i found poor old roberts here looking out for a cook that hed never seen before and expecting to recognize a woman that hed never met in his life he explodes in another fit of laughter the ladies stare at him in mystification  mrs roberts i would have stayed myself to meet her but id left my plush bag with my purse in it at stearnss and i had to go back after it  mrs campbell she had to leave him what is there to laugh at  mrs roberts i see nothing to laugh at willis  campbell sobered you dont  both ladies no  campbell well by jove then perhaps you dont see anything to laugh at in robertss having to guess who the cook was and going up to the wrong woman and her getting mad and going out and bringing back her little fieryred tipsy irishman of a husband that wanted to fight roberts and my having to lie out of it for him and their going off again and the husband coming back four or five times between drinks and having to be smoothed up each time  both ladies no  mrs roberts it was simply horrid  mrs campbell it wasnt funny at all it was simply disgusting poor mr roberts  campbell well by the holy poker this knocks me out the next time ill marry a man and have somebody around that can appreciate a joke the irishman said himself it would make a cow laugh  mrs campbell i congratulate you on being of the same taste willis and i dare say you tried to heighten the absurdity and add to poor mr robertss perplexity  roberts no no i assure you amy if it hadnt been for willis i shouldnt have known how to manage i was quite at my wits end  mrs campbell you are very generous im sure mr roberts and i suppose i shall have to believe you  roberts but i couldnt act upon the suggestion to take the man out and treat him willis was convinced himself i think that that wouldnt do but i confess i was tempted  mrs roberts treat him  roberts yes he was rather tipsy already and willis thought he would be more peaceable perhaps if we could get him quite drunk but i really couldnt bring my mind to it though i was so distracted that i was on the point of yielding  both ladies willis  mrs roberts you wanted poor edward to go out and drink with that wretched being so as to get him into a still worse state  mrs campbell you suggested that poor mr roberts should do such a thing as that well willis  mrs roberts well willis she turns from him more in sorrow than in anger and confronts a cooklike person of comfortable bulk with a bundle in her hand and every mark of hurry and exhaustion in her countenance why heres bridget now  the
