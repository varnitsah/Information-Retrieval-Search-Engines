11595164	the   history   of the   devil   as well   ancient as modern   in two parts    part i    containing a state of the devils circumstances and the various      turns of his affairs from his expulsion out of heaven to the      creation of man with remarks on the several mistakes concerning      the reason and manner of his fall    also his proceedings with mankind ever since adam to the first      planting of the christian religion in the world    part ii    containing his more private conduct down to the present times his      government his appearances his manner of working and the tools      he works with    bad as he is the devil may be abusd   be falsly chargd and causelesly accusd   when men unwilling to be blamd alone   shift off these crimes on him which are their own      the second edition    london   printed for t warner at the black boy in   paternoster row 1727       the preface   to the   second edition   this second edition of this work notwithstanding a large impression of the first is a certificate from the world of its general acceptation so we need not according to the custom of editors boast of it without evidence or tell a fb in its favour  the subject is singular and it has been handled after a singular manner the wise world has been pleased with it the merry world has been diverted with it and the ignorant world has been taught by it none but the malicious part of the world has been offended at it who can wonder that when the devil is not pleased his friends should be angry  the strangest thing of it all is to hear satan complain that the story is handled prophanely but who can think it strange that his advocates should be what he was from the beginning  the author affirms and has good vouchers for it in the opinion of such whose judgment passes with him for an authority that the whole tenor of the work is solemn calculated to promote serious religion and capable of being improvd in a religious manner but he does not think that we are bound never to speak of the devil but with an air of terror as if we were always afraid of him  tis evident the devil as subtle and as frightful as he is has acted the ridiculous and foolish part as much as most of gods creatures and daily does so and he cannot believe tis any sin to expose him for a foolish devil as he is or shew the world that he may be laughd at  those that think the subject not handled with gravity enough have all the room given them in the world to handle it better and as the author professes he is far from thinking his piece perfect they ought not to be angry that he gives them leave to mend it he has had the satisfaction to please some readers and to see good men approve it and for the rest as my lord rochester says in another case    he counts their censure fame   as for a certain reverend gentleman who is pleased gravely to dislike the work he hopes rather for the authors sake than the devils he only says let the performance be how it will and the author what he will it is apparent he has not yet preachd away all his hearers  it is enough to me says the author that the devil himself is not pleased with my work and less with the design of it let the devil and all his fellow complainers stand on one side and the honest well meaning charitable world who approve my work on the other and ill tell noses with satan if he dares     the

last scene of liberty and what may be supposed   to be his end with what we are to understand of his being   tormented for ever and ever                                         404       the   history   of the   devil c     chap i  being an introduction to the whole work   i doubt not but the title of this book will amuse some of my reading friends a little at first they will make a pause perhaps as they do at a witchs prayer and be some time resolving whether they had best look into it or no lest they should really raise the devil by reading his story  children and old women have told themselves so many frightful things of the devil and have formd ideas of him in their minds in so many horrible and monstrous shapes that really it were enough to fright the devil himself to meet himself in the dark dressd up in the several figures which imagination has formd for him in the minds of men and as for themselves i cannot think by any means that the devil would terrify them half so much if they were to converse face to face with him  it must certainly therefore be a most useful undertaking to give the true history of this tyrant of the air this god of the world this terror and aversion of mankind which we call devil to shew what he is and what he is not where he is and where he is not when he is in us and when he is not for i cannot doubt but that the devil is really and bona fide in a great many of our honest weakheaded friends when they themselves know nothing of the matter  nor is the work so difficult as some may imagine the devils history is not so hard to come at as it seems to be his original and the first rise of his family is upon record and as for his conduct he has acted indeed in the dark as to method in many things but in general as cunning as he is he has been fool enough to expose himself in some of the most considerable transactions of his life and has not shewn himself a politician at all our old friend matchiavel outdid him in many things and i may in the process of this work give an account of several of the sons of adam and some societies of em too who have outwitted the devil nay who have outsind the devil and that i think may be calld outshooting him in his own bow  it may perhaps be expected of me in this history that since i seem inclind to speak favourably of satan to do him justice and to write his story impartially i should take some pains to tell you what religion he is of and even this part may not be so much a jest as at first sight you may take it to be for satan has something of religion in him i assure you nor is he such an unprofitable devil that way as some may suppose him to be for tho in reverence to my brethren i will not reckon him among the clergy no not so much as a gifted brother yet i cannot deny but that he often preaches and if it be not profitably to his hearers tis as much their fault as it is out of his design  it has indeed been suggested that he has taken orders and that a certain pope famous for being an extraordinary favourite of his gave him both institution and induction but as this is not upon record and therefore we have no authentic document for the probation i shall not affirm it for a truth for i would not slander the devil  it is said also and i am apt to believe it that he was very familiar with that holy father pope silvester ii and some charge him with personating pope hildebrand on an extraordinary occasion and himself sitting in the chair apostolick in a full congregation and you may hear more of this hereafter but as i do not meet with pope diabolus among the list in all father platinas lives of the popes so i am willing to leave it as i find it  but to speak to the point and a nice point it is i acknowledge namely what religion the devil is of my answer will indeed be general yet not at all ambiguous for i love to speak positively and with undoubted evidence       1 he is a believer and if in saying so it should follow that      even the devil has more religion than some of our men of fame can      at this time be charged with i hope my lord  and his grace the       of  and some of the upper class in the redhot club will      not wear the coat however well it may sit to their shapes or      challenge the satyr as if it were pointed at them because tis      due to them in a word whatever their lordships are i can assure      them that the devil is no infidel       2 he fears god we have such abundant evidence of this in sacred      history that if i were not at present in common with a few      others talking to an infidel sort of gentlemen with whom those      remote things calld scriptures are not allowd in evidence i      might say it was sufficiently provd but i doubt not in the      process of this undertaking to shew that the devil really fears      god and that after another manner than ever he feard saint      frances or saint dunstan and if that be proved as i take upon      me to advance i shall leave it to judgment whos the better      christian the devil who believes and trembles or our modern      gentry of  who believe neither god nor devil   having thus brought the devil within the pale i shall leave him among you for the present not but that i may examine in its order who has the best claim to his brotherhood the papists or the protestants and among the latter the lutherans or the calvinists and so descending to all the several denominations of churches see who has less of the devil in them and who more and whether less or more the devil has not a seat in every synagogue a pew in every church a place in every pulpit and a vote in every synod even from the sanhedrim of the jews to our friends at the bull and mouth c from the greatest to the least  it will i confess come very much within the compass of this part of my discourse to give an account or at least make an essay toward it of the share the devil has had in the spreading religion in the world and especially of dividing and subdividing opinions in religion perhaps to eke it out and make it reach the farther and also to shew how far he is or has made himself a missionary of the famous clan de propaganda fide it is true we find him heartily employd in almost every corner of the world ad propagandum errorem but that may require a history by it self  as to his propagating religion tis a little hard indeed at first sight to charge the devil with propagating religion that is to say if we take it literally and in the gross but if you take it as the scots insisted to take the oath of fidelity viz with an explanation it is plain satan has very often had a share in the method if not in the design of propagating the christian faith for example  i think i do no injury at all to the devil to say that he had a great hand in the old holy war as it was ignorantly and enthusiastically calld stirring up the christian princes and powers of europe to run a madding after the turks and saracens and make war with those innocent people above a thousand miles off only because they entred into gods heritage when he had forsaken it grazd upon his ground when he had fairly turnd it into a common and laid it open for the next comer spending their nations treasure and embarking their kings and people i say in a war above a thousand miles off filling their heads with that religious madness calld in those days holy zeal to recover the terra sancta the sepulchers of christ and the saints and as they calld it falsly the holy city tho true religion says it was the accursed city and not worth spending one drop of blood for  this religious bubble was certainly of satan who as he craftily drew them in so like a true devil he left them in the lurch when they came there facd about to the saracens animated the immortal saladin against them and managd so dexterously that he left the bones of about thirteen or fourteen hundred thousand christians there as a trophy of his infernal politicks and after the christian world had run a la santa terra or in english a sauntring about a hundred year he dropt it to play another game less foolish but ten times wickeder than that which went before it namely turning the crusadoes of the christians one against another and as hudibras said in another case    made them fight like mad or drunk   for dame religion as for punk   of this you have a compleat account in the history of the popes decrees against the count de thoulouse and the waldenses and albigenses with the crusadoes and massacres which followd upon them wherein to do the devils politicks some justice he met with all the success he could desire the zealots of that day executed his infernal orders most punctually and planted religion in those countries in a glorious and triumphant manner upon the destruction of an infinite number of innocent people whose blood has fattend the soil for the growth of the catholick faith in a manner very particular and to satans full satisfaction  i might to compleat this part of his history give you the detail of his progress in these first steps of his alliances with rome and add a long list of massacres wars and expeditions in behalf of religion which he has had the honour to have a visible hand in such as the parisian massacre the flemish war under the duke d alva the smithfield fires in the marian days in england and the massacres in ireland all which would most effectually convince us that the devil has not been idle in his business but i may meet with these again in my way tis enough while i am upon the generals only to mention them thus in a summary way i say tis enough to prove that the devil has really been as much concerned as any body in the methods taken by some people for propagating the christian religion in the world  some have rashly and i had almost said maliciously chargd the devil with the great triumphs of his friends the spaniards in america and would place the conquest of mexico and peru to the credit of his account  but i cannot join with them in this at all i must say i believe the devil was innocent of that matter my reason is because satan was never such a fool as to spend his time or his politicks or embark his allies to conquer nations who were already his own that would be satan against beelzebub making war upon himself and at least doing nothing to the purpose  if they should charge him indeed with deluding philip ii of spain into that preposterous attempt calld the armada anglice the spanish invasion i should indeed more readily join with them but whether he did it weakly in hope which was indeed not likely that it should succeed or wickedly to destroy that great fleet of the spaniards and draw them within the reach of his own dominions the elements this being a question which authors differ exceedingly about i shall leave it to decide it self  but the greatest piece of management which we find the devil has concernd himself in of late in the matter of religion seems to be that of the mission into china and here indeed satan has acted his masterpiece it was no doubt much for his service that the chineses should have no insight into matters of religion i mean that we call christian and therefore tho popery and the devil are not at so much variance as some may imagine yet he did not think it safe to let the general system of christianity be heard of among them in china hence when the name of the christian religion had but been received with some seeming approbation in the country of japan satan immediately as if alarmd at the thing and dreading what the consequence of it might be armd the japoneses against it with such fury that they expelld it at once  it was much safer to his designs when if the story be not a fiction he put that dutch witicism into the mouths of the states commanders when they came to japan who having more wit than to own themselves christians in such a place as that when the question was put to them answered negatively that they were not but that they were of another religion calld hollanders  however it seems the diligent jesuits outwitted the devil in china and as i said above overshot him in his own bow for the mission being in danger by the devil and the chinese emperors joining together of being wholly expelld there too as they had been in japan they cunningly fell in with the ecclesiasticks of the country and joining the priestcraft of both religions together they brought jesus christ and confucius to be so reconcilable that the chinese and the roman idolatry appeared capable of a confederacy of going on hand in hand together and consequently of being very good friends  this was a masterpiece indeed and as they say almost frighted satan out of his wits but he being a ready manager and particularly famous for serving himself of the rogueries of the priests facd about immediately to the mission and making a virtue of necessity clapt in with all possible alacrity with the proposal1 so the jesuits and he formd a hotchpotch of religion made up of popery and paganism and calculated to leave the latter rather worse than they found it binding the faith of christ and the philosophy or morals of confucius together and formally christening them by the name of religion by which means the politick interest of the mission was preserved and yet satan lost not one inch of ground with the chineses no not by the planting the gospel it self such as it was among them  nor has it been such disadvantage to him that this plan or scheme of a new modelld religion would not go down at rome and that the inquisition damnd it with bell book and candle distance of place servd his new allies the missionaries in the stead of a protection from the inquisition and now and then a rich present well placd found them friends in the congregation it self and where any nuncio with his impudent zeal pretended to take such a long voyage to oppose them satan took care to get him sent back re infecta or inspird the million to move him off the premisses by methods of their own that is to say being interpreted to murther him  thus the mission has in itself been truly devilish and the devil has interested himself in the planting the christian religion in china  the influence the devil has in the politicks of mankind is another especial part of his history and would require if it were possible a very exact description but here we shall necessarily be obliged to inquire so nicely into the arcana of circumstances and unlock the cabinets of state in so many courts canvass the councils of ministers and the conduct of princes so fully and expose them so much that it may perhaps make a combustion among the great politicians abroad and in doing that we may come so near home too that tho personal safety and prudentials forbid our medling with our own country we may be taken in a double entendre and fall unpitied for being only suspected of touching truths that are so tender whether we are guilty or no on these accounts i must meddle the less with that part at least for the present  be it that the devil has had a share in some of the late councils of europe influencing them this way or that way to his own advantage what is it to us for example what if he has had any concern in the late affair of thorn what need we put it upon him seeing his confederates the jesuites with the assessorial tribunal of poland take it upon themselves i shall leave that part to the issue of time i wish it were as easy to persuade the world that he had no hand in bringing the injurd protestants to leave the justice due to the cries of protestant blood to the arbitrament of a popish power who dare say that the devil must be in it if justice should be obtaind that way i should rather say the devil is in it or else it would never be expected  it occurs next to enquire from the premisses whether the devil has more influence or less in the affairs of the world now than he had in former ages and this will depend upon comparing as we go along his methods and way of working in past times and the modern politicks by which he acts in our days with the differing reception which he has met with among the men of such distant ages  but there is so much to enquire of about the devil before we can bring his story down to our modern times that we must for the present let them drop and look a little back to the remoter parts of this history drawing his picture that people may know him when they meet him and see who and what he is and what he has been doing ever since he got leave to act in the high station he now appears in  in the mean time if i might obtain leave to present an humble petition to satan it should be that he would according to modern usage oblige us all with writing the history of his own times twould as well as one that is gone before it be a devilish good one for as to the sincerity of the performance the authority of the particulars the justice of the characters c if they were no better vouchd no more consistent with themselves with charity with truth and with the honour of an historian than the last of that kind which came abroad among us it must be a reproach to the devil himself to be the author of it  were satan to be brought under the least obligation to write truth and that the matters of fact which he should write might be depended upon he is certainly qualified by his knowledge of things to be a compleat historian nor could the bishop himself who by the way has given us already the devil of a history come up to him miltons pandemonium tho an excellent dramatick performance would appear a meer trifling singsong business beneath the dignity of chevychase the devil could give us a true account of all the civil wars in heaven how and by whom and in what manner he lost the day there and was obligd to quit the field the fiction of his refusing to acknowledge and submit to the messiah upon his being declard generalissimo of the heavenly forces which satan expected himself as the eldest officer and his not being able to brook another to be put in over his head i say that finespun thought of mr milton would appear to be straind too far and only serve to convince us that he milton knew nothing of the matter satan knows very well that the messiah was not declared to be the son of god with power till by and after the resurrection from the dead and that all power was then given him in heaven and earth and not before so that satans rebellion must derive from other causes and upon other occasions as he himself can doubtless give us an account if he thinks fit and of which we shall speak further in this work  what a fine history might this old gentleman write of the antediluvian world and of all the weighty affairs as well of state as of religion which happend during the fifteen hundred years of the patriarchal administration  who like him could give a full and compleat account of the deluge whether it was a meer vindictive a blast from heaven wrought by a supernatural power in the way of miracle or whether according to mr burnets theory it was a consequence following antecedent causes by the meer necessity of nature seen in constitution natural position and unavoidable working of things as by the theory publishd by that learnd enthusiast it seems to be  satan could easily account for all the difficulties of the theory and tell us whether as there was a natural necessity of the deluge there is not the like necessity and natural tendency to a conflagration at last  would the devil exert himself as an historian for our improvement and diversion how glorious an account could he give us of noahs voyage round the world in the famous ark he could resolve all the difficulties about the building it the furnishing it and the laying up provision in it for all the collection of kinds that he had made he could tell us whether all the creatures came voluntier to him to go into the ark or whether he went a hunting for several years before in order to bring them together  he could give us a true relation how he wheedled the people of the next world into the absurd ridiculous undertaking of building a babel how far that stupendous staircase which was in imagination to reach up to heaven was carried before it was interrupted and the builders confounded how their speech was alterd how many tongues it was divided into or whether they were divided at all and how many subdivisions or dialects have been made since that by which means very few of gods creatures except the brutes understand one another or care one farthing whether they do or no  in all these things satan who no doubt would make a very good chronologist could settle every epocha correct every calendar and bring all our accounts of time to a general agreement as well the grecian olympiads the turkish heghira the chinese fictitious account of the worlds duration as our blind julian and gregorian accounts which have put the world to this day into such confusion that we neither agree in our holydays or working days fasts or feasts nor keep the same sabbaths in any part of the same globe  this great antiquary could bring us to a certainty in all the difficulties of ancient story and tell us whether the tale of the siege of troy and the rape of helen was a fable of homer or a history whether the fictions of the poets are formd from their own brain or founded in facts and whether letters were invented by cadmus the phoenician or dictated immediately from heaven at mount sinai  nay he could tell us how and in what manner he wheedled eve deluded adam put cain into a passion till he made him murther his own brother and made noah who was above 500 years a preacher of righteousness turn sot in his old age dishonour all his ministry debauch himself with wine and by getting drunk and exposing himself become the jest and laughingstock of his children and of all his posterity to this day  and would satan according to the modern practice of the late right reverend historian enter into the characters of the great men of his age how should we be diverted with the just history of adam in paradise and out of it his character and how he behaved at and after his expulsion how cain wandered in the land of nod what the mark was which god set upon him whose daughter his wife was and how big the city was he built there according to a certain poet of noble extraction    how cain in the land of nod     when the rascal was alone   like an owl in an ivy tod     built a city as big as roan    roch   he could have certainly drawn eves picture told us every feature in her face and every inch in her shape whether she was a perfect beauty or no and whether with the fall she did grow crooked ugly illnaturd and a scold as the learned valdemar suggests to be the effects of the curse  descending to the character of the patriarchs in that age he might no doubt give us in particular the characters of belus worshipd under the name of baal with satan and jupiter his successors who they were here and how they behaved with all the pharaohs of egypt the abimilechs of canaan and the great monarchs of assyria and babylon  hence also he is able to write the lives of all the heroes of the world from alexander of macedon to lewis the xiv and from augustus to the great king george nor could the bishop himself go beyond him for flattery any more than the devil himself could go beyond the bishop for falshood  i could enlarge with a particular satisfaction upon the many fine things which satan rummaging his inexhaustible storehouse of slander could set down to blacken the characters of good men and load the best princes of the world with infamy and reproach  but we shall never prevail with him i doubt to do mankind so much service as resolving all those difficulties would be for he has an indelible grudge against us as he believes and perhaps is assurd that men were at first created by his sovereign to the intent that after a certain state of probation in life such of them as shall be approved are appointed to fill up those vacancies in the heavenly host which were made by the abdication and expulsion of him the devil and his angels so that man is appointed to come in satans stead to make good the breach and enjoy all those ineffable joys and beatitudes which satan enjoyd before his fall no wonder then that the devil swells with envy and rage at mankind in general and at the best of them in particular nay the granting this point is giving an unanswerable reason why the devil practises with such unwearied and indefatigable application upon the best men if possible to disappoint god almightys decree and that he should not find enough among the whole race to be proper subjects of his clemency and qualified to succeed the devil and his host or fill up the places vacant by the fall it is true indeed the devil who we have reason to say is no fool ought to know better than to suppose that if he should seduce the whole race of mankind and make them as bad as himself he could by that success of his wickedness thwart or disappoint the determined purposes of heaven but that those which are appointed to inherit the thrones which he and his followers abdicated and were deposed from shall certainly be preservd in spite of his devices for that inheritance and shall have the possession securd to them notwithstanding all that the devil and all the host of hell can do to prevent it  but however he knows the certainty of this and that when he endeavours the seducing the chosen servants of the most high he fights against god himself struggles with irresistible grace and makes war with infinite power undermining the church of god and that faith in him which is fortified with the eternal promises of jesus christ that the gates of hell that is to say the devil and all his power shall not prevail against them i say however he knows the impossibility there is that he should obtain his ends yet so blind is his rage so infatuate his wisdom that he cannot refrain breaking himself to pieces against this mountain and splitting against the rock qui jupiter vult perdere hos dementat  but to leave this serious part which is a little too solemn for the account of this rebel seeing we are not to expect he will write his own history for our information and diversion i shall see if i cannot write it for him in order to this i shall extract the substance of his whole story from the beginning to our own times which i shall collect out of what is come to hand whether by revelation or inspiration thats nothing to him i shall take care so to improve my intelligence as may make my account of him authentick and in a word such as the devil himself shall not be able to contradict  in writing this uncouth story i shall be freed from the censures of the criticks in a more than ordinary manner upon one account especially viz that my story shall be so just and so well grounded and after all the good things i shall say of satan will be so little to his satisfaction that the devil himself will not be able to say i dealt with the devil in writing it i might perhaps give you some account where i had my intelligence and how all the arcana of his management have come to my hands but pardon me gentlemen this would be to betray conversation and to discover my agents and you know statesmen are very careful to preserve the correspondences they keep in the enemys country lest they expose their friends to the resentment of the power whose councils they betray  besides the learned tell us that ministers of state make an excellent plea of their not betraying their intelligence against all party inquiries into the great sums of money pretended to be paid for secret service and whether the secret service was to bribe people to betray things abroad or at home whether the money was paid to some body or to no body employd to establish correspondences abroad or to establish families and amass treasure at home in a word whether it was to serve their country or serve themselves it has been the same thing and the same plea has been their protection likewise in the important affair which i am upon tis hoped you will not desire me to betray my correspondents for you know satan is naturally cruel and malicious and who knows what he might do to shew his resentment at least it might endanger a stop of our intelligence for the future  and yet before i have done i shall make it very plain that however my information may be secret and difficult that yet i came very honestly by it and shall make a very good use of it for tis a great mistake in those who think that an acquaintance with the affairs of the devil may not be made very useful to us all they that know no evil can know no good and as the learned tell us that a stone taken out of the head of a toad is a good antidote against poison so a competent knowledge of the devil and all his ways may be the best help to make us defie the devil and all his works     chap ii  of the word devil as it is a proper name to the devil and any or all      his host angels c   it is a question not yet determined by the learned whether the word devil be a singular that is to say the name of a person standing by himself or a noun of multitude if it be a singular and so must be used personally only as a proper name it consequently implies one imperial devil monarch or king of the whole clan of hell justly distinguishd by the term the devil or as the scots call him the muckle hornd deel or as others in a wilder dialect the devil of hell that is to say the devil of a devil or better still as the scripture expresses it by way of emphasis the great red dragon the devil and satan  but if we take this word to be as above a noun of multitude and so to be used ambodexter as occasion presents singular or plural then the devil signifies satan by himself or satan with all his legions at his heels as you please more or less and this way of understanding the word as it may be very convenient for my purpose in the account i am now to give of the infernal powers so it is not altogether improper in the nature of the thing it is thus expressd in scripture where the person possessd matt iv 24 is first said to be possessd of the devil singular and our saviour asks him as speaking to a single person what is thy name and is answerd in the plural and singular together my name is legion for we are many  nor will it be any wrong to the devil supposing him a single person seeing entitling him to the conduct of all his inferior agents is what he will take rather for an addition to his infernal glory than a diminution or lessening of him in the extent of his fame  having thus articld with the devil for liberty of speech i shall talk of him sometimes in the singular as a person and sometimes in the plural as an host of devils or of infernal spirits just as occasion requires and as the history of his affairs makes necessary  but before i enter upon any part of his history the nature of the thing calls me back and my lord b of  in his late famous orations in defence of liberty summons me to prove that there is such a thing or such a person as the devil and in short unless i can give some evidence of his existence as my lord  said very well i am talking of nobody  dm me sir says a graceless comrade of his to a great man your grace will go to the devil  dm ye sir says the d then i shall go no where i wonder where you intend to go  nay to the dl too i doubt says graceless for i am almost as wicked as my lord duke  d thou art a silly empty dog says the d and if there is such a place as a hell tho i believe nothing of it tis a place for fools such as thou art  gr i wonder then what heaven the great wits go to such as my lord duke i dont care to go there let it be where it will they are a tiresome kind of people theres no bearing them theyll make a hell wherever they come  d prithee hold thy fools tongue i tell thee if there is any such place as we call no where thats all the heaven or hell that i know of or believe any thing about  gr very good my lord so that heaven is no where and hell is no where and the devil is nobody according to my lord duke  d yes sir and what then  gr and you are to go no where when you die are you  d yes you dog dont you know what that incomparable noble genius my lord rochester sings upon the subject i believe it unfeignedly    after death nothing is     and nothing death  gr you believe it my lord you mean you would fain believe it if you could but since you put that great genius my lord rochester upon me let me play him back upon your grace i am sure you have read his fine poem upon nothing in one of the stanzas of which is this beautiful thought    and to be part of 2 thee     the wicked wisely pray  d you are a foolish dog  gr and my lord duke is a wise infidel  d why is it not wiser to believe no devil than to be always terrifyd at him  gr but shall i toss another poet upon you my lord    if it should so fall out as who can tell   but there may be a god a heaven and hell   mankind had best consider well for fear   t should be too late when their mistakes appear  d dm your foolish poet thats not my lord rochester  gr but how must i be damnd if theres no devil is not your grace a little inconsistent there my lord rochester would not have said that andt please your grace  d no you dog i am not inconsistent at all and if i had the ordering of you id make you sensible of it id make you think your self damnd for want of a devil  gr thats like one of your graces paradoxes such as when you swore by god that you did not believe there was any such thing as a god or devil so you swear by nothing and damn me to no where  d you are a critical dog who taught you to believe these solemn trifles who taught you to say there is a god  gr nay i had a better schoolmaster than my lord duke  d why who was your schoolmaster pray  gr the devil andt please your grace  d the devil the devil he did what youre going to quote scripture are you prithee dont tell me of scripture i know what you mean the devils believe and tremble why then i have the whiphand of the devil for i hate trembling and i am deliverd from it effectually for i never believed any thing of it and therefore i dont tremble  gr and there indeed i am a wickeder creature than the devil or even than my lord duke for i believe and yet dont tremble neither  d nay if you are come to your penitentials i have done with you  gr and i think i must have done with my lord duke for the same reason  d ay ay pray do ill go and enjoy my self i wont throw away the pleasure of my life i know the consequence of it  gr and ill go and reform my self else i know the consequence too  this short dialogue happend between two men of quality and both men of wit too and the effect was that the lord brought the reality of the devil into the question and the debate brought the profligate to be a penitent so in short the devil was made a preacher of repentance  the truth is god and the devil however opposite in their nature and remote from one another in their place of abiding seem to stand pretty much upon a level in our faith for as to our believing the reality of their existence he that denies one generally denies both and he that believes one necessarily believes both  very few if any of those who believe there is a god and acknowledge the debt of homage which mankind owes to the supreme governor of the world doubt the existence of the devil except here and there one whom we call practical atheists and tis the character of an atheist if there is such a creature on earth that like my lord duke he believes neither god or devil  as the belief of both these stands upon a level and that god and the devil seem to have an equal share in our faith so the evidence of their existence seems to stand upon a level too in many things and as they are known by their works in the same particular cases so they are discoverd after the same manner of demonstration  nay in some respects tis equally criminal to deny the reality of them both only with this difference that to believe the existence of a god is a debt to nature and to believe the existence of the devil is a like debt to reason one is a demonstration from the reality of visible causes and the other a deduction from the like reality of their effects  one demonstration of the existence of god is from the universal wellguided consent of all nations to worship and adore a supreme power one demonstration of the existence of the devil is from the avowd illguided consent of some nations who knowing no other god make a god of the devil for want of a better  it may be true that those nations have no other ideas of the devil than as of a superior power if they thought him a supreme power it would have other effects on them and they would submit to and worship him with a different kind of fear  but tis plain they have right notions of him as a devil or evil spirit because the best reason and in some places the only reason they give for worshiping him is that he may do them no hurt having no notions at all of his having any power much less any inclination to do them good so that indeed they make a meer devil of him at the same time that they bow to him as to a god  all the ages of paganism in the world have had this notion of the devil indeed in some parts of the world they had also some deities which they honourd above him as being supposed to be beneficent kind and inclined as well as capable to give them good things for this reason the more polite heathens such as the grecians and the romans had their lares or houshold gods whom they paid a particular respect to as being their protectors from hobgoblins ghosts of the dead evil spirits frightful appearances evil geniuss and other noxious beings from the invisible world or to put it into the language of the day we live in from the devil in whatever shape or appearance he might come to them and from whatever might hurt them and what was all this but setting up devils against devils supplicating one devil under the notion of a good spirit to drive out and protect them from another whom they calld a bad spirit the white devil against the black devil  this proceeds from the natural notions mankind necessarily entertain of things to come superior or inferior god and the devil fill up all futurity in our thoughts and tis impossible for us to form any images in our minds of an immortality and an invisible world but under the notions of perfect felicity or extreme misery  now as these two respect the eternal state of man after life they are respectively the object of our reverence and affection or of our horror and aversion but notwithstanding they are placd thus in a diametrical opposition in our affections and passions they are on an evident level as to the certainty of their existence and as i said above bear an equal share in our faith  it being then as certain that there is a devil as that there is a god i must from this time forward admit no more doubt of his existence nor take any more pains to convince you of it but speaking of him as a reality in being proceed to enquire who he is and from whence in order to enter directly into the detail of his history  now not to enter into all the metaphysical trumpery of his schools nor wholly to confine my self to the language of the pulpit where we are told that to think of god and of the devil we must endeavour first to form ideas of those things which illustrate the description of rewards and punishments in the one the eternal presence of the highest good and as a necessary attendant the most perfect consummate durable bliss and felicity springing from the presence of that being in whom all possible beatitude is inexpressibly present and that in the highest perfection on the contrary to conceive of a sublime fallen archangel attended with an innumerable host of degenerate rebel seraphs or angels cast out of heaven together all guilty of inexpressible rebellion and all suffering from that time and to suffer for ever the eternal vengeance of the almighty in an inconceivable manner that his presence tho blessed in it self is to them the most compleat article of terror that they are in themselves perfectly miserable and to be with whom for ever adds an inexpressible misery to any state as well as place and fills the minds of those who are to be or expect to be banishd to them with inconceivable horror and amazement  but when you have gone over all this and a great deal more of the like tho less intelligible language which the passions of men collect to amuse one another with you have said nothing if you omit the main article namely the personality of the devil and till you add to all the rest some description of the company with whom all this is to be sufferd viz the devil and his angels  now who this devil and his angels are what share they have either actively or passively in the eternal miseries of a future state how far they are agents in or partners with the sufferings of the place is a difficulty yet not fully discoverd by the most learned nor do i believe tis made less a difficulty by their medling with it  but to come to the person and original of the devil or as i said before of devils i allow him to come of an ancient family for he is from heaven and more truly than the romans could say of their idolizd numa he is of the race of the gods  that satan is a fallen angel a rebel seraph cast out for his rebellion is the general opinion and tis not my business to dispute things universally receivd as he was tryd condemnd and the sentence of expulsion executed on him in heaven he is in this world like a transported felon never to return his crime whatever particular aggravations it might have tis certain amounted to hightreason against his lord and governor who was also his maker against whom he rose in rebellion took up arms and in a word raisd a horrid and unnatural war in his dominions but being overcome in battle and made prisoner he and all his host whose numbers were infinite all glorious angels like himself lost at once their beauty and glory with their innocence and commencd devils being transformd by crime into monsters and frightful objects such as to describe human fancy is obliged to draw pictures and descriptions in such forms as are most hateful and frightful to the imagination  these notions i doubt not gave birth to all the beauteous images and sublime expressions in mr miltons majestick poem where tho he has playd the poet in a most luxuriant manner he has sinnd against satan most egregiously and done the devil a manifest injury in a great many particulars as i shall shew in its place and as i shall be obligd to do satan justice when i come to that part of his history mr miltons admirers must pardon me if i let them see that tho i admire mr milton as a poet yet that he was greatly out in matters of history and especially the history of the devil in short that he has charged satan falsly in several particulars and so he has adam and eve too but that i shall leave till i come to the history of the royal family of eden which i resolve to present you with when the devil and i have done with one another  but not to run down mr milton neither whose poetry or his judgment cannot be reproached without injury to our own all those bright ideas of his which make his poem so justly valued whether they are capable of proof as to the fact are notwithstanding confirmations of my hypothesis and are taken from a supposition of the personality of the devil placing him at the head of the infernal host as a sovereign elevated spirit and monarch of hell and as such it is that i undertake to write his history  by the word hell i do not suppose or at least not determine that his residence or that of the whole army of devils is yet in the same local hell to which the divines tell us he shall be at last chaind down or at least that he is yet confind to it for we shall find he is at present a prisoner at large of both which circumstances of satan i shall take occasion to speak in its course  but when i call the devil the monarch of hell i am to be understood as suits to the present purpose that he is the sovereign of all the race of hell that is to say of all the devils or spirits of the infernal clan let their numbers quality and powers be what they will  upon this supposed personality and superiority of satan or as i call it the sovereignty and government of one devil above all the rest i say upon this notion are formd all the systems of the dark side of futurity that we can form in our minds and so general is the opinion of it that it will hardly bear to be opposd by any other argument at least that will bear to be reasond upon all the notions of a parity of devils or making a commonwealth among the black divan seem to be enthusiastick and visionary but with no consistency or certainty and is so generally exploded that we must not venture so much as to debate the point  taking it then as the generality of mankind do that there is a grand devil a superior of the whole black race that they all fell together with their general satan at the head of them that tho he satan could not maintain his high station in heaven yet that he did continue his dignity among the rest who are calld his servants in scripture his angels that he has a kind of dominion or authority over the rest and that they were all how many millions soever in number at his command employd by him in all his hellish designs and in all his wicked contrivances for the destruction of man and for the setting up his own kingdom in the world  supposing then that there is such a superior masterdevil over all the rest it remains that we enquire into his character and something of his history in which tho we cannot perhaps produce such authentick documents as in the story of other great monarchs tyrants and furies of the world yet i shall endeavour to speak some things which the experience of mankind may be apt to confirm and which the devil himself will hardly be able to contradict  it being then granted that there is such a thing or person call him which we will as a masterdevil that he is thus superior to all the rest in power and in authority and that all the other evil spirits are his angels or ministers or officers to execute his commands and are employd in his business it remains to enquire whence he came how he got hither into this world what that business is which he is employd about what his present state is and where and to what part of the creation of god he is limited and restrained what the liberties are he takes or is allowd to take in what manner he works and how his instruments are likewise allowd to work what he has done ever since he commencd devil what he is now doing and what he may yet do before his last and closer confinement as also what he cannot do and how far we may or may not be said to be exposed to him or have or have not reason to be afraid of him these and whatever else occurs in the history and conduct of this archdevil and his agents that may be useful for information caution or diversion you may expect in the process of this work  i know it has been questiond by some with more face than fear how it consists with a compleat victory of the devil which they say was at first obtained by the heavenly powers over satan and his apostate army in heaven that when he was cast out of his holy place and dashd down into the abyss of eternal darkness as into a place of punishment a condemnd hold or place of confinement to be reserved there to the judgment of the great day i say how it consists with that entire victory to let him loose again and give him liberty like a thief that has broken prison to range about gods creation and there to continue his rebellion commit new ravages and acts of hostility against god make new efforts at dethroning the almighty creator and in particular to fall upon the weakest of his creatures man how satan being so entirely vanquishd he should be permitted to recover any of his wicked powers and find room to do mischief to mankind  nay they go farther and suggest bold things against the wisdom of heaven in exposing mankind weak in comparison of the immense extent of the devils power to so manifest an overthrow to so unequal a fight in which he is sure if alone in the conflict to be worsted to leave him such a dreadful enemy to engage with and so ill furnishd with weapons to assist him  these objections i shall give as good an answer to as the case will admit in this course but must adjourn them for the present  that the devil is not yet a close prisoner we have evidence enough to confirm i will not suggest that like our newgate thieves to bring little devils and great devils together he is let out by connivance and has some little latitudes and advantages for mischief by that means returning at certain seasons to his confinement again this might hold were it not that the comparison must suggest that the power which has cast him down could be deluded and the underkeepers or jaylors under whose charge he was in custody could wink at his excursions and the lord of the place know nothing of the matter but this wants farther explanation     chap iii  of the original of the devil who he is and what he was before his      expulsion out of heaven and in what state he was from that time      to the creation of man   to come to a regular enquiry into satans affairs tis needful we should go back to his original as far as history and the opinion of the learned world will give us leave  it is agreed by all writers as well sacred as prophane that this creature we now call a devil was originally an angel of light a glorious seraph perhaps the choicest of all the glorious seraphs see how milton describes his original glory    satan so call him now his former name   is heard no more in heaven he of the first   if not the first archangel great in power   in favour and preeminence    lib v fol 140  and again the same author and upon the same subject    brighter once amidst the host   of angels than that star the stars among    lib vii fol 189   the glorious figure which satan is supposed to make among the thrones and dominions in heaven is such as we might suppose the highest angel in that exalted train could make and some think as above that he was the chief of the archangels  hence that notion and not ill founded namely that the first cause of his disgrace and on which ensued his rebellion was occasioned upon gods proclaiming his son generalissimo and with himself supreme ruler in heaven giving the dominion of all his works of creation as well already finishd as not then begun to him which post of honour say they satan expected to be conferrd on himself as next in honour majesty and power to god the supreme  this opinion is followd by mr milton too as appears in the following lines where he makes all the angels attending all a general summons and god the father making the following declaration to them      here all ye angels prodigy of light   thrones dominions princedoms virtues powrs   hear my decree which unrevokd shall stand   this day i have begot whom i declare   my only son and on this hill   him have anointed whom you now behold   at my right hand your head i him appoint   and my self have sworn to him shall bow   all knees in heavn and shall confess him lord   under his great vicegerent reign abide   united as one individual soul   for ever happy him who disobeys   me disobeys breaks union and that day   cast out from god and blessed vision falls   into utter darkness deep ingulphd his place   ordaind without redemption without end   satan affronted at the appearance of a new essence or being in heaven calld the son of god for god says mr milton tho erroneously declared himself at that time saying this day have i begotten him and that he should be set up above all the former powers of heaven of whom satan as above was the chief and expecting if any higher post could be granted it might be his due i say affronted at this he resolvd    with all his legions to dislodge and leave   unworshipd unobeyd the throne supreme   contemptuous     par lost lib v fo 140   but mr milton is grosly erroneous in ascribing those words this day have i begotten thee to that declaration of the father before satan fell and consequently to a time before the creation whereas it is by interpreters agreed to be understood of the incarnation of the son of god or at least of the resurrection 3 see pool upon acts xiii 33  in a word satan withdrew with all his followers malecontent and chagrine resolvd to disobey this new command and not yield obedience to the son  but mr milton agrees in that opinion that the number of angels which rebeld with satan was infinite and suggests in one place that they were the greatest half of all the angelick body or seraphick host          but satan with his power                      an host   innumerable as the stars of night   or stars of morning dew drops which the sun   impearls on evry leaf and evry flower    ib lib v fo 142   be their number as it is numberless millions and legions of millions that is no part of my present enquiry satan the leader guide and superior as he was author of the celestial rebellion is still the great head and masterdevil as before under his authority they still act not obeying but carrying on the same insurrection against god which they begun in heaven making war still against heaven in the person of his image and creature man and tho vanquishd by the thunder of the son of god and cast down headlong from heaven they have yet reassumed or rather not lost either the will or the power of doing evil  this fall of the angels with the war in heaven which preceded it is finely describd by ovid in his war of the titans against jupiter casting mountain upon mountain and hill upon hill pelion upon ossa in order to scale the adamantine walls and break open the gates of heaven till jupiter struck them with his thunderbolts and overwhelmd them in the abyss vide ovid metam new translation lib i p 19    nor were the gods themselves secure on high   for now the gyants strove to storm the sky   the lawless brood with bold attempt invade   the gods and mountains upon mountains laid     but now the bolt enragd the father took   olympus from her deep foundations shook   their structure nodded at the mighty stroke   and ossas shatterd top oer pelion broke   theyre in their own ungodly ruines slain   then again speaking of jupiter resolving in council to destroy mankind by a deluge and giving the reasons of it to the heavenly host say thus speaking of the demygods alluding to good men below    think you that they in safety can remain   when i my self who oer immortals reign   who send the lightning and heavens empire sway   the stern 4 lycaon practisd to betray    ib p 10   since then so much poetic liberty is taken with the devil relating to his most early state and the time before his fall give me leave to make an excursion of the like kind relating to his history immediately after the fall and till the creation of man an interval which i think much of the devils story is to be seen in and which mr milton has taken little notice of at least it does not seem compleatly filld up after which i shall return to honest prose again and persue the duty of an historian      satan with hideous ruin thus supprest   expelld the seat of blessedness and rest   lookd back and saw the high eternal mound   where all his rebel host their outlet found   restord impregnable the breach made up   and garrisons of angels rangd a top   in front a hundred thousand thunders

choice to be or not to be       chap iv  of the name of the devil his original and the nature of his      circumstances since he has been called by that name   the scripture is the first writing on earth where we find the devil called by his own proper distinguishing denomination devil or the 5 destroyer nor indeed is there any other author of antiquity or of sufficient authority which says any thing of that kind about him  here he makes his first appearance in the world and on that occasion he is called the serpent but the serpent however since made to signify the devil when spoken of in general terms was but the devils representative or the devil in quo vis vehiculo for that time clothed in a bodily shape acting under cover and in disguise or if you will the devil in masquerade nay if we believe mr milton the angel gabriels spear had such a secret powerful influence as to make him strip of a sudden and with a touch to unmask and stand upright in his naked original shape meer devil without any disguises whatsoever  now as we go to the scripture for much of his history so we must go there also for some of his names and he has a great variety of names indeed as his several mischievous doings guide us to conceive of him the truth is all the ancient names given him of which the scripture is full seems to be originals derived from and adapted to the several steps he has taken and the several shapes he has appeared in to do mischief in the world    here he is called the serpent gen iii 1             the old serpent rev xii 9             the great red dragon rev xii 3

his other names are varied according to the custom of speech and the dialects of the several nations where he is spoken of but in a word devil is the common name of the devil in all the known languages of the earth nay all the mischiefs he is empowered to do are in scripture placed to his account under the particular title of the devil not of devils in the plural number though they are sometimes mentioned too but in the singular it is the identical individual devil in and under whom all the little devils and all the great devils if such there be are supposed to act nay they are supposed to be governd and directed by him thus we are told in scripture of the works of the devil 1 john iii 8 of casting out the devil mark i 34 of resisting the devil james iv 5 of our saviour being tempted of the devil mat iv 1 of simon magus a child of the devil acts xiii 10 the devil came down in a great wrath rev xii 12 and the like according to this usage in speech we go on to this day and all the infernal things we converse with in the world are fathered upon the devil as one undivided simple essence by how many agents soever working every thing evil frightful in appearance wicked in its actings horrible in its manner monstrous in its effects is called the devil in a word devil is the common name for all devils that is to say for all evil spirits all evil powers all evil works and even all evil things yet tis remarkable the devil is no old testament word and we never find it used in all that part of the bible but four times and then not once in the singular number and not once to signify satan as tis now understood  it is true the learned give a great many differing interpretations of the word devil the english commentators tell us it means a destroyer others that it signifies a deceiver and the greeks derive it from a calumniator or false witness for we find that calumny was a goddess to whom the athenians built altars and offerd sacrifices upon some solemn occasions and they call her diabolè from whence came the masculine diabolos which we translate devil  thus we take the name of devil to signify not persons only but actions and habits making imaginary devils and transforming that substantial creature calld devil into every thing noxious and offensive thus st francis being tempted by the devil in the shape of a bag of money lying in the highway the saint having discoverd the fraud whether seeing his clovenfoot hang out of the purse or whether he distinguishd him by his smell of sulphur or how otherwise authors are not agreed but i say the saint having discoverd the cheat and outwitted the devil took occasion to preach that eminent sermon to his disciples where his text was money is the devil  nor upon the whole is any wrong done to the devil by this kind of treatment it only gives him the sovereignty of the whole army of hell and making all the numberless legions of the bottomless pit servants or as the scripture calls them angels to satan the grand devil all their actions performances and atchievements are justly attributed to him not as the prince of devils only but the emperor of devils the prince of all the princes of devils  under this denomination then of devil all the powers of hell all the princes of the air all the black armies of satan are comprehended and in such manner they are to be understood in this whole work mutatis mutandis according to the several circumstances of which we are to speak of them  this being premisd and my authority being so good satan must not take it ill if i treat him after the manner of men and give him those titles which he is best known by among us for indeed having so many tis not very easy to call him out of his name  however as i am obligd by the duty of an historian to decency as well as impartiality so i thought it necessary before i used too much freedom with satan to produce authentick documents and bring antiquity upon the stage to justify the manner of my writing and let you see i shall describe him in no colours nor call him by any name but what he has been known by for many ages before me  and now though writing to the common understanding of my readers i am obligd to treat satan very coarsly and to speak of him in the common acceptation calling him plain devil a word which in this mannerly age is not so sonorous as others might be and which by the error of the times is apt to prejudice us against his person yet it must be acknowledgd he has a great many other names and sirnames which he might be known by of a less obnoxious import than that of devil or destroyer c  mr milton indeed wanting titles of honour to give to the leaders of satans host is obligd to borrow several of his scripture names and bestow them upon his infernal heroes whom he makes the generals and leaders of the armies of hell and so he makes beelzebub lucifer belial mammon and some others to be the names of particular devils members of satans upper house or pandemonium whereas indeed these are all names proper and peculiar to satan himself  the scripture also has some names of a coarser kind by which the devil is understood as particularly which is noted already in the apocalypse he is calld the great red dragon the beast the old serpent and the like but take it in the scripture or where you will in history sacred or prophane you will find that in general the devil is as i have said above his ordinary name in all languages and in all nations the name by which he and his works are principally distinguishd also the scripture besides that it often gives him this name speaks of the works of the devil of the subtilty of the devil of casting out devils of being tempted of the devil of being possessd with a devil and so many other expressions of that kind as i have said already are made use of for us to understand the evil spirit by that in a word devil is the common name of all wicked spirits for satan is no more the devil as if he alone was so and all the rest were a diminutive species who did not go by that name but i say even in scripture every spirit whether under his dominion or out of his dominion is called the devil and is as much a real devil that is to say a condemnd spirit and employd in the same wicked work as satan himself  his name then being thus ascertaind and his existence acknowledgd it should be a little enquird what he is we believe there is such a thing such a creature as the devil and that he has been and may still with propriety of speech and without injustice to his character be calld by his antient name devil  but who is he what is his original whence came he and what is his present station and condition for these things and these enquiries are very necessary to his history nor indeed can any part of his history be compleat without them  that he is of an antient and noble original must be acknowledged for he is heavenborn and of angelic race as has been touchd already if scriptureevidence may be of any weight in the question there is no room to doubt the genealogy of the devil he is not only spoken of as an angel but as a fallen angel one that had been in heaven had beheld the face of god in his full effulgence of glory and had surrounded the throne of the most high from whence commencing rebel and being expelld he was cast down down down god and the devil himself only knows where for indeed we cannot say that any man on earth knows it and wherever it is he has ever since mans creation been a plague to him been a tempter a deluder a calumniator an enemy and the object of mans horror and aversion  as his original is heavenborn and his race angelic so the angelic nature is evidently placd in a class superior to the human and this the scripture is express in also when speaking of man it says he made him a little lower than the angels  thus the devil as mean thoughts as you may have of him is of a better family than any of you nay than the best gentleman of you all what he may be fallen to is one thing but what he is fallen from is another and therefore i must tell my learned and reverend friend j w ll d when he spoke so rudely of the devil lately that in my opinion he abusd his betters  nor is the scripture more a help to us in the search after the devils original than it is in our search after his nature it is true authors are not agreed about his age what time he was created how many years he enjoyd his state of blessedness before he fell or how many years he continued with his whole army in a state of darkness and before the creation of man tis supposed it might be a considerable space and that it was a part of his punishment too being all the while unactive unemployd having no business nothing to do but gnawing his own bowels and rolling in the agony of his own selfapproaches being a hell to himself in reflecting on the glorious state from whence he was fallen  how long he remaind thus tis true we have no light into from history and but little from tradition rabbi judah says the jews were of the opinion that he remaind twenty thousand years in that condition and that the world shall continue twenty thousand more in which he shall find work enough to satisfy his mischievous desires but he shews no authority for his opinion  indeed let the devil have been as idle as they think he was before it must be acknowledgd that now he is the most busy vigilant and diligent of all gods creatures and very full of employment too such as it is  scripture indeed gives us light into the enmity there is between the two natures the diabolical and the human the reason of it and how and by what means the power of the devil is restraind by the messias and to those who are willing to trust to gospellight and believe what the scripture says of the devil there may much of his history be discoverd and therefore those that list may go there for a fuller account of the matter  but to reserve all scriptureevidence of these things as a magazine in store for the use of those with whom scripturetestimony is of force i must for the present turn to other enquiries being now directing my story to an age wherein to be driven to revelation and scriptureassertions is esteemd giving up the dispute people nowadays must have demonstration and in a word nothing will satisfy the age but such evidence as perhaps the nature of the question will not admit  it is hard indeed to bring demonstrations in such a case as this no man has seen god at any time says the scripture 1 john iv 12 so the devil being a spirit incorporeal an angel of light and consequently not visible in his own substance nature and form it may in some sense be said no man has seen the devil at any time all those pretences of phrenziful and fanciful people who tell us they have seen the devil i shall examine and perhaps expose by themselves  it might take up a great deal of our time here to enquire whether the devil has any particular shape or personality of substance which can be visible to us felt heard or understood and which he cannot alter and then what shapes or appearances the devil has at any time taken upon him and whether he can really appear in a body which might be handled and seen and yet so as to know it to have been the devil at the time of his appearing but this also i defer as not of weight in the present enquiry  we have divers accounts of witches conversing with the devil the devil in a real body with all the appearance of a body of a man or woman appearing to them also of having a familiar as they call it an incubus or little devil which sucks their bodies runs away with them into the air and the like much of this is said but much more than it is easy to prove and we ought to give but a just proportion of credit to those things  as to his borrowd shapes and his subtle transformings that we have such open testimony of that there is no room for any question about it and when i come to that part i shall be obligd rather to give a history of the fact than enter into any dissertation upon the nature and reason of it  i do not find in any author whom we can call creditable that even in those countries where the dominion of satan is more particularly establishd and where they may be said to worship him in a more particular manner as a devil which some tell us the indians in america did who worshipd the devil that he might not hurt them yet i say i do not find that even there the devil appeard to them in any particular constant shape or personality peculiar to himself  scripture and history therefore giving us no light into that part of the question i conclude and lay it down not as my opinion only but as what all ages seem to concur in that the devil has no particular body that he is a spirit and that tho he may proteus like assume the appearance of either man or beast yet it must be some borrowd shape some assumd figure pro hac vice and that he has no visible body of his own  i thought it needful to discuss this as a preliminary and that the next discourse might go upon a certainty in this grand point namely that the devil however he may for his particular occasions put himself into a great many shapes and clothe himself perhaps with what appearances he pleases yet that he is himself still a meer spirit that he retains the seraphic nature is not visible by our eyes which are human and organic neither can he act with the ordinary powers or in the ordinary manner as bodies do and therefore when he has thought fit to descend to the meannesses of disturbing and frightning children and old women by noises and knockings dislocating the chairs and stools breaking windows and such like little ambulatory things which would seem to be below the dignity of his character and which in particular is ordinarily performed by organic powers yet even then he has thought fit not to be seen and rather to make the poor people believe he had a real shape and body with hands to act mouth to speak and the like than to give proof of it in common to the whole world by shewing himself and acting visibly and openly as a body usually and ordinarily does  nor is it any disadvantage to the devil that his seraphic nature is not confind or imprisond in a body or shape suppose that shape to be what monstrous thing we would for this would indeed confine his actings within the narrow sphere of the organ or body to which he was limited and tho you were to suppose the body to have wings for a velocity of motion equal to spirit yet if it had not a power of invisibility too and a capacity of conveying it self undiscoverd into all the secret recesses of mankind and the same secret art or capacity of insinuation suggestion accusation c by which his wicked designs are now propagated and all his other devices assisted by which he deludes and betrays mankind i say he would be no more a devil that is a destroyer no more a deceiver and no more a satan that is a dangerous arch enemy to the souls of men nor would it be any difficulty to mankind to shun and avoid him as i shall make plain in the other part of his history  had the devil from the beginning been embodied as he could not have been invisible to us whose souls equally seraphic are only prescribd by being embodyd and encasd in flesh and blood as we are so he would have been no more a devil to any body but himself the imprisonment in a body had the powers of that body been all that we can conceive to make him formidable to us would yet have been a hell to him consider him as a conquerd exasperated rebel retaining all that fury and swelling ambition that hatred of god and envy at his creatures which dwells now in his enragd spirit as a devil yet suppose him to have been condemnd to organic powers confind to corporeal motion and restraind as a body must be supposed to restrain a spirit it must at the same time suppose him to be effectually disabled from all the methods he is now allowd to make use of for exerting his rage and enmity against god any farther than as he might suppose it to affect his maker at second hand by wounding his glory thro the sides of his weakest creature man  he must certainly be thus confind because body can only act upon body not upon spirit no species being empowerd to act out of the compass of its own sphere he might have been empowerd indeed to have acted terrible and even destructive things upon mankind especially if this body had any powers given it which mankind had not by which man would be overmatchd and not be in a condition of selfdefence for example suppose him to have had wings to have flown in the air or to be invulnerable and that no human invention art or engine could hurt ensnare captivate or restrain him  but this is to suppose the righteous and wise creator to have made a creature and not be able to defend and preserve him or to have left him defenceless to the mercy of another of his own creatures whom he had given power to destroy him this indeed might have occasiond a general idolatry and made mankind as the americans do to this day worship the devil that he might not hurt them but it could not have prevented the destruction of mankind supposing the devil to have had malice equal to his power and he must put on a new nature be compassionate generous beneficent and steadily good in sparing the rival enemy he was able to destroy or he must have ruind mankind in short he must have ceasd to have been a devil and must have reassumd his original angelic heavenly nature been filld with the principles of love to and delight in the works of his creator and bent to propagate his glory and interest or he must have put an end to the race of man whom it would be in his power to destroy and oblige his maker to create a new species or fortify the old with some kind of defence which must be invulnerable and which his fiery darts could not penetrate  on this occasion suffer me to make an excursion from the usual stile of this work and with some solemnity to express my thoughts thus  how glorious is the wisdom and goodness of the great creator of the world in thus restraining these seraphic outcasts from the power of assuming human or organic bodies which could they do envigorating them with the supernatural powers which as seraphs and angels they now possess and might exert they would be able even to fright mankind from the face of the earth and to destroy and confound gods creation nay even as they are were not their power limited they might destroy the creation it self reverse and overturn nature and put the world into a general conflagration but were those immortal spirits embodied tho they were not permitted to confound nature they would be able to harrass poor weak and defenceless man out of his wits and render him perfectly useless either to his maker or himself  but the dragon is chaind the devils power is limited he has indeed a vastly extended empire being prince of the air having at least the whole atmosphere to range in and how far that atmosphere is extended is not yet ascertaind by the nicest observations i say at least because we do not yet know how far he may be allowd to make excursions beyond the atmosphere of this globe into the planetary worlds and what power he may exercise in all the habitable parts of the solar system nay of all the other solar systems which for ought we know may exist in the mighty extent of created space and of which you may hear farther in its order  but let his power be what it will there we are sure tis limited here and that in two particulars first he is limited as above from assuming body or bodily shapes with substance and secondly from exerting seraphic powers and acting with that supernatural force which as an angel he was certainly vested with before the fall and which we are not certain is yet taken from him or at most we do not know how much it may or may not be diminishd by his degeneracy and by the blow given him at his expulsion this we are certain that be his power greater or less he is restraind from the exercise of it in this world and he who was one equal to the angel who killd 180000 men in one night is not able now without a new commission to take away the life of one job nor to touch any thing he had  but let us consider him then limited and restrained as he is yet he remains a mighty a terrible an immortal being infinitely superior to man as well in the dignity of his nature as in the dreadful powers he retains still about him it is true the brainsick heads of our enthusiasticks paint him blacker than he is and as i have said wickedly represent him clothed with terrors that do not really belong to him as if the power of good and evil was wholly vested in him and that he was placed in the throne of his maker to distribute both punishments and rewards in this they are much wrong terrifying and deluding fanciful people about him till they turn their heads and fright them into a belief that the devil will let them alone if they do such and such good things or carry them away with him they know not whither if they do not as if the devil whose proper business is mischief seducing and deluding mankind and drawing them in to be rebels like himself should threaten to seize upon them carry them away and in a word fall upon them to hurt them if they did evil and on the contrary be favourable and civil to them if they did well  thus a poor deluded country fellow in our town that had livd a wicked abominable debauchd life was frighted with an apparition as he calld it of the devil he fancyd that he spoke to him and telling his tale to a good honest christian gentleman his neighbour that had a little more sense than himself the gentleman askd him if he was sure he really saw the devil yes yes sir says he i saw him very plain and so they began the following discourse  gent see him see the devil art thou sure of it thomas  tho yes yes i am sure enough of it master to be sure twas the devil  gent and how do you know twas the devil thomas had you ever seen the devil before  tho no no i had never seen him before to be sure but for all that i know twas the devil  gent well if youre sure thomas theres no contradicting you pray what clothes had he on  tho nay sir dont jest with me he had no clothes on he was clothed with fire and brimstone  gent was it dark or day light when you saw him  tho o it was very dark for it was midnight  gent how could you see him then did you see by the light of the fire you speak of  tho no no he gave no light himself but i saw him for all that  gent but was it within doors or out in the street  tho it was within it was in my own chamber when i was just going into bed that i saw him  gent well then you had a candle hadnt you  tho yes i had a candle but it burnt as blue and as dim  gent well but if the devil was clothed with fire and brimstone he must give you some light there cant be such a fire as you speak of but it must give a light with it  tho no no he gave no light but i smelt his fire and brimstone he left a smell of it behind him when he was gone  gent well so you say he had fire but gave no light it was a devilish fire indeed did it feel warm was the room hot while he was in it  tho no no but i was hot enough without it for it put me into a great sweat with the fright  gent very well he was all in fire you say but without light or heat only it seems he stunk of brimstone pray what shapes was he in what was he like for you say you saw him  tho o sir i saw two great staring saucer eyes enough to fright any body out of their wits  gent and was that all you saw  tho no i saw his clovenfoot very plain twas as big as one of our bullocks that goes to plow  gent so you saw none of his body but his eyes and his feet a fine vision indeed  tho sir that was enough to send me going  gent going what did you run away from him  tho no but i fled into bed at one jump and sunk down and pulld the bedclothes quite over me  gent and what did you do that for  tho to hide my self from such a frightful creature  gent why if it had really been the devil do you think the bedclothes would have securd you from him  tho nay i dont know but in a fright it was all i could do  gent nay twas as wise as all the rest but come thomas to be a little serious pray did he speak to you  tho yes yes i heard a voice but who it was the lord knows  gent what kind of voice was it was it like a mans voice  tho no it was a hoarse ugly noise like the croaking of a frog and it calld me by my name twice thomas dawson thomas dawson  gent well did you answer  tho no not i i could not have spoke a word for my life why i was frighted to death  gent did it say any thing else  tho yes when it saw that i did not speak it said thomas dawson thomas dawson you are a wicked wretch you lay with jenny s last night if you dont repent i will take you away alive and carry you to hell and you shall be damned you wretch  gent and was it true thomas did you lye with jenny s the night before  tho indeed master why yes it was true but i was very sorry afterwards  gent but how should the devil know it thomas  tho nay he knows it to be sure why they say he knows every thing  gent well but why should he be angry at that he would rather did you lye with her again and encourage you to lye with forty whores than hinder you this cant be the devil thomas  tho yes yes sir twas the devil to be sure  gent but he bid you repent too you say  tho yes he threatnd me if i did not  gent why thomas do you think the devil would have you repent  tho why no thats true too i dont know what to say to that but what could it be twas the devil to be sure it could be nobody else  gent no no twas neither the devil thomas nor any body else but your own frighted imagination you had lain with that wench and being a young sinner of that kind your conscience terrified you told you the devil would fetch you away and you would be damnd and you were so persuaded it would be so that you at last imagind he was come for you indeed that you saw him and heard him whereas you may depend upon it if jenny s will let you lye with her every night the devil will hold the candle or do any thing to forward it but will never disturb you hes too much a friend to your wickedness it could never be the devil thomas twas only your own guilt frighted you and that was devil enough too if you knew the worst of it you need no other enemy  tho why thats true master one would think the devil should not bid me repent thats true but certainly twas the devil for all that  now thomas was not the only man that having committed a flagitious crime had been deluded by his own imagination and the power of fancy to think the devil was come for him whereas the devil to give him his due is too honest to pretend to such things tis his business to persuade men to offend not to repent and he professes no other he may press men to this or that action by telling them tis no sin no offence no breach of gods law and the like when really tis both but to press them to repent when they have offended thats quite out of his way tis none of his business nor does he pretend to it therefore let no man charge the devil with what he is not concernd in  but to return to his person he is as i have said notwithstanding his lost glory a mighty a terrible and an immortal spirit he is himself calld a prince the prince of the power of the air the prince of darkness the prince of devils and the like and his attending spirits are calld his angels so that however satan has lost the glory and rectitude of his nature by his apostate state yet he retains a greatness and magnificence which places him above our rank and indeed above our conception for we know not what he is any more than we know what the blessed angels are of whom we can say no more than that they are ministring spirits c as the scripture has describd them  two things however may give us some insight into the nature of the devil in the present state he is in and these we have a clear discovery of in the whole series of his conduct from the beginning       1 that he is the vanquishd but implacable enemy of god his      creator who has conquerd him and expelld him from the      habitations of bliss on which account he is filld with envy      rage malice and all uncharitableness would dethrone god and      overturn the thrones of heaven if it was in his power       2 that he is mans irreconcilable enemy not as he is a man nor      on his own account simply nor for any advantage he the devil can      make by the ruin and destruction of man but in meer envy at the      felicity he is supposed to enjoy as satans rival and as he is      appointed to succeed satan and his angels in the possession of      those glories from which they are fallen   and here i must take upon me to say mr milton makes a wrong judgment of the reason of satans resolution to disturb the felicity of man he tells us it was meerly to affront god his maker rob him of the glory designd in his new work of creations and to disappoint him in his main design namely the creating a new species of creatures in a perfect rectitude of soul and after his own image from whom he might expect a new fund of glory should be raisd and who was to appear as the triumph of the messiahs victory over the devil in all which satan could not be fool enough not to know that he should be disappointed by the same power which had so eminently counteracted his rage before  but i believe the devil went upon a much more probable design and tho he may be said to act upon a meaner principle than that of pointing his rage at the personal glory of his creator yet i own that in my opinion it was by much the more rational undertaking and more likely to succeed and that was that whereas he perceived this new species of creatures had a sublime as well as a human part and were made capable of possessing the mansions of eternal beatitude from whence he satan and his angels were expelld and irretrievably banishd envy at such a rival movd him by all possible artifice for he saw him deprived of capacity to do it by force to render him unworthy like himself that bringing him to fall into rebellion and disobedience he might see his rival damnd with him and those who were intended to fill up the empty spaces in heaven made so by the absence of so many millions of fallen angels be cast out into the same darkness with them  how he came to know that this new species of creatures were liable to such imperfection is best explaind by the devils prying vigilant disposition judging or leading him to judge by himself for he was as near being infallible as any of gods creatures had been and then inclining him to try whether it was so or no  modern naturalists especially some who have not so large a charity for the fair sex as i have tell us that as soon as ever satan saw the woman and lookd in her face he saw evidently that she was the best formd creature to make a tool of and the best to make a hypocrite of that could be made and therefore the most fitted for his purpose  1 he saw by some thwart lines in her face legible perhaps to himself only that there was a throne ready prepard for the sin of pride to sit in state upon especially if it took an early possession eve you may suppose was a perfect beauty if ever such a thing may be supposed in the human frame her figure being so extraordinary was the groundwork of his project there needed no more than to bring her to be vain of it and to conceit that it either was so or was infinitely more sublime and beautiful than it really was and having thus tickld her vanity to introduce pride gradually till at last he might persuade her that she was really angelic or of heavenly race and wanted nothing but to eat the forbidden fruit and that would make her something more excellent still  2 looking farther into her frame and with a nearer view to her imperfections he saw room to conclude that she was of a constitution easy to be seducd and especially by flattering her raising a commotion in her soul and a disturbance among her passions and accordingly he set himself to work to disturb her repose and put dreams of great things into her head together with something of a nameless kind which however some have been illnaturd enough to suggest i shall not injure the devil so much as to mention without better evidence  3 but besides this he found upon the very first survey of her outside something so very charming in her mein and behaviour so engaging as well as agreeable in the whole texture of her person and withal such a sprightly wit such a vivacity of parts such a fluency of tongue and above all such a winning prevailing whine in her smiles or at least in her tears that he made no doubt if he could but once delude her she would easily be brought to delude adam whom he found set not only a great value upon her person but was perfectly captivated by her charms in a word he saw plainly that if he could but ruin her he should easily make a devil of her to ruin her husband and draw him into any gulph of mischief were it ever so black and dreadful that she should first fall into herself how far some may be wicked enough from hence to suggest of the fair sex that they have been devils to their husbands ever since i cannot say i hope they will not be so unmerciful to discover truths of such fatal consequence tho they should come to their knowledge  thus subtle and penetrating has satan been from the beginning and who can wonder that upon these discoveries made into the womans inside he went immediately to work with her rather than with adam not but that one would think if adam was fool enough to be deluded by his wife the devil might have seen so much of it in his countenance as to have encouragd him to make his attack directly upon him and not go round about beating the bush and ploughing with the heifer setting upon the woman first and then setting her upon her husband who might as easily have been imposed upon as she  other commentators upon this critical text suggest to us that eve was not so pleased with the hopes of being made a goddess that the pride of a seraphic knowledge did not so much work upon her imagination to bring her to consent as a certain secret notion infusd into her head by the same wicked instrument that she should be wiser than adam and should by the superiority of her understanding necessarily have the government over him which at present she was sensible she had not he being master of a particular air of gravity and majesty as well as of strength infinitely superior to her  this is an illnaturd suggestion but it must be confessd the impatient desire of government which since that appears in the general behaviour of the sex and particularly of governing husbands leaves too much room to legitimate the supposition  the expositors who are of this opinion add to it that this being her original crime or the particular temptation to that crime heaven thought fit to shew his justice in making her more entire subjection to her husband be a part of the curse that she might read her sin in the punishment viz he shall rule over thee  i only give the general hint of these things as they appear recorded in the annals of satans first tyranny and at the beginning of his government in the world those that would be more particularly informd may enquire of him and know farther  i cannot however but observe here with some regret how it appears by the consequence that the devil was not mistaken when he made an early judgment of mrs eve and how satan really went the right way to work to judge of her tis certain the devil had nothing to do but to look in her face and upon a near steady view he might easily see there an instrument for his turn nor has he faild to make her a tool ever since by the very methods which he at first proposed to which perhaps he has made some additions in the corrupting her composition as well as her understanding qualifying her to be a compleat snare to the poor weaker vessel man to wheedle him with her syrens voice abuse him with her smiles delude him with her crocodile tears and sometimes cock her crown at him and terrify him with the thunder of her treble making the effeminated male appleeater tremble at the noise of that very tongue which at first commanded him to sin for it is yet a debate which the learned have not decided whether she persuaded and entreated him or like a true shetyrant exercised her authority and obligd him to eat the forbidden fruit  and therefore a certain author whose name for fear of the sexs resentment i conceal brings her in calling to adam at a great distance in an imperious haughty manner beckoning to him with her hand thus here says she you cowardly fainthearted wretch take this branch of heavenly fruit eat and be a stupid fool no longer eat and be wise eat and be a god and know to your eternal shame that your wife has been made an enlightnd goddess before you  he tells you adam hung back a little at first and trembld afraid to trespass what ails the sot says the new termagant what are you afraid of did god forbid you yes and why that we might not be knowing and wise like himself what reason can there be that we who have capacious souls able to receive knowledge should have it withheld take it you fool and eat dont you see how i am exalted in soul by it and am quite another creature take it i say or if you dont ill go and cut down the tree and you shall never eat any of it at all and you shall be still a fool and be governed by your wife for ever  thus if this interpretation of the thing be just she scolded him into it rated him and brought him to it by the terror of her voice a thing that has retained a dreadful influence over him ever since nor have the greatest of adams successors how light soever some husbands make of it in this age been ever able since that to conceal their terror at the very sound nay if we may believe history it prevailed even among the gods not all the noise of vulcans hammers could silence the clamours of that outrageous whore his goddess nay even jupiter himself led such a life with a termagant wife that once they say juno outscolded the noise of all his thunders and was within an ace of brawling him out of heaven but to return to the devil  with these views he resolvd it seems to attack the woman and if you consider him as a devil and what he aimd at and consider the fair prospect he had of success i must confess i do not see who can blame him or at least how any thing less could be expected from him but we shall meet with it again by and by     chap v  of the station satan had in heaven before he fell the nature and      original of his crime and some of mr miltons mistakes about      it   thus far i have gone upon general observation in this great affair of satan and his empire in the world i now come to my title and shall enter upon the historical part as the main work before me  besides what has been said poetically relating to the fall and wandering condition of the devil and his host which poetical part i offer only as an excursion and desire it should be taken so i shall give you what i think is deducd from good originals on the part of satans story in a few words  he was one of the created angels formd by the same omnipotent hand and glorious power who created the heavens and the earth and all that is therein this innumerable heavenly host as we have reason to believe containd angels of higher and lower stations of greater and of lesser degree expressd in the scripture by thrones dominions and principalities this i think we have as much reason to believe as we have that there are stars in the firmament or starry heavens of greater and of lesser magnitude  what particular station among the immortal choir of angels this archseraph this prince of devils calld satan was placd in before his expulsion that indeed we cannot come at the knowledge of at least not with such an authority as may be depended upon but as from scripture authority he is placd at the head of all the apostate armies after he was fallen we cannot think it in the least assuming to say that he might be supposed to be one of the principal agents in the rebellion which happend in heaven and consequently that he might be one of the highest in dignity there before that rebellion  the higher his station the lower and with the greater precipitation was his overthrow and therefore those words tho taken in another sense may very well be applyd to him how art thou fallen o lucifer son of the morning  having granted the dignity of his person and the high station in which he was placed among the heavenly host it would come then necessarily to inquire into the nature of his fall and above all a little into the reason of it certain it is he did fall was guilty of rebellion and disobedience the just effect of pride sins which in that holy place might well be calld wonderful  but what to me is more wonderful and which i think will be very ill accounted for is how came seeds of crime to rise in the angelic nature created in a state of perfect unspotted holiness how was it first found in a place where no unclean thing can enter how came ambition pride or envy to generate there could there be offence where there was no crime could untainted purity breed corruption could that nature contaminate and infect which was always drinking in principles of perfection  happy tis to me that writing the history not solving the difficulties of satans affairs is my province in this work that i am to relate the fact not give reasons for it or sign causes if it was otherwise i should break off at this difficulty for i acknowledge i do not see thro it neither do i think that the great milton after all his fine images and lofty excursions upon the subject has left it one jot clearer than he found it some are of opinion and among them the great dr bs that crime broke in upon them at some interval when they omitted but one moment fixing their eyes and thoughts on the glories of the divine face to admire and adore which is the full employment of angels but even this tho it goes as high as imagination can carry us does not reach it nor to me make it one jot more comprehensible than it was before all i can say to it here is that so it was the fact was upon record and the rejected troop are in being whose circumstances confess the guilt and still groan under the punishment  if you will bear with a poetic excursion upon the subject not to solve but to illustrate the difficulty take it in a few lines thus    thou sin of witchcraft firstborn child of crime     producd before the bloom of time   ambitions maiden sin in heaven conceivd     and who could have believd   defilement could in purity begin   and bright eternal day be soild with sin     tell us sly penetrating crime   how camst thou there thou fault sublime   how didst thou pass the adamantine gate     and into spirit thy self insinuate     from what dark state from what deep place     from what strange uncreated race   where was thy ancient habitation found   before void chaos heard the forming sound     wast thou a substance or an airy ghost     a vapour flying in the fluid waste       of unconcocted air     and how at first didst thou come there   sure there was once a time when thou wert not   by whom wast thou created and for what   art thou a steam from some contagious damp exhald     how should contagion be intaild     on bright seraphic spirits and in a place   where alls supreme and glory fills the space     no noxious vapour there could rise   for there no noxious matter lies     nothing thats evil could appear   sin never could seraphic glory bear   the brightness of the eternal face   which fills as well as constitutes the place   would be a fire too hot for crime to bear   twould calcine sin or melt it into air     how then did first defilement enter in   ambition thou first vital seed of sin   thou life of death how camst thou there     in what bright form didst thou appear     in what seraphic orb didst thou arise   surely that place admits of no disguise     eternal sight must know thee there     and being known thou soon must disappear     but since the fatal truth we know     without the matter whence or manner how   thou high superlative of sin     tell us thy nature where thou didst begin     the first degree of thy increase   debauchd the regions of eternal peace   and filld the breasts of loyal angels there   with the first treason and infernal war      thou art the high extreme of pride   and dost oer lesser crimes preside   not for the mean attempt of vice designd   but to embroil the world and damn mankind   transforming mischief now hast thou procurd     that loss that neer to be restord   and made the bright seraphic morningstar     in horrid monstrous shapes appear     satan that while he dwelt in glorious light   was always then as pure as he was bright   that in effulgent rays of glory shone   excelld by eternal light by him alone   distorted now and stript of innocence   and banishd with thee from the high preeminence   how has the splendid seraph changd his face   transformd by thee and like thy monstrous race   ugly as is the crime for which he fell                  fitted by thee to make a local hell                      for such must be the place where either of you dwell     thus as i told you i only moralize upon the subject but as to the difficulty i must leave it as i find it unless as i hinted at first i could prevail with satan to set pen to paper and write this part of his own history no question but he could let us into the secret but to be plain i doubt i shall tell so many plain truths of the devil in this history and discover so many of his secrets which it is not for his interest to have discoverd that before i have done the devil and i may not be so good friends as you may suppose we are at least not friends enough to obtain such a favour of him tho it be for public good so we must be content till we come ont other side the blueblanket and then we shall know the whole story  but now tho as i said i will not attempt to solve the difficulty i may i hope venture to tell you that there is not so much difficulty in it as at first sight appears and especially not so much as some people would make us believe let us see how others are mistaken in it perhaps that may help us a little in the enquiry for to know what it is not is one help towards knowing what it is  mr milton has indeed told us a great many merry things of the devil in a most formal solemn manner till in short he has made a good play of heaven and hell and no doubt if he had livd in our times he might have had it acted with our pluto and proserpine he has made fine speeches both for god and the devil and a little addition might have turnd it a la modern into a harlequin dieu  diable  i confess i dont well know how far the dominion of poetry extends itself it seems the buts and bounds of parnassus are not yet ascertaind so that for ought i know by vertue of their antient privileges calld licentia poetarum there can be no blasphemy in verse as some of our divines say there can be no treason in the pulpit but they that will venture to write that way ought to be better satisfyd about that point than i am  upon this foot mr milton to grace his poem and give room for his towring fancy has gone a length beyond all that ever went before him since ovid in his metamorphosis he has indeed complimented god almighty with a flux of lofty words and great sounds and has made a very fine story of the devil but he has made a meer je ne scay quoi of jesus christ in one line he has him riding on a cherub and in another sitting on a throne both in the very same moment of action in another place he has brought him in making a speech to his saints when tis evident he had none there for we all know man was not created till a long while after and no body can be so dull as to say the angels may be called saints without the greatest absurdity in nature besides he makes christ himself distinguish them as in two several bands and of differing persons and species as to be sure they are    stand still in bright array ye saints       here stand   ye angels     par lost lib vi fo 174  so that christ here is brought in drawing up his army before the last battle and making a speech to them to tell them they shall only stand by in warlike order but that they shall have no occasion to fight for he alone will engage the rebels then in embattling his legions he places the saints here and the angels there as if one were the main battle of infantry and the other the wings of cavalry but who are those saints they are indeed all of miltons own making tis certain there were no saints at all in heaven or earth at that time god and his angels filld up the place and till some of the angels fell and men were created had livd and were dead there could have been no saints there saint abel was certainly the protosaint of all that ever were seen in heaven as well as the protomartyr of all that have been upon earth  just such another mistake not to call it a blunder he makes about hell which he not only makes local but gives it a being before the fall of the angels and brings it in opening its mouth to receive them this is so contrary to the nature of the thing and so great an absurdity that no poetic license can account for it for tho poesie may form stories as idea and fancy may furnish materials yet poesy must not break in upon chronology and make things which in time were to exist act before they existed  thus a painter may make a fine piece of work the fancy may be good the strokes masterly and the beauty of the workmanship inimitably curious and fine and yet have some unpardonable improprieties which marr the whole work so the famous painter of toledo painted the story of the three wisemen of the east coming to worship and bring their presents to our lord upon his birth at bethlehem where he represents them as three arabian or indian kings two of them are white and one black but unhappily when he drew the latter part of them kneeling which to be sure was done after their faces their legs being necessarily a little intermixd he made three black feet for the negroe king and but three white feet for the two white kings and yet never discoverd the mistake till the piece was presented to the king and hung up in the great church as this is an unpardonable error in sculpture or limning it must be much more so in poetry where the images must have no improprieties much less inconsistencies  in a word mr milton has indeed made a fine poem but it is the devil of a history i can easily allow mr milton to make hills and dales flowry meadows and plains and the like in heaven and places of retreat and contemplation in hell tho i must add that it can be allowed to no poet on earth but mr milton nay i will allow mr milton if you please to set the angels a dancing in heaven lib v fo 138 and the devils a singing in hell lib i fo 44 tho they are in short especially the last most horrid absurdities but i cannot allow him to make their musick in hell to be harmonious and charming as he does such images being incongruous and indeed shocking to nature neither can i think we should allow things to be placd out of time in poetry any more than in history tis a confusion of images which is allowd to be disallowd by all the criticks of what tribe or species soever in the world and is indeed unpardonable but we shall find so many more of these things in mr milton that really taking notice of them all would carry me quite out of my way i being at this time not writing the history of mr milton but of the devil besides mr milton is such a celebrated man that who but he that can write the history of the devil dare meddle with him  but to come back to the business as i had cautiond you against running to scripture for shelter in cases of difficulty scripture weighing very little among the people i am directing my speech to so indeed scripture gives but very little light into any thing of the devils story before his fall and but to very little of it for some time after  nor has mr milton said one word to solve the main difficulty viz how the devil came to fall and how sin came into heaven how the spotless seraphic nature could receive infection whence the contagion proceeded what noxious matter could emit corruption there how and whence any vapour to poison the angelick frame could rise up or how it increasd and grew up to crime but all this he passes over and hurrying up that part in two or three words only tells us                    his pride   had cast him out of heaven with all his host   of rebel angels by whose aid aspiring   he trusted to have equald the most high    lib i fo 3  his pride but how came satan while an archangel to be proud how did it consist that pride and perfect holiness should meet in the same person here we must bid mr milton good night for in plain terms he is in the dark about it and so we are all and the most that can be said is that we know the fact is so but nothing of the nature or reason of it  but to come to the history the angels fell they sinnd wonderful in heaven and god cast them out what their sin was is not explicit but in general tis calld a rebellion against god all sin must be so  mr milton here takes upon him to give the history of it as particularly as if he had been born there and came down hither on purpose to give us an account of it i hope he is better informd by this time but this he does in such a manner as jostles with religion and shocks our faith in so many points necessary to be believd that we must forbear to give up to mr milton or must set aside part of the sacred text in such a manner as will assist some people to set it all aside  i mean by this his invented scheme of the sons being declared in heaven to be begotten then and then to be declard generalissimo of all the armies of heaven and of the fathers summoning all the angels of the heavenly host to submit to him and pay him homage the words are quoted already page 32  i must own the invention indeed is very fine the images exceeding magnificent the thought rich and bright and in some respect truly sublime but the authorities fail most wretchedly and the misstiming of it is unsufferably gross as is noted in the introduction to this work for christ is not declard the son of god but on earth tis true tis spoken from heaven but then tis spoken as perfected on earth if it was at all to be assignd to heaven it was from eternity and there indeed his eternal generation is allowd but to take upon us to say that on a day a certain day for so our poet assumes lib v fol 137           when on a day            on such a day   as heavens great year brings forth the empyreal host   of angels by imperial summons calld   forthwith from all the ends of heaven appeard   this is indeed too gross at this meeting he makes god declare the son to be that day begotten as before had he made him not begotten that day but declared general that day it would be reconcileable with scripture and with sense for either the begetting is meant of ordaining to an office or else the eternal generation falls to the ground and if it was to the office mediator then mr milton is out in ascribing another fixd day to the work see lib x fo 194 but then the declaring him that day is wrong chronology too for christ is declard the son of god with power only by the resurrection of the dead and this is both a declaration in heaven and in earth rom i 4 and milton can have no authority to tell us there was any declaration of it in heaven before this except it be that dull authority calld poetic license which will not pass in so solemn an affair as that  but the thing was necessary to milton who wanted to assign some cause or original of the devils rebellion and so as i said above the design is well laid it only wants two trifles calld truth and history so i leave it to struggle for itself  this groundplot being laid he has a fair field for the devil to play the rebel in for he immediately brings him in not satisfyd with the exaltation of the son of god the case must be thus satan being an eminent archangel and perhaps the highest of all the angelic train hearing this sovereign declaration that the son of god was declard to be head or generalissimo of all the heavenly host took it ill to see another put into the high station over his head as the soldiers call it he perhaps thinking himself the senior officer and disdaining to submit to any but to his former immediate sovereign in short he threw up his commission and in order not to be compeld to obey revolted and broke out in open rebellion  all this part is a decoration noble and great nor is there any objection to be made against the invention because a deduction of probable events but the plot is wrong laid as is observd above because contradicted by the scripture account according to which christ was declared in heaven not then but from eternity and not declared with power but on earth viz in his victory over sin and death by the resurrection from the dead so that mr milton is not orthodox in this part but lays an avowd foundation for the corrupt doctrine of arius which says there was a time when christ was not the son of god  but to leave mr milton to his flights i agree with him in this part viz that the wicked or sinning angels with the great archangel at the head of them revolted from their obedience even in heaven it self that satan began the wicked defection and being a chief among the heavenly host consequently carryd over a great party with him who all together rebeld against god that upon this rebellion they were sentencd by the righteous judgment of god to be expeld the holy habitation this besides the authority of scripture we have visible testimonies of from the devils themselves their influences and operations among us every day of which mankind are witnesses in all the merry things they do in his name and under his protection in almost every scene of life they pass thro whether we talk of things done openly or in masquerade things done inor out of it things done in earnest or in jest  but then what comes of the long and bloody war that mr milton gives such a full and particular account of and the terrible battles in heaven between michael with the royal army of angels on one hand and satan with his rebel host on the other in which he supposes the numbers and strength to be pretty near equal but at length brings in the devils army upon doubling their rage and bringing new engines of war into the field putting michael and all the faithful army to the worst and in a word defeats them for tho they were not put to a plain flight in which case he must at least have given an account of two or three thousand millions of angels cut in pieces and wounded yet he allows them to give over the fight and make a kind of retreat so making way for the compleat victory of the son of god now this is all invention or at least a borrowd thought from the old poets and the fight of the giants against jupiter so nobly designd by ovid almost two thousand years ago and there twas well enough but whether poetic fancy should be allowd to fable upon heaven or no and upon the king of heaven too that i leave to the sages  by this expulsion of the devils it is allowd by most authors they are ipso facto stript of the rectitude and holiness of their nature which was their beauty and perfection and being ingulphd in the abyss of irrecoverable ruin tis no matter where from that very time they lost their angelic beautiful form commencd ugly frightful monsters and devils and became evil doers as well as evil spirits filld with a horrid malignity and enmity against their maker and armd with a hellish resolution to shew and exert it on all occasions retaining however their exalted spirituous nature and having a vast extensive power of action all which they can exert in nothing else but doing evil for they are entirely divested of either power or will to do good and even in doing evil they are under restraints and limitations of a superior power which it is their torment and perhaps a great part of their hell that they cannot break thro     chap vi  what became of the devil and his host of fallen spirits after their      being expelld from heaven and his wandring condition till the      creation with some more of mr miltons absurdities on that      subject   having thus brought the devil and his innumerable legions to the edge of the bottomlesspit it remains before i bring them to action that some enquiry should be made into the posture of their affairs immediately after their precipitate fall and into the place of their immediate residence for this will appear to be very necessary to satans history and indeed so as that without it all the farther account we have to give of him will be inconsistent and imperfect  and first i take upon me to lay down some fundamentals which i believe i shall be able to make out historically tho perhaps not so geographically as some have pretended to do       1 that satan was not immediately nor is yet lockd down into      the abyss of a local hell such as is supposed by some and such      as he shall be at last or that       2 if he was he has certain liberties allowed him for excursions      into the regions of this air and certain spheres of action in      which he can and does move to do like a very devil as he is      all the mischief he can and of which we see so many examples both      about us and in us in the inquiry after which i shall take      occasion to examine whether the devil is not in most of us      sometimes if not in all of us one time or other       3 that satan has no particular residence in this globe or earth      where we live that he rambles about among us and marches over and      over our whole country he and his devils in camps volant but      that he pitches his grand army or chief encampment in our      adjacencies or frontiers which the philosophers call atmosphere      and whence he is calld the prince of the power of that element or      part of the world we call air from whence he sends out his      spies his agents and emissaries to get intelligence and to carry      his commissions to his trusty and well beloved cousins and      counsellors on earth by which his business is done and his      affairs carried on in the world   here again i meet mr milton full in my face who will have it that the devil immediately at his expulsion rolld down directly into a hell proper and local nay he measures the very distance at least gives the length of the journey by the time they were passing or falling which he says was nine days a good poetical flight but neither founded on scripture or philosophy he might every jot as well have brought hell up to the walls of heaven advancd to receive them or he ought to have considerd the space which is to be allowd to any locality let him take what part of infinite distance between heaven and a created hell he pleases  but let that be as mr miltons extraordinary genius pleases to place it the passage it seems is just nine days betwixt heaven and hell well might dives then see father abraham and talk to him too but then the great gulph which abraham tells him was fixd between them does not seem to be so large as according to sir isaac newton dr halley mr whiston and the rest of our men of science we take it to be  but suppose the passage to be nine days according to mr milton what followd why hell gapd wide opend its frightful mouth and received them all at once millions and thousands of millions as they were it received them all at a gulp as we call it they had no difficulty to go in no none at all      facilis desensus averni sed revocare gradum   hoc opus hic labor est          virg   all this as poetical we may receive but not at all as historical for then come difficulties insuperable in our way some of which may be as follow 1 hell is here supposed to be a place nay a place created for the punishment of angels and men and likewise created long before those had fallen or these had being this makes me say mr milton was a good poet but a bad historian tophet was prepard of old indeed but it was for the king that is to say it was prepard for those whose lot it should be to come there but this does not at all suppose it was prepard before it was resolvd whether there should be subjects for it or no else we must suppose both men and angels were made by the glorious and upright maker of all things on purpose for destruction which would be incongruous and absurd  but there is worse yet to come in the next place he adds that hell having receivd them closd upon them that is to say took them in closd or shut its mouth and in a word they were lockd in as it was said in another place they were lockd in and the key is carryd up to heaven and kept there for we know the angel came down from heaven having the key of the bottomlesspit but first see mr milton    nine days they fell confounded chaos roard   and felt tenfold confusion in their fall                       hell at last   yawning receivd them all and on them closd   down from the verge of heaven eternal wrath   burnt after them   unquenchable   this scheme is certainly deficient if not absurd and i think is more so than any other he has laid tis evident neither satan or his host of devils are no not any of them yet even now confind in the eternal prison where the scripture says he shall be reserved in chains of darkness they must have mean thoughts of hell as a prison a local confinement that can suppose the devil able to break goal knock off his fetters and come abroad if he had been once lockd in there as mr milton says he was now we know that he is abroad again he presented himself before god among his neighbours when jobs case came to be discoursd of and more than that its plain he was a prisoner at large by his answer to gods question which was whence comest thou to which he answerd from going to and fro thro the earth c this i say is plain and if it be as certain that hell closed upon them i demand then how got he out and why was there not a proclamation for apprehending him as there usually is after such rogues as break prison  in short the true account of the devils circumstances since his fall from heaven is much more likely to be thus that he is more of a vagrant than a prisoner that he is a wanderer in the wild unbounded wast where he and his legions like the hoords of tartary who in the wild countries of karakathay the desarts of barkan kassan and astracan live up and down where they find proper so satan and his innumerable legions rove about hic  ubique pitching their camps being beasts of prey where they find the most spoil watching over this world and all the other worlds for ought we know and if there are any such i say watching and seeking who they may devour that is who they may deceive and delude and so destroy for devour they cannot  satan being thus confind to a vagabond wandring unsettld condition is without any certain abode for tho he has in consequence of his angelic nature a kind of empire in the liquid wast or air yet this is certainly part of his punishment that he is continually hovering over this inhabited globe of earth swelling with the rage of envy at the felicity of his rival man and studying all the means possible to injure and ruin him but extremely limited in power to his unspeakable mortification this is his present state without any fixd abode place or space allowd him to rest the sole of his foot upon  from his expulsion i take his first view of horror to be that of looking back towards the heaven which he had lost there to see the chasm or opening made up out at which as at a breach in the wall of the holy place he was thrust headlong by the power which expeld him i say to see the breach repaird the mounds built up the walls garisond with millions of angels and armd with thunders and above all made terrible by that glory from whose presence they were expeld as is poetically hinted at before  upon this sight tis no wonder if there was such a place that they fled till the darkness might cover them and that they might be out of the view of so hated a sight  wherever they found it you may be sure they pitchd their first camp and began after many a sour reflection upon what was passd to consider and think a little upon what was to come  if i had as much personal acquaintance with the devil as would admit it and could depend upon the truth of what answer he would give me the first question i would ask him should be what measures they resolvd on at their first assembly and the next should be how they were employd in all that space of time between their so flying the face of their almighty conqueror and the creation of man as for the length of the time which according to the learnd was twenty thousand years and according to the more learned not half a quarter so much i would not concern my curiosity much about it tis most certain there was a considerable time between but of that immediately first let me enquire what they were doing all that time  the devil and his host being thus i say cast out of heaven and not yet confind strictly to hell tis plain they must be some where satan and all his legions did not lose their existence no nor the existence of devils neither god was so far from annihilating him that he still preservd his being and this not mr milton only but god himself has made known to us having left his history so far upon record several expressions in scripture also make it evident as particularly the story of job mentioned before the like in our saviours time and several others  if hell did not immediately ingulph them as milton suggests tis certain i say that they fled somewhere from the anger of heaven from the face of the avenger and his absence and their own guilt wonder not at it would make hell enough for them wherever they went  nor need we fly to the dreams of our astronomers who take a great deal of pains to fill up the vast spaces of the starry heavens with innumerable habitable worlds allowing as many solar systems as there are fixd stars and that not only in the known constellations but even in gallaxie it self who to every such system allow a certain number of planets and to every one of those planets so many satellites or moons and all these planets and moons to be worlds solid dark opaque bodies habitable and as they would have us believe inhabited by the like animals and rational creatures as on this earth so that they may at this rate find room enough for the devil and all his angels without making a hell on purpose nay they may for ought i know find a world for every devil in all the devils host and so every one may be a monarch or masterdevil separately in his own sphere or world and play the devil there by himself  and even if this were so it cannot be denied but that one devil in a place would be enough for a whole systemary world and be able if not restrained to do mischief enough there too and even to ruin and overthrow the whole body of people containd in it  but i say we need not fly to these shifts or consult the astronomers in the decision of this point for wherever satan and his defeated host went at their expulsion from heaven we think we are certain none of all these beautiful worlds or be they worlds or no i mean the fixd stars planets c had then any existence for the beginning as the scripture calls it was not yet begun  but to speak a little by the rules of philosophy that is to say so as to be understood by others even when we speak of things we cannot fully understand ourselves tho in the beginning of time all this glorious creation was formd the earth the starry heavens and all the furniture thereof and there was a time when they were not yet we cannot say so of the void or that nameless nowhere as i calld it before which now appears to be a somewhere in which these glorious bodies are placd that immense space which those take up and which they move in at this time must be supposed before they had being to be placd there as god himself was and existed before all being time or place so the heaven of heavens or the place where the thrones and dominions of his kingdom then existed inconceivable and ineffable had an existence before the glorious seraphs the innumerable company of angels which attended about the throne of god existed these all had a being long before as the eternal creator of them all had before them  into this void or abyss of nothing however unmeasurable infinite and even to those spirits themselves inconceivable they certainly launchd from the bright precipice which they fell from and here they shifted as well as they could  here expanding those wings which fear and horror at their defeat furnishd them as i hinted before they hurried away to the utmost distance possible from the face of god their conqueror and then most dreaded enemy formerly their joy and glory  be this utmost removd distance where it will here certainly satan and all his gang of devils his numberless tho routed armies retired here milton might with some good ground have formd his pandemonium and have brought them in consulting what was next to be done and whether there was any room left to renew the war or to carry on the rebellion but had they been cast immediately into hell closed up there the bottomless pit lockd upon them and the key carried up to heaven to be kept there as mr milton himself in part confesses and the scripture affirms i say had this been so the devil himself could not have been so ignorant as to think of any future steps to be taken to retrieve his affairs and therefore a pandemonium or divan in hell to consult of it was ridiculous  all mr miltons scheme of satans future conduct and all the scripture expressions about the devil and his numerous attendants and of his actings since that time make it not reasonable to suggest that the devils were confind to their eternal prison at their expulsion out of heaven but that they were in a state of liberty to act tho limited in acting of which i shall also speak in its place     chap vii  of the number of satans host how they came first to know of the new      created worlds now in being and their measures with mankind upon      the discovery   several things have been suggested to set us a calculating the number of this frightful throng of devils who with satan the masterdevil was thus cast out of heaven i cannot say i am so much master of political arithmetick as to cast up the number of the beast no nor the number of the beasts or devils who make up this throng st francis they tell us or some other saint they do not say who askd the devil once how strong he was for st francis you must know was very familiar with him the devil it seems did not tell him but presently raised a great cloud of dust by the help i suppose of a gust of wind and bid that saint count it he was i suppose a calculator that would be calld grave who dividing satans troops into three lines cast up the number of the devils of all sorts in each battalia at ten hundred times a hundred thousand millions of the first line fifty millions of times as many in the second line and three hundred thousand times as many as both in the third line  the impertinence of this account would hardly have given it a place here only to hint that it has always been the opinion that satans name may well be calld a noun of multitude and that the devil and his angels are certainly no inconsiderable number it was a smart repartee that a venetian nobleman made to a priest who rallied him upon his refusing to give something to the church which the priest demanded for the delivering him from purgatory when the priest asking him if he knew what an innumerable number of devils there were to take him he answerd yes he knew how many devils there were in all how many says the priest his curiosity i suppose being raisd by the novelty of the answer why ten millions five hundred and eleven thousand six hundred and seventy five devils and a half says the nobleman a half says the priest pray what kind of a devil is that your self says the nobleman for you are half a devil already and will be a whole one when you come there for you are for deluding all you deal with and bringing us soul and body into your hands that you may be paid for letting us go again so much for their number  here also it would come in very aptly to consider the state of that long interval between the time of their expulsion from heaven and the creation of the world and what the posture of the devils affairs might be during that time the horror of their condition can only be conceivd of at a distance and especially by us who being embodied creatures cannot fully judge of what is or is not a punishment to seraphs and spirits but tis just to suppose they sufferd all that spirits of a seraphic nature were capable to sustain consistent with their existence notwithstanding which they retaind still the hellishness of their rebellious principles namely their hatred and rage against god and their envy at the felicity of his creatures  as to how long their time might be i shall leave that search no lights being given me that are either probable or rational and we have so little room to make a judgment of it that we may as well believe father m who supposes it to be a hundred thousand years as those who judge it one thousand years tis enough that we are sure it was before the creation how long before is not material to the devils history unless we had some records of what happend to him or was done by him in the interval  during the wandring condition the devil was in at that time we may suppose he and his whole clan to be employd in exerting their hatred and rage at the almighty and at the happiness of the remaining faithful angels by all the ways they had power to shew it  from this determind stated enmity of satan and his host against god and at every thing that brought glory to his name mr milton brings in satan when first he saw adam in paradise and the felicity of his station there swelling with rage and envy and taking up a dreadful resolution to ruin adam and all his posterity meerly to disappoint his maker of the glory of his creation i shall come to speak of that in its place  how satan in his remote situation got intelligence of the place where to find adam out or that any such thing as a man was created is matter of just speculation and there might be many rational schemes laid for it mr milton does not undertake to tell us the particulars nor indeed could he find room for it perhaps the devil having as i have said a liberty to range over the whole void or abyss which we want as well a name for as indeed powers to conceive of might have discovered that the almighty creator had formd a new and glorious work with infinite beauty and variety filling up the immense wast of space in which he the devil and his angels had rovd for so long a time without finding any thing to work on or to exert their apostate rage in against their maker  that at length they found the infinite untrodden space on a sudden spread full with glorious bodies shining in selfexisting beauty with a new and to them unknown lustre calld light they found these luminous bodies tho immense in bulk and infinite in number yet fixt in their wondrous stations regular and exact in their motions confind in their proper orbits tending to their particular centers and enjoying every one their peculiar systems within which was containd innumerable planets with their satellites or moons in which again a reciprocal influence motion and revolution conspired to form the most admirable uniformity of the whole  surprized to be sure with this sudden and yet glorious work of the almighty for the creation was enough with its lustre even to surprize the devils they might reasonably be supposed to start out of their dark retreat and with a curiosity not below the seraphic dignity for these are some of the things which the angels desire to look into to take a flight thro all the amazing systems of the fixd suns or stars which we see now but at a distance and only make astronomical guesses at  here the devil found not subject of wonder only but matter to swell his revolted spirit with more rage and to revive the malignity of his mind against his maker and especially against this new encrease of glory which to his infinite regret was extended over the whole wast and which he lookd upon as we say in human affairs as a pays conquis or if you will have it in the language of the devil as an invasion upon his kingdom  here it naturally occurd to them in their state of envy and rebellion that tho they could not assault the impregnable walls of heaven and could no more pretend to raise war in the place of blessedness and peace yet that perhaps they might find room in this new and however glorious yet inferior kingdom or creation to work some despite to their great creator or to affront his majesty in the person of some of his new made creatures and upon this they may be justly supposed to double their vigilance in the survey they resolve to take of these new worlds however great numberless and wonderful  what discoveries they may have made in the other and greater worlds than this earth we have not yet had an account possibly they are conversant with other parts of gods creation besides this little little globe which is but as a point in comparison of the rest and with other of gods creatures besides man who may according to the opinion of our philosophers inhabit those worlds but as no body knows that part but the devil we shall not trouble our selves with the enquiry  but tis very reasonable and indeed probable that the devils were more than ordinarily surprizd at the nature and reason of all this glorious creation after they had with the utmost curiosity viewd all the parts of it the glories of the several systems the immense spaces in which those glorious bodies that were created and made part of it were allowd respectively to move the innumerable fixd stars as so many suns in the center of so many distant solar systems the likewise innumerable dark opaque bodies receiving light and depending upon those suns respectively for such light and then reflecting that light again upon and for the use of one another to see the beauty and splendor of their forms the regularity of their position the order and exactness and yet inconceivable velocity of their motions the certainty of their revolutions and the variety and virtue of their influences and then which was even to the devils themselves most astonishing that after all the rest of their observations they should find this whole immense work was adapted for and made subservient to the use delight and blessing only of one poor species in itself small and in appearance contemptible the meanest of all the kinds supposed to inhabit so many glorious worlds as appeared now to be formd i mean that moon calld the earth and the creature calld man that all was made for him upheld by the wise creator on his account only and would necessarily end and cease whenever that species should end and be determind  that this creature was to be found no where but as above in one little individual moon a spot less than almost any of the moons which were in such great numbers to be found attendant upon and prescribd with in every system of the whole created heavens this was astonishing even to the devil himself nay the whole clan of devils could scarce entertain any just ideas of the thing till at last satan indefatigable in his search or enquiry into the nature and reason of this new work and particularly searching into the species of man whom he found god had thus placd in the little globe calld earth he soon came to an eclairicissement or a clear understanding of the whole for example       first he found this creature calld man was however mean and      small in his appearance a kind of a seraphic species that he was      made in the very image of god endowed with reasonable faculties to      know good and evil and possessd of a certain thing till then      unknown and unheard of even in hell it self that is in the      habitation of devils let that be where it would viz       2 that god had made him indeed of the lowest and coarsest      materials but that he had breathd into him the breath of life      and that he became a living thing calld soul being a kind of an      extraordinary heavenly and divine emanation and consequently that      man however mean and terrestrial his body might be was yet      heavenborn in his spirituous part compleatly seraphic and after      a space of life here determind to be a state of probation he      should be translated thro the regions of death into a life purely      and truly heavenly and which should remain so for ever being      capable of knowing and enjoying god his maker and standing in his      presence as the glorified angels do       3 that he had the most sublime faculties infused into him was      capable not only of knowing and contemplating god and which was      still more of enjoying him as above but which the devil now      was not capable of honouring and glorifying his maker who also      had condescended to accept of honour from him       4 and which was still more that being of an angelic nature tho      mixd with and confined for the present in a case of mortal flesh      he was intended to be removd from this earth after a certain time      of life here to inhabit that heaven and enjoy that very glory and      felicity from which satan and his angels had been expelld   when he found all this it presently occurd to him that god had done it all as an act of triumph over him satan and that these creatures were only created to people heaven depopulated or stript of its inhabitants by his expulsion and that these were all to be made angels in the devils stead  if this thought encreasd his fury and envy as far as rage of devils can be capable of being made greater it doubtless set him on work to give a vent to that rage and envy by searching into the nature and constitution of this creature calld man and to find out whether he was invulnerable and could by no means be hurt by the power of hell or deluded by his subtilty or whether he might be beguild and deluded and so instead of being preservd in holiness and purity wherein he was certainly created be brought to fall and rebell as he satan had done before him by which instead of being transplanted into a glorious state after this life in heaven as his maker had designd him to be to fill up the angelic choir and supply the place from whence he satan had fallen he might be made to fall also like him and in a word be made a devil like himself  this convinces us that the devil has not lost his natural powers by his fall and our learned commentator mr pool is of the same opinion tho he grants that the devil has lost his moral power or his power of doing good which he can never recover vide mr pool upon acts xix 17 where we may particularly observe when the man possessd with an evil spirit flew upon the seven sons of scæva the jew who would have exorcisd them in the name of jesus without the authority of jesus or without faith in him he flew on them and masterd them so that they fled out of the house from the devil conquered naked and wounded but of this power of the devil i shall speak by it self  in a word and to sum up all the devils story from his first expulsion it stands thus for so many years as were between his fall and the creation of man tho we have no memoirs of his particular affairs we have reason to believe he was without any manner of employment but a certain tormenting endeavour to be always expressing his rage and enmity against heaven i call it tormenting because ever disappointed every thought about it proving empty every attempt towards it abortive leaving him only light enough to see still more and more reason to despair of success and that this made his condition still more and more a hell than it was before  after a space of duration in this misery which we have no light given us to measure or judge of he at length discovered the new creation of man as above upon which he soon found matter to set himself to work upon and has been busily employd ever since  and now indeed there may be room to suggest a local hell and the confinement of souls made corrupt and degenerate by him to it as a place tho he himself as is still apparent by his actings is not yet confind to it of this hell its locality extent dimensions continuance and nature as it does not belong to satans history i have a good excuse for saying nothing and so put off my meddling with that which if i would meddle with i could say nothing of to the purpose     chap viii  of the power of the devil at the time of the creation of this world      whether it has not been farther straitnd and limited since that      time and what shifts and stratagems he is obliged to make use of to      compass his designs upon mankind   cunning men have fabled and tho it be without either religion authority or physical foundation it may be we may like it neer the worse for that that when god made the stars and all the heavenly luminaries the devil to mimick his maker and insult his new creation made comets in imitation of the fixd stars but that the composition of them being combustible when they came to wander in the abyss rolling by an irregular illgrounded motion they took fire in their approach to some of those great bodies of flame the fixd stars and being thus kindled like a firework unskilfully let off they then took wild and excentrick as also different motions of their own out of satans direction and beyond his power to regulate ever after  let this thought stand by it self it matters not to our purpose whether we believe any thing of it or no tis enough to our case that if satan had any such power then he has no such power now and that leads me to enquire into his more recent limitations  i am to suppose he and all his accomplices being confounded at the discovery of the new creation and racking their wits to find out the meaning of it had at last no matter how discoverd the whole system and concluded as i have said that the creature calld man was to be their successor in the heavenly mansions upon which i suggest that the first motion of hell was to destroy this new work and if possible to overwhelm it  but when they came to make the attempt they found their chains were not long enough and that they could not reach to the extremes of the system they had no power either to break the order or stop the motion dislocate the parts or confound the situation of things they traversed no doubt the whole work visited every star landed upon every solid and saild upon every fluid in the whole scheme to see what mischief they could do  upon a long and full survey they came to this point in their enquiry that in short they could do nothing by force that they could not displace any part annihilate any atom or destroy any life in the whole creation but that as omnipotence had created it so the same omnipotence had armd it at all points against the utmost power of hell had made the smallest creature in it invulnerable as to satan so that without the permission of the same power which had made heaven and conquerd the devil he could do nothing at all as to destroying any thing that god had made no not the little diminutive thing calld man who satan saw so much reason to hate as being created to succeed him in happiness in heaven  satan found him placed out of his power to hurt or out of his reach to touch and here by the way appears the second conquest of heaven over the devil that having placd his rival as it were just before his face and shewd the hateful sight to him he saw written upon his image touch him if you dare  it cannot be doubted but had it not been thus man is so far from being a match for the devil that one of satans least imps or angels could destroy all the race of them in the world ay world and all in a moment  as he is prince of the power of the air taking the air for the elementary world how easily could he at one blast sweep all the surface of the earth into the sea or drive weighty immense surges of the ocean over the whole plane of the earth and deluge the globe at once with a storm or how easily could he who by the situation of the empire must be supposed able to manage the clouds draw them up in such position as should naturally produce thunders and lightnings cause those lightnings to blast the earth dash in pieces all the buildings burn all the populous towns and cities and lay wast the world  at the same time he might command suited quantities of sublimated air to burst out of the bowels of the earth and overwhelm and swallow up in the opening chasms all the inhabitants of the globe  in a word satan left to himself as a devil and to the power which by virtue of his seraphic original he must be vested with was able to have made devilish work in the world if by a superior power he was not restraind  but there is no doubt at least to me but that with his fall from heaven as he lost the rectitude and glory of his angelic nature i mean his innocence so he lost the power too that he had before and that when he first commencd devil he received the chains of restraint too as the badge of his apostacy viz a general prohibition to do any thing to the prejudice of this creation or to act any thing by force or violence without special permission  this prohibition was not sent him by a messenger or by an order in writing or proclaimed from heaven by a law but satan by a strange invisible and unaccountable impression felt the restraint within him and at the same time that his moral capacity was not taken away yet his power of exerting that capacity felt the restraint and left him unable to do even what he was able to do at the same time  i make no question but the devil is sensible of this restraint that is to say not as it is a restraint only or as an effect of his expulsion from heaven but as it prevents his capital design against man who for the reason i have given already he entertains a mortal hatred of and would destroy with all his heart if he might and therefore like a chaind mastiff we find him oftentimes making a horrid hellish clamour and noise barking and howling and frighting the people letting them know that if he was loose he would tear them in pieces but at the same time his very fury shakes his chain which lets them know to their satisfaction he can only bark but cannot bite  some are of opinion that the devil is not restraind so much by the superior power of his sovereign and maker but that all his milder measures with man are the effect of a political scheme and done upon mature deliberation that it was resolved to act thus in the great council or pt of devils calld upon this very occasion when they first were informd of the creation of man and especially when they considered what kind of creature he was and what might probably be the reason of making him viz to fill up the vacancies in heaven i say that then the devils resolvd that it was not for their interest to fall upon him with fury and rage and so destroy the species for that this would be no benefit at all to them and would only cause another original man to be created for that they knew god could by the same omnipotence form as many new species of creatures as he pleased and if he thought fit create them in heaven too out of the reach of devils or evil spirits and that therefore to destroy man would no way answer their end  on the other hand examining strictly the mould of this new made creature and of what materials he was formd how mixt up of a nature convertible and pervertible capable indeed of infinite excellence and consequently of eternal felicity but subject likewise to corruption and degeneracy and consequently to eternal misery that instead of being fit to supply the places of satan and his rejected tribe the expelld angels in heaven and filling up the thrones or stalls in the celestial choir they might if they could but be brought into crime become a race of rebels and traytors like the rest and so come at last to keep them company as well in the place of eternal misery as in the merit of it and in a word become devils instead of angels  upon this discovery i say they found it infinitely more for the interest of satans infernal kingdom to go another way to work with mankind and see if it were possible by the strength of all their infernal wit and counsels to lay some snare for him and by some stratagem to bring him to eternal ruin and misery  this being then approvd as their only method and the devil shewd he was no fool in the choice he next resolvd that there was no time to be lost that it was to be set about immediately before the race was multiplied and by that means the work be not made greater only but perhaps the more difficult too accordingly the diligent devil went instantly about it agreeably to all the story of eve and the serpent as before the belief of which whether historically or allegorically is not at all obstructed by this hypothesis  i do not affirm that this was the case at first because being not present in that black divan at least not that i know of for who knows where he was or was not in his preexistent state i cannot be positive in the resolve that past there but except for some very little contradiction which we find in the sacred writings i should i confess incline to believe it historically and i shall speak of those things which i call contradictions to it more largely hereafter  in the mean time be it one way or other that is to say either that satan had no power to have proceeded with man by violence and to have destroyd him as soon as he was made or that he had the power but chose rather to proceed by other methods to deceive and debauch him i say be it which you please i am still of the opinion that it really was not the devils business to destroy the species that it would have been nothing to the purpose and no advantage at all to him if he had done it for that as above god could immediately have created another species to the same end whom he either could have made invulnerable and not subject to the devils power or removd him out of satans reach placd him out of the devils ken in heaven or some other place where the devil could not come to hurt him and that therefore it is infinitely more his advantage and more suited to his real design of defeating the end of mans creation to debauch him and make a devil of him that he may be rejected like himself and increase the infernal kingdom and company in the lake of misery in æternum  it may be true for ought i know that satan has not the power of destruction put into his hand and that he cannot take away the life of a man and it seems probable to be so from the story of satan and job when satan appeard among the sons of god as the text says job i 6 now when god gave such a character of job to him and askd him if he had considerd his servant job ver 8 why did not the devil go immediately and exert his malice against the good man at once to let his maker see what would become of his servant job in his distress on the contrary we see he only answers by shewing the reason of jobs good behaviour that it was but common gratitude for the blessing and protection he enjoyd ver 10 and pleading that if his estate was taken away and he was exposd as he satan was to be a beggar and a vagabond going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down therein he should be a very devil too like himself and curse god to his face  upon this the text says that god answered ver 11 behold all that he hath is in thy power now tis plain here that god gave up jobs wealth and estate nay his family and the lives of his children and servants into the devils power and accordingly like a true merciless devil as he is he destroyd them all he movd the sabeans to fall upon the oxen and the asses and carry them off he movd the chaldeans to fall upon the camels and the servants to carry off the first and murther the last he made lightning flash upon the poor sheep and kill them all and he blowd his house down upon his poor children and buried them all in the ruins  now here is 1 a specimen of satans good will to mankind and what havock the devil would make in the world if he might and here is a testimony too that he could not do this without leave so that i cannot but be of the opinion he has some limitations some bounds set to his natural fury a certain number of links in his chain which he cannot exceed or in a word that he cannot go a foot beyond his tether  the same kind of evidence we have in the gospel matth viii 31 where satan could not so much as possess the filthiest and meanest of all creatures the swine till he had askd leave and that still to shew his good will as soon as he had gotten leave he hurried them all into the sea and choakd them these i say are some of the reasons why i am not willing to say the devil is not restraind in power but on the other side we are told of so many mischievous things the devil has done in the world by virtue of his dominion over the elements and by other testimonies of his power that i dont know what to think of it tho upon the whole the first is the safest opinion for if we should believe the last we might for ought i know be brought like the american indians to worship him at last that he may do us no harm  and now i have namd those people in america i confess it would go a great way in favour of satans generosity as well as in testimony of his power if we might believe all the accounts which indeed authors are pretty well agreed in the truth of namely of the mischiefs the devil does in those countries where his dominion seems to be establishd how he uses them when they deny him the homage he claims of them as his due what havock and combustion he makes among them and how beneficent he is or at least negative in his mischiefs when they appease him by their hellish sacrifices  likewise we see a test of his wicked subtilty in his management of those dark nations when he was more immediately worshipd by them namely the making them believe that all their good weather rains dews and kind influences upon the earth to make it fruitful was from him whereas they really were the common blessings of a higher hand and came not from him the devil but from him that made the devil and made him a devil or fallen angel by his curse  but to go back to the method the devil took with the first of mankind tis plain the policy of hell was right tho the execution of the resolves they took did not fully answer their end neither for satan fastening upon poor proud ridiculous mother eve as i have said before made presently a true judgment of her capacities and of her temper took her by the right handle and soothing her vanity which is to this day the softest place in the head of all the sex wheedld her out of her senses by praising her beauty and promising to make her a goddess  the foolish woman yielded presently and that we are told is the reason why the same method so strangely takes with all her posterity viz that you are sure to prevail with them if you can but once persuade them that you believe they are witty and handsome for the devil you may observe never quits any hold he gets and having once found a way into the heart always takes care to keep the door open that any of his agents may enter after him without any more difficulty hence the same argument especially the last has so bewitching an influence on the sex that they rarely deny you any thing after they are but weak enough and vain enough to accept of the praises you offer them on that head on the other hand you are sure they never forgive you the unpardonable crime of saying they are ugly or disagreeable it is suggested that the first method the devil took to insinuate all those fine things into eves giddy head was by creeping close to her one night when she was asleep and laying his mouth to her ear whispering all the fine things to her which he knew would set her fancy a tiptoe and so made her receive them involuntarily into her mind knowing well enough that when she had formd such ideas in her soul however they came there she would never be quiet till she had workd them up to some extraordinary thing or other  it was evident what the devil aimd at namely that she should break in upon the command of god and so having corrupted her self bring the curse upon her self and all her race as god had threatnd but why the pride of eve should be so easily tickled by the motion of her exquisite beauty when there then was no prospect of the use or want of those charms that indeed makes a kind of difficulty here which the learnd have not determined for       1 if she had been as ugly as the devil she had no body to rival      her so that she need not fear adam should leave her and get      another mistress       2 if she had been bright and beautiful as an angel she had no      other admirer but poor adam and he could have no room to be      jealous of her or afraid she should cuckold him so that in short      eve had no such occasion for her beauty nor could she make any      use of it either to a bad purpose or to a good and therefore i      believe the devil who is too cunning to do any thing that      signifies nothing rather tempted her by the hope of encreasing her      wit than her beauty   but to come back to the method of satans tempting her viz by whispering to her in her sleep twas a cunning trick thats the truth of it and by that means he certainly set her head a madding after deism and to be made a goddess and then backd it by the subtle talk he had with her afterward  i am the more particular upon this part because however the devil may have been the first that ever practised it yet i can assure him the experiment has been tried upon many a woman since to the wheedling her out of her modesty as well as her simplicity and the cunning men tell us still that if you can come at a woman when she is in a deep sleep and whisper to her close to her ear she will certainly dream of the thing you say to her and so will a man too  well be this so to her race or not it was it seems so to her for she wakd with her head filld with pleasing ideas and as some will have it unlawful desires such as to be sure she never had entertaind before these are supposed to be fatally infused in her dream and suggested to her waking soul when the organ ear which conveyd them was dozd and insensible strange fate of sleeping in paradise that whereas we have notice but of two sleeps there that in one a woman should go out of him and in the other the devil should come into her  certainly when satan first made the attempt upon eve he did not think he should have so easily conquered her or have brought his business about so soon the devil himself could not have imagined she should have been so soon brought to forget the command given or at least who gave it and have venturd to transgress against him and made her forget that god had told her it should be death to her to touch it and above all that she should aspire to be as wise as him who was so ignorant before as to believe it was for fear of her being like himself that he had forbid it her  well might she be said to be the weaker vessel tho adam himself had little enough to say for his being the stronger of the two when he was overpersuaded if it were done by persuasion by his wife to do the same thing  and mark how wise they were after they had eaten and what fools they both acted like even to one another nay even all the knowledge they attaind to by it was for ought i see only to know that they were fools and to be sensible both of sin and shame and see how simply they acted i say upon their having committed the crime and being detected in it      view them to day conversing with their god   his image both enjoyd and understood   to morrow skulking with a sordid flight                  among the bushes from the infinite                       as if that power was blind which gave them sight      with senseless labour tagging figleaf vests   to hide their bodies from the sight of beasts     hark how the fool pleads faint for forfeit life   first he reproaches heaven and then his wife   the woman which thou gavst as if the gift   could rob him of the little reason left   a weak pretence to shift his early crime   as if accusing her would excuse him   but thus encroaching crime dethrones the sense   and intercepts the heavenly influence   debauches reason makes the man a fool   and turns his active light to ridicule   it must be confessd that it was unaccountable degeneracy even of their common reasoning which adam and eve both fell into upon the first committing the offence of taking the forbidden fruit if that was their being made as gods it made but a poor appearance in its first coming to hide their nakedness when there was no body to see them and cover themselves among the bushes from their maker but thus it was and this the devil had brought them to and well might he and all the clan of hell as mr milton brings them in laugh and triumph over the man after the blow was given as having so egregiously abused and deluded them both  but here to be sure began the devils new kingdom as he had now seducd the two first creatures he was pretty sure of success upon all the race and therefore prepard to attack them also as soon as they came on nor was their encreasing multitude any discouragement to his attempt but just the contrary for he had agents enough to employ if every man and woman that should be born was to want a devil to wait upon them separately and singly to seduce them whereas some whole nations have been such willing subjects to him that one of his seraphic imps may for ought we know have been enough to guide a whole country the people being entirely subjected to his government for many ages as in america for example where some will have it that he conveyd the first inhabitants at least if he did not we dont well know who did or how they got thither  and how came all the communication to be so entirely cut off between the nations of europe and africa from whence america must certainly have been peopld or else the devil must have done it indeed i say how came the communication to be so entirely cut off between them that except the time whenever it was that people did at first reach from one to the other none ever came back to give their friends any account of their success or invite them to follow nor did they hear of one another afterwards as we have reason to think did satan politically keep them thus asunder lest news from heaven should reach them and so they should be recoverd out of his government we cannot tell how to give any other rational account of it that a nation nay a quarter of the world or as some will have it be half the globe should be peopled from europe or africa or both and no body ever go after them or come back from them in above three thousand years after  nay that those countries should be peopled when there was no navigation in use in these parts of the world no ships made that could carry provisions enough to support the people that faild in them but that they must have been starved to death before they could reach the shore of america the ferry from europe or africa in any part which we have known navigation to be practised in being at least 1000 miles and in most places much more  but as to the americans let the devil and they alone to account for their coming thither this we are certain of that we knew nothing of them for many hundred years and when we did when the discovery was made they that went from hence found satan in a full and quiet possession of them ruling them with an arbitrary government particular to himself he had led them into a blind subjection to himself nay i might call it devotion for it was all of religion that was to be found among them worshipping horrible idols in his name to whom he directed human sacrifices continually to be made till he deluged the country with blood and ripend them up for the destruction that followd from the invasion of the spaniards who he knew would hurry them all out of the world as fast as he the devil himself could desire of them  but to go back a little to the original of things it is evident that satan has made a much better market of mankind by thus subtilly attacking them and bringing them to break with their maker as he had done before them than he could have done by fulminating upon them at first and sending them all out of the world at once for now he has peopled his own dominions with them and tho a remnant are snatchd as it were out of his clutches by the agency of invincible grace of which i am not to discourse in this place yet this may be said of the devil without offence that he has in some sense carried his point and as it were forcd his maker to be satisfied with a part of mankind and the least part too instead of the great glory he would have brought to himself by keeping them all in his service  mr milton as i have noted above brings in the devil and all hell with him making a feu de joye for the victory satan obtaind over one silly woman indeed it was a piece of success greater in its consequence than in the immediate appearance nor was the conquest so compleat as satan himself imagind to make since the promise of a redemption out of his hands which was immediately made to the man in behalf of himself and his believing posterity was a great disappointment to satan and as it were snatchd the best part of his victory out of his hands  it is certain the devils knew what the meaning of that promise was and who was to be the seed of the woman namely the incarnate son of god and that it was a second blow to the whole infernal body but as if they had resolved to let that alone satan went on with his business and as he had introducd crime into the common parent of mankind and thereby secured the contamination of blood and the descent or propagation of the corrupt seed he had nothing to do but to assist nature in time to come to carry on its own rebellion and act it self in the breasts of eves tainted posterity and that indeed has been the devils business ever since his first victory upon the kind to this day  his success in this part has been such that we see upon innumerable occasions a general defection has followd a kind of a taint upon nature call it what you will a blast upon the race of mankind and were it not for one thing he had ruined the whole family i say were it not for one thing namely a selected company or number which his maker has resolvd he shall not be able to corrupt or if he does the sending the promisd seed shall recover back again from him by the power of irresistible grace which number thus selected or elected call it which we will are still to supply the vacancies in heaven which satans defection left open and what was before filld up with created seraphs is now to be restord by recoverd saints by whom infinite glory is to accrue to the kingdom of the redeemer  this glorious establishment has robbd satan of all the joy of his victory and left him just where he was defeated and disappointed nor does the possession of all the myriads of the sons of perdition who yet some are of the opinion will be snatchd from him too at last i say the possession of all these makes no amends to him for he is such a devil in his nature that the envy at those he cannot seduce eats out all the satisfaction of the mischief he has done in seducing all the rest but i must not preach so i return to things as much needful to know tho less solemn     chap ix  of the progress of satan in carrying on his conquest over mankind from      the fall of eve to the deluge   i doubt if the devil was askd the question plainly he would confess that after he had conquerd eve by his own wicked contrivance and then by her assistance had brought adam too like a fool as he was into the same gulph of misery he thought he had done his work compassed the whole race that they were now his own and that he had put an end to the grand design of their creation namely of peopling heaven with a new angelic race of souls who when glorifyd should make up the defection of the host of hell that had been expungd by their crime in a word that he had gotten a better conquest than if he had destroyd them all  but in the midst of his conquest he found a check put to the advantages he expected to reap from his victory by the immediate promise of grace to a part of the posterity of adam who notwithstanding the fall were to be purchased by the messiah and snatchd out of his satans hands and over whom he could make no final conquest so that his power met with a new limitation and that such as indeed fully disappointed him in the main thing he aimd at viz preventing the beatitudes of mankind which were thus securd and what if the numbers of mankind were upon this account encreased in such a manner that the selected number should by length of time amount to just as many as the whole race had they not fallen would have amounted to in all and thus indeed the world may be said to be upheld and continued for the sake of those few since till their number can be compleated the creation cannot fall any more than that without them or but for them it would not have stood  but leaving this speculation and not having enquird of satan what he has to say on that subject let us go back to the antediluvian world the devil to be sure gaind his point upon eve and in her upon all her race he drew her into sin got her turnd out of paradise and the man with her the next thing was to go to work with her posterity and particularly with her two sons cain and abel  adam having notwithstanding his fall repented very sincerely of his sin receivd the promise of redemption and pardon with an humble but believing heart charity bids us suppose that he led a very religious and sober life ever after and especially in the first part of his time that he brought up his children very soberly and gave them all the necessary advantages of a religious education and a good introduction into the world that he was capable of and that eve likewise assisted to both in her place and degree  their two eldest sons cain and abel the one heir apparent to the patriarchal empire and the other heir presumptive i suppose also lived very sober and religious lives and as the principles of natural religion dictated a homage and subjection due to the almighty maker as an acknowledgment of his mercies and a recognition of their obedience so the receivd usage of religion dictating at that time that this homage was to be paid by a sacrifice they either of them brought a freewilloffering to be dedicated to god respectively for themselves and families  how it was and for what reason that god had respect to the offering of abel which the learnd say was a lamb of the firstlings of the flock and did not give any testimony of the like respect to cain and his offering which was of the first fruits of the earth the offerings being equally suited to the respective employment of the men that is not my present business but this we find made heartburnings and raised envy and jealousy in the mind of cain and at that door the devil immediately entred for he who from the beginning was very diligent in his way never slipd any opportunity or missd any advantages that the circumstances of mankind offered him to do mischief  what shape or appearance the devil took up to enter into a conversation with cain upon the subject that authors do not take upon them to determine but tis generally supposed he personated some of cains sons or grandsons to begin the discourse who attackd their father or perhaps grandfather upon this occasion in the following manner or to that purpose                                       d sir i perceive your majesty for the first race were certainly all monarchs as great as kings to their immediate posterity to be greatly disturbd of late your countenance is changd your noble chearfulness the glories of your face are strangely sunk and gone and you are not the man you used to be please your majesty to communicate your griefs to us your children you may be sure that if it be possible we would procure you relief and restore your delights the loss of which if thus you go on to subject yourself to too much melancholy will be very hurtful to you and in the end destroy you  cain it is very kind my dear children to shew your respect thus to your true progenitor and to offer your assistance i confess as you say my mind is oppressd and displeased but tho tis very heavy yet i know not which way to look for relief for the distemper is above our reach no cure can be found for it on earth  d do not say so sir there can be no disease sure on earth but may be curd on earth if it be a mental evil we have heard that your great ancestor the first father of us all who lives still on the great western plains towards the sea is the oracle to which all his children fly for direction in such cases as are out of the reach of the ordinary understanding of mankind please you to give leave we will take a journey to him and representing your case to him we will hear his advice and bring it to you with all speed for the ease of your mind  cain i know not whether he can reach my case or no  d doubtless he may and if not the labour of our journey is nothing when placd in competition with the ease of your mind tis but a few days travel lost and you will not be the worse if we fail of the desired success  cain the offer is filial and i accept your affectionate concern for me with a just sense of an obligd parent go then and my blessing be upon you but alas why do i bless can he bless whom god has not blessd  d o sir do not say so has not god blessd you are you not the second sovereign of the earth and does he not converse with you face to face are not you the oracle to all your growing posterity and next after his sovereign imperial majesty lord adam patriarch of the world  cain but has not god rejected me and refused to converse any more with me while he daily favours and countenances my younger brother abel as if he resolvd to set him up to rule over me  d no sir that cannot be you cannot be disturbd at such a thing is not the right of sovereignty yours by primogeniture can god himself take that away when tis once given are not you lord adams eldest son are you not the firstborn glory of the creation and does not the government descend to you by the divine right of birth and blood  cain but what does all that signify to me while god appears to favour and caress my younger brother and to shine upon him while a black dejection and token of displeasure surrounds me every day and he does not appear to me as he used to do  d and what need your majesty be concernd at that if it be so if he does not appear pleased you have the whole world to enjoy your self in and all your numerous and rising posterity adore and honour you what need those remote things be any disturbance to you  cain how my children not the favour of god be valued yes yes in his favour is life what can all the world avail without the smiles and countenance of him that made it  d doubtless sir he that made the world and placd you at the head of it all to govern and direct it has made it agreeable and it is able to give you a full satisfaction and enjoyment if you please to consider it well tho you were never to converse with him all the while you live int  cain you are quite wrong there my children quite wrong  d but do you not great sir see all your children as well as us rejoicing in the plenty of all things and are they not compleatly happy and yet they know little of this great god he seldom converses among us we hear of him indeed by your sage advices and we bring our offerings to you for him as you direct and when thats done we enjoy whatever our hearts desire and so doubtless may you in an abundant manner if you please  cain but your felicity is wrong placd then or you suppose that god is pleased and satisfied in that your offerings are brought to me but what would you say if you knew that god is displeased that he does not accept your offerings that when i sacrificd to him in behalf of you all he rejected my offerings tho i brought a princely gift being of the finest of the wheat the choicest and earliest fruits and the sweetest of the oil an offering suited to the giver of them all  d but if you offered them sir how are you sure they were not accepted  cain yes yes i am sure did not my brother abel offer at the same time a lamb of his flock for he you know delights in cattle and covers the mountains with his herds over him all the while he was sacrificing a bright emanation shone chearing and enlivening a pledge of favour and light ambient flames playd hovering in the lower air as if attending his sacrifice and when ready prepard immediately descended and burnt up the flesh a sweet odoriferous savour ascending to him who thus testified his acceptance whereas over my head a black cloud misty and distilling vapour hung dripping upon the humble altar i had raised and wetting the finest and choicest things i had prepard spoild and defacd them the wood unapt to burn by the moisture which fell scarce receivd the fire i brought to kindle it and even then rather smotherd and choaked than kindled into a flame in a word it went quite out without consuming what was brought to be offerd up  d let not our truly reverencd lord and father be disquieted at all this if he accepts not what you bring you are dischargd of the debt and need bring no more nor have the trouble of such labourd collections of rarities any more when he thinks fit to require it again you will have notice no question and then it being calld for will be accepted or else why should it be requird  cain that may indeed be the case nor do i think of attempting any more to bring an offering for i rather take it that i am forbidden for the present but then what is it that my younger brother triumphs in and how am i insulted in that he and his house are all joy and triumph as if they had some great advantage over me in that their offering was accepted when mine was not  d does he triumph over your majesty our lord and sovereign give us but your order and we will go and pull him and all his generation in pieces for to triumph over you who are his elder brother is a horrid rebellion and treason and he ought to be expelld the society of mankind  cain i think so too indeed however my dear children and faithful subjects tho i accept your offer of duty and service yet i will consider very well before i take up arms against my brother besides our sovereign father and patriarchal lord adam being yet alive it is not in my right to act offensively without his command  d we are ready therefore to carry your petition to him and doubt not to obtain his licence and commission too to empower you to do your self justice upon your younger brother who being your vassal or at least inferior as he is junior in birth insults you upon the fancied opinion of having a larger share in the divine favour and receiving a blessing on his sacrifices on pretence of the same favour being denied you  cain i am content go then and give a just account of the state of our affairs  d we shall soon return with the agreeable answer let not our lord and father continue sad and dejected but depend upon a speedy relief by the assistance of thy numerous issue all devoted to thy interest and felicity  cain my blessing be with you in your way and give you a favourable reception at the venerable tent of our universal lord and father                                       note here the cursed race being fully given up to the direction of the evilspirit which so early possessd them and swelling with rage at the innocent abel and his whole family they resolved upon forming a most wicked and detestable lie to bring about the advice which they had already given their father cain a touch of and to pretend that adam being justly provokd at the undutiful behaviour of abel had given cain a commission to chastise him and by force to cut him off and all his family as guilty of rebellion and pride  filld with this mischievous and bloody resolution they came back to their father cain after staying a few days such as were sufficient to make cain believe they had been at the spacious plains where adam dwelt the same which are now calld the blessed valleys or the plains of mecca in arabia fælix near the banks of the redsea  note here also that cain having received a wicked hint from these men his children and subjects as before intimating that abel had broken the laws of primogeniture in his behaviour towards him cain and that he might be justly punishd for it satan that cunning manager of all our wayward passions fand the fire of envy and jealousy with his utmost skill all the while his other agents were absent and by the time they came back had blown it up into such a heat of fury and rage that it wanted nothing but air to make it burn out as it soon afterwards did in a furious flame of wrath and revenge even to blood and destruction  just in the very critical moment while things stood thus with cain satan brings in his wicked instruments as if just arrivd with the return of his message from adam at whose court they had been for orders and thus they that is the devil assuming to speak by them approach their father with an air of solemn but chearful satisfaction at the success of their embassy                                       d hail sovereign reverend patriarchal lord we come with joy to render thee an account of the success of our message  cain have you then seen the venerable tents where dwell the heavenborn the angelic pair to whom all human reverence highly due is and ought always to be humbly paid  d we have  cain did you together with my grand request a just a humble homage for me pay to the great sire and mother of mankind  d we did  cain did you in humble language represent the griefs and anguish which oppress my soul  d we did and back their blessing to thee bring  cain i hope with humblest signs of filial duty you took it for me on your bending knees  d we did and had our share the patriarch lifting his hands to heaven expressd his joy to see his spreading race and blessd us all  cain did you my solemn message too deliver my injuries impartially lay down and due assistance and direction crave  d we did  cain what spoke the oracle hes god to me what just command dye bring whats to be done am i to bear the insulting juniors rage and meekly suffer what unjustly he affronting primogeniture and laws of god and man imposes by his pride unsufferable am i to be crushd and be no more the firstborn son on earth but bow and kneel to him  d forbid it heaven as adam too forbids who with a justice godlike and peculiar to injurd parents abels pride resents and gives his high command to thee to punish  cain to punish say you did he use the word the very word am i commissiond then to punish abel  d not abel only but his rebel race as they alike in crime alike are joind in punishment  cain the race indeed have shard the merit with him how did they all insult and with a shout of triumph mock my sorrow when they saw me from my sacrifice dejected come as if my disappointment was their joy  d this too the venerable prince resents and to preserve the race in bounds of laws subordinate and limited to duty commands that this first breach be not passd by lest the precedent upon record stand to future times to encourage like rebellion  cain and is it then my sovereign parents will  d it is his will that thou his eldest son his image his belovd should be maintaind in all the rights of sovereignty derivd to thee from him and not be left exposd to injury and power usurped but should do thy self justice on the rebel race  cain and so i will abel shall quickly know what tis to trample on his elder brother shall know that hes thus sentencd by his father and im commissiond but to execute his high command his sentence which is gods and that he falls by the hand of heavenly justice                                       so now satan had done his work he had deluded the mother to a breach against the first and only command he had drawn adam to the same snare and now he brings in cain prompted by his own rage and deluded by his satans craft to commit murder nay a fratricide an aggravated murther  upon this he sends out cain while the bloody rage was in its ferment and wickedly at the same time bringing abel innocent and fearing no ill just in his way he suggests to his thoughts such words as these  look you cain see how divine justice concurs with your fathers righteous sentence see theres thy brother abel directed by heaven to fall into thy hands unarmd unguarded that thou mayst do thy self justice upon him without fear see thou mayst kill him and if thou hast a mind to conceal it no eyes can see or will the world ever know it so that no resentment or revenge upon thee or thy posterity can be apprehended but it may be said some wild beast had rent him nor will any one suggest that thou his brother and superior could possibly be the person  cain prepard for the fact by his former avowd rage and resolution of revenge was so much the less prepard to avoid the snare thus artfully contrivd by the master of all subtilty the devil so he immediately runs upon his brother abel and after a little unarmd resistance the innocent poor man expecting no such mischief was conquerd and murtherd after which as is to be supposed the exasperated crew of cains outrageous race overrun all his family and houshold killing man woman and child  it is objected here that we have no authority in scripture to prove this part of the story but i answer tis not likely but that abel as well as cain being at mans estate long before this had several children by their own sisters for they were the only men in the world who were allowd the marrying their own sisters there being no other women then in the world and as we never read of any of abels posterity tis likewise as probable they were all murtherd as that they should kill abel only whose sons might immediately fall upon cain for the blood of their father and so the world have been involvd in a civil war as soon as there were two families in it  but be it so or not tis not doubted the devil wrought with cain in the horrid murther or he had never done it whether it was directly or by agents is not material nor is the latter unlikely and if the latter then there is no improbability in the story for why might not he that made use of the serpent to tempt eve be as well supposed to make a tool of some of cains sons or grandsons to prompt him in the wicked attempt of murthering his brother and why must we be obligd to bring in a miracle or an apparition into the story to make it probable that the devil had any hand in it when twas so natural to a degenerate race to act in such a manner  however it was and by whatever tool the devil wrought tis certain that this was the consequence poor abel was butcherd and thus the devil made a second conquest in gods creation for adam was now as may be said really childless for his two sons were thus far lost abel was killed and cain was curst and driven out from the presence of the lord and his race blasted with him  it would be a useful enquiry here and worthy our giving an account of could we come to a certainty in it namely what was the mark that god set upon cain by which he was kept from being fallen upon by abels friends or relations but as this does not belong to the devils history and it was gods mark not the devils i have nothing to do with it here  the devil had now gaind his point the kingdom of grace so newly erected had been as it were extinct without a new creation had not adam and eve been alive and had not eve tho now 130 years of age been a breeding young lady for we must suppose the woman in that state of longevity bare children till they were seven or eight hundred year old this teeming of eve peopled not the world so much as it restored the blessed race for tho abel was killd cain had a numerous offspring presently which had seth adams third son never been born would soon have replenishd the world with people such as they were the seed of a murtherer cursed of god branded with a mark of infamy and who afterwards fell all together in the universal ruine of the race by the deluge  but after the murther of abel adam had another son born namely seth the father of enos and indeed the father of the holy race for during his time and his son enos the text says that men began to call on the name of the lord that is to say they began to look back upon cain and his wicked race and being convincd of the wickedness they had committed and led their whole posterity into they began to sue to heaven for pardon of what was past and to lead a new sort of life  but the devil had met with too much success in his first attempts not to go on with his general resolution of debauching the minds of men and bringing them off from god and therefore as he kept his hold upon cains cursed race embroild already in blood and murther so he proceeded with his degenerate offspring till in a word he brought both the holy seed and the degenerate race to joyn in one universal consent of crime and to go on in it with such aggravating circumstances as that it repented the lord that he had made man and he resolvd to overwhelm them again with a general destruction and clear the world of them  the succession of blood in the royal original line of adam is preservd in the sacred histories and brought down as low as noah and his three sons for a continud series of 1450 years say some 1640 say others in which time sin spread it self so generally thro the whole race and the sons of god so the scripture calls the men of the righteous seed the progeny of seth came in unto the daughters of men that is joind themselves to the cursd race of cain and married promiscuously with them according to their fancies the women it seems being beautiful and tempting and tho the devil could not make the women handsome or ugly in one or other families yet he might work up the gust of wicked inclination on either side so as to make both the men and women tempting and agreeable to one another where they ought not to have been so and perhaps as it is often seen to this day the more tempting for being under legal restraint  it is objected here that we do not find in the scripture that the men and women of either race were at that time forbidden intermarrying with one another and it is true that literally it is not forbid but if we did not search rather to make doubts than to explain them we might suppose it was forbidden by some particular command at that time seeing we may reasonably allow every thing to be forbidden which they are taxd with a crime in committing and as the sons of god taking them wives as they thought fit to choose tho from among the daughters of the cursed race is there chargd upon them as a general depravation and a great crime and for which tis said god even repented that he had made them we need go no farther to satisfy our selves that it was certainly forbidden  satan no doubt too had a hand in this wickedness for as it was his business to prompt men to do every thing which god had prohibited so the reason given why the men of those days did this thing was they saw the daughters of men that is of the wicked race or forbidden sort were fair he tempted them by the lust of the eye in a word the ladies were beautiful and agreeable and the devil knew how to make use of the allurement the men liked and took them by the meer direction of their fancy and appetite without regarding the supreme prohibition they took them wives of all which they chose or such as they likd to choose  but the text adds that this promiscuous generation went farther than the meer outward crime of it for it shewd that the wickedness of the heart of man was great before god and that he resented it in short god perceived a degeneracy or defect of virtue had seizd upon the whole race that there was a general corruption of manners a depravity of nature upon them that even the holy seed was tainted with it that the devil had broken in upon them and prevaild to a great degree that not only the practice of the age was corrupt for that god could easily have restraind but that the very heart of man was debauchd his desires wholly vitiated and his senses engagd in it so that in a word it became necessary to shew the divine displeasure not in the ordinary manner by judgment and reproofs of such kind as usually reclaim men but by a general destruction to sweep them away clear the earth of them and put an end to the wickedness at once removing the offence and the offenders all together this is signifyd at large gen vi 5 god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and again ver 11 12 the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filld with violence and god lookd upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth  it must be confessd it was a strange conquest the devil had made in the antediluvian world that he had as i may say brought the whole race of mankind into a general revolt from god noah was indeed a preacher of righteousness and he had preachd about 500 years to as little purpose as most of the good ministers ever did for we do not read there was one man converted by him or at least not one of them left for that at the deluge there was either none of them alive or none spard but noah and his three sons and their wives and even they are tis evident recorded not so much to be savd for their own goodness but because they were his sons nay without breach of charity we may conclude that at least one went to the devil even of those three namely ham or cham for triumphing in a brutal manner over his fathers drunkenness for we find the special curse reachd to him and his posterity for many ages and whether it went no farther than the present state of life with them we cannot tell  we will suppose now that thro this whole 1500 years the devil having so effectually debauchd mankind had advancd his infernal kingdom to a prodigious height for the text says the whole earth was filld with violence in a word blood murder rape robbery oppression and injustice prevaild every where and man like the wild bear in the forest livd by prey biting and devouring one another  at this time noah begins to preach a new doctrine to them for as he had before been a preacher of righteousness now he becomes a preacher of vengeance first he tells them they shall be all overwhelmd with a deluge that for their sins god repented they were made and that he would destroy them all adding that to prevent the ruin of himself and family he resolvd to build him a ship to have recourse to when the water should come over the rest of the world  what jesting what scorn what contempt did this work expose the good old man to for above a 100 years for so long the work was building as antient authors say let us represent to our selves in the most lively manner how the witty world at that time behavd to poor old noah how they took their evening walks to see what he was doing and passed their judgment upon it and upon the progress of it i say to represent this to our selves we need go no farther than to our own witicisms upon religion and upon the most solemn mysteries of divine worship how we damn the serious for enthusiasts think the grave mad and the sober melancholy call religion it self flatus and hyppo make the devout ignorant the divine mercenary and the whole scheme of divinity a frame of priestcraft and thus no doubt the building an ark or boat or whatever they calld it to float over the mountains and dance over the plains what could it be but a religious frenzy and the man that so busied himself a lunatick and all this in an age when divine things came by immediate revelation into the minds of men the devil must therefore have made a strange conquest upon mankind to obliterate all the reverence which but a little before was so strangely impressd upon them concerning their maker  this was certainly the height of the devils kingdom and we shall never find him arrive to such a pitch again he was then truly and literally the universal monarch nay the god of this world and as all tyrants do he governs them with an arbitrary absolute sway and had not god thought fit to give him a writ of ejectment and afterwards drown him out of possession i know not what would have been the case he might have kept his hold for ought i know till the seed of the woman came to bruise his head that is to say cripple his government dethrone him and depose his power as has been fulfilld in the messiah  but as he was i say drownd out of the world his kingdom for the present was at an end at least if he had a dominion he had no subjects and as the creation was in a manner renewed so the devil had all his work to do over again unhappy man how has he by his weak resistance made the devil recovering his hold too easy to him and given him all the advantages except as before excepted which he had before now whether he retired in the mean time and how he got footing again after noah and his family were landed upon the new surface that we come next to enquire     chap x  of the devils second kingdom and how he got footing in the renewd      world by his victory over noah and his race   the story of noah his building the ark his embarking himself and all natures stock for a new world on board it the long voyage they took and the bad weather they met with tho it would embellish this work very well and come in very much to the purpose in this place yet as it does not belong to the devils story for i cannot prove what some suggest viz that he was in the ark among the rest i say for that reason i must omit it  and now having mentiond satans being in the ark as i say i cannot prove it so there are i think some good reasons to believe he was not there first i know no business he had there secondly we read of no mischief done there and these joynd together make me conclude he was absent the last i chiefly insist upon that we read of no mischief done there which if he had been in the ark would certainly have happend and therefore i suppose rather that when he saw his kingdom dissolvd his subjects all ingulphd in an inevitable ruin and desolation a sight suitable enough to him except as it might unking him for a time i say when he saw this he took care to speed himself away as well as he could and make his retreat to a place of safety where that was is no more difficult to us than it was to him  it is suggested that as he is prince of the power of the air he retired only into that region it is most rational to suppose he went no further on many accounts of which i shall speak by and by here he stayd hovering in the earths atmosphere as he has often done since and perhaps now does or if the atmosphere of this globe was affected by the indraft of the absorption as some think then he kept himself upon the watch to see what the event of the new phænomenon would be and this watch wherever it was i doubt not was as near the earth as he could place himself perhaps in the atmosphere of the moon or in a word the next place of retreat he could find  from hence i took upon me to insist that satan has not a more certain knowledge of events than we i say he has not a more certain knowledge that he may be able to make stronger conjectures and more rational conclusions from that he sees i will not deny and that which he most outdoes us in is that he sees more to conclude from than we can but i am satisfied he knows nothing of futurity more than we can see by observation and inference nor for example did he know whether god would repeople the world any more or no  i must therefore allow that he only waited to see what would be the event of this strange eruption of water and what god proposd to do with the ark and all that was in it  some philosophers tell us besides what i hinted above that the devil could have no retreat in the earths atmosphere for that the air being wholly condensd into water and having continually pourd down its streams to deluge the earth that body was become so small and had sufferd such convulsions that there was but just enough air left to surround the water or as might serve by its pressure to preserve the natural position of things and supply the creatures in the ark with a part to breath in  the atmosphere indeed might suffer some strange and unnatural motions at that time but not i believe to that degree however i will not affirm that there could be room in it or is now for the devil much less for all the numberless legions of satans host but there was and now certainly is sufficient space to receive him and a sufficient body of his troops for the business he had for them at that time and thats enough to the purpose or if the earths atmosphere did suffer any particular convulsion on that occasion he might make his retreat to the atmosphere of the moon or of mars or of venus or of any of the other planets or to any other place for he that is prince of the air could not want retreats in such a case from whence he might watch for the issue of things certainly he did not go far because his business lay here and he never goes out of his way of doing mischief  in particular his more than ordinary concern was to see what would become of the ark he was wise enough doubtless to see that god who had directed its making nay even the very structure of it would certainly take care of it preserve it upon the water and bring it to some place of safety or other tho where it should be the devil with all his cunning could not resolve whether on the same surface the waters drawing off or in any other created or to be created place and this state of uncertainty being evidently his case and which proves his ignorance of futurity it was his business i say to watch with the utmost vigilance for the event  if the ark was as mr burnet thinks guided by two angels they not only held it from foundering or being swallowd up in the water but certainly kept the waters calm about it especially when the lord brought a strong wind to blow over the whole globe which by the way was the first and i suppose the only universal storm that ever blew for to be sure it blew over the whole surface at once i say if it was thus guided to be sure the devil saw it and that with envy and regret that he could do it no injury for doubtless had it been in the devils power as god had drownd the whole race of man except what was in the ark he would have taken care to have dispatchd them too and so made an end of the creation at once but either he was not empowerd to go to the ark or it was so well guarded by angels that when he came near it he could do it no harm so it rested at length the waters abating on the mountains of arrarat in armenia or some where else that way and where they say a piece of the keel is remaining to this day of which however with dr  i say i believe not one word  the ark being safe landed tis reasonable to believe noah prepared to go on shore as the seamen call it as soon as the dry land began to appear and here you must allow me to suppose satan tho himself clothd with a cloud so as not to be seen came immediately and pearching on the roof saw all the heavenkept houshold safely landed and all the host of living creatures dispersing themselves down the sides of the mountain as the search of their food or other proper occasions directed them  this sight was enough satan was at no loss to conclude from hence that the design of god was to repeople the world by the way of ordinary generation from the posterity of these eight persons without creating any new species  very well says the devil then my advantage over them by the snare i laid for poor eve is good still and i am now just where i was after adams expulsion from the garden and when i had cain and his race to go to work with for here is the old expungd corrupted race still as cain was the object then so noah is my man now and if i do not master him one way or another i am mistaken in my mark pardon me for making a speech for the devil  noah big with a sense of his late condition and while the wonders of the deluge were fresh in his mind spent his first days in the extasies of his soul giving thanks and praising the power that had been his protection in and thro the flood of waters and which had in so miraculous a manner safely landed him on the surface of the newly discoverd land and the text tells us as one of the first things he was employd in he built an altar unto the lord and offered burntofferings upon the altar gen viii 20  while noah was thus employd he was safe the devil himself could no where break in upon him and we may suppose very reasonably as he found the old father invulnerable he left him for some years watching notwithstanding all possible advantages against his sons and their children for now the family began to encrease and noahs sons had several children whether himself had any more children after the flood or not that we are not arrivd to any certainty about  among his sons the devil found japhet and shem good pious religious and very devout persons serving god daily after the example of their good old father noah and he could make nothing of them or of any of their posterity but ham the second or according to some the younger son of noah had a son who was namd canaan a loose young profligate fellow his education was probably but cursory and superficial his father ham not being near so religious and serious a man as his brothers shem and japhet were and as canaans education was defective so he provd as untaught youth generally do a wild and in short a very wicked fellow and consequently a fit tool for the devil to go to work with  noah a diligent industrious man being with all his family thus planted in the rich fruitful plains of armenia or wherever you please let it be near the mountains of caucasus or arrarat went immediately to work cultivating and improving the soil encreasing his cattle and pastures sowing corn and among other things planting trees for food and among the fruit trees he planted vines of the grapes thereof he made no doubt as they still in the same country do make most excellent wine rich luscious strong and pleasant  i cannot come into the notion of our criticks who to excuse noah from the guilt of what followed or at least from the censure tell us he knew not the strength or the nature of wine but that gathering the heavy clusters of the grapes and their own weight crushing out their balmy juices into his hand he tasted the tempting liquor and that the devil assisting he was charmd with the delicious fragrance and tasted again and again pressing it out into a bowl or dish that he might take a larger quantity till at length the heady froth ascended and seizing his brain he became intoxicate and drunk not in the least imagining there was any such strength in the juice of that excellent fruit  but to make out this story which is indeed very favourable for noah but in it self extremely ridiculous you must necessarily fall into some absurdities and beg the question most egregiously in some particular cases which way of arguing will by no means suppose what is suggested at first you must support there was no such thing as wine made before the deluge and that no body had been ever made drunk with the juice of the grape before noah which i say is begging the question in the grossest manner  if the contrary is true as i see no reason to question if i say it was true that there was wine drank and that men were or had been drunk with it before they cannot then but suppose that noah who was a wise a great and a good man and a preacher of righteousness both knew of it and without doubt had in his preaching against their crimes preachd against this among the rest upbraided them with it reprovd them for it and exhorted them against it  again tis highly probable they had grapes growing and consequently wines made from them in the antediluvian world how else did noah come by the vines which he planted for we are to suppose he could plant no trees or shrubs but such as he found the roots of in the earth and which no doubt had been there before in their highest perfection and had consequently grown up and brought forth the same luscious fruit before  besides as he found the roots of the vines so he understood what they were and what fruit they bore or else it may be supposed also he would not have planted them for he planted them for their fruit as he did it in the provision he was making for his subsistence and the subsistence of his family and if he did not know what they were he would not have set them for he was not planting for diversion but for profit  upon the whole it seems plain to me he knew what he did as well when he planted the vines as when he pressed out the grapes and also when he drank the juice that he knew it was wine was strong and would make him drunk if he took enough of it he knew that other men had been drunk with such liquor before the flood and that he had reprehended them for it and therefore it was not his ignorance but the devil took him at some advantage when his appetite was eager or he thirsty and the liquor cooling and pleasant and in short as eve said the serpent beguilded her and she did eat so the devil beguiled noah and he did drink the temptation was too strong for noah not the wine he knew well enough what he did but as the drunkards say to this day it was so good he could not forbear it and so he got drunk before he was aware or as our ordinary speech expresses it he was overtaken with drink and mr pool and other expositors are partly of the same mind  no sooner was the poor old man conquerd and the wine had lightend his head but it may be supposed he falls off from the chair or bench where he sate and tumbling backward his clothes which in those hot countries were only loose open robes like the vests which the armenians wear to this day flying abroad or the devil so assisting on purpose to expose him he lay there in a naked indecent posture not fit to be seen  in this juncture who should come by but young canaan say some or as others think this young fellow first attackd him by way of kindness and pretended affection prompted his grandfather to drink on pretence of the wine being good for him and proper for the support of his old age and subtilly set upon him drinking also with him and so his head being too strong for the old mans drank him down and then devil like triumphd over him boasted of his conquest insulted the body as it were dead uncovered him on purpose to expose him and leaving him in that indecent posture went and made sport with it to his father ham who in that part wicked like himself did the same to his brethren japhet and shem but they like modest and good men far from carrying on the wicked insult on their parent went and coverd him as the scripture expresses it and as may be supposed informd him how he had been abusd and by whom  why else should noah when he came to himself shew his resentment so much against canaan his grandson rather than against ham his father and who tis supposed in the story the guilt chiefly lay upon we see the curse is as it were laid wholly upon canaan the grandson and not a word of the father is mentiond gen ix 25 26 27 cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be c  that ham was guilty thats certain from the history of fact but i cannot but suppose his grandson was the occasion of it and in this case the devil seems to have made canaan the instrument or tool to delude noah and draw him in to drunkenness as he made the serpent the tool to beguile eve and draw her into disobedience  possibly canaan might do it without design at first but might be brought in to ridicule and make a jest of the old patriarch afterward as is too frequent since in the practice of our days but i rather believe he did it really with a wicked design and on purpose to expose and insult his reverend old parent and this seems more likely too because of the great bitterness with which noah resented it after he came to be informd of it  but be that as it will the devil certainly made a great conquest here and as to outward appearance no less than that which he gaind before over adam nor did the devils victory consist barely in his having drawn in the only righteous man of the whole antediluvian world and so beginning or initiating the new young progeny with a crime but here was the great oracle silencd at once the preacher of righteousness for such no doubt he would have been to the new world as he was to the old i say the preacher was turnd out of office or his mouth stopt which was worse nay it was a stopping of his mouth in the worst kind far worse than stopping his breath for had he died the office had descended to his sons shem and japhet but he was dead to the office of an instructor tho alive as to his being for of what force could his preachings be who had thus fallen himself into the most shameful and beastly excess  besides some are of the opinion tho i hope without ground that noah was not only overtaken once in his drink but that being fallen into that sin it became habitual and he continued in it a great while and that it was this which is the meaning of his being uncovered in his tent and that his son saw his nakedness that is he continually exposed himself for a long time a hundred years say they and that his son ham and his grandson canaan having drawn him into it kept him in it encouragd and prompted it and all the while satan still prompting them joind their scoffs and contempt of him with their wicked endeavours to promote the wickedness and both with as much success as the devil himself could wish for  then as for his two sons modestly and decently covering their father they tell us that represents shem and japhet applying themselves in an humble and dutiful manner to their father to entreat and beseech him to consider his ancient glory his own pious exhortations to the late drowned world and to consider the offence which he gave by his evil courses to god and the scandal to his whole family and also that they are brought in effectually prevailing upon him and that then noah cursed the wickedness of hams degenerate race in testimony of his sincere repentance after the fact  the story is not so very unlikely as it is certain that it is not to be proved and therefore we had better take it as we find it viz for one single act but suppose it was so tis still certain that noahs preaching was sadly interrupted the energy of his words flatterd and the force of his persuasions enervated and abated by this shameful fall that he was effectually silencd for an instructor ever after and this was as much as the devil had occasion for and therefore indeed we read little more of him except that he lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood nay we do not so much as read that he had any more children but the contrary nor indeed could noah have any more children except by his old and perhaps superannuated wife who it was very likely he had had four or five hundred year unless you will suppose he was allowd to marry some of his own progeny daughters or grandaughters which we do not suppose was allowd no not to adam himself  this was certainly a masterpiece of the devils policy and a fatal instance of his unhappy diligence viz that the door of the ark was no sooner open and the face of the world hardly dry from the universal destruction of mankind but he was at work among them and that not only to form a general defection among the race upon the foot of the original taint of nature but like a bold devil he strikes at the very root and flies at the next general representative of mankind attacks the head of the family that in his miscarriage the rise and progress of a reformation of the new world should receive an early check and should be at once prevented i say like a bold devil he strikes at the root and alas poor unhappy noah he proved too weak for him satan prevaild in his very first attempt and got the victory over him at once  noah thus overcome and satans conquest carried on to the utmost of his own wishes the devil had little more to do in the world for some ages than to carry on an universal degeneracy among mankind and to finish it by a like diligent application in deluding the generality of the race and them as they came on gradually into life this he found the less difficult because of the first defection which spread like a contagion upon the earth immediately after  the first evidence we have of his success in this mischievous design was in the building that great stupendious staircase for such it seems it was intended calld babel which if the whole world had not been drunk or otherwise infatuated they would never have undertaken even satan himself could never have prevaild with them to undertake such a preposterous piece of work for it had neither end or means possibility or probability in it  i must confess i am sometimes apt to vindicate our old ancestors in my thoughts from the charge it self as we generally understand it namely that they really designd to build a tower which should reach up to heaven or that it should secure them in case of another flood and father casaubon is of my opinion whether i am of his or no is a question by it self his opinion is that the confusion was nothing but a breach among the undertakers and directors of the work and that the building was designd chiefly for a storehouse for provisions in case of a second deluge as to their notion of its reaching up to heaven he takes the expression to be allegorical rather than little and only to mean that it should be exceeding high perhaps they might not be astronomers enough to measure the distance of space between the earth and heaven as we pretend to do now but as noah was then alive and as we believe all his three sons were so too they were able to have informd them how absurd it was to suppose either the one or the other viz 1 that they could build up to heaven or 2 that they could build firm enough to resist or high enough to overtop the waters supposing such another flood should happen i would rather think it was only that they intended to build a most glorious and magnificent city where they might all inhabit together and that this tower was to be built for ornament and also for strength or as above and for a storehouse to lay up vast magazines of provisions in case of extraordinary floods or other events the city being built in a great plain namely the plains of shimar near the river euphrates  but the story as it is recorded suits better with satans measures at that time and as he was from the beginning prompting them to every thing that was contrary to the happiness of man so the more preposterous it was and the more inconsistent with common sense the more to his purpose and it shewd the more what a compleat conquest he had gaind over the reason as well as the religion of mankind at that time  again tis evident in this case they were not only acting contrary to the nature of things but contrary to the design and to the command of heaven for gods command was that they should replenish the earth that is that they should spread their habitations over it and people the whole globe whereas they were pitching in one place as if they were not to multiply sufficient to take up any more  but what card the devil for that or to put it a little handsomer that was what satan aimed at for it was enough to him to bring mankind to act just contrary to what heaven had directed or commanded them in any thing and if possible in every thing  but god himself put a stop to this foolish piece of work and it was time indeed to do so for a madder thing the devil himself never proposed to them i say god himself put a stop to this new undertaking and disappointed the devil and how was it done not in judgment and anger as perhaps the devil expected and hopd for but as pitying the simplicity of that dreaming creature man he confused their speech or as some say divided and confused their councils so that they could not agree with one another which would be the same thing as not to understand one another or he put a new shibboleth upon their tongues thereby separating them into tribes or families for by this every family found themselves under a necessity of keeping together and this naturally encreased that differing jargons of language for at first it might be no more  what a confusion this was to them we all know by their being obligd to leave off their building and immediately separating one from another but what a surprize it was to the old serpent that remains to be considered of for indeed it belongs to his history  satan had never met with any disappointment in all his wicked attempts till now for first he succeeded even to triumph upon eve he did the like upon cain and in short upon the whole world one man noah excepted when he blended the sons of god and the daughters of hell for so the word is understood together in promiscuous voluptuous living as well as generation  as to the deluge authors are not agreed whether it was a disappointment to the devil or no it might be indeed a surprize to him for tho noah had preachd of it for a hundred year together yet as he satan daily prompted the people not to heed or believe what that old fellow noah said to them and to ridicule his whimsical building a monstrous tub to swim or float in when the said deluge should come so i am of the opinion he did not believe it himself and am positive he could not foresee it by any insight into futurity that he was master of  tis true the astronomers tell us there was a very terrible comet seen in the air that it appeared for 180 days before the flood continually and that as it approachd nearer and nearer every day all the while so that at last it burst and fell down in a continual spout or stream of water being of a watry substance and the quantity so great that it was forty days a falling so that this comet not only foretold the deluge or drowning of the earth but actually performd it and drownd it from it self  but to leave this tale to them that told it let us consider the devil surprisd and a little amazd at the absorption or inundation or whatever we are to call it of the earth in the deluge not i say that he was much concernd at it perhaps just the contrary and if god would drown it again and as often as he thought fit i do not see by any thing i meet with in satans history or in the nature of him that he would be at all disturbd at it all that i can see in it that could give satan any concern would be that all his favourites were gone and he had his work to do over again to lay a foundation for a new conquest in the generation that was to come but in this his prospect was fair enough for why should he be discouraged when he had now eight people to work upon who met with such success when he had but two and why should he question breaking in now where nature was already vitiated and corrupted when he had before conquerd the same nature when in its primitive rectitude and purity just come out of the hands of its maker and fortifyd with the awe of his high and solemn command just given them and the threatning of death also annext to it if broken  but i go back to the affair of babel this confusion of language or of councils take it which way you will as the first disappointment that i find the devil met with in all his attempts and practices upon mankind or upon the new creature which i mentioned above for now he foresaw what would follow namely that the people would separate and spread themselves over the whole surface of the earth and a thousand new scenes of actions would appear in which he therefore prepares himself to behave as he should see occasion  how the devil learnd to speak all the languages that were now to be used and how many languages they were the several ancient writers of the devils story have not yet determined some tell us they were divided only into fifteen some into seventy two others into one hundred and eighty and others again into several thousands  it also remains a doubt with me and i suppose will be so with others also whether satan has yet found out a method to converse with mankind without the help of language and words or not seeing man has no other medium of conversing no not with himself this i have not time to enter upon here however this seems plain to me viz that the devil soon learnd to make mankind understand him whatever language he spoke and no doubt but he found ways and means to understand them whatever language they spoke  after the confusion of languages the people necessarily sorted themselves into families and tribes every family understanding their own particular speech and that only and these families multiplying grew into nations and those nations wanting room and seeking out habitations wandred some this way some that till they found out countries respectively proper for their settling and there they became a kingdom spreading and possessing still more and more land as their people encreased till at last the whole earth was scarce big enough for them this presented satan with an opportunity to break in upon their morals at another door viz their pride for men being naturally proud and envious nations and tribes began to jostle with one another for room either one nation enjoyd better accommodations or had a better soil or a more favourable climate than another and these being numerous and strong thrust the other out and encroachd upon their land the other liking their situation prepare for their defence and so began oppression invasion war battle and blood satan all the while beating the drums and his attendants clapping their hands as men do when they set dogs on upon one another  the bringing mankind thus to war and confusion as it was the first game the devil playd after the confounding of languages and divisions at babel so it was a conquest upon mankind purely devilish born from hell and so exactly tinctured with satans original sin ambition that it really transformd men into meer devils for when is man transformd into the very image of satan himself when is he turnd into a meer devil if it is not when he is fighting with his fellow creatures and dipping his hands in the blood of his own kind let his picture be considerd the fire of hell flames or sparkles in his eyes a voracious grin sits upon his countenance rage and fury distort the muscles of his face his passions agitate his whole body and he is metamorphosd from a comely beauteous angelic creature into a fury a satyr a terrible and frightful monster nay into a devil for satan himself is describd by the same word which on his very account is changd into a substantive and the devils are calld furies  this sowing the seeds of strife in the world and bringing nations to fight and make war upon one another would take up a great part of the devils history and abundance of extraordinary things would occur in relating the particulars for there have been very great conflagrations kindled in the world by the artifice of hell under this head viz of making war in which it has been the devils masterpiece and he has indeed shewn himself a workman in it that he has wheedled mankind into strange unnatural notions of things in order to propagate and support the fighting principle in the world such as laws of war fair fighting behaving like men of honour fighting at the last drop and the like by which killing and murdering is understood to be justifiable virtue and a true greatness in spirit is rated now by rules which god never appointed and the standard of honour is quite different from that of reason and of nature bravery is denominated not from a fearless undaunted spirit in the just defence of life and liberty but from a daring defiance of god and man fighting killing and treading under foot his fellow creatures at the ordinary command of the officer whether it be right or wrong and whether it be in a just defence of life and our countrys life that is liberty or whether it be for the support of injury and oppression  a prudent avoiding causeless quarrels is calld cowardice and to take an affront baseness and meanness of spirit to refuse fighting and putting life at a cast on the point of a sword a practice forbid by the laws of god and of all good government is yet calld cowardice and a man is bound to die duelling or live and be laughd at  this trumping up these imaginary things calld bravery and gallantry naming them virtue and honour is all from the devils new management and his subtil influencing the minds of men to fly in the face of god and nature and to act against his senses nor but for his artifice in the management could it be possible that such inconsistencies could go down with mankind or they could pass such absurd things among them for reasoning for example a is found in bed with bs wife b is the person injurd and therefore offended and coming into the chamber with his sword in his hand a exclaims loudly why sir you wont murder me will you as you are a man of honour let me rise and take my sword  a very good story indeed fit for no body but the devil to put into any mans head but so it is b being put in mind forsooth that he is a man of honour starts back and must act the honourable part so he lets a get up put on his clothes and take his sword then they fight and b is killd for his honour whereas had the laws of god of nature and of reason taken place the adulterer and the adulteress should have been taken prisoners and carried before the judge and being taken in the fact should have been immediately sentencd he to the block and she to the stake and the innocent abusd husband had no reason to have run any risque of his life for being made a cuckold  but thus has satan abusd the reason of man and if a man does me the greatest injury in the world i must do my self justice upon him by venturing my life upon an even lay with him and must fight him upon equal hazard in which the injurd person is as often killd as the person offering the injury suppose now it be in the same case as above a man abuses my wife and then to give me satisfaction tells me he will fight me which the french call doing me reason no sir say i let me lie with your wife too and then if you desire it i may fight you then i am upon even terms with you but this indeed is the reasoning which the devil has brought mankind too at this day but to go back to the subject viz the devil bringing the nations to fall out and to quarrel for room in the world and so to fight in order to dispossess one another of their settlements this began at a time when certainly there were places enough in the world for every one to choose in and therefore the devil not the want of elbowroom must be the occasion of it and tis carried on ever since as apparently from the same interest and by the same original  but we shall meet with this part again very often in the devils story and as we bring him farther on in the management of mankind i therefore lay it by for the present and come to the next steps the devil took with mankind after the confusion of languages and this was in the affair of worship it does not appear yet that ever the devil was so bold as either  1 to set himself up to be worshipd as a god or which was still worse  2 to persuade man to believe there was no god at all to worship  both these are introducd since the deluge one indeed by the devil who soon found means to set himself up for a god in many parts of the world and holds it to this day but the last is brought in by the invention of man in which it must be confessd man has outsind the devil for to do satan justice he never thought it could ever pass upon mankind or that any thing so gross would go down with them so that in short these modern casuists in the reach of our days have i say outsind the devil  as then both these are modern inventions satan went on gradually and being to work upon human nature by stratagem not by force it would have been too gross to have set himself up as an object of worship at first it was to be done step by step for example       1 it was sufficient to bring mankind to a neglect of god to      worship him by halves and give little or no regard to his laws      and so grow loose and immoral in direct contradiction to his      commands this would not go down with them at first so the devil      went on gradually       2 from a negligence in worshiping the true god he by degrees      introducd the worship of false gods and to introduce this he      began with the sun moon and stars calld in the holy text      the host of heaven these had greater majesty upon them and seemd      fitter to command the homage of mankind so it was not the hardest      thing in the world to bring men when they had once forgotten the      true god to embrace the worship of such gods as those       3 having thus debauchd their principles in worship and led them      from the true and only object of worship to a false it was the      easier to carry them on so in a few gradations more he brought      them to downright idolatry and even in that idolatry he proceeded      gradually too for he began with awful names such as were      venerable in the thoughts of men as baal or bell which in      chaldaick and hebrew signifies lord or sovereign or mighty      and magnificent and this was therefore a name ascribd at first to      the true god but afterwards they descended to make images and      figures to represent him and then they were calld by the same      name as baal baalim and afterwards bell from which by a      hellish degeneracy saturn brought mankind to adore every block of      their own hewing and to worshipping stocks stones monsters      hobgoblins and every sordid frightful thing and at last the      devil himself   what notions some people may entertain of the forwardness of the first ages of the world to run into idolatry i do not enquire here i know they tell us strange things of its being the product of meer nature one remove from its primitive state but i who pretend to have so critically enquird into satans history can assure you and that from very good authority that the devil did not find it so easy a task to obliterate the knowledge of the true god in the minds and consciences of men as those people suggest  it is true he carried things a great length under the patriarchal government of the first ages but still he was sixteen hundred years bringing it to pass and tho we have reason to believe the old world before the flood was arrived to a very great height of wickedness and ovid very nobly describes it by the war of the titans against jupiter yet we do not read that ever satan was come to such a length as to bring them to idolatry indeed we do read of wars carried on among them whether it was one nation against another or only personal we cannot tell but the world seemd to be swallowd up in a life of wickedness that is to say of luxury and lewdness rapine and violence and there were giants among them and men of renown that is to say men famd for their mighty valour great actions of war we may suppose and their strength who personally opposd others we read of no considerable wars indeed but tis not to be doubted but there was such wars or else it is to be understood that they livd in common a life somewhat like the brutes the strong devouring the weak for the text says the whole earth was filled with violence hunting and tearing one another in pieces either for dominion or for wealth either for ambition or for avarice we know not well which  thus far the old antediluvian world went and very wicked they were there is no doubt of that but we have reason to believe that was no idolatry the devil had not brought them to that length yet perhaps it would soon have followd but the deluge intervend  after the deluge as i have said he had all his work to do over again and he went on by the same steps first he brought them to violence and war then to oppression and tyranny then to neglect of true worship then to false worship and then idolatry by the meer natural consequence of the thing who were the first nation or people that fell from the worship of the true god is something hard to determine the devil who certainly of all gods creatures is best able to inform us having left us nothing upon record upon that subject but we have reason to believe it was thus introducd  nimrod was the grandson of ham noahs second son the same who was cursed by his father for exposing him in his drunkenness this nimrod was the first who it seems satan pickd out for a hero here he inspird him with ambitious thoughts dreams of empire and having the government of all the rest that is to say universal monarchy the very same bait with which he has plaid upon the frailty of princes and ensnard the greatest of them ever since even from his most august imperial majesty king nimrod the first to his most christian majesty louis the xiv and many a mighty monarch between  when these mighty monarchs and men of fame went off the stage the world had their memories in esteem many ages after and as their great actions were no otherwise recorded than by oral tradition and the tongues and memories of fallible men time and the custom of magnifying the past actions of kings men soon fabld up their histories satan assisting into miracle and wonder hence their names were had in veneration more and more statues and bustoes representing their persons and great actions were set up in public places till from heroes and champions they made gods of them and thus satan prompting the world was quickly filld with idols  this nimrod is he who according to the received opinion tho i do not find satans history exactly concurring with it was first calld belus then baal and worshipd in most of the eastern countries under those names sometimes with additions of sirnames according to the several countries or people or towns where he was particularly set up as baal peor baal zephon baal phegor and in other places plain baal as jupiter in after times had the like additions as jupiter ammon jupiter capitolinus jupiter pistor jupiter feretrius and about ten or twelve jupiters more  i must acknowledge that i think it was a masterpiece of hell to bring the world to idolatry so soon after they had had such an eminent example of the infinite power of the true god as was seen in the deluge and particularly in the escape of noah in the ark to bring them even before noah or his sons were dead to forget whose hand it was and give the homage of the world to a name and that a name of a mortal man dead and rotten who was famous for nothing when he was alive but blood and war i say to bring the world to set up this nothing this meer name nay the very image and picture of him for a god it was first a mark of most prodigious stupidity in the whole race of men a monstrous degeneracy from nature and even from common sense and in the next place twas a token of an inexpressible craft and subtilty in the devil who had now gotten the people into so full and compleat a management that in short he could have brought them by the same rule to have worshipd any thing and in a little while more did bring many of them to worship himself plain devil as he was and knowing him to be such  as to the antiquity of this horrible defection of mankind tho we do not find the beginning of it particularly recorded yet we are certain it was not long after the confusion of babel for nimrod as is said was no more than noahs great grandson and noah himself i suppose might be alive some years after nimrod was born and as nimrod was not long dead before they forgot that he was a tyrant and a murtherer and made a baal that is a lord or idol of him i say he was not long dead for nimrod was born in the year of the world 1847 and built babylon the year 1879 and we find terah the father of abraham who livd from the year 1879 was an idolater as was doubtless bethuel who was terahs grandson for we find laban who was bethuels son was so and all this was during the life of the first postdiluvian family for terah was born within one hundred ninety three years after the flood and one hundred fifty seven years before noah was dead and even abram himself was eight and fifty years old before noah died and yet idolatry had been then in all probability above an hundred years practised in the world       n b it is worth remark here what a terrible advantage the devil         gaind by the debauching poor noah and drawing him into the sin         of drunkenness for by this as i said he silencd and stopd the         mouth of the great preacher of righteousness that father and         patriarch of the whole world who not being able for the shame of         his own foul miscarriage to pretend to instruct or reprove the         world any more the devil took hold of them immediately and for         want of a prophet to warn and admonish ran that little of religion         which there might be left in shem and japhet quite out of the         world and delugd them all in idolatry  how long the whole world may be said to be thus overwhelmd in ignorance and idolatry we may make some tolerable guess at by the history of abraham for it was not till god calld him from his fathers house that any such thing as a church was establishd in the world nor even then except in his own family and successors for almost four hundred years after that call and till god brought the israelites back out of egypt the whole world may be said to be involvd in idolatry and devil worship  so absolute a conquest had the devil made over mankind immediately after the flood and all taking its rise and beginning at the fatal defeat of noah who had he livd untainted and invulnerable as he had done for six hundred years before would have gone a great way to have stemd the torrent of wickedness which broke in upon mankind and therefore the devil i say was very cunning and very much in the right of it take him as he is a meer devil to attack noah personally and give him a blow so soon  it is true the devil did not immediately raze out the notion of religion and of a god from the minds of men nor could he easily suppress the principle of worship and homage to be paid to a sovereign being the author of nature and guide of the world the devil saw this clearly in the first ages of the new world and therefore as i have said he proceeded politically and by degrees that it was so is evident from the story of job and his three friends who if we may take it for a history not a fable and may judge of the time of it by the length of jobs life and by the family of eliphaz the temanite who it is manifest was at least grandson or great grandson to esau isaacs eldest son and by the language of abimilech king of gerar to abraham and of laban to jacob both the latter being at the same time idolaters i say if we may judge of it by all these there were still very sound notions of religion in the minds of men nor could satan with all his cunning and policy deface those ideas and root them out of the minds of the people  and this put him upon taking new measures to keep up his interest and preserve the hold he got upon mankind and his method was like himself subtle and politick to the last degree as his whole history makes appear for seeing he found they could not but believe the being of a god and that they would needs worship something it is evident he had no game left him to play but this namely to set up wrong notions of worship and bring them to a false worship instead of a true supposing the object worshipd to be still the same  to finish this stratagem he first insinuates that the true god was a terrible a dreadful unapproachable being that to see him was so frightful that it would be present death that to worship him immediately was a presumption which would provoke his wrath and that as he was a consuming fire in himself so he would burn up those in his anger that dard to offer up any sacrifice to him but by the interposition of some medium which might receive their adorations in his name  hence it occurd presently that subordinate gods were to be found out and set up to whom the people might pay the homage due to the supreme god and who they might worship in his name this i take from the most ancient account of idolatry in the world nor indeed could the devil himself find out any other reason why men should cannonise or rather deify their princes and men of fame and worship them after they were dead as if they could save them from death and calamity who were not able to save themselves when they were alive much less could satan bring men to swallow so gross so absurd a thing as the bowing the knee to a stock or a stone a calf an ox a lion nay the image or figure of a calf such as the israelites made at mount sinai and say these be thy gods o israel who brought thee out of the land of egypt  having thus i say brought them to satisfy themselves that they worshipd the true god and no other under the figures and appearances which they made to represent him it was easy after that to worship any thing for the true god and thus in a few ages they worshipd nothing but idols even throughout the whole world nor has the devil lost this hold in some parts of the world nay not in most parts of the world to this day he holds still all the eastern parts of asia and the southern parts of africa and the northern parts of europe and in them the vast countries of china and tartary persia and india guinea ethiopia zanquebar congo angola monomotapa c in all which except ethiopia we find no vestiges of any other worship but that of idols monsters and even the devil himself till after the very coming of our saviour and even then if it be true that the gospel was preachd in the indies and china by st thomas and in other remote countries by other of the apostles we see that whatever ground satan lost he seems to have recovered it again and all asia and africa is at present overrun with paganism or mahometanism which i think of the two is rather the worst besides all america a part of the world as some say equal in bigness to all the other in which the devils kingdom was never interrupted from its first being inhabited whenever it was to the first discovery of it by the european nations in the sixteenth century  in a word the devil got what we may call an entire victory over mankind and drove the worship of the true god in a manner quite out of the world forcing as it were his maker in a new kind of creation the old one proving thus ineffectual to recover a certain number by force and meer omnipotence to return to their duty serve him and worship him but of that hereafter     chap xi  of gods calling a church out of the midst of a degenerate world and of      satans new measures upon that incident how he attackd them      immediately and his success in those attacks   satan having as i have said in the preceding chapter made as it were a full conquest of mankind debauchd them all to idolatry and brought them at least to worshiping the true god by the wretched medium of corrupt and idolatrous representations god seemd to have no true servants or worshippers left in the world but if i may be allowd to speak so was obligd in order to restore the world to their senses again to call a select number out from among the rest who he himself undertook should own his godhead or supreme authority and worship him as he requird to be worshipd this i say god was obligd to do because tis evident it has not been done so much by the choice and council of men for satan would have overruld that part as by the power and energy of some irresistible and invincible operation and this our divines give high names to but be it what they will it is the second defeat or disappointment that the devil he met with in his progress in the world the first i have spoken of already  it is true satan very well understood what was threatnd to him in the original promise to the woman immediately after the fall namely thou shalt bruise his head c but he did not expect it so suddenly but thought himself sure of mankind till the fullness of time when the messiah should come and therefore it was a great surprize to him to see that abraham being calld was so immediately receivd and establishd tho he did not so immediately follow the voice that directed him yet in him in his loins was all gods church at that time containd  in the calling abraham it is easy to see that there was no other way for god to form a church that is to say to single out a people to himself as the world was then stated but by immediate revelation and a voice from heaven all mankind were gone over to the enemy overwhelmed in idolatry in a word were engagd to the devil god almighty or as the scripture distinguishes him the lord the true god was out of the question mankind knew little or nothing of him much less did they know any thing of his worship or that there was such a being in the world  well might it be said the lord appeared to abraham gen xii 7 for if god had not appeard himself he must have sent a messenger from heaven and perhaps it was so too for he had not one true servant or worshiper that we know of then on earth to send on that errand no prophet no preacher of righteousness noah was dead and had been so above seventeen year and if he had not his preaching as i observed after his great miscarriage had but little effect we are indeed told that noah left behind him certain rules and orders for the true worship of god which were calld the precepts of noah and remaind in the world for a long time tho how written when neither any letters much less writing were known in the world is a difficulty which remains to be solvd and this makes me look upon those laws calld the precepts of noah to be a modern invention as i do also the alphabetum noachi which bochart pretends to give an account of  but to leave that fiction and come back to abraham god calld him whether at first by voice without any vision whether in a dream or night vision which was very significant in those days or whether by some awful appearance we know not the second time tis indeed said expressly god appeared to him be it which way it will god himself calld him shewd him the land of canaan gave him the promise of it for his posterity and withal gave him such a faith that the devil soon found there was no room for him to meddle with abraham this is certain we do not read that the devil ever so much as attempted abraham at all some will suggest that the command to abraham to go and offer up his son isaac was a temptation of the devil if possible to defeat the glorious work of gods calling a holy seed into the world for the first if abraham had disobeyd that call the new favourite had been overcome and made a rebel of or secondly if he had obeyd then the promisd seed had been cut off and abraham defeated but as the text is express that god himself proposed it to abraham i shall not start the suggestions of the criticks in bar of the sacred oracle  be it one way or other abraham shewd a herolike faith and courage and if the devil had been the author of it he had seen himself disappointed in both his views 1 by abrahams ready and bold compliance as believing it to be gods command and 2 by the divine countermand of the execution just as the fatal knife was lifted up  but if the devil left abraham and made no attack upon him seeing him invulnerable he made himself amends upon the other branch of his family his poor nephew lot who notwithstanding he was so immediately under the particular care of heaven as that the angel who was sent to destroy sodom could do nothing till he was out of it and who tho after he had left zoar and was retird into a cave to dwell yet the subtle devil found him out deluded his two daughters took an advantage of the fright they had been in about sodom and gomorrah made them believe the whole world was burnt too as well as those cities and that in short they could never have any husbands c and so in their abundant concern to repeople the world and that the race of mankind might not be destroyed they go and lie with their own father the devil telling them doubtless how to do it by intoxicating his head with wine in all which story whether they were not as drunk as their father seems to be a question or else they could not have supposed all the men in the earth were consumd when they knew that the little city zoar had been preservd for their sakes  this now was the third conquest satan obtaind by the gust of humane appetite that is to say once by eating and twice by drinking or drunkenness and still the last was the worst and most shameful for lot however his daughters managd him could not pretend he did not understand what the strength of wine was and one would have thought after so terrible a judgment as that of sodom was which was as we may say executed before his face his thoughts should have been too solemnly engagd in praising god for sparing his life to be made drunk and that two nights together  but the devil playd his game sure he set his two daughters to work and as the devils instruments seldom fail so he securd his by that hellish stratagem of deluding the daughters to think all the world was consumd but they two and their father to be sure the old man could not suspect that his daughters design was so wicked as indeed it was or that they intended to debauch him with wine and make him drink till he knew not what he did  now the devil having carried his game here gaind a great point for as there were but two religious families in the world before from whence a twofold generation might be supposed to rise religious and righteous like their parents viz that of abraham and this of lot this crime ruind the hopes of one of them it could no more be said that just lot was in being who vexd his righteous soul from day to day with the wicked behaviour of the people of sodom righteous lot was degenerated into drunken incestuous lot lot fallen from what he was to be a wicked and unrighteous man no pattern of virtue no reprover of the age but a poor fallen degenerate patriarch who could now no more reprove or exhort but look down and be ashamd and nothing to do but to repent and see the poor mean excuses of all the three       eve says the serpent beguild me and i did eat       noah says  my grandson beguild me or the wine beguild me      and i did drink       lot says my daughters beguild me and i also did drink   it is observable that as i said above noah was silencd and his preaching at an end after that one action so the like may be said of lot and in short you never hear one word more of either of them after it as for mankind both were useless to them and as to themselves we never read of any of their repentance nor have we much reason to believe they did repent  from this attack of the devil upon lot we hear no more of the devil being so busily employd as he had been before in the world he had indeed but little to do for all the rest of the world was his own lulld asleep under the witchcraft of idolatry and are so still  but it could not be long that the devil lay idle as soon as god calld himself a people the devil could not be at rest till he attackd them    wherever god sets up a house of prayer   the devil always builds a chapel there   abraham indeed went off the stage free and so did isaac too they were a kind of first rate saints we do not so much as read of any failing they had or of any thing the devil had ever the face to offer to them no or with jacob either if you will excuse him for beguiling his brother esau of both his birthright and his blessing but he was busy enough with all his children for example                                         he sent judah to his sheepshearing and placed a whore tamar      in his way in the posture of temptation so made him commit      incest and whoredom both together    he sent incestuous reuben to lie with his fathers concubine      billah    he sent dinah to the ball to dance with the sichemite ladies      and play the whore with their master    he enragd simeon and levi at the supposed injury and then      prompted them to revenge for which their father heartily cursed      them    he set them all together to fall upon poor joseph first to      murther him intentionally and then actually sell him to the      midianites    he made them shew the partycolourd coat and tell a lie to their      father to make the poor old man believe joseph was killd by a      lion c    he sent potiphars wife to attack josephs chastity and filld      her with rage at the disappointment    he taught joseph to swear by the life of pharoah                                       in a word he debauchd the whole race except benjamin and never man had such a set of sons so wicked and so notorious after so good an introduction into the world as they all of them had to be sure for jacob no doubt gave them as good instruction as the circumstances of his wandring condition would allow him to do  we must now consider the devil and his affairs in a quite differing situation when the world first appeared peopled by the creating power of god he had only adam and eve to take care of and i think he plyd his time with them to purpose enough after the deluge he had noah only to pitch upon and he quickly conquerd him by the instigation of his grandson  at the building of babel he guided them by their acting all in a body as one man so that in short he managd them with ease taking them as a body politic and we find they came into his snare as one man but now the children of israel multiplying in the land of their bondage and god seeming to shew a particular concern for them the devil was obligd to new measures stand at a distance and look on for some time  the egyptians were plagued even without his help nor tho the cunning artist as i said stood and looked on yet he durst not meddle nor could he make a few lice the least and meanest of the armies of insects raised to afflict the egyptians  however when he perceivd that god resolved to bring the israelites out he prepard to attend them to watch them and be at hand upon all the wicked occasions that might offer as if he had been fully satisfied such occasions would offer and that he should not fail to have an opportunity to draw them into some snare or another and that therefore it was his business not to be out of the way but to be ready as we say to make his market of them in the best manner he could how many ways he attempted them nay how many times he conquerd them in their journey we shall see presently  first he put them in a fright at baalzephon where he thought he had drawn them into a noose and where he sent pharoah and his army to block them up between the mountains of piahiroth and the red sea but there indeed satan was outwitted by moses so far as it appeared to be a humane action for he little thought of their going dry footed thro the sea but depended upon having them all cut in pieces the next morning by the egyptians an eminent proof by the way that the devil has no knowledge of events or any insight into futurity nay that he has not so much as a second sight or knows to day what his maker intends to do to morrow for had satan known that god intended to ford them over the sea if he had not been able to have prevented the miracle he would certainly have prevented the escape by sending out pharoah and his army time enough to have taken the strand before them and so have driven them to the necessity of travelling on foot round the north point of that sea by the wilderness of etan where he would have pursud and harrassd them with his cavalry and in all probability have destroyd them but the blind shortsighted devil perfectly in the dark and unacquainted with futurity knew nothing of the matter was as much deceivd as pharoah himself stood still flattering himself with the hopes of his booty and the revenge he should take upon them the next morning till he saw the frighted waves in an uproar and to his utter astonishment and confusion saw the passage laid open and moses leading his vast army in full march over the dry space nay even then tis very propable satan did not know that if the egyptians followd them the sea would return upon and overwhelm them for i can hardly think so hard of the devil himself that if he had he would have sufferd much less prompted pharoah to follow the chase at such an expence so that either he must be an ignorant unforeseeing devil or a very ungrateful false devil to his friends the egyptians  i am enclind also to the more charitable opinion of satan too because the escape of the israelites was really a triumph over himself for the war was certainly his or at least he was auxiliary to pharoah it was a victory over hell and egypt together and he would never have sufferd the disgrace if he had known it beforehand that is to say tho he could not have prevented the escape of israel or the dividing the water yet he might have warnd the egyptians and cautioned them not to venture in after them  but we shall see a great many weak steps taken by the devil in the affair of this very people and their forty years wandring in the wilderness and tho he was in some things successful and wheedled them into many foolish and miserable murmurings and wranglings against god and mutinies against poor moses yet the devil was oftentimes baulkd and disappointed and tis for this reason that i choose to finish the first part of his history with the particular relation of his behaviour among the jews because also we do not find any extraordinary things happening any where else in the world for above one thousand five hundred years no variety no revolutions all the rest of mankind lay still under his yoke quietly submitted to his government did just as he bad them worshipd every idol he set up and in a word he had no difficulty with any body but the jews and for this reason i say this part of his story will be the more useful and instructing  to return therefore to moses and his dividing the red sea that the people went over or thro it that we have the sacred history for but how the devil behavd that you must come to me for or i know not where you will find a true account of it at least not in print  1 it was in the night they marchd thro whether the devil saw it in the dark or no thats not my business  but when he had daylight for it and viewd the next days work i make no question but all hell felt the surprise the prey being thus snatchd out of their hands unexpectedly tis true the egyptians host was sent to him in their room but that was not what he aimd at for he was sure enough of them his own way and if it was not just at that time yet he knew what and who they were but as he had devourd the whole israelitish host in his imagination to the tune of at least a million and a half of souls men women and children it was no doubt a great disappointment to the devil to miss of his prey and to see them all triumphing on the other side in safety  it is true satans annals do not mention this defeat for historians are generally backward to register their own misfortunes but as we have an account of the fact from other hands so as we cannot question the truth of it the nature of the thing will tell us it was a disappointment to the devil and a very great one too  i cannot but observe here that i think this part of the devils story very entertaining because of the great variety of incidents which appear in every part of it sometimes he is like a hunted fox curvetting and counterrunning to avoid his being pursued and found out while at the same time he is carrying on his secret designs to draw the people he pretends to manage into some snare or other to their hurt at another time tho the comparison is a little too low for his dignity like a monkey that has done mischief and who making his own escape sits and chatters at a distance as if he had triumpd in what he had done so satan when he had drawn them in to worship a calf to offer strange fire to set up a schism and the like and so to bring the divine vengeance upon themselves leaving them in their distress kept at a distance as if he lookd on with satisfaction to see them burnt swallowd up swept away and the like as the several stories relate  his indefatigable vigilance is on the other hand a useful caveat as well as an improving view to us no sooner is he routed and exposd defeated and disappointed in one enterprize but he begins another and like a cunning gladiator warily defends himself and boldly attacks his enemy at the same time thus we see him up and down conquering and conquered thro this whole part of his story till at last he receives a total defeat of which you shall hear in its place in the mean time let us take up his story again at the red sea where he receivd a great blow instead of which he expected a compleat victory for doubtless the devil and the king of Ægypt too thought of nothing but conquest at piahiroth  however tho the triumph of the israelites over the egyptians must needs be a great mortification to the devil and exasperated him very much yet the consequence was only this viz that satan like an enemy who is baulkd and defeated but not overcome redoubles his rage and reinforces his army and what the egyptians could not do for him he resolves to do for himself in order then to take his opportunity for what mischief might offer being defeated and provokd i say at the slur that was put upon him he resolves to follow them into the wilderness and many a vile prank he plaid them there as first he straitens them for water and makes them murmur against god and against moses within a very few days nay hours of their great deliverance of all  nor was this all but in less than one year more we find them at his instigation too setting up a golden calf and making all the people dance about it at mount sinai even when god himself had but just before appeard to them in the terrors of a burning fire upon the top of the mountain and what was the pretence truly nothing but that they had lost moses who used to be their guide and he had hid himself in the mount and had not been seen in forty days so that they could not tell what was become of him this put them all into confusion a poor pretence indeed to turn them all back to idolatry but the watchful devil took the hint pushd the advantage and insinuated that they should never see moses again that he was certainly devourd by venturing too near the flashes of fire in the mount and presuming upon the liberty he had taken before in a word that god had destroyed moses or he was starved to death for want of food having been forty days and forty nights absent  all these were its true in themselves most foolish suggestions considering moses was admitted to the vision of god and that god had been pleased to appear to him in the most intimate manner that as they might depend god would not destroy his faithful servant so they might have concluded he was able to support his being without food as long as he thought fit but to a people so easy to believe any thing what could be too gross for the devil to persuade them to  a people who could dance round a calf and call it their god might do any thing that could say to one another that this was the great jehovah that brought them out of the land of egypt and that within so few days after gods miraculous appearance to them and for them i say such a people were really fitted to be imposed upon nothing could be too gross for them  this was indeed his first considerable experiment upon them as a people or as a body and the truth is his affairs requird it for satan who had been a successful devil in most of his attempts upon mankind could hardly doubt of success in any thing after he had carried his point at mount sinai to bring them to idolatry in the very face of their deliverer and just after their deliverance it was more astonishing in the main than even their passing the red sea in a word the devils whole history does not furnish us with a story equally surprising  and how was poor aaron bewilderd in it too he that was mosess partner in all the great things that moses did in pharaohs sight and that was appointed to be his assistant and oracle or orator rather upon all public occasions that he above all the rest should come into this absurd and ridiculous proposal he that was singled out for the sacred priesthood for him to defile his holy hands with a polluted abominable sacrifice and with making the idol for them too for tis plain that he made it how monstrous it was  and see what an answer he gives to his brother moses how weak how simple i did so and so indeed i bad them bring the earrings c and i cast the gold into the fire and it came out this calf ridiculous as if the calf came out by meer fortuitous adventure without a mould to cast it in which could not be supposed and if it had not come out so without a mould moses would certainly have known of it had aaron been innocent he would have answered after quite another manner and told moses honestly that the whole body of the people came to him in a fright that they forced him to make them an idol which he did by making first a proper mould to cast it in and then taking the proper metal to cast it from that indeed he had sinnd in so doing but that he was mobbd into it and the people terrified him perhaps they threatned to kill him and if he had added that the devil prompting his fear beguild him he had said nothing but what was certainly true for if it was in satans power to make the people insolent and outrageous enough to threaten and bully the old venerable prophet for he was not yet a priest who was the brother of their oracle moses and had been partner with him in so many of his commissions i say if he coud bring up the passions of the people to a height to be rude and unmannerly to him aaron and perhaps to threaten and insult him he may be easily supposd to be able to intimidate aaron and terrify him into a compliance  see this cunning agent when he has mans destruction in his view how securely he acts he never wants a handle the best of men have one weak place or other and he always finds it out takes the advantage of it and conquers them by one artifice or another only take it with you as you go tis always by stratagem never by force a proof that he is not empowerd to use violence he may tempt and he does prevail but tis all legerdemain tis all craft and artifice he is still diabolè the calumniator and deceiver that is the misrepresenter he misrepresents man to god and misrepresents god to man also he misrepresents things he puts false colours and then manages the eye to see them with an imperfect view raising clouds and fogs to intercept our sight in short he deceives all our senses and imposes upon us in things which otherwise would be the easiest to discern and judge of  this indeed is in part the benefit of the devils history to let us see that he has used the same method all along and that ever since he has had any thing to do with mankind he has practisd upon them with stratagem and cunning also tis observable that he has carried his point better that way than he would have done by fury and violence if he had been allowed to make use of it for by his power indeed he might have laid the world desolate and made a heap of rubbish of it long ago but as i have observed before that would not have answered his ends half so well for by destroying men he would have made martyrs and sent abundance of good men to heaven who would much rather have died than yielded to serve him and as he aimed to have it to fall down and worship him i say he would have made martyrs and that not a few but this was none of satans business his design lies quite another way his business is to make men sin not to make them suffer to make devils of them not saints to delude them and draw them away from their maker not send them away to him and therefore he works by stratagem not by force  we are now come to his story as it relates to the jewish church in the wilderness and to the children of israel in their travelling circumstances and this was the first scene of publick management that the devil had upon his hands in the world for as i have said till now he dealt with mankind either in their separate condition one by one or else carried all before him engrossing whole nations in his systems of idolatry and overwhelming them in an ignorant destruction  but having now a whole people as it were snatchd away from him taken out of his government and which was still worse having a view of a kingdom being set up independent of him and superior to his authority it is not to be wondred at if he endeavourd to overthrow them in the infancy of their constitution and tried all possible arts to bring them back into his own hands again  he found them not only carried away from the country where they were even in his clutches surrounded with idols and where we have reason to believe the greatest part of them were polluted with the idolatry of the egyptians for we do not read of any stated worship which they had of their own or if they did worship the true god we scarce know in what manner they did it they had no law given them nothing but the covenant of circumcision and even moses himself had not strictly observd that till he was frighted into it we read of no sacrifices among them no feasts were ordaind no solemn worship appointed and how or in what manner they performd their homage we know not the passover was not ordaind till just at their coming away so that there was not much religion among them at least that we have any account of and we may suppose the devil was pretty easy with them all the while they were in the house of their bondage  but now to have a million of people fetchd out of his hands as it were all at once and to have the immediate power of heaven engaged in it and that satan saw evidently god had singled them out in a miraculous manner to favour them and call them his own this allarmd him at once and therefore he resolves to follow them lay close siege to them and take all the measures possible to bring them to rebel against and disobey god that he might be provokd to destroy them and how near he went to bring it to pass we shall see presently  this making a calf and paying an idolatrous worship to it for they acted the heathens and idolaters not in the setting up the calf only but in the manner of their worshiping viz dancing and musick things they had not been acquainted with in the worship of the true god i mention here to observe how the devil not only imposed upon their principles but upon their senses too as if the awful majesty of heaven whose glory they had seen in mount sinai where they stood and whose pillar of cloud and fire was their guide and protection would be worshipd by dancing round a calf and that not a living creature or a real calf but the mere image of a calf cast in gold or as some think in brass gilded over  but this was the devils way with mankind namely to impose upon their senses and bring them into the grossest follies and absurdities and then having first made them fools it was much the easier to make them offenders  in this very manner he acted with them thro all the course of their wilderness travels for as they were led by the hand like children defended by omnipotence fed by miracles instructed immediately from heaven and in all things had moses for their guide they had no room to miscarry but by acting the greatest absurdities and committing the greatest follies in nature and even these the devil brought them to be guilty of in a surprising manner 1 as god himself relievd them in every exigence and supplyd them in every want one would think twas impossible they should be ever brought to question either his willingness or his ability and yet they really objected against both which was indeed very provoking and i doubt not that when the devil had brought them to act in such a preposterous manner he really hoped and believed god would be provokd effectually the testimonies of his care of them and ability to supply them were miraculous and undeniable he gave them water from the rock bread from the air sent the fowls to feed them with flesh and supported them all the way by miracles their health was preservd none were sick among them their clothes did not wear out nor their shoes grow old upon their feet could any thing be more absurd than to doubt whether he could provide for them who had never let them want for so many years  but the devil managed them in spight of miracles nor did he ever give them over till he had brought six hundred thousand of them to provoke god so highly that he would not suffer above two of them to go into the land of promise so that in short satan gained his point as to that generation for all their carcasses fell in the wilderness let us take but a short view to what a height he brought em and in what a rude absurd manner they acted how he set them upon murmuring upon every occasion now for water then for bread nay they murmured at their bread when they had it our soul loaths this light bread  he sowd the seeds of churchrebellion in the sons of aaron and made nadab and abihu offer strange fire till they were strangely consumed by fire for the doing it  he set them a complaining at taberah and a lusting for flesh at the first three days journey from mount sinai  he planted envy in the hearts of miriam and aaron against the authority of moses to pretend god had spoke by them as well as by him till he humbled the father and made a leper of the daughter  he debauchd ten of the spies frighted them with sham appearances of things when they went out to search the land and made them fright the whole people out of their understanding as well as duty for which six hundred thousand of their carcasses fell in the wilderness  he raisd the rebellion of korah and the two hundred and fifty princes till he brought them to be swallowed up alive  he put moses into a passion at meribah and ruffled the temper of the meekest man upon earth by which he made both him and aaron forfeit their share of the promise and be shut out from the holy land  he raisd a mutiny among them when they travelled from mount hor till they brought fiery serpents among them to destroy them  he tried to make baalim the prophet curse them but there the devil was disappointed however he brought the midianites to debauch them with women as in the case of zimri and cosbi  he tempted achan with the wedge of gold and the babylonish garment that he might take of the accursed thing and be destroyd  he tempted the whole people not effectually to drive out the cursed inhabitants of the land of promise that they might remain and be goads in their sides till at last they often oppressd them for their idolatry and which was worse debauched them to idolatry  he prompted the benjamites to refuse satisfaction to the people in the case of the wickedness of the men of gibeah to the destruction of the whole tribe four hundred men excepted in the rock rimmon  at last he tempted them to reject the theocracy of their maker and call upon samuel to make them a king and most of those kings he made plagues and sorrows to them in their time as you shall hear in their order  thus he plagued the whole body of the people continually making them sin against god and bring judgments upon themselves to the consuming some millions of them first and last by the vengeance of their maker  as he did with the whole congregation so he did with their rulers and several of the judges who were made instruments to deliver the people yet were drawn into snares by this subtil serpent to ruin themselves or the people they had delivered  he tempted gideon to make an ephod contrary to the law of the tabernacle and made the children of israel go a whoring that is a worshiping after it  he tempted sampson to debauch himself with a harlot and betray his own happy secret to a whore at the expence of both his eyes and at last of his life  he tempted elis sons to lie with the women in the very doors of the tabernacle when they came to bring their offerings to the priest and he tempted poor eli to connive at them or not sufficiently reprove them  he tempted the people to carry the ark of god into the camp that it might fall into the hands of the philistines and  he tempted uzzi to reach out his hand to hold it up as if he that had preserved it in the house of dagon the idol of the philistines could not keep it from falling out of the cart  when the people had gotten a king he immediately set to work in diverse ways to bring that king to load them with plagues and calamities not a few  he tempted saul to spare the king of amaliek contrary to gods express command  he not tempted saul only but possessed him with an evil spirit by which he was left to wayward dispositions and was forced to have it fiddld out of him with a minstrel  he tempted saul with a spirit of discontent and with a spirit of envy at poor david to hunt him like a partridge upon the mountains  he tempted saul with a spirit of divination and sent him to a witch to enquire of samuel for him as if god would help him when he was dead that had forsaken him when he was alive  after that he tempted him to kill himself on a pretence that he might not fall into the hands of the uncircumcised as if selfmurther was not half so bad either for sin against god or disgrace among men as being taken prisoner by a philistine a piece of madness none but the devil could have brought mankind to submit to tho some ages after that he made it a fashion among the romans  after saul was dead and david came to the throne by how much he was a man chosen and particularly savoured by heaven the devil fell upon him with the more vigour attackd him so many ways and conquerd him so very often that as no man was so good a king so hardly any good king was ever a worse man in many cases one would have almost thought the devil had made sport with david to shew how easily he could overthrow the best man god could choose of the whole congregation  he made him distrust his benefactor so much as to feign himself mad before the king of gath when he had fled to him for shelter  he made him march with his four hundred cutthroats to cut off poor nabal and all his houshold only because he would not send him the good chear he had provided for his honest sheepshearers  he made him for his words sake give ziba half his masters estate for his treachery after he knew he had been the traitor and betrayd poor mephibosheth for the sake of it in which    the good old king it seems was very loth   to break his word and therefore broke his oath   then he tempted him to the ridiculous project of numbring the people tho against gods express command a thing joab himself was not wicked enough to do till david and the devil forcd him to it  and to make him compleatly wicked he carried him to the top of his house and shewd him a naked lady bathing her self in her garden in which it appeard that the devil knew david too well and what was the particular sin of his inclination and so took him by the right handle drawing him at once into the sins of murther and adultery  then that he might not quite give him over tho davids repentance for the last sin kept the devil off for a while when he could attack him no farther personally he fell upon him in his family and made him as miserable as he could desire him to be in his children three of whom he brought to destruction before his face and another after his death  first he tempted ammon to ravish his sister tamar so there was an end of her poor girl as to this world for we never hear any more of her  then he tempted absalom to murther his brother amnon in revenge for tamars maidenhead  then he made joab run absalom thro the body contrary to davids command  and after davids death he brought adonija weak man to the block for usurping king solomons throne  as to absalom he tempted him to rebellion and raising war against his father to the turning him shamefully out of jerusalem and almost out of the kingdom  he tempted him for davids farther mortification to lie with his fathers wives in the face of the whole city and had achitophels honest council been followd he had certainly sent him to sleep with his fathers long before his timebut there satan and achitophel were both outwitted together  thro all the reigns of the several successors of david the devil took care to carry on his own game to the continual insulting the measures which god himself had taken for the establishing his people in the world and especially as a church till at last he so effectually debauchd them to idolatry that crime which of all others was most provoking to god as it was carrying the people away from their allegiance and transposing the homage they owd god their maker to a contemptible block of wood or an image of a brute beast and this how sordid and brutish soever it was in it self yet so did his artifice prevail among them that first or last he brought them all into it the ten tribes as well as the two tribes till at last god himself was provoked to unchurch them gave them up to their enemies and the few that were left of them after incredible slaughters and desolation were hurried away some into tartary and others into babylon from whence very few of that few that were carried away ever found their way home again and some when they might have come would not accept of it but continued there to the very coming of the messiah see epistles of st james and of st peter at the beginning  but to look a little back upon this part for it cannot be omitted it makes so considerable a part of the devils history i mean his drawing gods people kings and all into all the sins and mischiefs which gradually contributed to their destruction  first for he began immediately with the very best and wisest of the race he drew in king solomon in the midst of all his zeal for the building gods house and for the making the most glorious and magnificent appearance for gods worship that ever the world saw i say in the middle of all this he drew him into such immoderate and insatiable an appetite for women as to set up the first and perhaps the greatest seraglio of whores that ever any prince in the world had or pretended to before nay and to bring whoring so much into reputation that as the text says seven hundred of them were princesses that is to say ladies of quality not as the grand seigniors and great moguls other princes of the eastern world have since practised namely to pick up their most beautiful slaves but these it seems were women of rank kings daughters as pharaohs daughter and the daughters of the princes and prime men among the moabites ammonites zidonians hittites c 1 kings xi 1  nor was this all but as he drew him into the love of these forbidden women for such they were as to their nation as well as number so he ensnard him by those women to a familiarity with their worship and by degrees brought that famous prince famous for his wisdom to be the greatest and mostimposdupon old fool in the world bowing down to those idols by the inticing of his whores whom he had abhorrd and detested in his youth as dishonouring that god for whom and for whose worship he had finishd and dedicated the most magnificent building and temple in the world nothing but the invincible subtlety of this arch devil could ever have brought such a man as solomon to such a degeneracy of manners and to such meannesses no not the devil himself without the assistance of his whores nor the whores themselves without the devil to help them  as to solomon satan had made conquest enough there we need hear no more of him the next advance he made was in the person of his son rehoboam had not the devil prompted his pride and tyrannical humour he would never have given the people such an answer as he did and when he saw a fellow at the head of them too whom he knew wanted and waited for an occasion to raise a rebellion and had ripened up the peoples humour to the occasion well might the text call it listening to the council of the young heads that it was indeed with a vengeance but those young heads too were acted by an old devil who for his craft is called as i have observd the old serpent  having thus pavd the way jeroboam revolts so far god had directed him for the text says expressly speaking in the first person of god himself this thing is of me  but tho god might appoint jeroboam to be king that is to say of ten tribes yet god did not appoint him to set up the two calves in the two extreme parts of the land viz in dan and in bethel that was jeroboams own doing and done on purpose to keep the people from falling back to rehoboam by being obliged to go to jerusalem to the publick worship and the text adds jeroboam made israel to sin this was indeed a masterpiece of the devils policy and it was effectual to answer the end nothing could have been more to the purpose what reason he had to expect the people would so universally come into it and be so well satisfied with a couple of calves instead of the true worship of god at jerusalem or what arts and management he satan made use of afterwards to bring the people in to join with such a delusion that we find but little of in all the annals of satan not is it much to the case tis certain the devil found a strange kind of propensity to worshiping idols rooted in the temper of that whole people even from their first breaking away from the egyptian bondage so that he had nothing to do but to work upon the old stock and propagate the crime that he found was so natural to them and this is satans general way of working not with them only but with us also and with all the world even then and ever since  when he had thus securd jeroboams revolt we need not trace him among his successors for the same reason of state that held for the setting up the calves at bethel and dan held good for the keeping them up to all jeroboams posterity nor had they one good king ever after even jehu who calld his friends to come and see his zeal for the lord and who fulfilld the threatnings of god upon ahab and his family and upon queen jezabel and her offspring and knew all the while that he was executing the judgment of the true god upon an idolatrous race yet he would not part with his calves but would have thought it to have been parting with his kingdom and that as the people would have gone up to jerusalem to worship so they would at the same time have transferd their civil obedience to the king of judah whose right it really was as far as they could claim by birth and right line so that by the way satan any more than other politicians is not for the jus divinum of lineal succession or what we call hereditary right any farther than serves for his purpose  thus satan ridded his hands of ten of the twelve tribes let us now see how he went on with the rest for his work was now brought into a narrower compass the church of god was now reducd to two tribes except a few religious people who separated from the schism of jeroboam and came and planted themselves among the tribes of judah and benjamin the first thing the devil did after this was to foment a war between the two kings while judah was governed by a boy or youth abija by name and he none of the best neither but gods time was not come and the devil receivd a great disappointment when jeroboam was so entirely overthrown that if the records of those ages do not mistake no less than 500000 men of israel were killd such a slaughter that one would think the army of judah had they known how to improve as well as gain a victory might have brought all the rest back again and have intirely reducd the house of jeroboam and the ten tribes that followd him to their obedience nay they did take a great deal of the country from them and among the rest bethel it self and yet so cunningly did satan manage that the king of judah who was himself a wicked king and perhaps an idolater in his heart did not take down the golden calf that jeroboam had there no nor destroy the idolatry it self so that in short his victory signified nothing  from hence to the captivity we find the devil busy with the kings of judah especially the best of them as for such as manasseth and those who transgressd by the general tenor of their lives those he had no great trouble with  but such as asa jehoshaphat hezekiah and josiah he hung about them and their courts till he brought every one of them into some mischief or another  as first good king asa of whom the scripture says his heart was perfect all his days yet this subtle spirit that could break in upon him no where else tempted him when the king of israel came out against him to send to hire benhadad the king of syria to help him as if god who had before enabled him to conquer the ethiopians with an army of ten hundred thousand men could not have saved him from the king of the ten tribes  in the same manner he tempted jehoshaphat to join with that wicked king ahab against the king of syria and also to marry his son to ahabs daughter which was fatal to jehoshaphat and to his posterity  again he tempted hezekiah to shew all his riches to the king of babylons messengers and who can doubt but that he satan is to be understood by the wicked spirit which stood before the lord 2 chron xviii 20 and offered his service to entice ahab the king of israel to come out to battle to his ruin by being a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets and who for that time had a special commission as he had another time in the case of job and indeed it was a commission fit for no body but the devil thou shalt entice him and thou shalt also prevail go out and do even so ver 21  even good josiah himself of whom it is recorded that like him there was no king before him neither after him arose there any like him 2 kings xxiii 26 yet the devil never left him with his machinations till finding he could not tempt him to any thing wicked in his government he tempted or movd him to a needless war with the king of egypt in which he lost his life  from the death of this good king the devil prevaild so with the whole nation of the jews and brought them to such an incorrigible pitch of wickedness that god gave them up forsook his habitation of glory the temple which he sufferd to be spoild first then burnt and demolishd destroying the whole nation of the jews except a small number that were left and those the enemy carried away into captivity  nor was he satisfied with this general destruction of the whole people of israel for the ten tribes were gone before but he followd them even into their captivity those that fled away to egypt which they tell us were seventy thousand he first corrupted and then they were destroyed there upon the overthrow of egypt by the same king of babylon  also he went very near to have them rooted out young and old man woman and child who were in captivity in babylon by the ministry of that true agent of hell haman the agagite but there satan met with a disappointment too as in the story of hester which was but the fourth that he had met with in all his management since the creation i say there he was disappointed and his prime minister haman was exalted as he deservd  having thus far traced the government and dominion of the devil from the creation of man to the captivity i think i may call upon him to set up his standard of universal empire at that period it seemd just then as if god had really forsaken the earth and given the entire dominion of mankind up to his outrageous enemy the devil for excepting the few israelites which were left in the territories of the king of babylon and they were but a few i say except among them there was not one corner of the world left where the true god was calld upon or his dominion so much as acknowledgd all the world was buried in idolatry and that of so many horrid kinds that one would think the light of reason should have convincd mankind that he who exacted such bloody sacrifices as that of moloch and such a bloody cutting themselves with knives as the priests of baal did could not be a god a good and beneficent being but must be a cruel voracious and devouring devil whose end was not the good but the destruction of his creatures but to such a height was the blind demented world arrivd to at that time that in these sordid and corrupt ways they went on worshiping dumb idols and offering human sacrifices to them and in a word committing all the most horrid and absurd abominations that they were capable of or that the devil could prompt them to till heaven was again put as it were to the necessity of bringing about a revolution in favour of his own forsaken people by miracle and surprize as he had done before  we come therefore to the restoration or return of the captivity had satan been able to have acted any thing by force as i have observd before all the princes and powers of the world having been as they really were at his devotion he might easily have made use of them armd all the world against the jews and prevented the rebuilding the temple and even the return of the captivity  but now the devils power manifestly received a check and the hand of god appeard in it and that he was resolvd to reestablish his people the jews and to have a second temple built the devil who knew the extent of his own power too well and what limitations were laid upon him stood still as it were looking on and not daring to oppose the return of the captivity which he very well knew had been prophesied and would come to pass  he did indeed make some little opposition to the building and to the fortifying the city but as it was to no purpose so he was soon obligd to give it over and thus the captivity being returnd and the temple rebuilt the people of the jews encreased and multiplied to an infinite number and strength and from this time we may say the power of the devil rather declind and decreasd than went on with success as it had done before it is true the jews fell into sects and errors and divisions of many kinds after the return from the captivity and no doubt the devil had a great hand in those divisions but he could never bring them back to idolatry and his not being able to do that made him turn his hand so many ways to plague and oppress them as particularly by antiochus the great who brought the abomination of desolation into the holy place and there the devil triumphd over them for some time but they were deliverd many ways till at last they came peaceably under the protection rather than the dominion of the roman empire when herod the great governd them as a king and reedified nay almost rebuilt their temple with so great an expence and magnificence that he made it as some say greater and more glorious than that of solomons tho that i take to be a great  fable to say no worse of it  in this condition the jewish church stood when the fullness of time as tis calld in scripture was come and the devil was kept at bay tho he had made some encroachments upon them as above for there was a glorious remnant of saints among them such as old zacharias the father of john the baptist and old simeon who waited for the salvation of israel i say in this condition the jewish church stood when the messiah came into the world which was such another mortal stab to the thrones and principalities infernal as that of which i have spoken already in chap iii at the creation of man and therefore with this i break off the antiquities of the devils history or the antient part of his kingdom for from hence downward we shall find his empire has declind gradually and tho by his wonderful address his prodigious application and the vigilance and fidelity of his instruments as well human as infernal and diabolical and of the human as well the ecclesiastick as the secular he has many times retrievd what he has lost and sometimes bid fair for recovering the universal empire he once possessd over mankind yet he has been still defeated again repulst and beaten back and his kingdom has greatly declind in many parts of the world and especially in the northern parts except great britain and how he has politically maintaind his interest and encreased his dominion among the wise and righteous generation that we cohabit with and among will be the subject of the modern part of satans history and of which we are next to give an account       part ii   of the   modern history   of the   devil   chap i   i have examined the antiquities of satans history in the former part of this work and brought his affairs down from the creation as far as to our blessed christian times especially to the coming of the messiah when one would think the devil could have nothing to do among us i have indeed but touchd at some things which might have admitted of a farther description of satans affairs and the particulars of which we may all come to a farther knowledge of hereafter yet i think i have spoken to the material part of his conduct as it relates to his empire in this world what has happend to his more sublimated government and his angelic capacities i shall have an occasion to touch at in several solid particulars as we go along  the messiah was now born the fulness of time was come that the old serpent was to have his head broken that is to say his empire or dominion over man which he gaind by the fall of our first father and mother in paradise receivd a downfal or overthrow  it is worth observing in order to confirm what i have already mentiond of the limitation of satans power that not only his angelic strength seems to have received a farther blow upon the coming of the son of god into the world but he seems to have had a blow upon his intellects his serpentine craft and devillike subtilty seems to have been circumscribd and cut short and instead of his being so cunning a fellow as before when as i said tis evident he outwitted all mankind not only eve cain noah lot and all the patriarchs but even nations of men and that in their publick capacity and thereby led them into absurd and ridiculous things such as the building of babel and deifying and worshiping their kings when dead and rotten idolizing beasts stocks stones any thing and even nothing and in a word when he managd mankind just as he pleased  now and from this time forward he appeared a weak foolish ignorant devil compard to what he was before he was upon almost every occasion resisted disappointed baulkd and defeated especially in all his attempts to thwart or cross the mission and ministry of the messiah while he was upon earth and sometimes upon other and very mean occasions too  and first how foolish a project was it and how below satans celebrated artifice in like cases to put herod upon sending to kill the poor innocent children in bethlehem in hopes to destroy the infant for i take it for granted it was the devil put into herods thoughts that execution how simple and foolish soever now we must allow him to be very ignorant of the nativity himself or else he might easily have guided his friend herod to the place where the infant was  this shews that either the devil is in general ignorant as we are of what is to come in the world before it is really come to pass and consequently can foretel nothing no not so much as our famous old merlin or mother shipton did or else that great event was hid from him by an immediate power superior to his which i cannot think neither considering how much he was concernd in it and how certainly he knew that it was once to come to pass  but be that as it will tis certain the devil knew nothing where christ was born or when nor was he able to direct herod to find him out and therefore put him upon that foolish as well as cruel order to kill all the children that he might be sure to destroy the messiah among the rest  the next simple step that the devil took and indeed the most foolish one that he could ever be chargd with unworthy the very dignity of a devil and below the understanding that he always was allowd to act with was that of coming to tempt the messiah in the wilderness it is certain and he ownd it himself afterwards upon many occasions that the devil knew our saviour to be the son of god and tis as certain that he knew that as such he could have no power or advantage over him how foolish then was it in him to attack him in that manner if thou beest the son of god why he knew him to be the son of god well enough he said so afterwards i know thee who thou art the holy one of god how then could he be so weak a devil as to say if thou art then do so and so  the case is plain the devil tho he knew him to be the son of god did not fully know the mystery of the incarnation nor did he know how far the inanition of christ extended and whether as man he was not subject to fall as adam was tho his reservd godhead might be still immaculate and pure and upon this foot as he would leave no method untried he attempts him three times one immediately after another but then finding himself disappointed he fled  this evidently proves that the devil was ignorant of the great mystery of godliness as the text calls it god manifest in the flesh and therefore made that foolish attempt upon christ thinking to have conquerd his human nature as capable of sin which it was not and at this repulse hell groand the whole army of regimented devils receivd a wound and felt the shock of it twas a second overthrow to them they had had a long chain of success carried a devilish conquest over the greatest part of the creation of god but now they were cut short the seed of the woman was now come to break the serpents head that is to cut short his power to contract the limits of his kingdom and in a word to dethrone him in the world no doubt the devil receivd a shock for you find him always afterward crying out in a horrible manner whenever christ met with him or else very humble and submissive as when he beggd leave to go into the herd of swine a thing he has often done since  defeated here the first stratagem i find him concernd in after it was his entring into judas and putting him upon betraying christ to the chief priest but here again he was entirely mistaken for he did not see as much a devil as he was what the event would be but when he came to know that if christ was put to death he would become a propitiatory and be the great sacrifice of mankind so to rescue the fallen race from that death they had incurrd the penalty of by the fall that this was the fulfilling of all scripture prophesy and that thus it was that christ was to be the end of the law i say as soon as he perceivd this he strove all he could to prevent it and disturbd pilates wife in her sleep in order to set her upon her husband to hinder his delivering him up to the jews for then and not till then he knew how christ was to vanquish hell by the power of his cross  thus the devil was disappointed and exposed in every step he took and as he now plainly saw his kingdom declining and even the temporal kingdom of christ rising up upon the ruins of his satans power he seemd to retreat into his own region the air and to consult there with his fellow devils what measures he should take next to preserve his dominion among men here it was that he resolvd upon that truly hellish thing calld persecution by which tho he provd a foolish devil in that too he flatterd himself he should be able to destroy gods church and root out its professors from the earth even almost as soon as it was establishd whereas on the contrary heaven counteracted him there too and tho he armd the whole roman empire against the christians that is say the whole world and they were fallen upon every where with all the fury and rage of some of the most flaming tyrants that the world ever saw of whom nero was the first yet in spight of hell god made all the blood which the devil causd to be spilt to be semen ecclesiæ and the devil had the mortification to see that the number of christians encreased even under the very means he made use of to root them out and destroy them this was the case thro the reign of all the roman emperors for the first three hundred years after christ  having thus tried all the methods that best suited his inclination i mean those of blood and death complicated with tortures and all kinds of cruelty and that for so long a stage of time as above the devil all on a suddain as if glutted with blood and satiated with destruction sits still and becomes a peaceable spectator for a good while as if he either found himself unable or had no disposition to hinder the progress of christianity in the first ages of its settlement in the world in this interval the christian church was establishd under constantine religion flourished in peace and under the most perfect tranquillity the devil seemd to be at a loss what he should do next and things began to look as if satans kingdom was at an end but he soon let them see that he was the same indefatigable devil that ever he was and the prosperity of the church gave him a large field of action for knowing the disposition of mankind to quarrel and dispute the universal passion rooted in nature especially among the churchmen for precedency and dominion he fell to work with them immediately so that turning the tables and reassuming the subtilty and craft which i say he seemd to have lost in the former four hundred years he gaind more ground in the next ages of the church and went farther towards restoring his power and empire in the world and towards overthrowing that very church which was so lately establishd than all he had done by fire and blood before  his policy now seemd to be edgd with resentment for the mistakes he had made as if the devil looking back with anger at himself to see what a fool he had been to expect to crush religion by persecution rejoycd for having discoverd that liberty and dominion was the only way to ruin the church not fire and faggot and that he had nothing to do but to give the zealous people their utmost liberty in religion only sowing error and variety of opinion among them and they would bring fire and faggot in fast enough among themselves  it must be confessd these were devilish politicks and so sure was the aim and so certain was the devil to hit his mark by them that we find he not only did not fail then but the same hellish methods have prevaild still and will do so to the end of the world nor had the devil ever a better game to play than this for the ruin of religion as we shall have room to show in many examples besides that of the dissenters in england who are evidently weakend by the late toleration whether the devil had any hand in baiting his hook with an a of parliament or no history is silent but tis too evident he has catchd the fish by it and if the honest church of england does not in pity and christian charity to the dissenters straighten her hand a little i cannot but fear the devil will gain his point and the dissenter will be undone by it  upon this new foot of politicks the devil began with the emperors themselves arius the father of the hereticks of that age having broachd his opinions and athanasius the orthodox bishop of the east opposing him the devil no sooner saw the door open to strife and imposition but he thrust himself in and raising the quarrel up to a suited degree of rage and spleen he involvd the good emperor himself in it first and athanasius was banishd and recalld and banishd and recalld again several times as error ran high and as the devil either got or lost ground after constantine the next emperor was a child of his own arian and then the court came all into the quarrel as courts often do and then the arians and the orthodox persecuted one another as furiously as the pagans persecuted them all before to such a height the devil brought his conquest in the very infancy of the question and so much did he prevail over the true christianity of the primitive church even before they had enjoyd the liberty of the pure worship twenty years  flushd with this success the devil made one push for the restoring paganism and bringing on the old worship of the heathen idols and temples but like our king james ii he drove too hard and julian had so provokd the whole roman empire which was generally at that time become christian that had the apostate livd he would not have been able to have held the throne and as he was cut off in his beginning paganism expird with him and the devil himself might have cryd out as julian did and with much more propriety vicisti galileane  jovian the next emperor being a glorious christian and a very good and great man the devil abdicated for a while and left the christian armies to reestablish the orthodox faith nor could he bring the christians to a breach again among themselves a great while after  however time and a diligent devil did the work at last and when the emperors concerning themselves one way or other did not appear sufficient to answer his end he changd hands again and went to work with the clergy to set the doctors effectually together by the ears he threw in the new notion of primacy among them for a bone of contention the bait took the priests swallowd it eagerly down and the devil a cunninger fisherman than ever st peter was struck them as the anglers call it with a quick hand and hung them fast upon the hook  having them thus in his clutches and they being now as we may say his own they took their measures afterwards from him and most obediently followd his directions nay i will not say but he may have had pretty much the management of the whole society ever since of what profession or party soever they may have been with exception only to the reverend and right reverend among our selves  the sacred as above being thus hookd in and the devil being at the head of their affairs matters went on most gloriously his own way first the bishops fell to bandying and partymaking for the superiority as heartily as ever temporal tyrants did for dominion and took as black and devilish methods to carry it on as the worst of those tyrants ever had done before them  at last satan declard for the roman pontiff and that upon excellent conditions in the reign of the emperor mauritius for boniface who had long contended for the title of supreme fell into a treaty with phocas captain of the emperors guards whether the bargain was from hell or not let any one judge the conditions absolutely entitle the devil to the honour of making the contract viz that phocas first murthering his master the emperor and his sons boniface should countenance the treason and declare him emperor and in return phocas should acknowledge the primacy of the church of rome and declare boniface universal bishop a blessed compact which at once set the devil at the head of affairs in the christian world as well spiritual as temporal ecclesiastick and civil since the conquest over eve in paradise by which death and the devil hand in hand establishd their first empire upon earth the devil never gaind a more important point than he gaind at this time  he had indeed prospered in his affairs tolerably well for some time before this and his interest among the clergy had got ground for some ages but that was indeed a secret management was carried on privately and with difficulty as in sowing discord and faction among the people perplexing the councils of their princes and secretly wheedling in with the dignified clergy  also he had raised abundance of little churchrebellions by setting up hereticks of several kinds and raising them favourers among the clergy such as ebion cerinthius pelagius and others  he had drawn in the bishops of rome to set up the ridiculous pageantry of the key and while he the devil set open the gates of hell to them all set them upon locking up the gates of heaven and giving the bishop the key a cheat which as gross as it was the devil so gilded over or so blinded the age to receive it that like gideons ephod all the catholick world went a whoring after the idol and the bishop of rome sent more fools to the devil by it than ever he pretended to let into heaven though he opend the door as wide as his key was able to do  the story of this key being given to the bishop of rome by st peter who by the way never had it himself and of its being lost by somebody or other the devil it seems did not tell them who and its being found again by a lombard soldier in the army of king antharis who attempting to cut it with his knife was miraculously forced to direct the wound to himself and cut his own throat that king antharis and his nobles happened to see the fellow do it and were converted to christianity by it and that the king sent the key with another made like it to pope pelagius then bishop of rome who thereupon assumd the power of opening and shutting heavens gates and he afterwards setting a price or toll upon the entrance as we do here at passing a turnpike these fine things i say were successfully managed for some years before this i am now speaking of and the devil got a great deal of ground by it too but now he triumphd openly and having set up a murtherer upon the temporal throne and a church emperor upon the ecclesiastic throne and both of his own choosing the devil may be said to begin his new kingdom from this epocha and call it the restoration  since this time indeed the devils affairs went very merrily on and the clergy brought so many gewgaws into their worship and such devilish principles were mixt with that which we calld the christian faith that in a word from this time the bishop of rome commencd whore of babylon in all the most express terms that could be imagind tyranny of the worst sort crept into the pontificate errors of all sorts into the profession and they proceeded from one thing to another till the very popes for so the bishop of rome was now called by way of distinction i say the popes themselves their spiritual guides professd openly to confederate with the devil and to carry on a personal and private correspondence with him at the same time taking upon them the title of christs vicar and the infallible guide of the consciences of christians  this we have sundry instances of in some merry popes who if fame lies not were sorcerers magicians had familiar spirits and immediate conversation with the devil as well visibly as invisibly and by this means became what we call devils incarnate upon this account it is that i have left the conversation that passes between devils and men to this place as well because i believe it differs much now in his modern state from what it was in his ancient state and therefore that which most concerns us belongs rather to this part of his history as also because as i am now writing to the present age i choose to bring the most significant parts of his history especially as they relate to our selves into that part of time that we are most concernd in  the devil had once as i observd before the universal monarchy or government of mankind in himself and i doubt not but in that flourishing state of his affairs he governed them like what he is viz an absolute tyrant during this theocracy of his for satan is calld the god of this world he did not familiarize himself to mankind so much as he finds occasion to do now there was not then so much need of it he governed then with an absolute sway he had his oracles where he gave audience to his votaries like a deity and he had his subgods who under his several dispositions receivd the homage of mankind in their names such were all the rabble of the heathen deities from jupiter the supreme to the lares or houshold gods of every family these i say like residents received the prostrations but the homage was all satans the devil had the substance of it all which was the idolatry  during this administration of hell there was less witchcraft less true literal magick than there has been since there was indeed no need of it the devil did not stoop to the mechanism of his more modern operations but ruld as a deity and receivd the vows and the bows of his subjects in more state and with more solemnity whereas since that he is content to employ more agents and take more pains himself too now he runs up and down hackney in the world more like a drudge than a prince and much more than he did then  hence all those things we call apparitions and visions of ghosts familiarspirits and dealings with the devil of which there is so great a variety in the world at this time were not so much known among the people in those first ages of the devils kingdom in a word the devil seems to be put to his shifts and to fly to art and stratagem for the carrying on his affairs much more now than he did then  one reason for this may be that he has been more discoverd and exposd in these ages than he was before then he could appear in the world in his own proper shapes and yet not be known when the sons of god appeard at the divine summons satan came along with them but now he has plaid so many scurvy tricks upon men and they know him so well that he is obligd to play quite out of sight and act in disguise mankind will allow nothing of his doing and hear nothing of his saying in his own name and if you propose any thing to be done and it be but said the devil is to help in the doing it or if you say of any man he deals with the devil or the devil has a hand in it every body flies him and shuns him as the most frightful thing in the world  nay if any thing strange and improbable be done or related to be done we presently say the devil was at the doing it thus the great ditch at newmarket heath is calld the devils ditch so the devil built crowland abby and the whisperingplace in gloucester cathedral nay the cave at castleton only because theres no getting to the farther end of it is calld the devils a and the like the poor people of wiltshire when you ask them how the great stones at stonehenge were brought thither theyll all tell you the devil brought them if any mischief extraordinary befalls us we presently say the devil was in it and the devil would have it so in a word the devil has got an ill name among us and so he is fain to act more in tenebris more incog than he used to do play out of sight himself and work by the sap as the engineers call it and not openly and avowedly in his own name and person as formerly tho perhaps not with less success than he did before and this leads me to enquire more narrowly into the manner of the devils management of his affairs since the christian religion began to spread in the world which manifestly differs from his conduct in more antient times in which if we discover some of the most consummate fools policy the most profound simple craft and the most subtle shallow management of things that can by our weak understandings be conceivd we must only resolve it into this that in short it is the devil     chap ii  of hell as it is represented to us and how the devil is to be      understood as being personally in hell when at the same time we      find him at liberty ranging over the world   it is true as that learnd and pleasant author the inimitable dr brown says the devil is his own hell one of the most constituting parts of his infelicity is that he cannot act upon mankind brevi manu by his own inherent power as well as rage that he cannot unhinge this creation which as i have observd in its place he had the utmost aversion to from its beginning as it was a stated design in the creator to supply his place in heaven with a new species of beings calld man and fill the vacancies occasiond by his degeneracy and rebellion  this filld him with rage inexpressible and horrible resolutions of revenge and the impossibility of executing those resolutions torments him with despair this added to what he was before makes him a compleat devil with a hell in his own breast and a fire unquenchable burning about his heart  i might enlarge here and very much to the purpose in describing spherically and mathematically that exquisite quality calld a devilish spirit in which it would naturally occur to give you a whole chapter upon the glorious articles of malice and envy and especially upon that luscious delightful triumphant passion calld revenge how natural to man nay even to both sexes how pleasant in the very contemplation tho there be not just at that time a power of execution how palatable it is in it self and how well it relishes when dishd up with its proper sauces such as plot contrivance scheme and confederacy all leading on to execution how it possesses a human soul in all the most sensible parts how it empowers mankind to sin in imagination as effectually to all future intents and purposes damnation as if he had sinned actually how safe a practice it is too as to punishment in this life namely that it empowers us to cut throats clear of the gallows to slander virtue reproach innocence wound honour and stab reputation and in a word to do all the wicked things in the world out of the reach of the law  it would also require some few words to describe the secret operations of those nice qualities when they reach the human soul how effectually they form a hell within us and how imperceptibly they assimilate and transform us into devils meer human devils as really devils as satan himself or any of his angels and that therefore tis not so much out of the way as some imagine to say such a man is an incarnate devil for as crime made satan a devil who was before a bright immortal seraph or angel of light how much more easily may the same crime make the same devil tho every way meaner and more contemptible of a man or a woman either but this is too grave a subject for me at this time  the devil being thus i say fird with rage and envy in consequence of his jealousy upon the creation of man his torment is encreased to the highest by the limitation of his power and his being forbid to act against mankind by force of arms this is i say part of his hell which as above is within him and which he carries with him wherever he goes nor is it so difficult to conceive of hell or of the devil either under this just description as it is by all the usual notions that we are taught to entertain of them by the old women our instructors for every man may by taking but a common view of himself and making a just scrutiny into his own passions on some of their particular excursions see a hell within himself and himself a meer devil as long as the inflammation lasts and that as really and to all intents and purposes as if he had the angel satan before his face in his locality and personality that is to say all devil and monster in his person and an immaterial but intense fire flaming about and from within him at all the pores of his body  the notions we receive of the devil as a person being in hell as a place are infinitely absurd and ridiculous the first we are certain is not true in fact because he has a certain liberty however limited that is not to the purpose is daily visible and to be tracd in his several attacks upon mankind and has been so ever since his first appearance in paradise as to his corporal visibility that is not the present question neither tis enough that we can hunt him by the foot that we can follow him as hounds do a fox upon a hot scent we can see him as plainly by the effect by the mischief he does and more by the mischief he puts us upon doing i say as plainly as if we saw him by the eye  it is not to be doubted but the devil can see us when and where we cannot see him and as he has a personality tho it be spirituous he and his angels too may be reasonably supposed to inhabit the world of spirits and to have free access from thence to the regions of life and to pass and repass in the air as really tho not perceptible to us as the spirits of men do after their release from the body pass to the place wherever that is which is appointed for them  if the devil was confind to a place hell as a prison he could then have no business here and if we pretend to describe hell as not a prison but that the devil has liberty to be there or not be there as he pleased then he would certainly never be there or hell is not such a place as we are taught to understand it to be  indeed according to some hell should be a place of fire and torment to the souls that are cast into it but not to the devils themselves who we make little more or less than keepers and turnkeys to hell as a goal that they are sent about to bring souls thither lock them in when they come and then away upon the scent to fetch more that one sort of devils are made to live in the world among men and to be busy continually debauching and deluding mankind bringing them as it were to the gates of hell and then another sort are porters and carriers to fetch them in  this is in short little more or less than the old story of pluto of cerberus and of charon only that our tale is not half so well told nor the parts of the fable so well laid together  in all these notions of hell and devil the torments of the first and the agency of the last tormenting we meet with not one word of the main and perhaps only accent of horror which belongs to us to judge of about hell i mean the absence of heaven expulsion and exclusion from the presence and face of the chief ultimate the only eternal and sufficient good and this loss sustaind by a sordid neglect of our concern in that excellent part in exchange for the most contemptible and justly condemnd trifles and all this eternal and irrecoverable these people tell us nothing of the eternal reproaches of conscience the horror of desperation and the anguish of a mind hopeless of ever seeing the glory which alone constitutes heaven and which makes all other places dreadful and even darkness it self  and this brings me directly to the point in hand viz the state of that hell which we ought to have in view when we speak of the devil as in hell this is the very hell which is the torment of the devil in short the devil is in hell and hell is in the devil he is filld with this unquenchable fire he is expeld the place of glory banishd from the regions of light absence from the life of all beatitude is his curse despair is the reigning passion in his mind and all the little constituent parts of his torment such as rage envy malice and jealousy are consolidated in this to make his misery compleat viz the duration of it all the eternity of his condition that he is without hope without redemption without recovery  if any thing can inflame this hell and make it hotter tis this only and this does add an inexpressible horror to the devil himself namely the seeing man the only creature he hates placed in a state of recovery a glorious establishment of redemption formd for him in heaven and the scheme of it perfected on earth by which this man tho even the devil by his art may have deluded him and drawn him into crime is yet in a state of recovery which the devil is not and that it is not in his satans power to prevent it now take the devil as he is in his own nature angelic a bright immortal seraph heavenborn and having tasted the eternal beatitude which these are appointed to enjoy the loss of that state to himself the possession of it granted to his rival tho wicked like and as himself i say take the devil as he is having a quick sense of his own perdition and a stinging sight of his rivals felicity tis hell enough and more than enough even for an angel to support nothing we can conceive can be worse  as to any other fire than this such and so immaterially intense as to torment a spirit which is it self fire also i will not say it cannot be because to infinite every thing is possible but i must say i cannot conceive rightly of it  i will not enter here into the wisdom or reasonableness of representing the torments of hell to be fire and that fire to be a commixture of flame and sulphur it has pleased god to let the horror of those eternal agonies about a lost heaven be laid before us by those similitudes or allegories which are most moving to our senses and to our understandings nor will i dispute the possibility much less will i doubt but that there is to be a consummation of misery to all the objects of misery when the devils kingdom in this world ending with the world it self that liberty he has now may be farther abridgd when he may be returnd to the same state he was in between the time of his fall and the creation of the world with perhaps some additional vengeance on him such as at present we cannot describe for all that treason and those high crimes and misdemeanours which he has been guilty of here in his conversation with mankind  as his infelicity will be then consummated and compleated so the infelicity of that part of mankind who are condemnd with him may receive a considerable addition from those words in their sentence to be tormented with the devil and his angels for as the absence of the supreme good is a compleat hell so the hated company of the deceiver who was the great cause of his ruine must be a subject of additional horror and he will be always saying as a scots gentleman who died of his excesses said to the famous dr p who came to see him on his deathbed but had been too much his companion in his life    o tu fundamenta jecisti   i would not treat the very subject it self with any indecency nor do i think my opinion of that hell which i say consists in the absence of him in whom is heaven one jot less solemn than theirs who believe it all fire and brimstone but i must own that to me nothing can be more ridiculous than the notions that we entertain and fill our heads with about hell and about the devils being there tormenting of souls broiling them upon gridirons hanging them up upon hooks carrying them upon their backs and the like with the several pictures of hell represented by a great mouth with horrible teeth gaping like a cave on the sides of a mountain suppose that appropriated to satan in the peak which indeed is not much unlike it with a stream of fire coming out of it as there is of water and smaller devils going and coming continually in and out to fetch and carry souls the lord knows whither and for the lord knows what  these things however intended for terror are indeed so ridiculous that the devil himself to be sure mocks at them and a man of sense can hardly refrain doing the like only i avoid it because i would not give offence to weaker heads  however i must not compliment the brains of other men at the expence of my own or talk nonsense because they can understand no other i think all these notions and representations of hell and of the devil to be as prophane as they are ridiculous and i ought no more to talk prophanely than merrily of them  let us learn to talk of these things then as we should do and as we really cannot describe them to our reason and understanding why should we describe them to our senses we had i think much better not describe them at all that is to say not attempt it the blessed apostle st paul was as he said himself carried up or caught up into the third heaven yet when he came down again he could neither tell what he heard or describe what he saw all he could say of it was that what he heard was inutterable and what he saw was inconceivable  it is the same thing as to the state of the devil in those regions which he now possesses and where he now more particularly inhabits my present business then is not to enter into those grave things so as to make them ridiculous as i think most people do that talk of them but as the devil let his residence be where it will has evidently free leave to come and go not into this world only i mean the region of our atmosphere but for ought we know to all the other inhabited worlds which god has made whereever they are and by whatsoever names they are or may be known or distinguished for if he is not confined in one place we have no reason to believe he is excluded from any place heaven only excepted from whence he was expelld for his treason and rebellion  his liberty then being thus ascertaind three things seem to be material for us to give an account of in order to form this part of his history       1 what his business is on this globe of earth which we vulgarly      call the world how he acts among us what affairs mankind and he      have together and how far his conduct here relates to us and ours      is or may be influencd by him       2 where his principal residence is and whether he has not a      particular empire of his own to which he retreats upon proper      occasions where he entertains his friends when they come under his      particular administration and where when he gets any victory over      his enemies he carries his prisoners of war       3 what may probably be the great business this black emperor has      at present upon his hands either in this world or out of it and      by what agents he works   as these things may perhaps run promiscuously thro the course of this whole work and frequently be touchd at under other branches of the devils history so i do not propose them as heads of chapters or particular sections for the order of discourse to be handled apart for by the way as satans actings have not been the most regular things in the world so in our discourse about him it must not be expected that we can always tie our selves down to order and regularity either as to time or place or persons for satan being hic  ubique a loose ungovernd fellow we must be content to trace him where we can find him  it is true in the foregoing chapter i shewd you the devil entred into the herd ecclesiastick and gave you some account of the first successful step he took with mankind since the christian epocha how having secretly managed both temporal and spiritual power apart and by themselves he now united them in point of management and brought the church usurpation and the armys usurpation together the pope to bless the general in deposing and murthering his master the emperor and the general to recognise the pope in dethroning his master christ jesus  from this time forward you are to allow the devil a mystical empire in this world not an action of moment done without him not a treason but he has a hand in it not a tyrant but he prompts him not a government but he has a  in it not a fool but he tickles him not a knave but he guides him he has a finger in every fraud a key to every cabinet from the divan at constantinople to the mississipi in france and to the southsea cheats at  from the first attack upon the christian world in the person of the romish antichrist down to the bull unigenitus and from the mixture of st peter and confucius in china to the holy office in spain and down to the emlins and dodwells of the current age  how he has managed and does manage and how in all probability he will manage till his kingdom shall come to a period and how at last he will probably be managed himself enquire within and you shall know farther     chap iii  of the manner of satans acting and carrying on his affairs in this      world and particularly of his ordinary workings in the dark by      possession and agitation   the devil being thus reducd to act upon mankind by stratagem only it remains to enquire how he performs and which way he directs his attacks the faculties of man are a kind of a garrison in a strong castle which as they defend it on the one hand under the command of the reasoning power of mans soul so they are prescribed on the other hand and cant sally out without leave for the governor of a fort does not permit his soldiers to hold any correspondence with the enemy without special order and direction now the great enquiry before us is how comes the devil to a parley with us how does he converse with our senses and with the understanding how does he reach us which way does he come at the affections and which way does he move the passions tis a little difficult to discover this treasonable correspondence and that difficulty is indeed the devils advantage and for ought i see the chief advantage he has over mankind  it is also a great enquiry here whether the devil knows our thoughts or no if i may give my opinion i am with the negative i deny that he knows any thing of our thoughts except of those thoughts which he puts us upon thinking for i will not doubt but he has the art to inject thoughts and to revive dormant thoughts in us it is not so wild a scheme as some take it to be that mr milton lays down to represent the devil injecting corrupt desires and wandring thoughts into the head of eve by dreams and that he brought her to dream whatever he put into her thoughts by whispering to her vocally when she was asleep and to this end he imagines the devil laying himself close to her ear in the shape of a toad when she was fall asleep i say this is not so wild a scheme seeing even now if you can whisper any thing close to the ear of a person in a deep sleep so as to speak distinctly to the person and yet not awaken him as has been frequently tried the person sleeping shall dream distinctly of what you say to him nay shall dream the very words you say  we have then no more to ask but how the devil can convey himself to the ear of a sleeping person and it is granted then that he may have power to make us dream what he pleases but this is not all for if he can so forcibly by his invisible application cause us to dream what he pleases why can he not with the same facility prompt our thoughts whether sleeping or waking to dream is nothing else but to think sleeping and we have abundance of deepheaded gentlemen among us who give us ample testimony that they dream waking  but if the devil can prompt us to dream that is to say to think yet if he does not know our thoughts how then can he tell whether the whisper had its effect the answer is plain the devil like the angler baits the hook if the fish bite he lies ready to take the advantage he whispers to the imagination and then waits to see how it works as naomi said to ruth chap iii 5 18 sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be at rest until he have finished the thing thus when the devil had whisperd to eve in her sleep according to milton and suggested mischief to her imagination he only sat still to see how the matter would work for he knew if it took with her he should hear more of it and then by finding her alone the next day without her ordinary guard her husband he presently concluded she had swallowed the bait and so attackd her afresh  a small deal of craft and less by far than we have reason to believe the devil is master of will serve to discover whether such and such thoughts as he knows he has suggested have taken place or no the action of the person presently discovers it at least to him that lies always upon the watch and has every word every gesture every step we take subsequent to his operation open to him it may therefore for ought we know be a great mistake and what most of us are guilty of to tell our dreams to one another in the morning after we have been disturbd with them in the night for if the devil converses with us so insensibly as some are of the opinion he does that is to say if he can hear as far as we can see we may be telling our story to him indeed when we think we are only talking to one another  this brings me most naturally to the important enquiry whether the devil can walk about the world invisibly or no the truth is this is no question to me for as i have taken away his visibility already and have denied him all prescience of futurity too and have provd he cannot know our thoughts nor put any force upon persons or actions if we should take away his invisibility too we should undevil him quite to all intents and purposes as to any mischief he could do nay it would banish him the world and he might een go and seek his fortune some where else for if he could neither be visible or invisible neither act in publick or in private he could neither have business or being in this sphere nor could we be any way concernd with him  the devil therefore most certainly has a power and liberty of moving about in this world after some manner or another this is verifyd as well by way of allegory as by way of history in the scripture it self and as the first strongly suggests and supposes it to be so the last positively asserts it and not to croud this work with quotations from a book which we have not much to do with in the devils story at least not much to his satisfaction i only hint his personal appearance to our saviour in the wilderness where it is said the devil taketh him up to an exceeding high mountain and in another place the devil departed from him what shape or figure he appeard in we do not find mentioned but i cannot doubt his appearing to him there any more than i can his talking to our saviour in the mouths and with the voices of the several persons who were under the terrible affliction of an actual possession  these things leave us no room to doubt of what is advanced above namely that he the devil has a certain residence or liberty of residing in and moving about upon the surface of this earth as well as in the compass of the atmosphere vulgarly calld the air in some manner or other that is the general  it remains to enquire into the manner which i resolve into two kinds       1 ordinary which i suppose to be his invisible motions as a      spirit under which consideration i suppose him to have an      unconfind unlimited unrestraind liberty as to the manner of      acting and this either in persons by possession or in things by      agitation       2 extraordinary which i understand to be his appearances in      borrowed shapes and bodies or shadows rather of bodies assuming      speech figure posture and several powers of which we can give      little or no account in which extraordinary manner of appearances      he is either limited by a superior power or limits himself      politically as being not the way most for his interest or purpose      to act in his business which is more effectually done in his state      of obscurity   hence we must suppose the devil has it very much in his own choice whether to act in one capacity or in the other or in both that is to say of appearing and not appearing as he finds for his purpose in this state of invisibility and under the operation of these powers and liberties he performs all his functions and offices as devil as prince of darkness as god of this world as tempter accuser deceiver and all whatsoever other names of office or titles of honour he is known by  now taking him in this large unlimited or little limited state of action he is well calld the god of this world for he has very much of the attribute of omnipresence and may be said either by himself or his agents to be every where and see every thing that is to say every thing that is visible for i cannot allow him any share of omniscience at all  that he ranges about every where is with us and sometimes in us sees when he is not seen hears when he is not heard comes in without leave and goes out without noise is neither to be shut in or shut out that when he runs from us we cant catch him and when he runs after us we cant escape him is seen when he is not known and is known when he is not seen all these things and more we have knowledge enough about to convince us of the truth of them so that as i have said above he is certainly walking to and fro thro the earth c after some manner or other and in some figure or other visible or invisible as he finds occasion now in order to make our history of him complete the next question before us is how and in what manner he acts with mankind how his kingdom is carried on and by what methods he does his business for he certainly has a great deal of business to do he is not an idle spectator nor is he walking about incognito and clothd in mist and darkness purely in kindness to us that we should not be frighted at him but tis in policy that he may act undiscoverd that he may see and not be seen may play his game in the dark and not be detected in his roguery that he may prompt mischief raise tempests blow up coals kindle strife embroil nations use instruments and not be known to have his hand in any thing when at the same time he really has a hand in every thing  some are of opinion and i among the rest that if the devil was personally and visibly present among us and we conversed with him face to face we should be so familiar with him in a little time that his ugly figure would not affect us at all that his terrors would not fright us or that we should any more trouble our selves about him than we did with the last great comet in 1678 which appeard so long and so constantly without any particular known event that at last we took no more notice of it than of the other ordinary stars which had appeard before we or our ancestors were born  nor indeed should we have much reason to be frighted at him or at least none of those silly things could be said of him which we now amuse our selves about and by which we set him up like a scarecrow to fright children and old women to fill up old stories make songs and ballads and in a word carry on the low prizd buffoonery of the common people we should either see him in his angelic form as he was from the original or if he has any deformities entaild upon him by the supreme sentence and in justice to the deformity of his crime they would be of a superior nature and fitted more for our contempt as well as horror than those weak fancied trifles contrived by our antient devilraisers and devilmakers to feed the wayward fancies of old witches and sorcerers who cheated the ignorant world with a devil of their own making set forth in terrorem with bats wings horns cloven foot long tail forkd tongue and the like  in the next place be his frightful figure what it would and his legions as numerous as the host of heaven we should see him still as the prince of devils tho monstrous as a dragon flaming as a comet tall as a mountain yet dragging his chain after him equal to the utmost of his supposed strength always in custody of his jailors the angels his power overpowerd his rage cowd and abated or at least awd and under correction limited and restraind in a word we should see him a vanquishd slave his spirit broken his malice tho not abated yet handcuffd and overpowerd and he not able to work any thing against us by force so that he would be to us but like the lions in the tower encagd and lockd up unable to do the hurt he wishes to do and that we fear or indeed any hurt at all  from hence tis evident that tis not his business to be public or to walk up and down in the world visibly and in his own shape his affairs require a quite different management as might be made apparent from the nature of things and the manner of our actings as men either with our selves or to one another  nor could he be serviceable in his generation as a public person as now he is or answer the end of his party who employ him and who if he was to do their business in public as he does in private would not be able to employ him at all  as in our modern meetings for the propagation of impudence and other virtues there would be no entertainment and no improvement for the good of the age if the people did not all appear in masque and conceald from the common observation so neither could satan from whose management those more happy assemblies are taken as copies of a glorious original perform the usual and necessary business of his profession if he did not appear wholly in covert and under needful disguises how but for the convenience of his habit could he call himself into so many shapes act on so many different scenes and turn so many wheels of state in the world as he has done as a meer professd devil he could do nothing  had he been obligd always to act the meer devil in his own clothes and with his own shape appearing uppermost in all cafes and places he could never have preachd in so many pulpits presided in so many councils voted in so many committees sat in so many courts and influencd so many parties and factions in church and state as we have reason to believe he has done in our nation and in our memories too as well as in other nations and in more antient times the share satan has had in all the weighty confusions of the times ever since the first ages of christianity in the world has been carried on with so much secresy and so much with an air of cabal and intrigue that nothing can have been managd more subtilly and closely and in the same manner has he acted in our times in order to conceal his interest and conceal the influence he has had in the councils of the world  had it been possible for him to have raised the flames of rebellion and war so often in this nation as he certainly has done could he have agitated the parties on both sides and inflamd the spirits of three nations if he had appears in his own dress a meer naked devil it is not the devil as a devil that does the mischief but the devil in masquerade satan in full disguise and acting at the head of civil confusion and distraction  if history may be credited the french court at the time of our old confusions was made the scene of satans politicks and prompted both parties in england and in scotland also to quarrel and how was it done will any man offer to scandalize the devil so much as to say or so much as to suggest that satan had no hand in it all did not the devil by the agency of cardinal richlieu send 400000 crowns at one time and 600000 at another to the scots to raise an army and march boldly into england and did not the same devil at the same time by other agents remit 800000 crowns to the other party in order to raise an army to fall upon the scots nay did not the devil with the same subtilty send down the archbishops order to impose the servicebook upon the people in scotland and at the same time raise a mob against it in the great church at st giless nay did not he actually in the person of an old woman his favourite instrument throw the threelegd stool at the servicebook and animate the zealous people to take up arms for religion and turn rebels for god sake  all these happy and successful undertakings tho tis no more to be doubted they were done by the agency of satan and in a very surprizing manner too yet were all done in secret by what i call possession and injection and by the agency and contrivance of such instruments or by the devil in the disguise of such servants as he found out fitted to be employd in his work and who he took a more effectual care in concealing of  but we shall have occasion to touch all this part over again when we come to discourse of the particular habits and disguises which the devil has made use of all along in the world the better to cover his actions and to conceal his being concernd in them  in the mean time the cunning or artifice the devil makes use of in all these things is in it self very considerable tis an old practice of his using and he has gone on in diverse measures for the better concealing himself in it which measures tho he varies sometimes as his extraordinary affairs require yet they are in all ages much the same and have the same tendency namely that he may get all his business carried on by the instrumentality of fools that he may make mankind agents in their own destruction and that he may have all his work done in such a manner as that he may seem to have no hand in it nay he contrives so well that the very name devil is put upon his opposite party and the scandal of the black agent lies all upon them  in order then to look a little into his conduct let us enquire into the common mistakes about him see what use is made of them to his advantage and how far mankind is imposed upon in those particulars and to what purpose     chap iv  of satans agents or missionaries and their actings upon and in the      minds of men in his name   infinite advantages attend the devil in his retired government as they respect the management of his interests and the carrying on his absolute monarchy in the world particularly as it gives him room to act by the agency of his inferior ministers and messengers calld on many occasions his angels of whom he has an innumerable multitude at his command enough for ought we know to spare one to attend every man and woman now alive in the world and of whom if we may believe our second sight christians the air is always as full as a beam of the evening sun is of insects where they are ever ready for business and to go and come as their great governor issues out orders for their directions  these as they are all of the same spirituous quality with himself and consequently invisible like him except as above are ready upon all occasions to be sent to and into any such person and for such purposes superior limitations only excepted as the grand director of devils the devil properly so calld guides them and be the subject or the object what it will that is to say be the person they are sent to or into as above who it will and the business the messenger is to do what it will they are sufficiently qualified for this is a particular to satans messengers or agents that they are not like us humane devils here in the world some bred up one way some another some of one trade some of another and consequently some fit for some business some for another some good for something and some good for nothing but his people are every one fit for every thing can find their way every where and are a match for every body they are sent to in a word there are no foolish devils they are all fully qualified for their employment fit for any thing he sets them about and very seldom mistake their errand or fail in the business they are sent to do  nor is it strange at all that the devil should have such a numberless train of deputy devils to act under him for it must be acknowledged he has a great deal of business upon his hands a vast deal of work to do abundance of public affairs under his direction and an infinite variety of particular cases always before him for example  how many governments in the world are wholly in his administration how many divans and great councils under his direction nay i believe twould be hard to prove that there is or has been one council of state in the world for many hundred years past down to the year 1713 we dont pretend to come nearer home where the devil by himself or his agents in one shape or another has not sat as a member if not taken the chair  and tho some learnd authors may dispute this point with me by giving some examples where the councils of princes have been acted by a better hand and where things have been carried against satans interest and even to his great mortification it amounts to no more than this namely that in such cases the devil has been outvoted but it does not argue but he might have been present there and have pushd his interest as far as he could only that he had not the success he expected for i dont pretend to say that he has never been disappointed but those examples are so rare and of so small signification that when i come to the particulars as i shall do in the sequel of this history you will find them hardly worth naming and that take it one time with another the devil has met with such a series of success in all his affairs and has so seldom been baulkd and where he has met with a little check in his politicks has notwithstanding so soon and so easily recoverd himself regaind his lost ground or replacd himself in another country when he has been supplanted in one that his empire is far from being lessend in the world for the last thousand years of the christian establishment  suppose we take an observation from the beginning of luther or from the year 1420 and call the reformation a blow to the devils kingdom which before that was come to such a height in christendom that tis a question not yet thorowly decided whether that medley of superstition and horrible heresies that mass of enthusiam and idols calld the catholick hierarchy was a church of god or a church of the devil whether it was an assembly of saints or a synagogue of satan i say take that time to be the epocha of satans declension and of lucifers falling from heaven that is from the top of his terrestrial glory yet whether he did not gain in the defection of the greek church about that time and since as much as he lost in the reformation of the roman is what authors are not yet agreed about not reckoning what he has regaind since of the ground which he had lost even by the reformation viz the countries of the duke of savoys dominion where the reformation is almost eaten out by persecution the whole valtoline and some adjacent countries the whole kingdom of poland and almost all hungary for since the last war the reformation as it were lies gasping for breath and expiring in that country also several large provinces in germany as austria carinthia and the whole kingdom of bohemia where the reformation once powerfully planted receivd its deaths wound at the battle of prague ann 1627 and languishd but a very little while died and was buried and good king popery reignd in its stead  to these countries thus regaind to satans infernal empire let us add his modern conquests and the encroachments he has made upon the reformation in the present age which are however light we make of them very considerable viz the electorate of the rhine and the palatinate the one fallen to the house of bavaria and the other to that of neuburgh both popish the dutchy of deux ponts fallen just now to a popish branch the whole electorate of saxony fallen under the power of popish government by the apostacy of their princes and more likely to follow the fate of bohemia whenever the diligent devil can bring his new project in poland to bear as tis more than probable he will do so some time or other by the growing zeal as well as power of that house of bigots the house of a  but to sum up the dull story we must add in the roll of the devils conquests the whole kingdom of france where we have in one year seen to the immortal glory of the devils politicks that his measures have prevailed to the total extirpation of the protestant churches without a war and that interest which for 200 years had supported it self in spight of persecutions massacres five civil wars and innumerable battles and slaughters at last receivd its mortal wound from its own champion henry iv and sunk into utter oblivion by satans most exquisite management under the agency of his two prime ministers cardinal richlieu and lewis the xiv whom he entirely possessd  thus far we have a melancholy view of the devils new conquests and the ground he has regaind upon the reformation in which his secret management has been so exquisite and his politicks so good that could he bring but one thing to pass which by his own former mistake for the devil is not infallible he has rendred impossible he would bring the protestant interest so near its ruin that heaven would be as it were put to the necessity of working by miracle to prevent it the case is thus  antient historians tell us and from good authority that the devil finding it for his interest to bring his favourite mahomet upon the stage and spread the victorious halfmoon upon the ruin of the cross having with great success raisd first the saracen empire and then the turkish to such a height as that the name of christian seemed to be extirpated in those two quarters of the world which were then not the greatest only but by far the most powerful i mean asia and africa having totally laid wast all those antient and flourishing churches of africa the labours of st cyprian tertullian st augustine and 670 christian bishops and fathers who governd there at once also all the churches of smyrna philadelphia ephesus sardis antioch laodicea and innumerable others in pontus bithynia and the provinces of the lesser asia  the devil having i say finishd these conquests so much to his satisfaction began to turn his eyes northward and tho he had a considerable interest in the whore of babylon and had brought his power by the subjection of the roman hierarchy to a great height yet finding the interest of mahomet most suitable to his devilish purposes as most adapted to the destruction of mankind and laying waste the world he resolvd to espouse the growing power of the turk and bring him in upon europe like a deluge  in order to this and to make way for an easy conquest like a true devil he workd under ground and sapd the foundation of the christian power by sowing discord among the reigning princes of europe that so envying one another they might be content to stand still and look on while the turk devoured them one by one and at last might swallow them up all  this devilish policy took to his hearts content the christian princes stood still stupid dozing and unconcernd till the turk conquered thrace overrun servia macedonia bulgaria and all the remains of the grecian empire and at last the imperial city of constantinople it self  finding this politic method so well answer his ends the devil who always improves upon the success of his own experiments resolvd from that time to lay a foundation for the making those divisions and jealousies of the christian princes immortal whereas they were at first only personal and founded in private quarrels between the princes respectively such as emulation of one anothers glory envy at the extraordinary valour or other merit of this or that leader or revenge of some little affront for which notwithstanding so great was the piety of christian princes in those days that they made no scruple to sacrifice whole armies yea nations to their piques and private quarrels a certain sign whose management they were under  these being the causes by which the devil first sowd the seeds of mischief among them and the success so well answering his design he could not but wish to have the same advantage always ready at his hand and therefore he resolvd to order it so that these divisions which however useful to him were only personal and consequently temporary like an annual in the garden which must be raisd anew every season might for the future be national and consequently durable and immortal  to this end it was necessary to lay the foundation of eternal feud not in the humours and passions of men only but in the interests of nations the way to do this was to form and state the dominion of those princes by such a plan drawn in hell and laid out from a scheme truly political of which the devil was chief engineer that the divisions should always remain being made a natural consequence of the situation of the country the temper of their people the nature of their commerce the climate the manner of living or something which should for ever render it impossible for them to unite  this i say was a scheme truly infernal in which the devil was as certainly the principal operator to illustrate great things by small as ever john of leyden was of the high dutch rebellion or sir john bt of the late project called the southsea stock nor did this contrivance of the devil at all dishonour his author or the success appear unworthy of the undertaker for we see it not only answer the end and made the turk victorious at the same time and formidable to europe ever after but it works to this day the foundation of the divisions remains in all the several nations and that to such a degree that it is impossible they should unite  this is what i hinted before in which the devil was mistaken and is another instance that he knows nothing of what is to come for this very foundation of immortal jealousy and discord between the several nations of spain france germany and others which the devil himself with so much policy contrivd and which servd his interests so long is now the only obstruction to his designs and prevents the entire ruin of the reformation for tho the reformd countries are very powerful and some of them as great britain and prussia is particularly more powerful than ever yet it cannot be said that the protestant interests in general are stronger than formerly or so strong as they were in 1623 under the victorious arms of the swede on the other hand were it possible that the popish powers to wit of france spain germany italy and poland which are intirely popish could heartily unite their interests and should join their powers to attack the protestants the latter would find it very difficult if not impossible to defend themselves  but as fatal as such a union of the popish powers would be and as useful as it would be to the devils cause at this time not the devil with all his angels are able to bring it to pass no not with all his craft and cunning he divided them but he cant unite them so that even just as tis with men so tis with devils they may do in an hour what they cant undo in an age  this may comfort those fainthearted christians among us who cry out of the danger of a religious war in europe and what terrible things will happen when france and spain and germany and italy and poland shall all unite let this answer satisfy them the devil himself can never make france and spain or france and the emperor unite jarring humours may be reconcild but jarring interests never can they may unite so as to make peace tho that can hardly be long but never so as to make conquests together they are too much afraid of one another for one to bear that any addition of strength should come to the other but this is a digression we shall find the devil mistaken and disappointed too on several other occasions as we go along  i return to satans interest in the several governments and nations by vertue of his invisibility and which he carries on by possession tis by this invisibility that he presides in all the councils of foreign powers for we never mean our own that we always premise and what tho it is alledged by the criticks that he does not preside because there is always a president i say if he is not in the presidents chair yet if he be in the president himself the difference is not much and if he does not vote as a counsellor if he votes in the counsellor tis much the same and here as it was in the story of ahab the king of israel as he was a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets so we find him a spirit of some particular evil quality or other in all the transactions and transactors on that stage of life we call the state  thus he was a dissembling spirit in char ix a turbulent spirit in char v emperors a bigotted spirit of fire and faggot in our queen mary an apostate spirit in hen iv a cruel spirit in peter of castile a revengeful spirit in ferdinand ii a phaeton in lewis xiv a sardanapalus in c ii  in the great men of the world take them a degree lower than the class of crownd heads he has the same secret influence and hence it comes to pass that the greatest heroes and men of the highest character for atchievements of glory either by their virtue or valour however they have been crowned with victories and elevated by human tongues whatever the most consummate virtues or good qualities they have been known by yet they have always had some devil or other in them to preserve satans claim to them uninterrupted and prevent their escape out of his hands thus we have seen a bloody devil in a dalva a profligate devil in a buckingham a lying artful or politick devil in a richlieu a treacherous devil in a mazarin a cruel merciless devil in a cortez a debauchd devil in an eugene a conjuring devil in a luxemburg and a covetous devil in a mh in a word tell me the man i tell you the spirit that reignd in him  nor does he thus carry on his secret management by possession in men of the first magnitude only but have you not had evidences of it among our selves how has he been a lying spirit in the mouths of our prophets a factious spirit in the heads of our politicians a profuse devil in a bs a corrupt devil in m a proud spirit in my lord plausible a bullying spirit in my lord bugbear a talkative spirit in his grace the d of rattlehall a scribling spirit in my lord h a runaway spirit in my lord frightful and so thro a long roll of heroes whose exceeding and particular qualifications proclaim loudly what handle the devil took them by and how fast he held them for these were all men of ancient fame i hope you know that  from men of figure we descend to the mob and tis there the same thing possession like the plague is morbus plebæi not a family but he is a spirit of strife and contention among them not a man but he has a part in him he is a drunken devil in one a whoring devil in another a thieving devil in a third a lying devil in the fourth and so on to a thousand and a hundred thousand ad infinitum  nay even the ladies have their share in the possession and if they have not the devil in their heads or in their tails in their faces or their tongues it must be some poor despicable shedevil that satan did not think it worth his while to meddle with and the number of those that are below his operation i doubt is very small but that part i have much more to say to in its place  from degrees of persons to professions and employments tis the same we find the devil is a true posturemaster he assumes any dress appears in any shape counterfeits every voice acts upon every stage here he wears a gown there a long robe here he wears the jackboots there the smallsword is here an enthusiast there a buffoon on this side he acts the mountebank on that side the merryandrew nothing comes amiss to him from the great mogul to the scaramouch the devil is in them more or less and plays his game so well that he makes sure work with em all he knows where the common foible lies which is universal passion what handle to take hold of every man by and how to cultivate his interest so as not to fail of his end or mistake the means  how then can it be denyd but that his acting thus in tenebris and keeping out of the sight of the world is abundantly his interest and that he could do nothing comparatively speaking by any other method  what would this publick appearance have signified who would have entertaind him in his own proper shape and person even b b himself tho all the world knows him to have a foolish devil in him would not have been fool enough to have taken him into his service if he had known him and my lord simpleton also who satan has set up for a cunning fool seems to have it sit much better upon him now he passes for a fool of art than it should have done if the naked devil had come and challenged him for a fool in nature  infinite variety illustrate the devils reign among the sons of men all which he manages with admirable dexterity and a slight particular to himself by the mere advantage of his present conceald situation and which had he been obliged to have appeard in publick had been all lost and he capable of just nothing at all or at least of nothing more than the other ordinary politicians of wickedness could have done without him  now authors are much divided as to the manner how the devil manages his proper instruments for mischief for satan has a great many agents in the dark who neither have the devil in them nor are they much acquainted with him and yet he serves himself of them whether of their folly or of that other frailty calld wit tis all one he makes them do his work when they think they are doing their own nay so cunning is he in his guiding the weak part of the world that even when they think they are serving god they are doing nothing less or more than serving the devil nay tis some of the nicest part of his operation to make them believe they are serving god when they do his work thus those who the scripture foretold should persecute christs church in the latter days were to think they do god good service thus the inquisition for example it may be at this time in all the acts of christian cruelty which they are so famous for if any of them are ignorant enough not to know that they are devils incarnate they may for ought we know go on for gods sake torture murther starve to death mangle and macerate and all for god and gods catholic church and tis certainly the devils masterpiece to bring mankind to such a perfection of devilism as that of the inquisition is for if the devil had not been in them could they christen such a hellfire judicature as the inquisition is by the name of the holy office and so in paganism how could so many nations among the poor indians offer human sacrifices to their idols and murther thousands of men women and children to appease this god of the air when he is angry if the devil did not act in them under the vizor of devotion  but we need not go to america or to the inquisition not to paganism or to popery either to look for people that are sacrificing to the devil or that give their peaceofferings to him while they are offerd upon gods altar are not our churches ay and meetinghouses too as much as they pretend to be more sanctified than their neighbours full of devil worshipers where do his devotees gratulate one another and congratulate him more than at church where while they hold up their hands and turn up their eyes towards heaven they make all their vows to satan or at least to the fair devils his representatives which i shall speak of in their place  do not the sons of god make assignations with the daughters of men in the very house of worship do they not talk to them in the language of the eyes and what is at the bottom of it while one eye is upon the prayerbook and the other adjusting their dress are they not sacrificing to venus and mercury nay and the very devil they dress at  let any man impartially survey the churchgestures the air the postures and the behaviour let him keep an exact roll and if i do not shew him two devil worshipers for one true saint then the word saint must have another signification than i ever yet understood it by  the church as a place is the receptacle of the dead as well as the assembly of the living what relates to those below i doubt satan if he would be so kind could give a better account of than i can but as to the superficies i pretend to so much penetration as to tell you that there are more spectres more apparitions always there than you that know nothing of the matter may be aware of  i happend to be at an eminent place of gods most devout worship the other day with a gentleman of my acquaintance who i observed minded very little the business he ought to come about first i saw him always busy staring about him and bowing this way and that way nay he made two or three bows and scrapes when he was repeating the responses to the ten commandments and assure you he made it correspond strangely so that the harmony was not so broken in upon as you would expect it should thus lord and a bow to a fine lady just come up to her seat have mercy upon us  three bows to a throng of ladies that came into the next pew altogether and incline  then stopd to make a great scrape to my lord  our hearts just then the hearts of all the church were gone off from the subject for the response was over so he huddled up the rest in whispers for god a mighty could hear him well enough he said nay as well as if he had spoken as loud as his neighbours did  after we were come home i askd him what he meant by all this and what he thought of it  how could i help it said he i must not be rude  what says i rude to who  why says he there came in so many she devils i could not help it  what said i could not you help bowing when you were saying your prayers  o sir says he the ladies would have thought i had slighted them i could not avoid it  ladies said i i thought you calld them devils just now  ay ay devils said he little charming devils but i must not be rude to them however  very well said i then you would be rude to god a mighty because you could not be rude to the devil  why thats true said he but what can we do theres no going to church as the case stands now if we must not worship the devil a little between whiles  this is the case indeed and satan carries his point on every hand for if the fair speaking world and the fair looking world are generally devils that is to say are in his management we are sure the foul speaking and the foul doing world are all on his side and you have then only the fairdoing part of the world that are out of his class and when we speak of them o how few  but i return to the devils managing our wicked part for this he does with most exquisite subtilty and this is one part of it viz he thrusts our vices into our virtues by which he mixes the clean and the unclean and thus by the corruption of the one poisons and debauches the other so that the slave he governs cannot account for his own common actions and is fain to be obligd to his maker to accept of the heart without the hands and feet to take as we vulgarly express it the will for the deed and if heaven was not so good to come into that half in half service i dont see but the devil would carry away all his servants here indeed i should enter into a long detail of involuntary wickedness which in short is neither more or less than the devil in every body ay in every one of you our governors excepted take it as you please  what is our language when we look back with reflection and reproach on past follies i think i was bewitchd i was possesd certainly the devil was in me or else i had never been such a sot devil in you sir ay who doubts it you may be sure the devil was in you and there he is still and next time he can catch you in the same snare youll be just the same sot that you say you were before  in short the devil is too cunning for us and manages us his own way he governs the vices of men by his own methods tho every crime will not make a man a devil yet it must be owned that every crime puts the criminal in some measure into the devils power gives him a title to the man and he treats him magisterially ever after  some tell us every single man every individual has a devil attending him to execute the orders of the grand signior devil of the whole clan that this attending evil angel for so he is calld sees every step you take is with you in every action prompts you to every mischief and leaves you to do every thing that is pernicious to your self they also alledge that there is a good spirit which attends him too which latter is always accessary to every thing that we do that is good and reluctant to evil if this is true how comes it to pass that those two opposite spirits do not quarrel about it when they are pressing us to contrary actions one good and the other evil and why does the evil tempting spirit so often prevail instead of answering this difficult question i shall only tell you as to this story of good and evil angels attending every particular person tis a good allegory indeed to represent the struggle in the mind of man between good and evil inclinations but as to the rest the best thing i can say of it is that i think tis a fib  but to take things as they are and only talk by way of natural consequence for to argue from nature is certainly the best way to find out the devils story if there are good and evil spirits attending us that is to say a good angel and a devil then tis no unjust reproach upon any body to say when they follow the dictates of the latter the devil is in them or they are devils nay i must carry it farther still namely that as the generality and greatest number of people do follow and obey the evil spirit and not the good and that the predominate power is allowed to be the nominating power you must then allow that in short the greater part of mankind has the devil in them and so i come to my text  to this purpose give me leave to borrow a few lines of a friend on this very part of the devils management    to places and persons he suits his disguises     and dresses up all his banditti   who as pickpockets flock to a country assizes     croud up to the court and the city    theyre at every elbow and every ear     and ready at every call sir   the vigilant scout plants his agents about     and has something to do with us all sir    in some he has part and in some hes the whole     and of some like the vicar of baddow   it can neither be said they have body or soul     but only are devils in shadow    the pretty and witty are devils in masque     the beauties are meer apparitions   the homely alone by their faces are known     and the good by their ugly conditions    the beaus walk about like the shadows of men     and wherever he leads em they follow   but takem and shakem theres not one in ten     buts as light as a feather and hollow    thus all his affairs he drives on in disguise     and he tickles mankind with a feather   creeps in at our ears and looks out at our eyes     and jumbles our senses together    he raises the vapours and prompts the desires     and to evry dark deed holds the candle   the passions enflames and the appetite fires     and takes evry thing by the handle    thus he walks up and down in compleat masquerade     and with every company mixes   sells in every shop works at every trade     and evry thing doubtful perplexes   how satan comes by this governing influence in the minds and upon the actions of men is a question i am not yet come to nor indeed does it so particularly belong to the devils history it seems rather a polemick so it may pass at school among the metaphysicks and puzzle the heads of our masters wherefore i think to write to the learned dr b about it imploring his most sublime haughtiness that when his other more momentous avocations of pedantry and pedagogism will give him an interval from wrath and contention he will set apart a moment to consider human nature devilizd and give us a mathematical anatomical description of it with a map of satans kingdom in the microcosm of mankind and such other illuminations as to him and his contemporaries  and  c in their great wisdom shall seem meet     chap v  of the devils management in the pagan hierarchy by omens entrails      augurs oracles and such like pageantry of hell and how they went      off the stage at last by the introduction of true religion   i have adjournd not finished my account of the devils secret management by possession and shall reassume it in its place but i must take leave to mention some other parts of his retird scheme by which he has hitherto managd mankind and the first of these is by that fraud of all frauds calld oracle  here his trumpet yielded an uncertain sound for some ages and like what he was and according to what he practised from the beginning he deliverd out falshood and delusion by retale the priests of apollo acted this farce for him to a great nicety at delphos there were divers others at the same time and some which to give the devil his due he had very little hand in as we shall see presently  there were also some smaller some greater some more some less famous places where those oracles were seated and audience given to the enquirers in all which the devil or some body for him permissu superiorum for either vindictive or other hidden ends and purposes was allowd to make at least a pretension to the knowledge of things to come but as publick cheats generally do they acted in masquerade and gave such uncertain and inconsistent responses that they were obligd to use the utmost art to reconcile events to the prediction even after things were come to pass  here the devil was a lying spirit in a particular and extraordinary manner in the mouths of all the prophets and yet he had the cunning to express himself so that whatever happend the oracle was supposd to have meant as it fell out and so all their augurs omens and voices by which the devil amusd the world not at that time only but since have been likewise interpreted  julian the apostate dealt mightily in these amusements but the devil who neither wishd his fall or presagd it to him evidencd that he knew nothing of julians fate for that as he sent almost to all the oracles of the east and summond all the priests together to inform him of the success of his persian expedition they all like ahabs prophets having a lying spirit in them encouragd him and promisd him success  nay all the ill omens which disturbd him they presagd good from for example he was at a prodigious expence when he was at antioch to buy up white beasts and white fowls for sacrifices and for predicting from the entrails from whence the antiochians in contempt calld him victimarius but whenever the entrails foreboded evil the cunning devil made the priests put a different construction upon them and promise him good when he entred into the temple of the genij to offer sacrifice one of the priests dropt down dead this had it had any signification more than a man falling dead of an apoplectic would have signified something fatal to julian who made himself a brother sacrist or priest whereas the priests turnd it presently to signify the death of his colleague the consul sallust which happend just at the same time tho eight hundred miles off so in another case julian thought it ominous that he who was augustus should be namd with two other names of persons both already dead the case was thus the stile of the emperor was julianus foelix augustus and two of his principal officers were julianus and foelix now both julianus and foelix died within a few days of one another which disturbd him much who was the third of the three names but his flattering devil told him it all imported good to him viz that tho julianus and foelix should die augustus should be immortal  thus whatever happend and whatever was foretold and how much soever they differd from one another the lying spirit was sure to reconcile the prediction and the event and make them at least seem to correspond in favour of the person enquiring  now we are told oracles are ceased and the devil is farther limited for the good of mankind not being allowd to vent his delusions by the mouths of the priests and augurs as formerly i will not take upon me to say how far they are really ceasd more than they were before i think tis much more reasonable to believe there was never any reality in them at all or that any oracle ever gave out any answers but what were the invention of the priests and the delusions of the devil i have a great many antient authors on my side in this opinion as eusebius tertullian aristotle and others who as they livd so near the pagan times and when even some of those rites were yet in use they had much more reason to know and could probably pass a better judgment upon them nay cicero himself ridicules them in the openest manner again other authors descend to particular and shew how the cheat was managd by the heathen sacrists and priests and in what enthusiastic manner they spoke namely by going into the hollow images such as the brazen bull and the image of apollo and how subtilly they gave out dubious and ambiguous answers that when the people did not find their expectations answerd by the event they might be imposed upon by the priests and confidently told they did not rightly understand the oracles meaning however i cannot say but that indeed there are some authors of good credit too who will have it that there was a real prophetic spirit in the voice or answers given by the oracles and that oftentimes they were miraculously exact in those answers and they give that of the delphic oracle answering the question which was given about croesus for an example viz what croesus was doing at that time to wit that he was boiling a lamb and the flesh of a tortoise together in a brass vessel or boiler with a cover of the same metal that is to say in a kettle with a brass cover  to affirm therefore that they were all cheats a man must encounter with antiquity and set his private judgment up against an establishd opinion but tis no matter for that if i do not see any thing in that receivd opinion capable of evidence much less of demonstration i must be allowd still to think as i do others may believe as they list i see nothing hard or difficult in the thing the priests who were always historically informd of the circumstances of the enquirer or at least something about them might easily find some ambiguous speech to make and put some double entendre upon them which upon the event solvd the credit of the oracle were it one way or other and this they certainly did or we have room to think the devil knows less of things now than he did in former days  it is true that by these delusions the priests got infinite sums of money and this makes it still probable that they would labour hard and use the utmost of their skill to uphold the credit of their oracles and tis a full discovery as well of the subtlety of the sacrists as of the ignorance and stupidity of the people in those early days of satans witchcraft to see what merry work the devil made with the world and what gross things he put upon mankind such was the story of the dordonian oracle in epirus viz that two pigeons flew out of thebes n b it was the egyptian thebes from the temple of belus erected there by the antient sacrists and that one of these fled eastward into lybia and the desarts of africk and the other into greece namely to dordona and these communicated the divine mysteries to one another and afterwards gave mystical solutions to the devout enquirers first the dordonian pigeon perching upon an oak spoke audibly to the people there that the gods commanded them to build an oracle or temple to jupiter in that place which was accordingly done the other pigeon did the like on the hill in africa where it commanded them to build another to jupiter ammon or hammon  wise cicero contemned all this and as authors tell us ridiculed the answer which as i have hinted above the oracle gave to croesus proving that the oracle it self was a liar that it could not come from apollo for that apollo never spoke latin in a word cicero rejected them all and demosthenes also mentions the cheats of the oracles when speaking of the oracle of apollo he said pithia philippizd that is that when the priests were bribd with money they always gave their answers in favour of philip of macedon  but that which is most strange to me is that in this dispute about the reality of oracles the heathen who made use of them are the people who expose them and who insist most positively upon their being cheats and impostors as in particular those mentioned above while the christians who reject them yet believe they did really foretel things answer questions c only with this difference that the heathen authors who oppose them insist that tis all delusion and cheat and charge it upon the priests and the christian opposers insist that it was real but that the devil not the gods gave the answers and that he was permitted to do it by a superior power to magnify that power in the total silencing them at last  but as i said before i am with the heathen here against the christian writers for i take it all to be a cheat and delusion i must give my reason for it or i do nothing my reason is this i insist satan is as blind in matters of futurity as we are and can tell nothing of what is to come these oracles often pretending to predict could be nothing else therefore but a cheat formd by the moneygetting priests to amuse the world and bring grist to their mill if i meet with any thing in my way to open my eyes to a better opinion of them i shall tell it you as i go on  on the other hand whether the devil really spake in those oracles or set the cunning priests to speak for him whether they predicted or only made the people believe they predicted whether they gave answers which came to pass or prevaild upon the people to believe that what was said did come to pass it was much at one and fully answerd the devils end namely to amuse and delude the world and as to do or to cause to be done is the same part of speech so whoever did it the devils interest was carried on by it his government preservd and all the mischief he could desire was effectually brought to pass so that every way they were the devils oracles thats out of the question  indeed i have wonderd sometimes why since by this sorcery the devil performd such wonders that is playd so many tricks in the world and had such universal success he should set up no more of them but there might be a great many reasons given for that too long to tire you with at present tis true there were not many of them and yet considering what a great deal of business they dispatchd it was enough for six or eight oracles were more than sufficient to amuse all the world the chief oracles we meet with in history are among the greeks and the romans viz       that of jupiter ammon in lybia as above       the dordonian in epirus       apollo delphicus in the country of phocis in greece       apollo clavius in asia minor       serapis in alexandria in egypt       trophomis in bæotia       sybilla cumæa in italy       diana at ephesus       apollo daphneus at antioch       besides many of lesser note in several other places as i have      hinted before   i have nothing to do here with the story mentioned by plutarch of a voice being heard at sea from some of the islands calld the echinades and calling upon one thamuz an egyptian who was on board a ship bidding him when he came to the palodes other islands in the ionian seas tell them there that the great god pan was dead and when thamuz performd it great groanings and howlings and lamentation were heard from the shore  this tale tells but indifferently tho indeed it looks more like a christian fable than a pagan because it seems as if made to honour the christian worship and blast all the pagan idolatry and for that reason i reject it the christian profession needing no such fabulous stuff to confirm it  nor is it true in fact that the oracles did cease immediately upon the death of christ but as i noted before the sum of the matter is this the christian religion spreading it self universally as well as miraculously and that too by the foolishness of preaching into all parts of the world the oracles ceasd that is to say their trade ceasd their rogueries were daily detected the deluded people being better taught came no more after them and being ashamd as well as discouragd they sneakd out of the world as well as they could in short the customers fell off and the priests who were the shopkeepers having no business to do shut up their shops broke and went away the trade and the tradesmen were hissd off the stage together so that the devil who it must be confessd got infinitely by the cheat became bankrupt and was obligd to set other engines at work as other cheats and deceivers do who when one trick grows stale and will serve no longer are forcd to try another  nor was the devil to seek in new measures for tho he could not give out his delusive trash as he did before in pomp and state with the solemnity of a temple and a set of enthusiasts calld priests who plaid a thousand tricks to amuse the world he then had recourse to his old egyptian method which indeed was more antient than that of oracles and that was by magic sorcery familiars witchcraft and the like  of this we find the people of the south that is of arabia and chaldea were the first from whence we are told of the wise men that is to say magicians were calld chaldeans and southsayers hence also we find ahaziah the king of israel sent to baalzebub the god of ekron to enquire whether he should live or die this some think was a kind of an oracle tho others think it was only some overgrown magician who counterfeited himself to be a devil and obtaind upon that idolhunting age to make a cunning man of him and for that purpose he got himself made a priest of baalzebub the god of ekron and gave out answers in his name thus those merry fellows in egypt jannes and jambres are said to mimick moses and aaron when they workd the miraculous plagues upon the egyptians and we have some instances in scripture that support this such as the witch of endor the king manasses who dealt with the devil openly and had a familiar the woman mentioned acts xvi who had a spirit of divination and who got money by playing the oracle that is answering doubtful questions c which spirit or devil the apostles cast out  now tho it is true that the old women in the world have filld us with tales some improbable others impossible some weak some ridiculous and that this puts a general discredit upon all the graver matrons who entertain us with stories better put together yet tis certain and i must be allowd to affirm that the devil does not disdain to take into his service many troops of good old women and old womenmen too who he finds tis for his service to keep in constant pay to these he is found frequently to communicate his mind and oftentimes we find them such proficients that they know much more than the devil can teach them  how far our antient friend merlin or the grave matron his satans most trusty and wellbeloved cousin and counsellor mother shipton were commissioned by him to give out their prophetic oracles and what degree of possession he may have arrived to in them upon their midnight excursions i will not undertake to prove but that he might be acquainted with them both as well as with several of our modern gentlemen i will not deny neither  i confess it is not very incongruous with the devils temper or with the nature of his business to shift hands possibly he found that he had tried the world with oracular cheats that men began to be forfeited with them and grew sick of the frauds which were so frequently detected that it was time to take new measures and contrive some new trick to bite the world that he might not be exposd to contempt or perhaps he saw the approach of new light which the christian doctrine bringing with it began to spread in the minds of men that it would outshine the dim burning ignis fatuus with which he had so long cheated mankind and was afraid to stand it lest he should be mobbd off the stage by his own people when their eyes should begin to open that upon this foot he might in policy withdraw from those old retreats the oracles and restrain those responses before they lost all their credit for we find the people seemd to be at a mighty loss for some time for want of them so that it made them run up and down to conjurers and mangossips to brazen heads speaking calves and innumerable simple things so gross that they are scarce fit to be named to satisfy the itch of having their fortunes told them as we call it  now as the devil is very seldom blind to his own interest and therefore thought fit to quit his old way of imposing upon the world by his oracles only because he found the world began to be too wise to be imposed upon that way so on the other hand finding there was still a possibility to delude the world tho by other instruments he no sooner laid down his oracles and the solemn pageantry magnificent appearances and other frauds of his priests and votaries in their temples and shrines but he set up a new trade and having as i have said agents and instruments sufficient for any business that he could have to employ them in he begins in corners as the learned and merry dr brown says and exercises his minor trumperies by way of his own contriving lifting a great number of newfound operators such as witches magicians diviners figurecasters astrologers and such inferior seducers  now it is true as that doctor says this was running into corners as if he had been expelld his more triumphant way of giving audience in form which for so many ages had been allowd him yet i must add that as it seemd to be the devils own doing from a right judgment of his affairs which had taken a new turn in the world upon the shining of new lights from the christian doctrine so it must be acknowledged the devil made himself amends upon mankind by the various methods he took and the multitude of instruments he employd and perhaps deluded mankind in a more fatal and sensible manner than he did before tho not so universally  he had indeed before more pomp and figure put upon it and he cheated mankind then in a way of magnificence and splendor but this was not in above eight or ten principal places and not fifty places in all public or private whereas now fifty thousand of his angels and instruments visible and invisible hardly may be said to suffice for one town or city but in short as his invisible agents fill the air and are at hand for mischief on every emergence so his visible fools swarm in every village and you have scarce a hamlet or a town but his emissaries are at hand for business and which is still worse in all places he finds business nay even where religion is planted and seems to flourish yet he keeps his ground and pushes his interest according to what has been said elsewhere upon the same subject that wherever religion plants the devil plants close by it  nor as i say does he fail of success delusion spreads like a plague and the devil is sure of votaries like a true mountebank he can always bring a croud about his stage and that some times faster than other people  what i observe upon this subject is this that the world is at a strange loss for want of the devil if it was not so whats the reason that upon the silencing the oracles and religion telling them that miracles are ceasd and that god has done speaking by prophets they never enquire whether heaven has established any other or new way of revelation but away they ran with their doubts and difficulties to these dreamers of dreams tellers of fortunes and personal oracles to be resolvd as if when they acknowledge the devil is dumb these could speak and as if the wicked spirit could do more than the good the diabolical more than the divine or that heaven having taken away the devils voice had furnishd him with an equivalent by allowing scolds termagants and old weak and superannuated wretches to speak for him for these are the people we go to now in our doubts and emergencies  while this blindness continues among us tis nonsense to say that oracles are silenced or the devil is dumb for the devil gives audience still by his deputies only as jeroboam made priests of the meanest of the people so he is grown a little humble and makes use of meaner instruments than he did before for whereas the priests of apollo and of jupiter were splendid in their appearance of grave and venerable aspect and sometimes of no mean quality now he makes use of scoundrels and rabble beggars and vagabonds old hags superannuated miserable hermits gypsies and strollers the pictures of envy and ill luck  either the devil is grown an ill master and gives but mean wages that he can get no better servants or else common sense is grown very low prizd and contemptible that such as these are fit tools to continue the succession of fraud and carry on the devils interest in the world for were not the passions and temper of mankind deeply preengaged in favour of this dark prince we could never suffer our selves to accept of his favours by the hands of such contemptible agents as these how do we receive his oracles from an old witch of particular eminence and who we believe to be more than ordinarily inspird from hell i say we receive the oracle with reverence that is to say with a kind of horror with regard to the black prince it comes from and at the same time turn our faces away from the wretch that mumbles out the answers lest she should cast an evil eye as we call it upon us and put a devil into us when she plays the devil before us how do we listen to the cant of those worst of vagabonds the gypsies when at the same time we watch our hedges and henroosts for fear of their thieving  either the devil uses us more like fools than he did our ancestors or we really are worse fools than those ages produced for they were never deluded by such lowprizd devils as we are by such despicable bridewell devils that are fitter for a whippingpost than an altar and instead of being receivd as the voice of an oracle should be sent to the house of correction for pickpockets  nor is this accidental and here and there one of these wretches to be seen but in short if it has been in other nations as it is with us i do not see that the devil was able to get any better people into his pay or at least very rarely where have we seen any thing above a tinker turn wizard and where have we had a witch of quality among us mother jegs excepted and if she had not been more of something else than a witch twas thought she had never got so much money by her profession  magicians southsayers devilraisers and such people we have heard much of but seldom above the degree of the meanest of the mean people the lowest of the lowest rank indeed the word wise men which the devil woud fain have had his agents honourd with was used a while in egypt and in persia among the chaldeans but it continued but a little while and never reachd so far northward as our country nor however the devil has managed it have many of our great men who have been most acquainted with him ever been able to acquire the title of wise men  i have heard that in older times i suppose in good queen besss days or beyond for little is to be said here for any thing on this side of her time there were some counsellors and statesmen who merited the character of wise in the best sense that is to say good and wise as they stand in conjunction but as to what has happend since that or as we may call it from that queens funeral to the late revolution i have little to say but ill tell you what honest andrew marvel said of those times and by that you may if you please make your calculation or let it alone tis all one    to see a white staffmaker a beggar a lord   and scarce a wise man at a long councilboard   but i may be told this relates to wise men in another constitution or wise men as they are opposed to fools whereas we are talking of them now under another class namely as wisemen or magicians southsayers c such as were in former times calld by that name  but to this i answer that take them in which sense you please it may be the same for if i were to ask the devil the character of the best statesman he had employd among us for many years past i am apt to think that tho oracles are ceased he would honestly according to the old ambiguous way when i askd if they were christians answer they were his privycounsellors  it is but a little while ago that i happend in conversation to meet with a long list of the magistrates of that age in a neighbouring country that is to say the men of fame among them and it was a very diverting thing to see the judgment which was passd upon them among a great deal of good company it is not for me to tell you how many white staves golden keys mareshals batoons cordons blue gordon rouge and gordon blanc there were among them or by what titles as dukes counts marquis abbot bishop or justice they were to be distinguishd but the marginal notes i found upon most of them were being markd with an asterism as follows  such a duke such eminent offices added to his titles  in the margin  no saint  such an arch with the title of noble added  no archangel  such an eminent statesman and prime minister  no witch  such a ribbon with a set of great letters added  no conjurer  it presently occurrd to me that tho oracles were ceased and we had now no more double entendre in such a degree as before yet that ambiguous answers were not at an end and that whether those negatives were meant so by the writers or not twas certain custom led the readers to conclude them to be satyrs that they were to be rung backwards like the bells when the towns on fire tho in short i durst not read them backward any where but as speaking of foreign people for fear of raising the devil i am talking of  but to return to the subject to such mean things is the devil now reducd in his ordinary way of carrying on his business in the world that his oracles are deliverd now by the bellmen and the chimneysweepers by the meanest of those that speak in the dark and if he operates by them you may expect it accordingly his agents seem to me as if the devil had singld them out by their deformity or that there was something particular requird in their aspect to qualify them for their employment whence it is become proverbial when our looks are very dismal and frightful to say i look like a witch or in other cases to say as ugly as a witch in another case to look as envious as a witch now whether there is any thing particularly requird in the looks of the devils modern agents which is assisting in the discharge of their offices and which make their answers appear more solemn this the devil has not yet reveald at least not to me and therefore why it is that he singles out such creatures as are fit only to fright the people that come to them with their enquiries i do not take upon me to determine  perhaps it is necessary they should be thus extraordinary in their aspect that they might strike an awe into the minds of their votaries as if they were satans true and real representatives and that the said votaries may think when they speak to the witches they are really talking to the devil or perhaps tis necessary to the witches themselves that they should be so exquisitely ugly that they might not be surprizd at whatever figure the devil makes when he first appears to them being certain they can see nothing uglier than themselves  some are of the opinion that the communication with the devil or between the devil and those creatures his agents has something assimulating in it and that if they were tolerable before they are ipso facto turnd into devils by talking with him i will not say but that a tremor in the limbs a horror in the aspect and a surprizing stare in the eyes may seize upon some of them when they really see the devil and that the frequent repetition may make those distortions which we so constantly see in their faces becomes natural to them by which if it does not continue always upon the countenance they can at least like the posturemasters cast themselves into such figures and frightful dislocations of the lines and features in their faces and so assume a devils face suitable to the occasion or as may serve the turn for which they take it up and as often as they have any use for it  but be it which of these the enquirer pleases tis all one to the case in hand this is certain that such deformd devillike creatures most of those we call hags and witches are in their shapes and aspects and that they give out their sentences and frightful messages with an air of revenge for some injury receivd for witches are famd chiefly for doing mischief  it seems the devil has always pickd out the most ugly and frightful old women to do his business mother shipton our famous english witch or prophetess is very much wrongd in her picture if she was not of the most terrible aspect imaginable and if it be true that merlin the famous welch fortuneteller was a frightful figure it will seem the more rational to believe if we credit another story viz that he was begotten by the devil himself of which i shall speak by it self but to go back to the devils instruments being so ugly it may be observed i say that the devil has always dealt in such sort of cattle the sybils of whom so many strange prophetic things are recorded whether true or no is not to the question are if the italian painters may have any credit given them all represented as very old women and as if ugliness were a beauty to old age they seem to paint them out as ugly and frightful as not they the painters but even as the devil himself could make them not that i believe there are any original pictures of them really extant but it is not unlikely that the italians might have some traditional knowledge of them or some remaining notions of them or particularly that antient sybil named anus who sold the fatal book to tarquin tis said of her that tarquin supposed she doated with age  i had thoughts indeed here to have entred into a learned disquisition of the excellency of old women in all diabolical operations and particularly of the necessity of having recourse to them for satans more exquisite administration which also may serve to solve the great difficulty in the natural philosophy of hell namely why it comes to pass that the devil is obligd for want of old women properly so calld to turn so many antient fathers grave counsellors both of law and state and especially civilians or doctors of the law into old women and how the extraordinary operation is performd but this as a thing of great consequence in satans management of humane affairs and particularly as it may lead us into the necessary history as well as characters of some of the most eminent of these sects among us i have purposely reservd for a work by it self to be published if satan hinders not in fifteen volumes in folio wherein i shall in the first place define in the most exact manner possible what is to be understood by a male old woman of what heterogeneous kind they are produced give you the monstrous anatomy of the parts and especially those of the head which being filld with innumerable globules of a sublime nature and which being of a fine contexture without but particularly hollow in the cavity defines most philosophically that antient paradoxical saying viz being full of emptiness and makes it very consistent with nature and common sense  i shall likewise spend some time and it must be labour too i assure you when tis done in determining whether this new species of wonderfuls are not derivd from that famous old woman merlin which i prove to be very reasonable for us to suppose because of the many several judicious authors who affirm the said merlin as i hinted before to have been begotten by the devil  as to the deriving his gift of prophesy from the devil by that pretended generation i shall omit that part because as i have all along insisted upon it that satan himself has no prophetic or predicting powers of his own it is not very clear to me that he could convey it to his posterity nil dat quod not habet  however in deriving this so much magnified prophet in a right line from the devil much may be said in favour of his ugly face in which it was said he was very remarkable for it is no new thing for a child to be like the father but all these weighty things i adjourn for the present and proceed to the affair in hand namely the several branches of the devils management since his quitting his temples and oracles     chap vi  of the extraordinary appearance of the devil and particularly of the      clovenfoot   some people would fain have us treat this tale of the devils appearing with a clovenfoot with more solemnity than i believe the devil himself does for satan who knows how much of a cheat it is must certainly ridicule it in his own thoughts to the last degree but as he is glad of any way to hoodwink the understandings and bubble the weak part of the world so if he sees men willing to take every scarecrow for a devil it is not his business to undeceive them on the other hand he finds it his interest to foster the cheat and serve himself of the consequence nor could i doubt but the devil if any mirth be allowd him often laughs at the many frightful shapes and figures we dress him up in and especially to see how willing we are first to paint him as black and make him appear as ugly as we can and then stare and start at the spectrum of our own making  the truth is that among all the horribles that we dress up satan in i cannot but think we shew the least of invention in this of a goat or a thing with a goats foot of all the rest for tho a goat is a creature made use of by our saviour in the allegory of the day of judgment and is said there to represent the wicked rejected party yet it seems to be only on account of their similitude to the sheep and so to represent the just fate of hypocrisy and hypocrites and in particular to form the necessary antithesis in the story for else our whimsical fancies excepted a sheep or a lamb has a clovenfoot as well as a goat nay if the scripture be of any value in the case tis to the devils advantage for the dividing the hoof was the distinguishing character or mark of a clean beast and how the devil can be brought into that number is pretty hard to say  one would have thought if we had intended to have given a just figure of the devil it would have been more apposite to have rankd him among the catkind and given him a foot if he is to be known by his foot like a lion or like a red dragon being the same creatures which he is represented by in the text and so his claws would have had some terror in them as well as his teeth  but neither is the goat a true representative of the devil at all for we do not rank the goats among the subtle or cunning part of the brutes he is counted a fierce creature indeed of his kind tho nothing like those other abovementiond and he is emblematically used to represent a lustful temper but even that part does not fully serve to describe the devil whose operation lies principally another way  besides it is not the goat himself that is made use of tis the clovenhoof only and that so particularly that the cloven foot of a ram or a swine or any other creature may serve as well as that of a goat only that history gives us some cause to call it the goats foot  in the next place tis understood by us not as a bare token to know satan by but as if it were a brand upon him and that like the mark god put upon cain it was given him for a punishment so that he cannot get leave to appear without it nay cannot conceal it whatever other dress or disguise he may put on and as if it was to make him as ridiculous as possible they will have it be that whenever satan has occasion to dress himself in any humane shape be it of what degree soever from the king to the beggar be it of a fine lady or of an old woman the latter it seems he oftenest assumes yet still he not only must have this clovenfoot about him but he is obligd to shew it too nay they will not allow him any dress whether it be a princes robes a lord chars gown or a ladys hoop and long petticoats but the clovenfoot must be shewd from under them they will not so much as allow him an artificial shoe or a jackboot as we often see contrivd to conceal a clubfoot or a woodenleg but that the devil may be known wherever he goes he is bound to shew his foot they might as well oblige him to set a bill upon his cap as folks do upon a house to be let and have it written in capital letters i am the devil  it must be confessd this is very particular and would be very hard upon the devil if it had not another article in it which is some advantage to him and that is that the fact is not true but the belief of this is so universal that all the world runs away with it by which mistake the good people miss the devil many times where they look for him and meet him as often where they did not expect him and when for want of this clovenfoot they do not know him  upon this very account i have sometimes thought not that this has been put upon him by meer fancy and the cheat of a heavy imagination propagated by fable and chymnycorner divinity but that it has been a contrivance of his own and that in short the devil raisd this scandal upon himself that he might keep his disguise the better and might go a visiting among his friends without being known for were it really so that he could go no where without this particular brand of infamy he could not come into company could not dine with my lord mayor nor drink tea with the ladies could not go to the drawingr at  could not have gone to fountainbleau to the king of frances wedding or to the diet of poland to prevent the grandees there coming to an agreement nay which would be still worse than all he could not go to the masquerade nor to any of our balls the reason is plain he would be always discoverd exposd and forcd to leave the good company or which would be as bad the company would all cry out the devil and run out of the room as if they were frighted nor could all the help of invention do him any service no dress he could put on would cover him not all our friends at tavistock corner could furnish him with a habit that would disguise or conceal him this unhappy foot would spoil it all now this would be a great a loss to him that i question whether he could carry on any of his most important affairs in the world without it for tho he has access to mankind in his compleat disguise i mean that of his invisibility yet the learned very much agree in this that his corporal presence in the world is absolutely necessary upon many occasions to support his interest and keep up his correspondences and particularly to encourage his friends when numbers are requisite to carry on his affairs but this part i shall have occasion to speak of again when i come to consider him as a gentleman of business in his locality and under the head of visible apparition but i return to the foot  as i have thus suggested that the devil himself has politically spread about this notion concerning his appearing with a clovenfoot so i doubt not that he has thought it for his purpose to paint this clovenfoot so lively in the imaginations of many of our people and especially of those clear sighted folks who see the devil when he is not to be seen that they would make no scruple to say nay and to make affidavit too even before satan himself whenever he sat upon the bench that they had seen his worships foot at such and such a time this i advance the rather because tis very much for his interest to do this for if we had not many witnesses viva voce to testify it we should have had some obstinate fellows always among us who would have denied the fact or at least have spoken doubtfully of it and so have raisd disputes and objections against it as impossible or at least as improbable buzzing one ridiculous notion or other into our ears as if the devil was not so black as he was painted that he had no more a clovenfoot than a pope whose apostolical toes have so often been reverentially kissd by kings and emperors but now alas this part is out of the question not the man in the moon not the groaningboard not the speaking of fryar bacons brazenhead not the inspiration of mother shipton or the miracles of dr faustus things as certain as death and taxes can be more firmly believd the devil not have a clovenfoot i doubt not but i could in a short time bring you a thousand old women together that would as soon believe there was no devil at all nay they will tell you he could not be a devil without it any more than he could come into the room and the candles not burn blue or go out and not leave a smell of brimstone behind him  since then the certainty of the thing is so well establishd and there are so many good and substantial witnesses ready to testify that he has a clovenfoot and that they have seen it too nay and that we have antiquity on our side for we have this truth confirmd by the testimony of many ages why should we doubt it any longer we can prove that many of our ancestors have been of this opinion and divers learnd authors have left it upon record as particularly that learned familiarist mother hazel whose writings are to be found in ms in the famous library at pyecorner also the admird joan of amesbury the history of the lancashire witches and the reverend exorcist of the devils of london whose history is extant among us to this day all these and many more may be quoted and their writings referrd to for the confirmation of the antiquity of this truth but there seems to be no occasion for farther evidence tis enough satan himself if he did not raise the report yet tacitly owns the fact at least he appears willing to have it believd and be receivd as a general truth for the reasons above  but besides all this and as much a jest as some unbelieving people would have this story pass for who knows but that if satan is empowerd to assume any shape or body and to appear to us visibly as if really so shapd i say who knows but he may by the same authority be allowd to assume the addition of the clovenfoot or two or four clovenfeet if he pleased and why not a clovenfoot as well as any other foot if he thinks fit for if the devil can assume a shape and can appear to mankind in a visible form it may i doubt not with as good authority be advancd that he is left at liberty to assume what shape he pleases and to choose what case of flesh and blood hell please to wear whether real or imaginary and if this liberty be allowd him it is an admirable disguise for him to come generally with his clovenfoot that when he finds it for his purpose on special occasions to come without it as i said above he may not be suspected but take this with you as you go that all this is upon a supposition that the devil can assume a visible shape and make a real appearance which however i do not yet think fit to grant or deny  certain it is the first people who bestowd a clovenfoot upon the devil were not so despicable as you may imagine but were real favourites of heaven for did not aaron set up the devil of a calf in the congregation and set the people a dancing about it for a god upon which occasion expositors tell us that particular command was given levit xvii 7 they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils after whom they have gone a whoring likewise king jeroboam set up the two calves one at dan and the other at bethel and we find them chargd afterwards with setting up the worship of devils instead of the worship of god  after this we find some nations actually sacrificed to the devil in the form of a ram and others of a goat from which and that above of the calves at horeb i doubt not the story of the clovenfoot first derived and it is plain that the worship of that calf at horeb is meant in the scripture quoted above levit xvii 7 thou shalt no more offer sacrifices unto devils the original is seghnirim that is rough and hairy goats or calves and some think also in this shape the devil most ordinarily appeared to the egyptians and arabians from whence it was derived  also in the old writings of the egyptians i mean their hieroglyphick writing before the use of letters was known we are told this was the mark that he was known by and the figure of a goat was the hieroglyphick of the devil some will affirm that the devil was particularly pleased to be so represented how they came by their information and whether they had it from his own mouth or not authors have not yet determined  but be this as it will i do not see that satan could have been at a loss for some extraordinary figure to have banterd mankind with tho this had not been thought of but thinking of the clovenfoot first and the matter being indifferent this took place and easily rooted it self in the bewildred fancy of the people and now tis riveted too fast for the devil himself to remove it if he was disposed to try but as i said above tis none of his business to solve doubts or remove difficulties out of our heads but to perplex us with more as much as he can  some people carry this matter a great deal higher still and will have the clovenfoot be like the great stone which the brasilian conjurers used to solve all difficult questions upon after having used a great many monstrous and barbarous gestures and distortions of their bodies and cut certain marks or magical figures upon the stone so i say they will have this clovenfoot be a kind of a conjuringstone and tell us that in former times when satan drove a greater trade with mankind in publick than he has done of late he gave this clovenfoot as a token to his particular favourites to work wonders with and to conjure by and that witches fairies hobgoblins and such things of which the antients had several kinds at least in their imagination had all a goats leg with a clovenfoot to put on upon extraordinary occasions it seems this method is of late grown out of practice and so like the melting of marble and the painting of glass tis laid aside among the various useful arts which history tells us are lost to the world what may be practised in the fairy world if such a place there be we can give no particular account at present  but neither is this all for other woudbewise people take upon them to make farther and more considerable improvements upon this doctrine of the clovenfoot and treat it as a most significant instrument of satans private operation and that as joseph is said to divine that is to say to conjure by his golden cup which was put into benjamins sack so the devil has managed several of his secret operations and possessions and other hellish mechanisms upon the spirits as well as bodies of men by the medium or instrumentality of the clovenfoot accordingly it had a kind of an hellish inspiration in it and a separate and magical power by which he wrought his infernal miracles that the clovenfoot had a superior signification and was not only emblematic and significative of the conduct of men but really guided their conduct in the most important affairs of life and that the agents the devil employd to influence mankind and to delude them and draw them into all the snares and traps that he lays continually for their destruction were equippd with this foot in aid of their other powers for mischief  here they read us learnd lectures upon the sovereign operations which the devil is at present master of in the government of human affairs and how the clovenfoot is an emblem of the true double entendre or divided aspect which the great men of the world generally act with and by which all their affairs are directed from whence it comes to pass that there is no such thing as a single hearted integrity or an upright meaning to be found in the world that mankind worse than the ravenous brutes preys upon his own kind and devours them by all the laudable methods of flattery whyne cheat and treachery crocodile like weeping over those it will devour destroying those it smiles upon and in a word devours its own kind which the very beasts refuse and that by all the ways of fraud and allurement that hell can invent holding out a cloven divided hoof or hand pretending to save when the very pretence is made use of to ensnare and destroy  thus the divided hoof is the representative of a divided double tongue and heart an emblem of the most exquisite hypocrisy the most fawning and fatally deceiving flattery and here they give us very diverting histories tho tragical in themselves of the manner which some of the devils inspired agents have managd themselves under the especial influence of the clovenfoot how they have made war under the pretence of peace murtherd garrisons under the most sacred capitulations massacred innocent multitudes after surrenders to mercy  again they tell us the clovenfoot has been made use of in all treasons plots assassinations and secret as well as open murthers and rebellions thus joab under the treason of an embrace shewd how dexterously he could manage the clovenfoot and struck abner under the fifth rib thus david playd the clovenfoot upon poor uriah when he had a mind to lie with his wife thus brutus playd it upon cæsar and to come nearer home we have had a great many retrograde motions in this country by this magical implement the foot such as that of the earl of essexs fate beheading the queen of scots and diverse others in queen elizabeths time that of the earl of shrewsbury and sir thomas overbury gondamor and sir walter raleigh and many others in king james the is time in all which if the clovenfoot had not been dexterously managd those murthers had not been so dexterously managd or the murtherers have so well been skreend from justice for which and the imprecated justice of heaven unappeased some have thought the innocent branches of the royal house of stuart did not fare the better in the ages which followd  it must be confessd the clovenfoot was in its full exercise in the next reign and the generation that rose up immediately after them arrived to the most exquisite skill for management of it here they fasted and prayd there they plunderd and murtherd here they raisd war for the king and there they fought against him cutting throats for gods sake and deposing both king and kingly government according to law  nor was the clovenfoot unemployed on all sides for tis the main excellency of this instrument of hell that it acts on every side it is its denominating quality and is for that reason calld a cloven or divided hoof  this mutilated apparition has been so publick in other countries too that it seems to convince us the devil is not confind to england only but that as his empire extended to all the sublunary world so he gives them all room to see he is qualified to manage them his own way  what abundant use did that prince of dissemblers charles v make of this foot twas by the help of this apparition of the foot that he baited his hook with the city of milan and tickled francis i of france so well with it that when he passd thro france and was in that kings power he let him go and never get the bait off of the hook neither it seems the foot was not on king franciss side at that time  how cruelly did philip ii of spain manage this foot in the murther of the nobility of the spanish netherlands the assassination of the prince of orange and at last in that of his own son don carlos infant of spain and yet such was the devils craft and so nicely did he bestir his clovenhoof that this monarch died consolated tho impenitent in the arms of the church and with the benediction of the clergy too those second best managers of the said hoof in the world  i must acknowledge i agree with this opinion thus far namely that the devil acting by this clovenfoot as a machine has done great things in the world for the propagating his dark empire among us and history is full of examples besides the little low prizd things done among us for we are come to such a kind of degeneracy in folly that we have even dishonourd the devil and put this glorious engine the clovenfoot to such mean uses that the devil himself seems to be ashamd of us  but to return a little to foreign history besides what has been mentiond above we find flaming examples of most glorious mischief done by this weapon when put into the hands of kings and men of fame in the world how many games have the kings of france playd with this clovenfoot and that within a few years of one another first charles ix playd the clovenfoot upon gaspar coligni admiral of france when he caressd him complimented him invited him to paris to the wedding of the king of navarre calld him father kissd him and when he was wounded sent his own surgeons to take care of him and yet three days after orderd him to be assassinated and murtherd used with a thousand indignities and at last thrown out of the window into the street to be insulted by the rabble  did not henry iii in the same country play the clovenfoot upon the duke of guise when he calld him to his council and causd him to be murtherd as he went in at the door the guises again plaid the same game back upon the king when they sent out a jacobin friar to assassinate him in his tent as he lay at the siege of paris  in a word this opera of the clovenfoot has been acted all over the christian world ever since judas betrayd the son of god with a kiss nay our saviour says expresly of him one of you is a devil and the sacred text says in another place the devil enterd into judas  it would take up a great deal of time and paper too to give you a full account of the travels of this clovenfoot its progress into all the courts of europe and with what most accurate hypocrisy satan has made use of it upon many occasions and with what success but as in the elaborate work of which i just now gave you a specimen i design one whole volume upon this subject and which i shall call the compleat history of the clovenfoot i say for that reason and diverse others i shall say but very little more to it in this place  it remains to tell you that this merry story of the clovenfoot is very essential to the history which i am now writing as it has been all along the great emblem of the devils government in the world and by which all his most considerable engagements have been answerd and executed for as he is said not to be able to conceal this foot but that he carries it always with him it imports most plainly that the devil would be no devil if he was not a dissembler a deceiver and carried a double entendre in all he does or says that he cannot but say one thing and mean another promise one thing and do another engage and not perform declare and not intend and act like a true devil as he is with a countenance that is no index of his heart  i might indeed go back to originals and derive this clovenfoot from satans primitive state as a cherubim or a celestial being which cherubims as moses is said to have seen them about the throne of god in mount sinai and as the same moses from the original represented them afterwards covering the ark had the head and face of a man wings of an eagle body of a lion and legs and feet of a calf but this is not so much to our present purpose for as we are to allow that whatever satan had of heavenly beauty before the fall he lost it all when he commencd devil so to fetch his original so far up would be only to say that he retaind nothing but the clovenfoot and that all the rest of him was alterd and deformd become frightful and horrible as the devil but his clovenfoot as we now understand it is rather mystical and emblematick and describes him only as the fountain of mischief and treason and the prince of hypocrites and as such we are now to speak of him  tis from this original all the hypocritic world copy he wears the foot on their account and from this model they act this made our blessed lord tell them the works of your father ye will do meaning the devil as he had expressd it just before  nor does he deny the use of the foot to the meaner class of his disciples in the world but decently equips them all upon every occasion with a needful proportion of hypocrisy and deceit that they may hand on the power of promiscuous fraud thro all his temporal dominions and wear the foot always about them as a badge of their professd share in whatever is done by that means  thus every dissembler every false friend every secret cheat every bearskinjobber has a clovenfoot and so far hands on the devils interest by the same powerful agency of art as the devil himself uses to act when he appears in person or would act if he was just now upon the spot for this foot is a machine which is to be wound up and wound down as the cause it appears for requires and there are agents and engineers to act in it by directions of satan the grand engineer who lies still in his retirement only issuing out his orders as he sees convenient  again every class every trade every shopkeeper every pedlar nay that meanest of tradesmen that church pedlar the pope has a clovenfoot with which he paw was upon the world wishes them all well and at the same time cheats them wishes them all fed and at the same time starves them wishes them all in heaven and at the same time marches before them directly to the devil alamode de clovenfoot  nay the very bench the everliving foundation of justice in the world how often has it been made the tool of violence the refuge of oppression the seat of bribery and corruption by this monster in masquerade and that every where our own country always excepted they had much better wipe out the picture of justice blinded and having the sword and scales in her hand which in foreign countries is generally painted over the seat of those who sit to do justice and place instead thereof a naked unarmd clovenhoof a proper emblem of that spirit that influences the world and of the justice we often see administred among them human imagination cannot form an idea more suitable nor the devil propose an engine more or better qualified for an operation of justice by the influence of bribery and corruption it is this magnipotent instrument in the hands of the devil which under the closest disguise agitates every passion bribes every affection blackens every virtue gives a double face to words and actions and to all persons who have any concern in them and in a word makes us all devils to one another  indeed the devil has taken but a dark emblem to be distinguishd by for this of a goat was said to be a creature hated by mankind from the beginning and that there is a natural antipathy in mankind against them hence the scape goat was to bear the sins of the people and to go into the wilderness with all that burthen upon him  but we have a saying among us in defence of which we must enquire into the proper sphere of action which may be assigned to this clovenfoot as hitherto described the proverb is this every devil has not a clovenfoot this proverb instead of giving us some more favourable thoughts of the devil confirms what i have said already that the devil raisd this scandal upon himself i mean the report that he cannot conceal or disguise his devils foot or hoof but that it must appear under whatever habit he shews himself and the reason i gave holds good still namely that he may be more effectually conceald when he goes abroad without it for if the people were fully persuaded that the devil could not appear without this badge of his honour or mark of his infamy take it as you will and that he was bound also to shew it upon all occasions it would be natural to conclude that whatever frightful appearances might be seen in the world if the clovenfoot did not also appear we had no occasion to look for the devil or so much as to think of him much less to apprehend he was near us and as this might be a mistake and that the devil might be there while we thought our selves so secure it might on many occasions be a mistake of very ill consequence and in particular as it would give the devil room to act in the dark and not be discoverd where it might be most needful to know him  from this short hint thus repeated i draw a new thesis namely that devil is most dangerous that has no clovenfoot or if you will have it in words more to the common understanding the devil seems to be most dangerous when he goes without his clovenfoot  and here a learned speculation offers it self to our debate and which indeed i ought to call a council of casuists and men learned in the devils politicks to determine  whether is most hurtful to the world the devil walking about without his clovenfoot or the clovenfoot walking about without the devil  it is indeed a nice and difficult question and merits to be well enquird into for which reason and diverse others i have referrd it to be treated with some decency and as a dispute of dignity sufficient to take up a chapter by itself     chap vii  whether is most hurtful to the world the devil walking about without      his clovenfoot or the clovenfoot walking about without the devil   in discussing this most critical distinction of satans private motions i must as the pulpit gentlemen direct us explain the text and let you know what i mean by several dark expressions in it that i may not be understood to talk as the devil walks in the dark       1 as to the devils walking about       2 his walking without his clovenfoot       3 the clovenfoot walking about without the devil   now as i study brevity and yet would be understood too you may please to understand me as i understand my self thus       1 that i must be allowd to suppose the devil really has a full      intercourse in and through and about this globe with egress and      regress for the carrying on his special affairs when how and      where to his majesty in his great wisdom it shall seem meet      that sometimes he appears and becomes visible and that like a      mastiff without his clog he does not always carry his clovenfoot      with him this will necessarily bring me to some debate upon the      most important question of apparitions hauntings walkings c      whether of satan in human shape or of human creatures in the      devils shape or in any other manner whatsoever       2 i must also be allowd to tell you that satan has a great deal      of wrong done him by the general embracing vulgar errors and that      there is a clovenfoot oftentimes without a devil or in short      that satan is not guilty of all the simple things no or of all      the wicked things we charge him with   these two heads well settled will fully explain the title of this chapter answer the query mentioned in it and at the same time correspond very well with and give us a farther prospect into the main and original design of this work namely the history of the devil we are so fond of and pleased with the general notion of seeing the devil that i am loth to disoblige my readers so much as calling in question his visibility would do nor is it my business any more than it is his to undeceive them where the belief is so agreeable to them especially since upon the whole tis not one farthing matter either on one side or on the other whether it be so or no or whether the truth of fact be ever discovered or not  certain it is whether we see him or no here he is and i make no doubt but he is looking on while i am writing this part of his story whether behind me or at my elbow or over my shoulder is not material to me nor have i once turned my head about to see whether he is there or no for if he be not in the inside i have so mean an opinion of all his extravasated powers that it seems of very little consequence to me what shape he takes up or in what posture he appears nor indeed can i find in all my enquiry that ever the devil appeard qua devil in any of the most dangerous or important of his designs in the world the most of his projects especially of the significant part of them having been carried on another way  however as i am satisfied no body will be pleasd if i should dispute the reality of his appearance and the world runs away with it as a receivd point and that admits no dispute i shall most readily grant the general and give you some account of the particulars  history is fruitful of particulars whether invention has supplyd them or not i will not say where the devil is brought upon the stage in plain and undeniable apparition the story of samuel being raisd by the witch of endor i shall leave quite out of my list because there are so many scruples and objections against that story and as i shall not dispute with the scripture so on the other hand i have so much deference for the dignity of the devil as not to determine rashly how far it may be in the power of every old witch woman to call him up whenever she pleases and that he must come whatever the pretence is or whatever business of consequence he may be engaged in as often as tis needful for her to pa wa for half a crown or perhaps less than half the money  nor will i undertake to tell you till i have talkd farther with him about it how far the devil is concernd to discover frauds detect murthers reveal secrets and especially to tell where any money is hid and shew folks where to find it tis an odd thing that satan should think it of consequence to come and tell us where such a miser hid a strong box or where such an old woman buried her chamber pot full of money the value of all which is perhaps but a trifle when at the same time he lets so many veins of gold so many unexhausted mines nay mountains of silver as we may depend upon it are hid in the bowels of the earth and which it would be so much to the good of whole nations to discover lie still there and never say one word of them to any body besides how does the devils doing things so foreign to himself and so out of his way agree with the rest of his character namely shewing a kind of a friendly disposition to mankind or doing beneficent things this is so beneath satans quality and looks so little that i scarce know what to say to it but that which is still more pungent in the case is these things are so out of his road and so foreign to his calling that it shocks our faith in them and seems to clash with all the just notions we have of him and of his business in the world the like is to be said of those little merry turns we bring him in acting with us and upon us upon trifling and simple occasions such as tumbling chairs and stools about house setting pots and vessels bottom upward tossing the glass and crokery ware about without breaking and such like mean foolish things beneath the dignity of the devil who in my opinion is rather employd in setting the world with the bottom upward tumbling kings and crowns about and dashing the nations one against another raising tempests and storms whether at sea or on shore and in a word doing capital mischiefs suitable to his nature and agreeable to his name devil and suited to that circumstance of his condition which i have fully represented in the primitive part of his exild state  but to bring in the devil playing at pushpin with the world or like domitian catching flies that is to say doing nothing to the purpose this is not only deluding our selves but putting a slur upon the devil himself and i say i shall not dishonour satan so much as to suppose any thing in it however as i must have a care too how i take away the proper materials of winter evening frippery and leave the good wives nothing of the devil to fright the children with i shall carry the weighty point no farther no doubt the devil and dr faustus were very intimate i should rob you of a very significant 6 proverb if i should so much as doubt it no doubt the devil shewd himself in the glass to that fair lady who lookd in it to see where to place her patches but then it should follow too that the devil is an enemy to the ladies wearing patches and that has some difficulties in it which we cannot so easily reconcile but we must tell the story and leave out the consequences  but to come to more remarkable things and in which the devil has thought fit to act in a figure more suitable to his dignity and on occasions consistent with himself take the story of the appearance of julius cæsar or the devil assuming that murthered emperor to the great marcus brutus who notwithstanding all the good things said to justify it was no less than a kingkiller and an assassinator which we in our language call by a very good name and peculiar to the english tongue a ruffian  the spectre had certainly the appearance of cæsar with his wounds bleeding fresh as if he had just receivd the fatal blow he had reproachd him with his ingratitude with a tu brute tu quoque mi fili what thou brutus thou my adopted son now history seems to agree universally not only in the story itself but in the circumstances of it we have only to observe that the devil had certainly power to assume not a human shape only but the shape of julius cæsar in particular  had brutus been a timorous conscienceharryd weakheaded wretch had he been under the horror of the guilt and terrifyd with the dangers that were before him at that time we might suggest that he was overrun with the vapours that the terrors which were upon his mind disorderd him that his head was delirious and prepossessd and that his fancy only placd cæsar so continually in his eye that it realizd him to his imagination and he believd he saw him with many other suggested difficulties to invalidate the story and render the reality of it doubtful  but the contrary to an extreme was the case of brutus his known character placd him above the power of all hypocondriacks or fanciful delusions brutus was of a true roman spirit a bold hero of an intrepid courage one that scornd to fear even the devil as the story allows besides he gloryd in the action there coud be no terror of mind upon him he valued himself upon it as done in the service of liberty and the cause of his country and was so far from being frighted at the devil in the worst shape that he spoke first to him and askd him what art thou and when he was cited to see him again at philippi answerd with a gallantry that knew no fear well i will see thee there whatever the devils business was with brutus this is certain according to all the historians who give us the account of it that brutus discoverd no fear he did not like saul at endor fall to the ground in a swoon 1 sam xxviii 20 then saul fell all along upon the earth and there was no strength in him and was sore afraid in a word i see no room to charge brutus with being overrun with the hyppo or with vapours or with fright and terror of mind but he saw the devil thats certain and with eyes open his courage not at all daunted his mind resolute and with the utmost composure spoke to him replyd to his answer and defyd his summons to death which indeed he feard not as appeard afterward  i come next to an instance as eminent in history as the other this was in char vi of france sirnamed the beloved who riding over the forest near mans a ghastly frightful fellow that is to say the devil so clothed in human vizor came up to his horse and taking hold of his bridle stopd him with the addition of these words stop king whither go you you are betrayd and immediately disappeard it is true the king had been distemperd in his head before and so he might have been deceived and we might have chargd it to the account of a whimsical brain or the power of his imagination but this was in the face of his attendants several of his great officers courtiers and princes of the blood being with him who all saw the man heard the words and immediately to their astonishment lost sight of the spectre who vanishd from them all  two witnesses will convict a murtherer why not a traitor this must be the old gentleman emblematically so called or who must it be nay who else could it be his ugliness is not the case tho ugly as the devil is a proverb in his favour but vanishing out of sight is an essential to a spirit and to an evil spirit in our times especially  these are some of the devils extraordinaries and it must be confessd they are not the most agreeable to mankind for sometimes he takes upon him to disorder his friends very much on these occasions as in the above case of cha vi of france the king they say was really demented ever after that is as we vulgarly but not always improperly express it he was really frighted out of his wits whether the malicious devil intended it so or not is not certain tho it was not so foreign to his particular disposition if he did  but where he is more intimate we are told he appears in a manner less disagreeable and there he is more properly a familiar spirit that is in short a devil of their acquaintance it is true the antients understand the word a familiar spirit to be one of the kinds of possession but if it serves our turn as well under the denomination of an intimate devil or a devil visitant it must be acknowledgd to be as near in the literal sense and acceptation of the word as the other nay it must be allowd tis a very great piece of familiarity in the devil to make visits and shew none of his disagreeables not appear formidable or in the shape of what he is respectfully withholding his dismal part in compassion to the infirmities of his friends  it is true satan may be obligd to make different appearances as the several circumstances of things call for it in some cases he makes his publick entry and then he must shew himself in his habit of ceremony in other cases he comes upon private business and then he appears in disguise in some publick cases he may thing fit to be incog and then he appears dressd a la masque so they say he appeard at the famous st bartholomew wedding at paris where he came in dressd up like a trumpeter dancd in his habit sounded a levet and then went out and rung the alarmbell which was the signal to begin the massacre half an hour before the time appointed lest the kings mind should alter and his heart fail him  if the story be not made upon him for we should not slander the devil it should seem he was not thoroughly satisfied in king charles ixs steadiness in his cause for the king it seems had relaxd a little once before and satan might be afraid he would fall off again and so prevent the execution others say the king did relent immediately after the ringing the alarmbell but that then it was too late the work was begun and the rage of blood having been let loose among the people there was no recalling the order if the devil was thus brought to the necessity of a secret management it must be owned he did it dexterously but i have not authority enough for the story to charge him with the particulars so i leave it au croc  i have much better vouchers for the story following which i had so solemnly confirmd by one that livd in the family that i never doubted the truth of it there livd in the parish of st bennet fynk near the royal exchange an honest poor widow woman who her husband being lately dead took lodgers into her house that is she let out some of her rooms in order to lessen her own charge of rent among the rest she let her garrets to a working watchwheelmaker or one some way concernd in making the movements of watches and who workd to those shopkeepers who sell watches as is usual  it happened that a man and woman went up to speak with this movementmaker upon some business which related to his trade and when they were near the top of the stairs the garretdoor where he usually worked being wide open they saw the poor man the watchmaker or wheelmaker had hangd himself upon a beam which was left open in the room a little lower than the plaister or ceiling surprizd at the sight the woman stopd and cried out to the man who was behind her on the stairs that he should run up and cut the poor creature down  at that very moment comes a man hastily from another part of the room which they upon the stairs could not see bringing a jointstool in his hand as if in great haste and sets it down just by the wretch that was hangd and getting up as hastily upon it pulls a knife out of his pocket and taking hold of the rope with one of his hands beckond to the woman and the man behind her with his head as if to stop and not come up shewing them the knife in his other hand as if he was just going to cut the poor man down  upon this the woman stoppd a while but the man who stood on the jointstool continued with his hand and knife as if fumbling at the knot but did not yet cut the man down at which the woman cried out again and the man behind her calld to her go up says he and help the man upon the stool supposing something hindred but the man upon the stool made signs to them again to be quiet and not come on as if saying i shall do it immediately then he made two strokes with his knife as if cutting the rope and then stoppd again and still the poor man was hanging and consequently dying upon this the woman on the stairs cried out to him what ails you why dont you cut the poor man down and the man behind her having no more patience thrusts her by and said to her let me come ill warrant you ill do it and with that runs up and forward into the room to the man but when he came there behold the poor man was there hanging but no man with a knife or jointstool or any such thing to be seen all that was spectre and delusion in order no doubt to let the poor creature that had hangd himself perish and expire  the man was so frighted and surprizd that with all the courage he had before he dropd on the floor as one dead and the woman at last was fain to cut the poor man down with a pair of scissars and had much to do to effect it  as i have no room to doubt the truth of this story which i had from persons on whose honesty i could depend so i think it needs very little trouble to convince us who the man upon the stool must be and that it was the devil who placd himself there in order to finish the murther of the man who he had devillike tempted before and prevaild with to be his own executioner besides it corresponds so well with the devils nature and with his business viz that of a murtherer that i never questiond it nor can i think we wrong the devil at all to charge him with it       n b i cannot be positive in the remaining part of this story         viz whether the man was cut down soon enough to be recoverd         or whether the devil carryd his point and kept off the man and         woman till it was too late but be it which it will tis plain he         did his devilish endeavour and stayd till he was forcd to         abscond again   we have many solid tales well attested as well in history as in the reports of honest people who could not be deceived intimating the devils personal appearance some in one place some in another as also sometimes in one habit or dress and sometimes in another and it is to be observed that in none of those which are most like to be real and in which there is least of fancy and vapour you have any mention of the cloven foot which rather seems to be a mere invention of men and perhaps chiefly of those who had a cloven understanding i mean a shallow kind of craft the effect of an empty and simple head thinking by such a wellmeant tho weak fraud to represent the devil to the old women and children of the age with some addition suitable to the weakness of their intellects and suited to making them afraid of him  i have another account of a person who travelld upwards of four years with the devil in his company and conversd most intimately with him all the while nay if i may believe the story he knew most part of the time that he was the devil and yet conversd with him and that very profitably for he performd many very useful services for him and constantly preservd him from the danger of wolves and wild beasts which the country he travelld thro was intolerably full of where by the way you are to understand that the wolves and bears in those countries knew the devil whatever disguise he went in or that the devil has some way to fright bears and such creatures more than we know of nor could this devil ever be prevaild upon to hurt him or any of his company this account has an innumerable number of diverting incidents attending it but they are equal to all the rest in bulk and therefore too long for this book  i find too upon some more ordinary occasions the devil has appeard to several people at their call this indeed shews abundance of good humour in him considering him as a devil and that he was mighty complaisant nay some they tell us have a power to raise the devil whenever they think fit this i cannot bring the devil to a level with unless i should allow him to be servus servorum as another devil in disguise calls himself subjected to ever old wizards call or that he is under a necessity of appearing on such or such particular occasions whoever it is that calls him which would bring the devils circumstances to a pitch of slavery which i see no reason to believe of them  here also i must take notice again that tho i say the devil when i speak of all these apparitions whether of a greater or lesser kind yet i am not obligd to suppose satan himself in person is concernd to shew himself but that some of his agents deputies and servants are sent to that purpose and directed what disguise of flesh and blood to put on as may be suitable to the occasion  this seems to be the only way to reconcile all those simple and ridiculous appearances which not satan but his emissaries which we old women call imps sometimes make and the mean and sorry employment they are put to thus fame tells us of a certain witch of quality who calld the devil once to carry her over a brook where the water was swelld with a hasty rain and lashd him soundly with her whip for letting her ladyship fall into the water before she was quite over thus also as fame tells us she set the devil to work and made him build crowland abbey where there was no foundation to be found only for disturbing the workmen a little who were first set about it so it seems another laborious devil was obligd to dig the great ditch cross the country from the fenn country to the edge of suffolk and essex which who ever he has preservd the reputation of and where it crosses newmarket heath tis calld devils ditch to this day  another piece of punishment no doubt it was when the devil was obligd to bring the stones out of wales into wiltshire to build stoneheng how this was ordered in those days when it seems they kept satan to hard labour i know not i believe it must be registred among the antient pieces of art which are lost in the world such as melting of stone painting of glass c certainly they had the devil under correction in those days that is to say those lesser sorts of devils but i cannot think that the muckle thief devil as they call him in the north the grand seignior devil of all was ever reduced to discipline what devil it was that dunstan took by the nose with his red hot tongs i have not yet examind antiquity enough to be certain of any more than i can what devil it was that st francis playd so many warm tricks with and made him run away from him so often however this i take upon me to say in the devils behalf that it coud not be our satan the arch devil of all devils of whom i have been talking so long  now is it unworthy the occasion to take notice that we really wrong the devil and speak of him very much to his disadvantage when we say of such a great lord or of such a lady of quality i think the devil is in your grace no no satan has other business he very rarely possesses fls besides some are so far from having the devil in them that they are really transmigrated into the very essence of the devil themselves and others again not transmigrated or assimilated but indeed and in truth shew us that they are to have mere native devils in every part and parcel of them and that the rest is only masque and disguise thus if rage envy pride and revenge can constitute the parts of a devil why should not a lady of such quality in whom all those extraordinaries abound have a right to the title of being a devil really and substantially and to all intents and purposes in the most perfect and absolute sense according to the most exquisite descriptions of devils already given by me or any body else and even just as joan of arc or joan queen of naples were who were both sent home to their native country as soon as it was discovered that they were real devils and that satan acknowledgd them in that quality  nor does my lady dsss wearing sometimes a case of humanity about her calld flesh and blood at all alter the case for so tis evident according to our present hypothesis satan has been always allowd to do upon urgent occasions ay and to make his personal appearance as such among even the sons and daughters of god too as well as among the children of men and therefore her grace may have appeared in the shape of a fine lady as long as she has been supposd to do without any impeachment of her just claim to the title of devil which being her true and natural original she ought not nor indeed shall not by me be denied her shapes of honour whenever she pleases to declare for a reassumption  and farther to give every truth its due illustration this need not be thought so strange and is far from being unjust her grace as she it may be is now stiled has not acted at least that i never heard of so unworthy her great and illustrious original that we should think she has lost any thing by walking about the world so many years in apparition but to give her the due homage of her quality she has acted as consonant to the essence and nature of devil which she has such a claim to as was consistent with the needful reserve of her present disguise  nor shall we lead the reader into any mistake concerning this part of our work as if this was or is meant to be a particular satyr upon the dss of  and upon her only as if we had no devils among us in the phenomena of fair ladies but this one if satan would be so honest to us as he might be and twoud be very ingenuous in him that must be acknowledgd to give us a little of his illumination in this case we should soon be able to unmasque a great many notable figures among us to our real surprize  indeed tis a point worth our further enquiry and would be a discovery many ways to our advantage were we blessd with it to see how many real devils we have walking up and down the world in masque and how many hooppetticoats compleat the entire masque that disguises the devil in the shape of that thing calld woman  as for the men nature has satisfied her self in letting them be their own disguise and in suffering them to act the old women as old women are vulgarly understood in matters of council and politicks but if at any time they have occasion for the devil in person they are obligd to call him to their aid in such shape as he pleases to make use of pro hac vice and of all those shapes the most agreeable to him seems to be that of a female of quality in which he has infinite opportunity to act to perfection what part soever he is calld in for  how happy are those people who they say have the particular quality or acquird habit calld the second sight one sort of whom they tell us are able to distinguish the devil in whatever case or outside of flesh and blood he is pleasd to put on and consequently could know the devil wherever they met him were i blest with this excellent and useful accomplishment how pleasant would it be and how would it particularly gratify my spleen and all that which i in common with my fellow creatures carry about me calld illnature to stand in the mall or at the entrance to any of our assemblies of beauties and point them out as they pass by with this particular mark thats a devil that fine young toast is a devil theres a devil drest in a new habit for the ball theres a devil in a coach and six cum aliis in short it would make a merry world among us if we coud but enter upon some proper method of such discriminations but lawrd what a hurricane would it raise if like  who they say scourgd the devil so often that he durst not come near him in any shape whatever we coud find some new method out to make the devil unmask like the angel uriel who mr milton says had an enchanted spear with which if he did but touch the devil in whatever disguise he had put on it obligd him immediately to start up and shew himself in his true original shape mere devil as he was  this would do nicely and as i who am originally a projector have spent some time upon this study and doubt not in a little time to finish my engine which i am contriving to screw the devil out of every body or any body i question not when i have brought it to perfection but i shall make most excellent discoveries by it and besides the many extraordinary advantages of it to human society i doubt not but it will make good sport in the world too wherefore when i publish my proposals and divide it into shares as other less useful projects have been done i question not for all the severe act lately passd against bubbles but i shall get subscribers enough c  in a word a secret power of discovering what devils we have among us and where and what business they are doing would be a vast advantage to us all that we might know among the crowd of devils that walk about streets who are apparitions and who are not  now i you must know at certain intervals when the old gentlemans illuminations are upon me and when i have something of an eclaricissement with him have some degrees of this discriminating second sight and therefore tis no strange thing for me to tell a great many of my acquaintance that they are really devils when they themselves know nothing of the matter sometimes indeed i find it pretty hard to convince them of it or at least they are very unwilling to own it but it is not the less so for that  i had a long discourse upon this subject one day with a young beautiful lady of my acquaintance who the world very much admired and as the world judges no farther than they can see and how should they you would say they took her to be as she really was a most charming creature  to me indeed she discoverd her self many ways besides the advantage i had of my extraordinary penetration by the magic powers which i am vested with to me i say she appeard a fury a satyr a fiery little fiend as could possibly be dressd up in flesh in short she appeard to me what really she was a very devil it is natural to human creatures to desire to discover any extraordinary powers they are possessd of superior to others and this itch prevailing in me among the rest i was impatient to let this lady know that i understood her composition perfectly well nay as well as she did her self  in order to this happening to be in the family once for some days and having the honour to be very intimate with her and her husband too i took an opportunity on an extraordinary occasion when she was in the height of good humour to talk with her you must note that as i said the lady was in an extraordinary good humour and there had been a great deal of mirth in the family for some days but one evening sir e her husband upon some very sharp turn she gave to another gentleman which made all the company pleasant run to her and with a passion of good humour takes her in his arms and turning to me says he jack this wife of mine is full of wit and good humour but when she has a mind to be smart she is the keenest little devil in the world this was alluding to the quick turn she had given the other gentleman  is that the best language you can give your wife says my lady o madam says i such devils as you are all angels ay ay says my lady i know that he has only let a truth fly out that he does not understand look ye there now says sir edward could any thing but such a dear devil as this have said a thing so pointed well well adds he devil to a lady in a mans arms is a word of divers interpretations thus they rallied for a good while he holding her fast all the while in his arms and frequently kissing her and at last it went off all in sunshine and mirth  but the next day for i had the honour to lodge in the ladys fathers house where it all happend i say the next day my lady begins with me upon the subject and that very smartly so that first i did not know whether she was in jest or earnest ay ay says she you men make nothing of your wives after you have them alluding to the discourse with sir edward the night before  why madam says i we men as you are pleasd to term it if we meet with good wives worship them and make idols of them what would you have more of us  no no says she before you have them they are angels but when you have been in heaven adds she and smild then they are devils  why madam says i devils are angels you know and were the highest sort of angels once  yes says she very smartly all devils are angels but all angels are not devils  but madam says i you should never take it ill to be calld devil you know  i know says she hastily what dye mean by that  why madam says i and lookd very gravely and serious i thought you had known that i knew it or else i would not have said so for i would not offend you but you may depend i shall never discover it unless you order me to do so for your particular service  upon this she lookd hard and wild and bid me explain my self  i told her i was ready to explain my self if she would give me her word she would not resent it and would take nothing ill  she gave me her word solemnly she would not tho like a true devil she broke her promise with me all at once  well however being unconcernd whether she kept her word or no i began by telling her that i had not long since obtaind the second sight and had some years studied magic by which i could penetrate into many things which to ordinary perception were invisible and had some glasses by the help of which i could see into all visionary or imaginary appearances in a different manner than other people did  very well says she suppose you can whats that to me  i told her it was nothing to her any further than that as she knew her self to be originally not the same creature she seemd to be but was of a sublime angelic original so by the help of my recited art i knew it too and so far it might relate to her  very fine says she so you would make a devil of me indeed  i took that occasion to tell her i would make nothing of her but what she was that i supposd she knew well enough god almighty never thought fit to make any human creature so perfect and compleatly beautiful as she was but that such were also reserved for figures to be assumd by angels of one kind or other  she rallied me upon that and told me that would not bring me off for i had not determined her for any thing angelic but a meer devil and how could i flatter her with being handsome and a devil both at the same time  i told her as satan whom we abusively calld devil was an immortal seraph and of an original angelic nature so abstracted from any thing wicked he was a most glorious being that when he thought fit to encase himself with flesh and walk about in disguise it was in his power equally with the other angels to make the form he took upon himself be as he thought fit beautiful or deformd  here she disputed the possibility of that and after charging me faintly with flattering her face told me the devil could not be represented by any thing handsome alledging our constant picturing the devil in all the frightful appearances imaginable  i told her we wrongd him very much in that and quoted st francis to whom the devil frequently appeared in the form of the most incomparably beautiful naked woman to allure him and what means he used to turn the appearance into a devil again and how he effected it  she put by the discourse and returned to that of angels and insisted that angels did not always assume beautiful appearances that sometimes they appeard in terrible shapes but that when they did not it was at best only amiable faces not exquisite and that therefore it would not hold that to be handsome should always render them suspected  i told her the devil had more occasion to form beauties than other angels had his business being principally to deceive and ensnare mankind and then i gave her some examples upon the whole  i found by her discourse she was willing enough to pass for an angel but twas the hardest thing in the world to convince her that she was a devil and she would not come into that by any means she argued that i knew her father and that her mother was a very good woman and was delivered of her in the ordinary way and that there was such and such ladies who were present in the room when she was born and that had often told her so  i told her that was nothing in such a case as hers that when the old gentleman had occasion to transform himself into a fine lady he could easily dispose of a child and place himself in the cradle instead of it when the nurse or mother were asleep nay or when they were broad awake either it was the same thing to him and i quoted luther to her upon that occasion who affirms that it had been so however i said to convince her that i knew it for i would have it that she knew it already if she pleasd i would go to my chamber and fetch her my magick lookingglass where she should see her own picture not only as it was an angelick picture for the world to admire but a devil also frightful enough to any body but herself and me that understood it  no no said she ill look in none of your conjuring glasses i know my self well enough and i desire to look no otherwise than i am  no madam says i i know that very well nor do you need any better shape than that you appear in tis most exquisitely fine all the world knows you are a compleat beauty and that is a clear evidence what you would be if your present appearing form was reduced to its proper personality  appearing form says she why what would you make an apparition of me  an apparition madam said i yes to be sure why you know you are nothing else but an apparition and what else would you be when it is so infinitely to your advantage  with that she turnd pale and angry and then rose up hastily and lookd into the glass a large peerglass being in the room where she stood surveying her self from head to foot with vanity not a little       i took that time to slip away and running up into my apartment i         fetchd my magic glass as i calld it in which i had a hollow         case so framed behind a lookingglass that in the first she would         see her own face only in the second she would see the devils         face ugly and frightful enough but dressd up with a ladys         headclothes in a circle the devils face in the center and as         it were at a little distance behind   i came down again so soon that she did not think the time long especially having spent it in surveying her fair self when i returnd i said come madam do not trouble your self to look there that is not a glass capable of shewing you any thing come take this glass  it will shew me as much of my self says she a little scornfully as i desire to see so she continued looking in the peerglass after some time more for seeing her a little out of humour i waited to see what observations she would make i askd her if she had viewd her self to her satisfaction she said she had and she had seen nothing of devil about her come madam said i look here and with that i opend the lookingglass and she lookd in it but saw nothing but her own face well says she the glasses agree well enough i see no difference what can you make of it with that i took it a little away dont you says i then i shoud be mistaken very much so i lookd in it my self and giving it a turn imperceptible to her i shewd it her again where she saw the devil indeed dressd up like a fine lady but ugly and devil like as could be desired for a devil to be  she started and cryd out most horribly and told me she thought i was more of a devil than she for that she knew nothing of all those tricks and i did it to fright her she believd i had raisd the devil  i told her it was nothing but her own natural picture and that she knew well enough and that i did not shew it her to inform her of it but to let her know that i knew it too that so she might make no pretences of being offended when i talkd familiarly to her of a thing of this nature  very well so says she i am a real frightful devil am i  o madam says i dont say am i why you know what you are dont you a devil ay certainly as sure as the rest of the world believes you a lady  i had a great deal of farther discourse with her upon that subject tho she would fain have beat me off of it and two or three times she put the talk off and brought something else on but i always found means to revive it and to attack her upon the reality of her being a devil till at last i made her downright angry and then she shewd it  first she cried told me i came to affront her that i would not talk so if sir ed was by and that she ought not to be used so i endeavourd to pacify her and told her i had not treated her with any indecency nor i would not because while she thought fit to walk abroad incog it was none of my business to discover her that if she thought fit to tell sir ed any thing of the discourse she was very welcome or to conceal it which i thought the wisest course she should do just as she pleasd but i made no question i should convince sir e her husband that what i said was just and that i was really so whether it was for her service or no for him to know it was for her to consider  this calmd her a little and she lookd hard at me a minute without speaking a word when on a sudden she broke out thus and you will undertake says she to convince sir ed that he has married a devil will ye a fine story indeed and what follows why then it must follow that the child i go with for she was big with child will be a devil too will it a fine story for sir ed indeed isnt it  i dont know that madam said i thats as you order it by the fathers side said i i know it will not but what it may by the mothers side thats a doubt i cant resolve till the devil and i talk farther about it  you and the devil talk together says she and looks rufully at me why do you talk with the devil then  ay madam says i as sure as ever you did your self besides said i can you question that pray who am i talking to now  i think you are mad says she why you will make devils of all the family it may be and particularly i must be with child of a devil thats certain  no madam said i tis not certain as i said before i question it  why you say i am the devil the child you know has always most of the mother in it then that must be a devil too i think what else can it be says she  i cant tell that madam said i thats as you agree among your selves this kind does not go by generation thats a dispute foreign to the present purpose  then i entred into a discourse with her of the ends and purposes for which the devil takes up such beautiful forms as hers and why it always gave me a suspicion when i saw a lady handsomer than ordinary and set me upon the search to be satisfied whether she was really a woman or an apparition a lady or a devil allowing all along that her being a devil was quite out of the question  upon that very foot she took me up again roundly and so says she you are very civil to me through all your discourse for i see it ends all in that and you take it as a thing confest that i am a devil a very pretty piece of good usage indeed says she i thank you for it  nay madam says i do not take it ill of me for i only discover to you that i knew it i do not tell it you as a secret for you are satisfied of that another way  satisfied of what says she that i am a devil i think the devils in you and so began to be hot  a devil yes madam says i without doubt a meer devil take it as you please i cant help that and so i began to take it ill that she should be disgusted at opening such a wellknown truth to her  with that she discoverd it all at once for she turnd fury in the very letter of it flew out in a passion raild at me curst me most heartily and immediately disappeared which you know is the particular mark of a spirit or apparition  we had a great deal of discourse besides this relating to several other young ladies of her acquaintance some of which i said were mere apparitions like her self and told her which were so and which not and the reason why they were so and for what uses and purposes some to delude the world one way and some another and she was pretty well pleased to hear that but she could not bear to hear her own true character which however as cunning as she was made her act the devil at last as you have heard and then vanished out of my sight  i have seen her in miniature several times since but she proves her self still to be the devil of a lady for she bears malice and will never forgive me that i would not let her be an angel but like a very devil as she is she endeavours to kill me at a distance and indeed the poison of her eyes basilisklike is very strong and she has a strange influence upon me but i that know her to be a devil strive very hard with my self to drive the memory of her out of my thoughts  i have had two or three engagements since this with other apparitions of the same sex and i find they are all alike they are willing enough to be thought angels but the word devil does not go down at all with them but tis all one whenever we see an apparition it is so natural to say we have seen the devil that theres no prevailing with mankind to talk any other language a gentleman of my acquaintance the other day that had courted a lady a long time had the misfortune to come a little suddenly upon her when she did not expect him and found her in such a rage at some of her servants that it quite disorderd her especially a footman the fellow had done something that was indeed provoking but not sufficient to put her into such a passion and so out of her self nor was she able to restrain her self when she saw her lover come in but damnd the fellow and ragd like a fury at him  my friend did his best to compose her and beggd the fellows pardon of her but it would not do nay the poor fellow made all the submissions that could be expected but twas the same thing and so the gentleman not caring to engage himself farther than became him withdrew and came no more at her for three days in all which time she was hardly cool  the next day my friend came to me and talking of it in confidence to me i am afraid says he i am going to marry a she devil and so told me the story i took no notice to him but finding out his mistress and taking proper measures with some of my particular skill i soon found out that it was really so that she was a mere apparition and had it not been for that accidental disorder of her passions which discoverd her inside she might indeed have cheated any man for she was a lovely devil as ever was seen she talkd like an angel sung like a syren did every thing and said every thing that was taking and charming but what then it was all apparition for she was a mere devil it is true my friend marryd her and tho she was a devil without doubt yet either she behavd so well or he was so good i never could hear him find fault with her  these are particular instances but alas i could run you a length beyond all those examples and give you such a list of devils among the gay things of the town that would fright you to think of and you would presently conclude with me that all the perfect beauties are devils mere apparitions but time and paper fails so we must only leave the men the caution let them venture at their peril i return to the subject  we have a great many charming apparitions of like kind go daily about the world in compleat masquerade and tho we must not say so they are in themselves mere devils wicked dangerous murthering devils that kill various ways some basilisklike with their eyes some syrenlike with their tongues all murtherers even from the beginning it is true tis pity these pretty apparitions should be devils and be so mischievous as they are but since it is so i can do no less than to advertise you of it that you may shun the devil in whatever shape you meet with him  again there are some half devils they say like the sagittarii half man half horse or rather like the satyr who they say is half devil half man or like my lord bishop who they say was halfheaded whether they mean halfwitted or no i do not find authors agreed about it but if they had voted him such it had been as kind a thing as any they coud say of him because it would have cleard him from the scandal of being a devil or half a devil for we dont find the devil makes any alliance with fls  then as to merry devils theres my master g he may indeed have the devil in him but it must be said to the credit of possession in general that satan would have scornd to have entred into a soul so narrow that there was not room to hold him or to take up with so discording a creature so abject so scoundrel as never made a figure among mankind greater than that of a thief a moroder moulded up into quality and a raparee dressd up alamasque with a robe and a coronet  some little dogkennel devil may indeed take up his quarters in or near him and so run into and out of him as his drum beats a call but to him that was born a devil satan that never acts to no purpose coud not think him worth being possessd by any thing better than a devil of a dirty quality that is to say a spirit too mean to wear the name of devil without some badge or addition of infamy and meanness to distinguish it by  thus what devil of quality would be confind to a pn who inheriting all the pride and insolence of his ancestors without one of their good qualities the bully the billingsgate and all the hereditary ill language of his family without an ounce of their courage that has been rescued five or six times from the scandal of a coward by the bravery and at the hazard of friends and never faild to be ungrateful that if ever he committed a murther did it in cold blood because no body could prove he ever had any hot who possessd with a poltroon devil was always wickeder in the dark than he durst be by daylight and who after innumerable passive sufferings has been turned out of human society because he could not be kickd or cuffd either into good manners or good humour  to say this was a devil an apparition or even a half devil would be unkind to satan himself since tho he the devil has so many millions of inferior devils under his command not one coud be found base enough to match him nor one devil found but what would think himself dishonourd to be employd about him  some merry goodfornothing devils we have indeed which we might if we had room speak of at large and divert you too with the relation such as my lady hatts devil in essex who upon laying a joiners mallet in the window of a certain chamber would come very orderly and knock with it all night upon the window or against the wainscot and disturb the neighbourhood and then go away in the morning as well satisfied as may be whereas if the mallet was not left he would think himself affronted and be as unsufferable and terrifying as possible breaking the windows splitting the wainscot committing all the disorders and doing all the damage that he was able to the house and to the goods in it and again such as the druming devil in the well at oundle in northamptonshire and such like  a great many antick devils have been seen also who seemd to have little or nothing to do but only to assure us that they can appear if they please and that there is a reality in the thing calld apparition  as to shadows of devils and imaginary appearances such as appear and yet are invisible at the same time i had thought to have bestowd a chapter upon them by themselves but it may be as much to the purpose to let them alone as to meddle with them tis said our old friend luther used to be exceedingly troubled with such invisible apparitions and he tells us much of them in what they call his tabletalk but with master luthers leave tho the devil passes for a very great lyar i could swallow many things of his own proper making as soon as some of those i find in a book that goes by his name particularly the story of the devil in a basket the child flying out of the cradle and the like  in a word the walking devils that we have generally among us are of the female sex whether it be that the devil finds less difficulty to manage them or that he lives quieter with them or that they are fitter for his business than the men i shall not now enter into a dispute about that perhaps he goes better disguisd in the fair sex than otherwise antiquity gives us many histories of shedevils such as we can very seldom match for wickedness among the men such now as in the text lots daughters josephs mistress sampsons dalilah herods herodias these were certainly devils or playd the devil sufficiently in their turn one male apparition indeed the scripture furnishes you with and that is judas for his master says expresly of him one of you is a devil not has the devil or is possessd of the devil but really is a devil or is a real devil  how happy is it that this great secret comes thus to be discoverd to mankind certainly the world has gone on in ignorance a long time and at a strange rate that we should have so many devils continually walking about among us in humane shape and we know it not  philosophers tell us that there is a world of spirits and many learned pieces of guesswork they make at it representing the world to be so near us that the air as they describe it must be full of dragons and devils enough to fright our imaginations with the very thoughts of them and if they say true tis our great felicity that we cannot see any farther into it than we do which if we could would appear as frightful as hell itself but none of those sages ever told us till now that half the people who converse with us are apparitions especially of the women and among them especially this valuable part the woman of figure the fair the beautiful or patchd and painted  this unusual phænomenon has been seen but a little while and but a little way and the general part of mankind cannot come into the same notions about it nay perhaps they will all think it strange but be it as strange as it will the nature of the thing confirms it this lower sphere is full of devils and some of both sexes have given strange testimonies of the reality of their preexistent devilism for many ages past tho i think it never came to that height as it has now  it is true in former times satan dealt much in old women and those as i have observd already very ugly ugly as a witch black as a witch i look like a witch all proverbial speeches and which testifyd what tools it was satan generally workd with and these old spectres they tell us usd to ride thro the air in the night and upon broomsticks too all mighty homely doings some say they usd to go to visit their grand seignior the devil in those nocturnal perambulations but be that as it will tis certain the devil has changd hands and that now he walks about the world clothd in beauty coverd with the charms of the lovely and he fails not to disguise himself effectually by it for who would think a beautiful lady could be a masque to the devil and that a fine face a divine shape a heavenly aspect should bring the devil in her company nay should be herself an apparition a mere devil  the enquiry is indeed worth our while and therefore i hope all the enamourd beaus and boys all the beautyhunters and fortunehunters will take heed for i suppose if they get the devil they will not complain for want of a fortune and theres danger enough i assure you for the world is full of apparitions non rosa sine spinis not a beauty without a devil the old women spectres and the young women apparitions the ugly ones witches and the handsome ones devils lord ha mercy and a illustration cross may be set on the mans door that goes a courting     chap viii  of the clovenfoot walking about the world without the devil viz of      witches making bargains for the devil and particularly of selling      the soul to the devil   i have dwelt long upon the devil in masque as he goes about the world incog and especially without his clovenfoot and have touched upon some of his disguises in the management of his interest in the world i must say some of his disguises only for who can give a full account of all his tricks and arts in so narrow a compass as i am prescribd to  but as i said that every devil has not a clovenfoot so i must add now for the present purpose that every clovenfoot is not the devil  not but that wherever i should meet the clovenhoof i should expect that the devil was not far off and should be apt to raise the posse against him to apprehend him yet it may happen otherwise thats certain every coin has its counterfeit every art its pretender every whore her admirer every error its patron and every day has its devil  i have had some thought of making a full and compleat discovery here of that great doubt which has so long puzzld the world namely whether there is any such thing as secret making bargains with the devil and the first positive assurance i can give you in the case is that if there is not tis not his fault tis not for want of his endeavour tis plain if you will pardon me for taking so mean a step as that of quoting scripture i say tis evident he would fain have made a contract with our saviour and he bid boldly give him his due namely all the kingdoms of the world for one bend of his knee impudent seraph to think thy lord should pay thee homage how many would agree with him here for a less price they say oliver cromwell struck a bargain with him and that he gave oliver the protectorship but would not let him call himself king which stuck so close to that furioso that the mortification spread into his soul and tis said he dyd of a gangreen in the spleen but take notice and do oliver justice i do not vouch the story neither does the bishop say one word of it  fame usd to say that the old famous duke of luxemburg made a magic compact of this kind nay i have heard many an old woman officer of the troops who never card to see his face declare that he carryd the devil at his back i remember a certain author of a news paper in london was once taken up and they say it cost him 50l for printing in his news that luxemburg was humpbackd now if i have resolvd the difficulty namely that he was not humpd only carryd the devil at his back i think the poor man should have his 50l again or i should have it for the discovery  i confess i do not well understand this compacting with such a fellow as can neither write nor read nor do i know who is the scrivener between them or how the indenture can be executed but that which is worse than all the rest is that in the first place the devil never keeps articles he will contract perhaps and they say he is mighty forward to make conditions but who shall bind him to the performance and where is the penalty if he fails if we agree with him he will be apt enough to claim his bargain and demand payment nay perhaps before it is due but who shall make him stand to his  besides he is a knave in his dealing for he really promises what he cannot perform witness his impudent proposal to our lord mentioned above all these kingdoms will i give thee lying spirit why they were none of thine to give no not one of them for the earth is the lords and the kingdoms thereof nor were they in his power any more than in his right so i have heard that some poor dismal creatures have sold themselves to the devil for a sum of money for so much cash and yet even in that case when the day of payment came i never heard that he brought the money or paid the purchase so that he is a scoundrel in his treaties for you shall trust for your bargain but not be able to get your money and yet for your part he comes for you to an hour of which by it self  in a word let me caution you all when you trade with the devil either get the price or quit the bargain the devil is a cunning shaver he will wriggle himself out of the performance on his side if possible and yet expect you should be punctual on your side they tell you of a poor fellow in herefordshire that offerd to sell his soul to him for a cow and though the devil promised and as they say signd the writings yet the poor countryman could never get the cow of him but still as he brought a cow to him some body or other came and challengd it proving that it was lost or stolen from them so that the man got nothing but the name of a cowstealer and was at last carried to hereford goal and condemnd to be hangd for stealing two cows one after the other the wicked fellow was then in the greatest distress imaginable he summond his devil to help him out but he failed him as the devil always will he really had not stolen the cows but they were found in his possession and he could give no account how he came by them at last he was driven to confess the truth told the horrid bargain he had made and how the devil often promisd him a cow but never gave him one except that several times in the morning early he found a cow put into his yard but it always provd to belong to some of his neighbours whether the man was hangd or no the story does not relate but this part is to my purpose that they that make bargains with the devil ought to make him give security for the performance of covenants and who the devil would get to be bound for him i cant tell they must look to that who make the bargain besides if he had not had a mind to cheat or baffle the poor man what need he have taken a cow so near home if he had such and such powers as we talk of and as fancy and fable furnish for him could not he have carried a cow in the air upon a broomstick as well as an old woman could he not have stole a cow for him in lincolnshire and set it down in herefordshire and so have performed his bargain saved his credit and kept the poor man out of trouble so that if the story is true as i really believe it is either it is not the devil that makes those bargains or the devil has not such power as we bestow on him except on special occasions he gets a permit and is bid go as in the case of job the gadaren hogs and the like  we have another example of a mans selling himself to the devil that is very remarkable and that is in the bible too and even in that i do not find what the devil did for him in payment of the purchase price the person selling was ahab of whom the text says expresly there was none like him who did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord 1 kings xxi 20 and the 25 i think it might have been rendred if not translated in spight of the lord or in defiance of god for certainly thats the meaning of it and now allowing me to preach a little upon this text my sermon shall be very short ahab sold himself who did he sell himself to i answer that question by a question who would buy him who as we say would give any thing for him and the answer to that is plain also you may judge of the purchaser by the work he was to do he that buys a slave in the market buys him to work for him and to do such business as he has for him to do ahab was bought to work wickedness and who would buy him for that but the devil  i think theres no room to doubt but ahab sold himself to the devil the text is plain that he sold himself and the work he was sold to do points out the master that bought him what price he agreed with the devil for that indeed the text is silent in so we may let it alone nor is it much to our purpose unless it be to enquire whether the devil stood to his bargain or not and whether he paid the money according to agreement or cheated him as he did the farmer at hereford  this buying and selling between the devil and us is i must confess an odd kind of stockjobbing and indeed the devil may be said to sell the bearskin whatever he buys but the strangest part is when he comes to demand the transfer for as i hinted before whether he performs or no he expects his bargain to a tittle there is indeed some difficulty in resolving how and in what manner payment is made the stories we meet with in our chimneycorner histories and which are so many ways made use of to make the devil frightful to us and our heirs for ever are generally so foolish and ridiculous as if true or not true they have nothing material in them are of no signification or else so impossible in their nature that they make no impression upon any body above twelve years old and under seventy or else are so tragical that antiquity has fabled them down to our taste that we might be able to hear them and repeat them with less horror than is due to them  this variety has taken off our relish of the thing in general and made the trade of soulselling like our late more eminent bubbles be taken to be a cheat and to have little in it  however to speak a little more gravely to it i cannot say but that since by the two eminent instances of it above in ahab and in christ himself the fact is evidently ascertaind and that the devil has attempted to make such a bargain on one and actually did make it with the other the possibility of it is not to be disputed but then i must explain the manner of it a little and bring it down nearer to our understanding that it may be more intelligible than it is for as for this selling the soul and making a bargain to give the devil possession by livery and seisin on the day appointed that i cannot come into by any means no nor into the other part namely of the devil coming to claim his bargain and to demand the soul according to agreement and upon default of a fair delivery taking it away by violence case and all of which we have many historical relations pretty current among us some of which for ought i know we might have hopd had been true if we had not been sure they were false and others we had reason to fear were false because it was impossible they should be true  the bargains of this kind according to the best accounts we have of them used to consist of two main articles according to the ordinary stipulations in all covenants namely       1 something to be performd on the devils part buying       2 something to be performed on the mans part selling   1 the devils part this was generally some poor trifle for the devil generally bought good pennyworths and oftentimes like a compleat sharper agreed to give what he was not able to procure that is to say would bargain for a price he could not pay as in the case of the hereford man and the cow for example 1 long life this tho the deluded chapman has often had folly enough to contract for the devil never had power to make good and we have a famous story how true i know not of a wretch that sold himself to the devil on condition he satan should assure him 1 that he should never want victuals 2 that he should never be a cold 3 that he should always come to him when he calld him and 4 that he should let him live one and twenty years and then satan was at liberty to have him that is i suppose to take him wherever he could find him  it seems the fellows desire to be assurd of 21 years life was chiefly that during that time he might be as wicked as he would and should yet be sure not to be hangd nay to be free from all punishment upon this foot tis said he commencd rogue and committed a great many robberies and other villanous things now it seems the devil was pretty true to his bargain in several of those things particularly that two or three times when the fellow was taken up for petty crimes and calld for his old friend he came and frighted the constables so that they let the offender get away from them but at length having done some capital crime a set of constables or such like officers seizd upon him who were not to be frighted with the devil in what shape soever he appeard so that they carryd him off and he was committed to newgate or some other prison as effectual  nor could satan with all his skill unlock his fetters much less the prison doors but he was tryd convicted and executed the fellow in his extremity they say expostulated with the devil for his bargain the term of 21 years it seems not being expird but the devil it is said shuffld with him told him a good while he would get him out bid him have patience and stay a little and thus led him on till he came as it were within sight of the gallows that is to say within a day or two of his execution when the devil cavilld upon his bargain told him he agreed to let him live 21 years and he had not hindred him but that he did not covenant to cause him to live that time that there was a great deal of difference between doing and suffering that he was to suffer him to live and that he did but he could not make him live when he had brought himself to the gallows  whether this story were true or not for you must not expect we historians should answer for the discourse between the devil and his chaps because we were not privy to the bargain i say whether it was true or not the inference is to our purpose several ways       1 it confirms what i have said of the knavery of the devil in      his dealings and that when he has stockjobbd with us on the best      conditions he can get he very seldom performs his bargain       2 it confirms what i have likewise said that the devils power      is limited with this addition that he not only cannot destroy the      life of man but that he cannot preserve it in short he can      neither prevent or bring on our destruction   i may be allowd i hope for the sake of the present discourse to suppose that the devil would have been so just to this wicked tho foolish creature as to have savd him from the gallows if he could but it seems he at last acknowledgd that it was not in his power nay he could not keep him from being taken and carryd to prison after he was gotten into the hands of a bold fellow or two that were not to be feard with his bluster as some foolish creatures had been before  and how simple how weak how unlike any thing of an angelick nature was it to attempt to save the poor wretch only by little noises and sham appearances putting out the candles rushing and josteling in the dark and the like if the devil was that mighty seraph which we have heard of if he is a god of this world a prince of the air a spirit able to destroy cities and make havock in the world if he can raise tempests and storms throw fire about the world and do wonderful things as an unchaind devil no doubt could do what need all this frippery and what need he try so many ridiculous ways by the emptiness nay the silly nonsensical manner of which he shews that he is able to do no better and that his power is extinguishd in a word he would certainly act otherwise if he could sed caret pedibus he wants power  how weak a thing is it then for any man to expect performance from the devil if he has not power to do mischief which is his element his very nature and on many accounts is the very sum of his desires how should he have power to do good how power to deliver from danger or from death which deliverance would be in itself a good and we know it is not in his nature to do good to or for any man  in a word the devil is strangely impudent to think that any man should depend upon him for the performance of an agreement of any kind whatever when he knows himself that he is not able if he was honest enough to be as good as his word  come we next to his expecting our performance to him tho he is not so just to us yet it seems he never fails to come and demand payment of us at the very day appointed he was but a weak trader in things of this nature who having sold his soul to the devil so our old womens tales call the thing and when the devil came to demand his bargain put it off as a thing of no force for that it was done so long ago he thought he the devil had forgot it it was a better answer which they tell us a lutheran divine gave the devil in the name of a poor wretch who had sold himself to the devil and who was in a terrible fright about his coming for his bargain as he might well be indeed if the devil has such a power as really to come and take it by force the story if you can bear a serious one is this  the man was in great horror of mind and the family feard he would destroy himself at length they sent for a lutheran minister to talk with him and who after some labour with him got out the truth viz that he had sold himself to the devil and that the time was almost expird when he expected the devil would come and fetch him away and he was sure he would not fail coming to the time to a minute the minister first endeavourd to convince him of the horrid crime and to bring him to a true penitence for that part and having as he thought made him a sincere penitent he then began to encourage him and particularly desird of him that when the time was come that the devil should fetch him away he the minister should be in the house with him accordingly to make the story short the time came the devil came and the minister was present when the devil came what shape he was in the story does not say the man said he saw him and cryd out the minister could not see him but the man affirming he was in the room the minister said aloud in the name of the living god satan what comest thou here for the devil answerd i come for my own the minister answerd he is not thy own for jesus christ has redeemd him and in his name i charge thee to avoid and touch him not at which says the story the devil gave a furious stamp with his clovenfoot i suppose and went away and was never known to molest him afterward  another story tho it be in it self a long one i shall abridge for your reading with the less uneasiness as follows  a young gentleman of berg in the elector of brandenburghs now the king of prussias dominions being deeply in love with a beautiful lady but something above his fortune and whom he could by no means bring to love him again applyd himself to an old thing calld a witch for her assistance and promised her great things if she could bring the lady to love him or any how compass her so as he might have his will of her nay at last he told her he would give up his soul to her if she would answer his desire  the old hag it seems having had some of his money had very honestly tried what she could do but all to no purpose the lady would not comply but when he offerd such a great price she told him she would consider farther against such a time and so appointed him the next evening  at the time appointed he comes and the witch made a long speech to him upon the nicety of the affair i suppose to prepare him not to be surprizd at what was to come for she supposd he was not so very desperately bent as he appeard to be she told him it was a thing of very great difficulty but as he had made such a great offer of selling his soul for it she had an acquaintance in the house who was better skilld than she was in such particular things and would treat with him farther and she doubted not but that both together they might answer his end the fellow it seems was still of the same mind and told her he card not what he pawnd or sold if he could but obtain the lady well says the old hag sit still a while and with that she withdraws  by and by she comes in again with a question in her mouth pray says she do you seek this lady for a wife or for a mistress would you marry her or would you only lie with her the young man told her no no he did not expect she would lie with him therefore he would be satisfied to marry her but asks her the reason of the question why truly says the old hag my reason is very weighty for if you would have her for your wife i doubt we can do you no service but if you have a mind to lie with her the person i speak of will undertake it  the man was surprizd at that only he objected that this was a transient or short felicity and that he should perhaps have her no more the old hag bid him not fear but that if she once yielded to be his whore he might have her as often as he pleased upon this he consents for he was stark mad for the lady he having consented she told him then he should follow her but told him whoever he saw he must speak to no body but her till she gave him leave and that he should not be surprizd whatever happend for no hurt should befall him all which he agreed to and the old woman going out he followd her  being upon this led into another room where there was but very little light yet enough to let him see that there was no body in it but himself and the woman he was desired to sit down in a chair next to a table and the old woman clapping the door too after her he asked her why she shut the door and where was the person she told him of at which she answerd there he is pointing to a chair at a little distance the young gentleman turning his head saw a grave kind of a man sitting in an elbowchair tho he said he could have sworn there was no body in the chair when the old woman shut the door however having promisd not to speak to any body but the old woman he said not a word  by and by the woman making abundance of strange gestures and motions and mumbling over several things which he could not understand on a suddain a large wickerchair which stood by the chimney removes to the other end of the table which he sat by but there was no body in the chair in about two minutes after that the chair removd there appeard a person sitting in that too who the room being as is said almost dark could not be so distinguishd by the eye as to see his countenance  after some while the first man and the chair he sat in movd as if they had been one body to the table also and the old woman and the two men seemd to talk together but the young man could not understand any thing they said after some time the old witch turnd to the young gentleman told him his request was granted but not for marriage but the lady should love and receive him  the witch then gave him a stick dipt in tar at both ends and bid him hold it to a candle which he did and instead of burning like a stick it burnt out like a torch then she bid him break it off in the middle and light the other end he did that too and all the room seemd to be in a light flame then she said deliver one piece here pointing to one only of the persons so he gave the first firestick to the first man or apparition now says she deliver the other here so he gave the other piece to the other apparition at which they both rose up and spoke to him words which he said he understood not and could not repeat and immediately vanishd with the firesticks and all leaving the room full of smoke i do not remember that the story says any thing of brimstone or the smell of it but it says the door continud fast lockd and no body was left in the room but the young gentleman and the witch  now the ceremony being over he askd the witch if the business was done she said yes well but says he have i sold my soul to the devil yes says she you have and you gave him possession when you deliverd the two firesticks to him to him says he why was that the devil yes says the old hag at which the young man was in a terrible fright for a while but it went off again  and whats next says he when shall i see the lady for whose sake i have done all this you shall know that presently said she and opening the door in the next room she presents him with a most beautiful lady but had chargd him not to speak a word to her she was exactly dressd like and he presently knew her to be the lady he desird upon which he flew to her and clasped her in his arms but that moment he had her fast as he thought in his arms she vanishd out of his sight  finding himself thus disappointed he upbraids the old woman with betraying him and flew out with ill language at her in a great rage the devil often deluded him thus after this with shews and appearances but still no performance after a while he gets an opportunity to speak with the lady her self in reality but she was as positive in her denial as ever and even took away all hopes of his ever obtaining her which put him into despair for now he thought he had given himself up to the devil for nothing and this brought him to himself so that he made a penitent confession of his crime to some friends who took great care of him and encouragd him and at last furnishd him with such an answer as put the devil into a fright when he came for the bargain  for satan it seems as the story says had the impudence to demand his agreement notwithstanding he had faild in the performance on his part what the answer was i do not pretend to have seen but it seems it was something like what is mentiond above viz that he was in better hands and that he durst not touch him  i have heard of another person that had actually signd a contract with the devil and upon a fast kept by some protestant or christian divines while they were praying for the poor man the devil was obligd to come and throw the contract in at the window  but i vouch none of these stories there may be much in them and much use made of them even whether exactly such in fact as they are related or no the best use i can make of them is this if any wicked desperate wretches have made bargain and sale with satan their only way is to repent if they know how and that before he comes to claim them then batter him with his own guns play religion against devilism and perhaps they may drive the devil out of their reach at least he will not come at them which is as well  on the other hand how many stories have we handed about of the devils really coming with a terrible appearance at the time appointed and powerfully or by violence carrying away those that have given themselves thus up to him nay and sometimes a piece of the house along with them as in the famous instance of sudbury anno 1662 it seems he comes with rage and fury upon such occasions pretending he only comes to take his own or as if he had leave given him to come and take his goods as we say where he could find them and would strike a terror into all that should oppose him  the greatest part of the terror we are usually in upon this occasion is from a supposition that when this hellfire contract is once made god allows the devil to come and take the wicked creature how and in what manner he thinks fit as being given up to him by his own act and deed but in my opinion theres no divinity at all in that for as in our law we punish a felo de se or selfmurtherer because as the law suggests he had no right to dismiss his own life that he being a subject of the commonwealth the government claims the ward or custody of him and so twas not murther only but robbery and is a felony against the state robbing the king of his liegeman as tis justly calld so neither has any man a right to dispose of his soul which belongs to his maker in property and in right of creation the man then having no right to sell satan has no right to buy or at best he has made a purchase without a title and consequently has no just claim to the possession  it is therefore a mistake to say that when any of us have been so mad to make such a pretended contract with the devil that god gives him leave to take it as his due tis no such thing the devil has bought what you had no right to sell and therefore as an unlawful oath is to be repented of and then broken so your business is to repent of the crime and then tell the devil you have better considerd of it and that you wont stand to your bargain for you had no power to sell and if he pretends to violence after that i am mistaken i believe the devil knows better  it is true our old mothers and nurses have told us other things but they only told us what their mothers and nurses told them and so the tale has been handed down from one generation of old women to another but we have no vouchers for the fact other than oral tradition the credit of which i confess goes but a very little way with me nor do i believe it one jot the more for all the frightful addenda which they generally join to the tale for it never wants a great variety of that kind  thus they tell us the devil carried away dr faustus and took a piece of the wall of his garden along with them thus at salisbury the devil as it is said and publickly printed carried away two fellows that had given themselves up to him and carried away the roof of the house with them and the like all which i believe my share of besides if these stories were really true they are all against the devils true interest satan must be a fool which is indeed what i never took him to be in the main this would be the way not to encrease the number of desperadoes who should thus put themselves into his hand but to make himself a terror to them and this is one of the most powerful objections i have against the thing for the devil i say is no fool that must be acknowledgd he knows his own game and generally plays it sure  i might before i quit this point seriously reflect here upon our beau mond viz the gay part of mankind especially those of the times we live in who walk about in a composure and tranquillity inexpressible and yet as we all know must certainly have all sold themselves to the devil for the power of acting the foolishest things with the greater applause it is true to be a fool is the most pleasant life in the world if the fool has but the particular felicity which few fools want viz to think themselves wise the learned say it is the dignity and perfection of fools that they never fail trusting themselves they believe themselves sufficient and able for every thing and hence their want or waste of brains is no grievance to them but they hug themselves in the satiety of their own wit but to bring other people to have the same notion of them which they have of themselves and to have their apish and ridiculous conduct make the same impression on the minds of others as it does on their own this requires a general infatuation and must either be a judgment from heaven or a mist of hell nothing but the devil can make all the men of brains applaud a fool and can any man believe that the devil will do this for nothing no no he will be well paid for it and i know no other way they have to compound with him but this of bargain and sale  tis the same thing with rakes and bullies as tis with fools and beaus and this brings me to the subject of buying and selling it self and to examine what is understood by it in the world what people mean by such and such a man selling himself to the devil i know the common acceptation of it is that they make some capitulation for some indulgence in wickedness on conditions of safety and impunity which the devil promises them tho as i said above he is a bite in that too for he cant perform the conditions however i say he promises boldly and they believe him and for this privilege in wickedness they consent that he shall come and fetch them for his own at such or such a time  this is the state of the case in the general acceptation of it i do not say tis really so nay tis even an inconsistency in it self for one would think they need not capitulate with the devil to be so and so superlatively wicked and give him such a price for it seeing unless we have a wrong notion of him he is naturally enclind as well as avowdly willing to have all men be as superlatively wicked as possibly they can and must necessarily be always ready to issue out his licenses gratis as far as his authority will go in the case and therefore i do not see why the wretches that deal with him should article with him for a price but suppose for argument sake that it is so then the next thing is some capital crime follows the contract and then the wretch is forsaken for the devil cannot protect him as he promised so he is trust up and like coleman at the gallows he exclaims that there is no truth in devils  it may be true however that under the powerful guard and protection of the devil men do sometimes go a great way in crime and that perhaps farther in these our days of boasted morals than was known among our fathers the only difference that i meet with between the sons of belial in former days and those of our ages seems to be in the devils management not in theirs the sum of which amounts to this that satan seems to act with more cunning and they with less for in the former ages of satans dominion he had much business upon his hands all his art and engines and engineers also were kept fully employd to wheedle allure betray and circumvent people and draw them into crimes and they found him as we may say a full employment i doubt not he was calld the tempter on that very account but the case seems quite alterd now the tables are turned then the devil tempted men to sin but now in short they tempt the devil men push into crimes before he pushes them they out shoot him in his own bow out run him on his own ground and as we say of some hot spurs who ride post they whip the postboy in a word the devil seems to have no business now but to sit still and look on  this i must confess seems to intimate some secret compact between the devil and them but then it looks not as is they had contracted with the devil for leave to sin but that the devil had contracted with them that they should sin so and so up to such a degree and that without giving him the trouble of daily solicitation private management and artful screwing up their passions their affections and their most retird faculties as he was before obligd to do  this also appears more agreeable to the nature of the thing and as it is a most exquisite part of satans cunning so tis an undoubted testimony of his success if it was not so he could never bring his kingdom to such a height of absolute power as he has done this also solves several difficulties in the affair of the worlds present way of sinning which otherwise it would be very hard to understand as particularly how some eminent men of quality among us whose upper rooms are not extraordinary well furnished in other cases yet are so very witty in their wickedness that they gather admirers by hundreds and thousands who however heavy lumpish slow and backward even by nature and in force of constitution in better things yet in their race devilwards they are of a sudden grown nimble light of foot and outrun all their neighbours fellows that are as empty of sense as beggars are of honesty and as far from brains as a whore is of modesty on a sudden you shall find them dip into polemicks study michael servetus socinus and the most learned of their disciples they shall reason against all religion as strongly as a philosopher blaspheme with such a keenness of wit and satyrise god and eternity with such a brightness of fancy as if the soul of a rochester or a hobbs was transmigrated into them in a little length of time more they banter heaven burlesque the trinity and jest with every sacred thing and all so sharp so ready and so terribly witty as if they were born buffoons and were singld out by nature to be champions for the devil  whence can all this come how is the change wrought who but the devil can inject wit in spight of natural dullness create brains fill empty heads and supply the vacuities in the understanding and will satan do all this for nothing no no he is too wise for that i can never doubt a secret compact if there is such a thing in nature when i see a head where there was no head sense in posse where there is no sense in esse wit without brains and sight without eyes tis all devilwork could g write satyrs that could neither read latin or spell english like old sir william read who wrote a book of opticks which when it was printed he did not know which was the right side uppermost and which the wrong could this eminent uninformd beau turn atheist and make wise speeches against that being which made him a fool if the devil had not sold him some wit in exchange for that trifle of his calld soul had he not barterd his inside with that son of the morning to have his tongue tipd with blasphemy he that knew nothing of a god but only to swear by him could never have set up for a wit to burlesque his providence and ridicule his government of the world  but the devil as he is god of the world has one particular advantage and that is that when he has work to do he very seldom wants instruments with this circumstance also that the degeneracy of human nature supplies him as the late king of france said of himself when they told him what a calamity was like to befal his kingdom by the famine well says the king then i shall not want soldiers and it was so want of bread supplied his army with recruits so want of grace supplied the devil with reprobates for his work  another reason why i think the devil has made more bargains of that kind we speak of in this age is because he seems to have laid by his clovenfoot all his old emissaries the tools of his trade the engineers which he employd in his mines such as witches warlocks magicians conjurers astrologers and all the hellish train or rabble of human devils who did his drudgery in former days seem to be out of work i shall give you a fuller enumeration of them in the next chapter  these i say seem to be laid aside not that his work is abated or that his business with mankind for their delusion and destruction is not the same or perhaps more than ever but the devil seems to have changd hands the temper and genius of mankind is alterd and they are not to be taken by fright and horror as they were then the figures of those creatures was always dismal and horrible and that is it which i mean by the clovenfoot but now wit beauty and gay things are the sum of his craft he manages by the soft and the smooth the fair and the artful the kind and the cunning not by the frightful and terrible the ugly and the odious    when the devil for weighty dispatches     wanted messengers cunning and bold   he passd by the beautiful faces     and pickd out the ugly and old    of these he made warlocks and witches     to run of his errands by night   till the over wrought hagridden wretches     were as fit as the devil to fright    but whoever has been his adviser     as his kingdom encreases in growth   he now takes his measures much wiser     and trafficks with beauty and youth    disguisd in the wanton and witty     he haunts both the church and the court   and sometimes he visits the city     where all the best christians resort    thus dressd up in full masquerade     he the bolder can range up and down   for he better can drive on his trade     in any ones name than his own     chap ix  of the tools the devil works with viz witches wizards or      warlocks conjurers magicians divines astrologers interpreters      of dreams tellers of fortunes and above all the rest his      particular modern privycounsellors calld wits and fools   tho as i have advancd in the foregoing chapter the devil has very much changd hands in his modern management of the world and that instead of the rabble and long train of implements reckoned up above he now walks about in beaus beauties wits and fools yet i must not omit to tell you that he has not dismissd his former regiments but like officers in time of peace he keeps them all in half pay or like extraordinary men at the customhouse they are kept at a call to be ready to fill up vacancies or to employ when he is more than ordinarily full of business and therefore it may not be amiss to give some brief account of them from satans own memoirs their performance being no inconsiderable part of his history  nor will it be an unprofitable digression to go back a little to the primitive institution of all these orders for they are very antient and i assure you it requires great knowledge of antiquity to give a particular of their original i shall be very brief in it  in order then to this enquiry you must know that it was not for want of servants that satan took this sort of people into his pay he had as i have observd in its place millions of diligent devils at his call whatever business and however difficult he had for them to do but as i have said above that our modern people are forwarder than even the devil himself can desire them to be and that they come before they are calld run before they are sent and crowd themselves into his service so it seems it was in those early days when the world was one universal monarchy under his dominion as i have at large describd in its place  in those days the wickedness of the world keeping a just pace with their ignorance this inferior sort of low prizd instruments did the devils work mighty well they drudgd on in his blackart so laboriously and with such good success that he found it was better to employ them as tools to delude and draw in mankind than to send his invisible implements about and oblige them to take such shapes and dresses as were necessary upon every trifling occasion which perhaps was more cost than worship more pains than pay  having then a set of these voluntiers in his service the true devil had nothing to do but to keep an exact correspondence with them and communicate some needful powers to them to make them be and do something extraordinary and give them a reputation in their business and these in a word did a great part of nay almost all the devils business in the world  to this purpose gave he them power if we may believe old glanville baxter hicks and other learnd consultors of oracles to walk invisible to fly in the air ride upon broomsticks and other wooden gear to interpret dreams answer questions betray secrets to talk gibberish the universal language to raise storms sell winds bring up spirits disturb the dead and torment the living with a thousand other needful tricks to amuse the world keep themselves in veneration and carry on the devils empire in the world  the first nations among whom these infernal practices were found were the chaldeans and that i may do justice in earnest as well as in jest it must be allowd that the chaldeans or those of them so calld were not conjurers or magicians only philosophers and studiers of nature wise sober and studious men at first and we have an extraordinary account of them and if we may believe some of our best writers of fame abraham was himself famous among them for such magick as sir walter raleigh expresses it qui contemplatione creaturarum cognovit creatorem  now granting this it is all to my purpose namely that the devil drew these wise men in to search after more knowledge than nature could instruct them in and the knowledge of the true god being at that time sunk very low he debauchd them all with dreams apparitions conjurers c till he ruind the just notions they had and made devils of them all like himself  the learned senensis speaking of this chaldean kind of learning gives us an account of five sorts of them you will pardon me for being so grave as to go this length back       1 chascedin or chaldeans properly so calld being      astronomers       2 asaphim or magicians such was zoroastres and balaam the      son of beor       3 chatumim or interpreters of dreams and hard speeches      inchanters c       4 mecasphim or witches calld at first prophets afterwards      malefici or venefici poisoners       5 gazarim or auruspices and diviners such as divind by the      entrails of beasts the liver in particular mentiond in ezek      or as others calld augurs   now as to all these i suppose i may do them no wrong if i say however justifiable they were in the beginning the devil got them all into his service at last and that brings me to my text again from which the rest was a digression       1 the chascedin or chaldean astronomers turned astrologers      fortunetellers calculators of nativities and vile deluders of      the people as if the wisdom of the holy god was in them as      nebuchadnezzar said of daniel on that very account       2 the asaphim or magi or magicians sixtus senensis says      they were such as wrought by covenants with devils but turnd to      it from their wisdom which was to study the practical part of      natural philosophy working admirable effects by the mutual      application of natural causes       3 the chartumim from being reasoners or disputers upon difficult      points in philosophy became enchanters and conjurers so       4 the mecasphim or prophets they turnd to be sorcerers      raisers of spirits such as wounded by an evil eye and by bitter      curses and were afterwards famd for having familiar converse with      the devil and were called witches       5 the gazarim from the bare observing of the good and bad      omens by the entrails of beasts flying of birds c were      turnd to sacrists or priests of the heathen idols and sacrificers   thus i say first or last the devil engrossd all the wisemen of the east for so they are calld made them all his own and by them he workd wonders that is he filld the world with lying wonders as if wrought by these men when indeed it was all his own from beginning to the end and set on foot meerly to propagate delusion impose upon blinded and ignorant men the god of this world blinded their minds and they were led away by the subtilty of the devil to say no worse of it till they became devils themselves as to mankind for they carried on the devils work upon all occasions and the race of them still continue in other nations and some of them among our selves as we shall see presently  the arabians followd the chaldeans in this study while it was kept within its due bounds and after them the egyptians and among the latter we find that jannes and jambres were famous for their leading pharaoh by their pretended magic performances to reject the real miracles of moses and history tells us of strange pranks the wisemen the magicians and the southsayers plaid to delude the people in the most early ages of the world  but as i say now the devil has improvd himself so he did then for the grecian and roman heathen rites coming on they outdid all the magicians and southsayers by establishing the devils lying oracles which as a masterpiece of hell did the devil more honour and brought more homage to him than ever he had before or could arrive to since  again as by the setting up the oracles all the magicians and southsayers grew out of credit so at the ceasing of those oracles the devil was fain to go back to the old game again and take up with the agency of witches divinations inchantments and conjurings as i hinted before answerable to the four sorts mentiond in the story of nebuchadnezzar viz magicians astrologers the chaldeans and the southsayers how these began to be out of request i have mentiond already but as the devil has not quite given them over only laid them aside a little for the present we may venture to ask what they were and what use he made of them when he did employ them  the truth is i think as it was a very mean employment for any thing that wears a human countenance to take up so i must acknowledge i think twas a mean low prizd business for satan to take up with below the very devil below his dignity as an angelic tho condemnd creature below him even as a devil to go to talk to a parcel of ugly deformd spiteful malicious old women to give them power to do mischief who never had a will after they enterd into the state of old womanhood to do any thing else why the devil always chose the ugliest old women he could find whether wizardism made them ugly that were not so before and whether the ugliness as it was a beauty in witchcraft did not encrease according to the meritorious performance in the blacktrade these are all questions of moment to be decided if human learning can arrive to so much perfection in ages to come  some say the evil eye and the wicked look were parts of the enchantment and that the witches when they were in the height of their business had a powerful influence with both that by looking upon any person they could bewitch them and make the devil as the scots express it ride through them booted and spurrd and that hence came that very significant saying to look like a witch  the strange work which the devil has made in the world by this sort of his agents calld witches is such and so extravagantly wild that except our hope that most of those tales happen not to be true i know not how any one could be easy to live near a widow after she was five and fifty  all the other sorts of emissaries which satan employs come short of these ghosts and apparitions sometimes come and shew themselves on particular accounts and some of those particulars respect doing justice repairing wrongs preventing mischief sometimes in matters very considerable and on things so necessary to publick benefit that we are tempted to believe they proceed from some vigilant spirit who wishes us well but on the other hand these witches are never concernd in any thing but mischief nay if what they do portends good to one it issues in hurt to many the whole tenour of their life their design in general is to do mischief and they are only employd in mischief and nothing else how far they are furnishd with ability suitable to the horrid will they are vested with remains to be describd  these witches tis said are furnishd with power suitable to the occasion that is before them and particularly that which deserves to be considerd as prediction and foretelling events which i insist the author of witchcraft is not accomplishd with himself nor can he communicate it to any other how then witches come to be able to foretel things to come which tis said the devil himself cannot know and which as i have shewn tis evident he does not know himself is yet to be determind that witches do foretel is certain from the witch of endor who foretold things to saul which he knew not before namely that he should be slain in battle the next day which accordingly came to pass  there are however and notwithstanding this particular case many instances wherein the devil has not been able to foretel approaching events and that in things of the utmost consequence and he has given certain foolish or false answers in such cases the devils priests which were summond in by the prophet elija to decide the dispute between god and baal had the devil been able to have informd them of it would certainly have receivd notice from him of what was intended against them by elija that is to say that they would be all cut in pieces for satan was not such a fool as not to know that baal was a nonentity a nothing at best a dead man perishd and rotting in his grave for baal was bell or belus an ancient king of the assyrian monarchy and he could no more answer by fire to consume the sacrifice than he could raise himself from the dead  but the priests of baal were left of their master to their just fate namely to be a sacrifice to the fury of a deluded people hence i infer his inability for it would have been very unkind and ungrateful in him not to have answerd them if he had been able there is another argument raised here most justly against the devil with relation to his being under restraint and that of greater eminence than we imagine and it is drawn from this very passage thus tis not to be doubted but that satan who has much of the element put into his hands as prince of the air had a power or was able potentially speaking to have answerd baals priests by fire fire being in vertue of his airy principality a part of his dominion but he was certainly withheld by the superior hand which gave him that dominion i mean withheld for the occasion only so in another case it was plain that balaam who was one of those sorts of chaldeans mentiond above who dealt in divinations and inchantments was withheld from cursing israel  some are of opinion that balaam was not a witch or a dealer with the devil because tis said of him or rather he says it of himself that he saw the visions of god numb xxiv 16 he hath said who heard the words of god and knew the knowledge of the most high which saw the visions of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open hence they alledge he was one of those magi which st augustin speaks of de divinatione who by the study of nature and by the contemplation of created beings came to the knowledge of the creature and that balaams fault was that being tempted by the rewards and honours that the king promised him he intended to have cursd israel but when his eyes were opend and that he saw they were gods own people he durst not do it they will have it therefore that except as above balaam was a good man or at least that he had the knowledge of the true god and the fear of that god upon him and that he honestly declares this numb xxii 18 if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god where tho he is calld a false prophet by some he evidently owns god and assumes a property in him as other prophets did my god and i cannot go beyond his orders but that which gives me a better opinion of balaam than all this is his plain prophesy of christ chap xxiv 17 where he calls him the star of jacob and declares i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not nigh there shall come a star out of jacob and a scepter shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moab and destroy all the children of seth all which express not a knowledge only but a faith in christ but i have done preaching this is all by the by i return to my business which is the history  there is another piece of dark practice here which lies between satan and his particular agents and which they must give us an answer to when they can which i think will not be in haste and that is about the obsequious devil submitting to be calld up into visibility whenever an old woman has her hand crossd with a white sixpence as they call it one would think that instead of these vile things calld witches being sold to the devil the devil was really sold for a slave to them for how far soever satans residence is off of this state of life they have power it seems to fetch him from home and oblige him to come at their call  i can give little account of this only that indeed so it is nor is the thing so strange in its self as the methods to do it are mean foolish and ridiculous as making a circle and dancing in it pronouncing such and such words saying the lords prayer backward and the like now is this agreeable to the dignity of the prince of the air or atmosphere that he should be commanded forth with no more pomp or ceremony than that of muttering a few words such as the old witches and he agree about or is there something else in it which none of us or themselves understand  perhaps indeed he is always with those people calld witches and conjurers or at least some of his camp volant are always present and so upon the least call of the wizard it is but putting off the misty cloak and showing themselves  then we have a piece of mock pageantry in bringing those things calld witches or conjurers to justice that is first to know if a woman be a witch throw her into a pond and if she be a witch she will swim and it is not in her own power to prevent it if she does all she can to sink her self it will not do she will swim like a cork then that a rope will not hang a witch but you must get a with a green osyer that if you nail a horseshoe on the sill of the door she cannot come into the house or go out if she be in these and a thousand more too simple to be believd are yet so vouchd so taken for granted and so universally receivd for truth that there is no resisting them without being thought atheistical  what methods to take to know who are witches i really know not but on the other side i think there are variety of methods to be used to know who are not w g esq is a man of fame his parts are great because his estate is so he has threescore and eight lines of virgil by rote and they take up many of the intervals of his merry discourses he has just as many witty stories to please society when they are well told once over he begins again and so he lives in a round of wit and learning he is a man of great simplicity and sincerity you must be careful not to mistake my meaning as to the word simplicity some take it to mean honesty and so do i only that it has a negative attending it in his particular case in a word w g is an honest man and no conjurer a good character i think and without impeachment to his understanding he may be a man of worth for all that take the other sex there is the lady h is another discovery bless us what charms in that face how bright those eyes how flowing white her breasts how sweet her voice add to all how heavenly divinely good her temper how inimitable her behaviour how spotless her virtue how perfect her innocence and to sum up her character we may add the lady h is no witch sure none of our beau critics will be so unkind now as to censure me in those honest descriptions as if i meant that my good friend w g esq or my adord angel the bright the charming lady h were fools but what will not those savages calld critics do whose barbarous nature enclines them to trample on the brightest characters and to cavil on the clearest expressions  it might be expected of me however in justice to my friends and to the bright characters of abundance of gentlemen of this age who by the depth of their politics and the height of their elevations might be suspected and might give us room to charge them with subterranean intelligence i say it might be expected that i should clear up their fame and assure the world concerning them even by name that they are no conjurers that they do not deal with the devil at least not by the way witchcraft and divination such as sir tk e b esq my lord homily coll swagger jeoffry well with esq capt harry go deeper mr wellcome woollen citizen and merchant taylor of london henry cadaver esq the d of caerfilly the marquess of sillyhoo sir edward thro and thro bart and a world of fine gentlemen more whose great heads and weighty understandings have given the world such occasion to challenge them with being at least descended from the magi and perhaps engaged with old satan in his politics and experiments but i that have such good intelligence among satans ministers of state as is necessary to the present undertaking am thereby well able to clear up their characters and i doubt not but they will value themselves upon it and acknowledge their obligation to me for letting the world know the devil does not pretend to have had any business with them or to have enrolld them in the list of his operators in a word that none of them are conjurers upon which testimony of mine i expect they be no longer chargd with or so much as suspected of having an unlawful quantity of wit or having any sorts of it about them that are contraband or prohibited but that for the future they pass unmolested and be taken for nothing but what they are viz very honest worthy gentlemen     chap x  of the various methods the devil takes to converse with mankind   having spoken something of persons and particularly of such as the devil thinks fit to employ in his affairs in the world it comes next of course to say something of the manner how he communicates his mind to them and by them to the rest of his acquaintance in the world  i take the devil to be under great difficulties in his affairs on his part especially occasiond by the bounds which are set him or which policys oblige him to set to himself in his access to the conversing with mankind tis evident he is not permitted to fall upon them with force and arms that is to say to muster up his infernal troops and attack them with fire and sword if he was not loose to act in this manner as he was able by his own seraphic power to have destroyd the whole race and even the earth they dwelt upon so he would certainly and long ago have effectually done it his particular interests and inclinations are well enough known  but in the next place as he is thus restraind from violence so prudentials restrain him in all his other actings with mankind and being confind to stratagem and soft still methods such as persuasion allurement feeding the appetite prompting and then gratifying corrupt desires and the like he finds it for his purpose not to appear in person except very rarely and then in disguise but to act all the rest in the dark under the vizor of art and craft making use of persons and methods conceald or at least not fully understood or discoverd  as to the persons whom he employs i have taken some pains you see to discover some of them but the methods he uses with them either to inform and instruct and give orders to them or to converse with other people by them these are very particular and deserve some place in our memoirs particularly as they may serve to remove some of our mistakes and to take off some of the frightful ideas we are apt to entertain in prejudice of this great manager as if he was no more to be matchd in his politics than he would be to be matchd in his power if it was let loose which is so much a mistake that on the contrary we read of several people that have abused and cheated the devil a thing which i cannot say is very honest nor just notwithstanding the old latin proverb fallere fallentem non est fraus which men construe or rather render by way of banter upon satan tis no sin to cheat the devil which for all that upon the whole i deny and alledge that let the devil act how he will by us we ought to deal fairly by him  but to come to the business without circumlocutions i am to enquire how satan issues out his orders gives his instructions and fully delivers his mind to his emissaries of whom i have mentiond some in the title to chap ix in order to this you must form an idea of the devil sitting in great state in open campaign with all his legions about him in the height of the atmosphere or if you will at a certain distance from the atmosphere and above it that the plan of his encampment might not be hurried round its own axis with the earths diurnal motion which might be some disturbance to him  by this fixd situation the earth performing its rotation he has every part and parcel of it brought to a direct opposition to him and consequently to his view once in twenty four hours the last time i was there if i remember right he had this quarter of the world which we call christendom just under his eye and as the motion is not so swift but that his piercing opticks can take a strict view of it en passant for the circumference of it being but twenty one thousand miles and its circular motion being full twenty four hours performing he has something more than an hour to view every thousand miles which to his supernatural penetration is not worth naming  as he takes thus a daily view of all the circle and an hourly view of the parts he is fully master of all transactions at least such as are done above board by all mankind and then he dispatches his emissaries or aid du camps to every part with his orders and instructions now these emissaries you are to understand are not the witches and diviners who i spoke of above for i call them also emissaries but they are all devils or as you know they are calld devils angels and these may perhaps come and converse personally with the subemissaries i mentiond to be ready for their support and assistance on all occasions of business these are those devils which the witches are said to raise for we can hardly suppose the master devil comes himself at the summons of every ugly old woman  these run about into every nook and corner wherever satans business calls them and are never wanting to him but are the most diligent devils imaginable like the turkish chaiux they no sooner receive their errand but they execute it with the utmost alacrity and as to their speed it may be truly written as a motto upon the head of every individual devil    non indiget calcaribus   these are those who they tell us our witches sorcerers wizards and such sorts of folks converse freely with and are therefore calld their familiars and as they tell us come to them in human shapes talk to them with articulate plain voices as if men and that yet the said witches c know them to be devils  history has not yet enlightend us in this part of useful knowledge or at least not sufficiently for a description of the persons or habits of these sorts of appearances as what shapes they take up what language they speak and what particular works they perform so we must refer it to farther enquiry but if we may credit history we are told many famous stories of these appearances for example the famous mother lakland who was burnt for a witch at ipswich anno 1646 confessed at the time of her execution or a little before it that she had frequent conversation with the devil himself that she being very poor and withal of a devilish passionate cruel and revengeful disposition before used to wish she had it in her power to do such and such mischievous things to some that she hated and that the devil himself who it seems knew her temper came to her one night as she lay in her bed and was between sleeping and waking and speaking in a deep hollow voice told her if she would serve him in some things he would employ her to do she should have her will of all her enemies and should want for nothing that she was much afraid at first but that he solliciting her very often bad her not be afraid of him and still urgd her to yield and as she says struck his claw into her hand and tho it did not hurt her made it bleed and with the blood wrote the covenants that is to say the bargain between them being askd what was in them and whether he requird her to curse or deny god or christ she said no       n b i do not find she told them whether the devil wrote it with         a pen or whether on paper or parchment nor whether she signd it         or no but it seems he carryd it away with him i suppose if         satans register were examind it might be found among the         archives of hell the rolls of his acta publica and when his         historiographer royal publishes them we may look for it among         them   then he furnishd her with three devils to wait upon her i suppose for she confessd they were to be employd in her service they attended in the shapes of two little dogs and a mole the first she bewitchd was her own husband by which he lay a while in great misery and died then she sent to one captain beal and burnt a new ship of his just built which had never been at sea these and many other horrid things she did and confessd and having been twenty years a witch at last the devil left her and she was burnt as she deservd  that some extraordinary occasions may bring these agents of the devil nay sometimes the devil himself to assume human shapes and appear to other people we cannot doubt he did thus in the case of our saviour as a tempter and some think he did so to manasses as a familiar who the scripture charges with sorcery and having a familiar or devil fame tells us that st dunstan frequently converst with him and finally took him by the nose and so of others  but in these modern ages of the world he finds it much more to his purpose to work under ground as i have observd and to keep upon the reserve so that we have no authentick accounts of his personal appearance but what are very antient or very remote from our faith as well as our enquiry  it seems to be a question that would bear some debating whether all apparitions are not devils or from the devil but there being so many of those apparitions which we call spirits which really assume shapes and make appearances in the world upon such accounts as we know satan himself scorns to be employd in that i must dismiss the question in favour of the devil assuring them that as he never willingly did any good in his life so he would be far from giving himself the trouble of setting one foot into the world on such an errand and for that reason we maybe assurd those certain apparitions which we are told came to detect a murther in gloucestershire and others who appeard to prevent the ruining an orphan for want of finding a deed that was not lost was certainly some other power equally concernd and not the devil  on the other hand neither will it follow that satan never appears in human shape for tho every apparition may not be the devil yet it does not follow that the devil never makes an apparition all i shall say to it is as i have mentiond before that generally speaking the devil finds it more for his purpose to have his interest in the world propagated another way namely in private and his personal appearances are reservd for things only of extraordinary consequence and as i may say of evident necessity where his honour is concernd and where his interest could be carried on no other way not forgetting to take notice that this is very seldom  it remains to enquire what then those things are which we make so much stir about and which are calld apparitions or spirits assuming human shapes and shewing themselves to people on particular occasions whether they are evil spirits or good and tho indeed this is out of my way at this time and does not relate at all to the devils history yet i thought it not amiss to mention it 1 because as i have said i do not wholly exclude satan from all concern in such things and 2 because i shall dismiss the question with so very short an answer namely that we may determine which are and which are not the devils by the errand they come upon every one to his own business if it comes of a good errand you may certainly acquit the devil of it conclude him innocent and that he has no hand in it if it comes of a wicked and devilish errand you may een take him up upon suspicion tis ten to one but you find him at the bottom of it  next to apparitions we find mankind disturbd by abundance of little odd reservd ways which the devil is shrewdly suspected of having a hand in such as dreams noises voices c smells of brimstone candles burning blue and the like  as to dreams i have nothing to say in satans prejudice at all there i make no question but he deals very much in that kind of intelligence and why should he not we know heaven it self formerly converst very often with the greatest of men by the same method and the devil is known to mimick the methods as well as the actions of his maker whether heaven has not quite left off that way of working we are not certain but we pretty well know the devil has not left it and i believe some instances may be given where his worship has been really seen and talkd to in sleep as much as if the person had been awake with his eyes open  these are to be distinguishd too pretty much by the goodness or badness of the subject how often have men committed murther robbery and adultery in a dream and at the same time except an extraordinary agitation of the soul and expressd by extraordinary noises in the sleep by violent sweating and other such ways the head has never been removd from the pillow or the body so much as turnd in the bed  whether in such cases the soul with all the passions and affections being agitated and giving their full assent to the facts of whatever kind soever the man is not as guilty as if the sins so dreamd of his committing had been actually committed tho it be no doubt to me but that it is so yet as it is foreign to the present affair and not at all relating to the devils history i leave it to the reverend doctors of the church as properly belonging to them to decide  i knew a person who the devil so haunted with naked women fine beautiful ladies in bed with him and ladies of his acquaintance too offering their favours to him and all in his sleep so that he seldom slept without some such entertainment the particulars are too gross for my story but he gave me several long accounts of his nights amours and being a man of a virtuous life and good morals it was the greatest surprize to him imaginable for you cannot doubt but that the cunning devil made every thing be acted to the life with him and in a manner the most wicked he ownd with grief to me that the very first attack the devil made upon him was with a very beautiful lady of his acquaintance who he had been really something freer than ordinary with in their common conversation this lady he brought to him in a posture for wickedness and wrought up his inclination so high in his sleep that he as he thought actually went about to debauch her she not at all resisting but that he wakd in the very moment to his particular satisfaction  he was greatly concernd at this part namely that he really gave the consent of his will to the fact and wanted to know if he was not as guilty of adultery as if he had lain with her indeed he decided the question against himself so forcibly that i who was of the same opinion before had nothing to say against it however i confirmd him in it by asking him these questions       1 whether he did not think the devil had the chief hand in such      a dream he answerd it could certainly be no body else it must      be the devil       2 i then askd him what reason the devil could have for it if      his consent to the fact in sleep had not been criminal thats      true indeed says he i am answerd but then he askd another      question which i confess is not so easy to answer namely how      he should prevent being servd so again   nor could all my divinity or his own keep the devil from attacking him again on the other hand as i have said he worried him to that degree that he injurd his health bringing naked women to him sometimes one sometimes another sometimes in one posture of lewdness sometimes in another sometimes into his very arms sometimes with such additions as i am not merry enough and sometimes such as i am not wicked enough to put into your heads the man indeed could not help it and so the devil was more faulty than he but as i hinted to him he might bring his mind to such a stated habit of virtue as to prevent its assenting to any wicked motion even in sleep and that would be the way to put an end to the attempt and this advice he relishd very well and practised i believe with success  by this same method the same devil injects powerful incentives to other crimes provokes avarice by laying a great quantity of gold in your view and no body present giving you an opportunity to steal it or some of it at the same time perhaps knowing your circumstances to be such as that you are at that time in a great want of the money  i knew another who being a tradesman and in great distress for money in his business dreamd that he was walking all alone in a great wood and that he met a little child with a bag of gold in its hand and a fine necklace of diamonds on its neck upon the sight his wants presently dictated to him to rob the child the little innocent creature just so he dreamd not being able to resist or to tell who it was accordingly he consented to take the money from the child and then to take the diamond necklace from it too and did so  but the devil a full testimony as i told him that it was the devil not contented with that hinted to him that perhaps the child might some time or other know him and single him out by crying or pointing or some such thing especially if he was suspected and shewd to it and therefore it would be better for him to kill the child prompting him to kill it for his own safety and that he need do no more but twist the neck of it a little or crush it with his knee he told me he stood debating with himself whether he should do so or not but that in that instant his heart struck him with the word murther and he entertaind a horror of it refusd to do it and immediately waked  he told me that when he wakd he found himself in so violent a sweat as he never had known the like that his pulse beat with that heat and rage that it was like a palpitation of the heart to him and that the agitation of his spirits was such that he was not fully composed in some hours tho the satisfaction and joy that attended him when he found it was but a dream assisted much to return his spirits to their due temperament  it is neither my business or inclination to turn divine here nor is the age i write to sufficiently grave to relish a sermon if i was disposed to preach though they must allow the subject would very well bear it but i shall only ask them if they think this is not the devil what they think it is if they believe it is the devil they will act accordingly i hope or let it alone as satan and they can agree about it  i should not oblige the devil over much whatever i might do to those that read it if i should enter here upon a debate of interests viz to enquire whether the devil has not a vast advantage upon mankind this way and whether it is not much his interest to preserve it and if i prove the affirmative i leave it to you to enquire whose interest it is to disappoint and supplant him  in short i take dreams to be the second best of the advantages the devil has over mankind the first i suppose you all know viz the treachery of the garrison within by dreams he may be said to get into the inside of us without opposition here he opens and locks without a key and like an enemy laying siege to a fortified city reason and nature the governor of the city keep him out by day and keep the garrison true to their duty but in the dark he gets in and parlees with the garrison the affections and passions debauches their loyalty stirring up them to disloyalty and rebellion so they betray their trust revolt mutiny and go over to the besieger  thus he manages his interest i say and insinuates himself into the inside of us without our consent nay without our knowledge for whatever speculation may do tis evident demonstration does not assist us to discover which way he gets access to the soul while the organ tied up and dozed with sleep has lockd it up from action that it is so is clear but how he does it is a secret which i do not find the antients or moderns have yet made a discovery of  that devil of a creature mother lakland whose story i mentiond above acknowledgd that the first time the devil attempted to draw her in to be a witch was in a dream and even when she consented she said she was between sleeping and waking that is she did not know whether she was awake or asleep and the cunning devil it seems was satisfied with her assent given so when she was asleep or neither asleep or awake so taking the advantage of her incapacity to act rationally  the stories of her bewitching several people and the manner in which they died are so formidable and extravagant that i care not to put any ones faith to the stretch about them tho publishd by authority and testified by abundance of witnesses but this is recorded in particular and to my purpose whether from her own mouth or not i do not say namely the description of a witch and the difference between witches and those other of satans acquaintance who act in his name       1 they have consulted and covenanted with a spirit or devil       2 they have a deputy devil sometimes several to serve and      assist them       3 these they employ as they please call them by name and command      their appearance in whatever shape they think fit       4 they send them abroad to or into the persons who they design to      bewitch who they always torment and often murther them as mother      lakland did several   as to the difference between the several devils that appear it relates to the office of the persons who employ them as conjurers who seem to command the particular devil that waits upon them with more authority and raise them and lay them at pleasure drawing circles casting figures and the like but the witch in a more familiar manner whispers with the devil keeps the devil in a bag or a sack sometimes in her pocket and the like and like mr faux shews tricks with him  but all these kinds deal much in dreams talk with the devil in their sleep and make other people talk with him in their sleep too and tis on this occasion i mention it here in short the devil may well take this opportunity with mankind for not half the world that came into his measures would comply if they were awake but of that hereafter  and yet his thus insinuating himself by dream does not seem sufficient in my opinion to answer the devils end and to carry on his business and therefore we must be forcd to allow him a kind of actual possession in particular cases and that in the souls of some people by different methods from others luther is of the opinion that the devil gets a familiarity with some souls just at or rather before their being embodied as to the manner and method how he gets in that is another question and may be spoken of by it self besides why may not he that at satans request to enter into the herd of swine said go give the same commission to possess a sort of creatures so many degrees below the dignity of the gaderenian swine and open the door too but as for that when our lord said go the devil never enquird which way he should get in  when then i see nations or indeed herds of nations set on fire of hell and as i may say enflamd by the devil when i see towns parties factions and rabbles of people visibly possessd tis enough to me that the great master of the devils has said to him go theres no need to enquire which way he finds open or at what postern gate he gets in as to his appearing tis plain he often gets in without appearing and therefore the question about his appearing still remains a doubt and is not very easy to be resolvd  in the scripture we have some light into it and that is all the help i find from antiquity and it goes a great way to solve the phænomena of satans appearing what i mean by the scripture giving some light to it is this tis said in several places and of several persons god came to them in a dream gen xx 3 god came to abimelech in a dream by night gen xxxi 24 and god came to laban the syrian in a dream matt ii 13 the angel of the lord appeard to joseph in a dream short comments are sufficient to plain texts applying this to my friend when he wanted to be satisfied about the how relating to his dream viz how he should come to dream such wicked things i told him in short the case was plain the devil came to him in a dream by night how and in what manner he formd the wicked representations and spread debauchd appearances before his fancy by real whispers and voice according to milton or by what other methods the learned are not arrivd to any certainty about it  this leads me necessarily to enquire whether the devil or some of his agents are not always in our company whether they make any visible appearances or no for my part i make no question of it how else could he come at the knowledge of what we do for as i can allow him no prescience at all as for many reasons i have observd already he must be able to see and know us and what we are about when we know nothing of him or else he could know nothing of us and our affairs which yet we find otherwise and this gives him infinite advantage to influence our actions to judge of our inclinations and to bring our passions to clash with our reason as they often do and get the better of it too  all this he obtains by his being able to walk about invisible and see when he is not seen of which i have spoken already hence that most wise and solid suggestion that when the candles burn blue the devil is in the room which great secret in nature that you may more fully be convincd of its imaginary reality i must tell you the following story which i saw in a letter directed to a particular friend take it word for word as in the letter because i do not make my self accountable for the facts but take them ad referendum   sir  we had one day very early in the morning and for the most part of the day a great deal of rain with a high wind and the clouds very thick and dark all day  in the evening the cloudy thick weather continued tho not the rain when being at a friends house in  lane london and several ladies and some gentlemen in the room besides two or three servants for we had been eating the following interlude happend for our entertainment when the cloth was taken away two large candles were brought upon the table and placd there with some bottles and glasses for the gentlemen who it seems were intending to drink and be very merry two large waxcandles were also set on another table the ladies being going to cards also there were two large candles in sconces over or near the chimney and one more in a lookingglass sconce on a peer by the window  with all this apparatus the company separating sat down the gentlemen at their table and the ladies at theirs to play as above when after some time the gentleman of the house said hastily to a servant what a p ails the candles and turning to the servant raps out an oath or two and bids him snuff the candles for they burnt as if the devil was in the room  the fellow going to snuff one of the candles snuffs it out at which his master being in a passion the fellow lights it again immediately at the other candle and then being in a little hurry going to snuff the other candle snuffed that out too  the first candle that was relighted as is usual in such cases burnd dim and dull for a good while and the other being out the room was much darker than before and a wench that stood by the ladies table bawls out to her mistress law madam the candles burn blue an old lady that sat by says ay betty so they do upon this one of the ladies starts up mercy upon us says she what is the matter in this unlucky moment another servant without orders went to the great peer sconce and because as he thought he would be sure to snuff the candle well he offers to take it down but very unhappily i say the hook came out and down falls the sconce candle and all and the lookingglass broke all to pieces with a horrible noise however the candle falling out of the sconce did not go out but lay on the floor burning dully and as it is usual on such cases all on one side betty cries out again law madam that candle burns blue too the very moment she said this the footman that had thrown down the sconce says to his fellow servant that came to his assistance i think the devil is in the candles to night and away he run out of the room for fear of his master  the old lady who upon the maid bettys notion of the candles burning blue had her head just full of that old chimneycorner story the candles burn blue when the spirits are in the room heard the footman say the word devil but heard nothing else of what he said upon this she rises up in a terrible fright and cries out that the footman said the devil was in the room as she was indeed frighted out of her wits she frighted the ladies most terribly and they all starting up together down goes the card table and put the waxcandles out  mrs betty that had frighted them all runs to the sconce next the chimney but that having a long snuff she cried out it burnt blue too and she durst not touch it in short tho there were three candles left still burning in the room yet the ladies were all so frighted that they and the maids too run out of the parlour screaming like mad folks the master in a rage kickd his first man out of the room and the second man was run out to avoid as i said before the like so that no servant was to be had but all was in confusion  the two other gentlemen who were sitting at the first table kept their seats composed and easy enough only concernd to see all the house in such a fright it was true they said the candles burnt dim and very oddly but they could not perceive they burnt blue except one of those over the chimney and that on the table which was relighted after the fellow had snufft it out  however the maid the old lady and the footman that pulld down the sconce all insist that the candles burnt blue and all pretend that the devil was certainly in the room and was the occasion of it and they now came to me with the story to desire my opinion of it  this put me upon enquiry into the notion of candles burning blue when spirits are in a room which upon all the search into things that i am able to make amounts to no more than this that upon any extraordinary emission of sulphureous or of nitrous particles either in a close room or in any not very open place if the quantity be great a candle or lamp or any such little blaze of fire will seem to be or to burn blue and if then they can prove that any such effluvia attends or is emitted from a spirit then when satan is at hand it may be so  but then tis begging the question grossly because no man can assure us that the devil has any sulphureous particles about him  it is true the candles burn thus in mines and vaults and damp places and tis as true that they will do so upon occasion of very damp stormy and moist air when an extraordinary quantity of vapours are supposed to be dispersd abroad as was the case when this happend and if there was any thing of that in it on that monday night the candles might perhaps burn blue upon that occasion but that the devil was abroad upon any extraordinary business that night that i cannot grant unless i have some better testimony than the old lady that heard the footmans outcry but by halves or than mrs betty who first fancied the candles burnt blue so i must suspend my judgment till i hear farther  this story however may solve a great many of those things which pass for apparitions in the world and which are laid to the devils charge tho he really may know nothing of the matter and this would bring me to defend satan in many things wherein he may truly be said to suffer wrongfully and if i thought it would oblige him i might say something to his advantage this way however ill venture a word or two for an injurd devil take it as you will  first it is certain that as this invisibility of the devil is very much to our prejudice so the doctrine of his visibility is a great prejudice to him as we make use of it  by his invisibility he is certainly vested with infinite advantages against us while he can be present with us and we know nothing of the matter he informs himself of all our measures and arms himself in the best and most suitable manner to injure and assault us as he can counteract all our secret concerted designs disappoint all our schemes and except when heaven apparently concerns it self to overrule him can defeat all our enterprizes break all our measures and do us mischief in almost every part of our life and all this because we are not privy to all his motions as he is to ours  but now for his visibility and his real appearance in the world and particularly among his disciples and emissaries such as witches and wizards demonaists and the like here i think satan has a great deal of loss suffers manifest injury and has great injustice done him and that therefore i ought to clear this matter up a little if it be possible to do justice to satan and set matters right in the world about him according to that useful old maxim of setting the saddle upon the right horse or giving the devil his due  first as i have said we are not to believe every idle head who pretends even to converse face to face with the devil and who tells us they have thus seen him and been acquainted with him every day many of these pretenders are manifest cheats and however they would have the honour of a private interest in him and boast how they have him at their beck can call him this way and send him that as they please raise him and lay him when and how and as often as they find for their purpose i say whatever boasts they make of this kind they really have nothing of truth in them  now the injuries and injustice done to the devil in these cases are manifest namely that they entitle the devil to all the mischief they are pleased to do in the world and if they commit a murther or a robbery fire a house or do any act of violence in the world they presently are said to do it by the agency of the devil and the devil helps them so satan bears the reproach and they have all the guilt this is 1 a grand cheat upon the world and 2 a notorious slander upon the devil and it would be a public benefit to mankind to have such wouldbedevils as these turnd inside out that we might know when the devil was really at work among us and when not what mischiefs were of his doing and which were not and that these fellows might not slip their necks out of the halter by continually laying the blame of their wickedness upon the devil  not that the devil is not very willing to have his hand in any mischief or in all the mischief that is done in the world but there are some low prizd rogueries that are too little for him beneath the dignity of his operation and which tis really a scandal to the devil to charge upon him i remember the devil had such a cheat put upon him in eastsmithfield once where a person pretended to converse with the devil face to face and that in open day too and to cause him to tell fortunes foretel good and evil c discover stollen goods tell where they were who stole them and how to find them again nay and even to find out the thieves but satan was really sandered in the case the fellow had no more to do with the devil than other people and perhaps not so much neither this was one of those they calld cunningmen or at least he endeavourd to pass for such a one but twas all a cheat  besides what had the devil to do to detect thieves and restore stollen goods thieving and robbing trick and cheat are part of the craft of his agency and of the employments which it is his business to encourage they greatly mistake him who think he will assist any body in suppressing and detecting such laudable arts and such diligent servants  i wont say but the devil to draw these people we call cunningmen into a snare and to push on his farther designs may encourage them privately and in a manner that they themselves know nothing of to make use of his name and abuse the world about him till at last they may really believe they do deal with the devil when indeed tis only he deals with them and they know nothing of the matter  in other cases he may encourage them in these little frauds and cheats and give them leave as above to make use of his name to bring them afterwards and by degrees to have a real acquaintance with him so bringing the jest of their trade into earnest till at length prompting them to commit some great villany he secures them to be his own by their very fear of his leaving them to be exposed to the world thus he puts a jonathan wild upon them and makes them be the very wretches they only pretended to be before so old parsons of clithroe as fame tells was twenty five years a cunningman and twenty two years a witch that is to say for five and twenty years he was only pretending to deal with the devil when satan and he had no manner of acquaintance and he only put his legerdemain upon the people in the devils name without his leave but at length the devils patience being tird quite out he told the old counterfeit that in short he had been his stalking horse long enough and that now if he thought fit to enter himself and take a commission well and good and he should have a lease to carry on his trade for so many years more to his hearts content but if not he would expose his knavery to the world for that he should take away his peoples trade no longer but that he satan would set up another in his room that should make a meer fool of him and carry away all his customers  upon this the old man considerd of it took the devils counsel and listed in his pay so he that had plaid his pranks twenty five years as a conjurer when he was no conjurer was then forcd really to deal with the devil for fear the people should know he did not till now he had ambo dexter cheated the devil on one hand and the people on the other but the devil gaind his point at last and so he was a real wizard ever after  but this is not the only way the devil is injurd neither for we have often found people pretend upon him in other cases and of nearer concern to him a great deal and in articles more weighty as in particular in the great business of possession it is true this point is not thoroly understood among men neither has the devil thought fit to give us those illuminations about it as i believe he might do particularly that great and important article is not for ought i can see rightly explaind namely whether there are not two several kinds of possession viz some wherein the devil possesses us and some in which we really possess the devil the nicety of which i doubt this age with all its penetration is not qualified to explain and a dissertation upon it being too long for this work especially so near its conclusion i am obligd to omit as i am also all the practical discourses upon the usefulness and advantages of real possession whether considerd one way or other to mankind all which i must leave to hereafter  but to come back to the point in hand and to consider the injustice done to the devil in the various turns and tricks which men put upon him very often in this one article viz pretending to possession and to have the devil in them when really it is not so certainly the devil must take it very ill to have all their demented lunatick tricks chargd upon him some of which nay most of which are so gross so simple so empty and so little to the purpose that the devil must be ashamd to see such things pass in his name or that the world should think he was concernd in them  it is true that possession being one of the principal pieces of the devils artifice in his managing mankind and in which with the most exquisite skill he plays the devil among us he has the more reason to be affronted when he finds himself invaded in this part and angry that any body should pretend to possess or be possessd without his leave and this may be the reason for ought we know why so many blunders have been made when people have pretended to it without him and he has thought fit not to own them in it of which we have many examples in history as in simon magus the devil of london the fair maid of kent and several others whose history it is not worth while to enlarge upon  in short possessions as i have said are nice things as it is not so easy to mimick the devil in that part as it may be in some other designing men have attempted it often but their manner has been easily distinguishd even without the devils assistance  thus the people of salem in newengland pretended to be bewitchd and that a black man tormented them by the instigation of such and such whom they resolvd to bring to the gallows this black man they would have be the devil employd by the person who they accusd for a witch thus making the devil a page or a footman to the wizard to go and torment whoever the said wizard commanded till the devil himself was so weary of the foolish part that he left them to go on their own way and at last they overacted the murthering part so far that when they confessd themselves to be witches and possessd and that they had correspondence with the devil satan not appearing to vouch for them no jury would condemn them upon their own evidence and they could not get themselves hangd whatever pains they took to bring it to pass  thus you see the devil may be wrongd and falsely accusd in many particulars and often has been so there are likewise some other sorts of counterfeit devils in the world such as gypsies fortunetellers foretellers of good and bad luck sellers of winds raisers of storms and many more some practisd among us some in foreign parts too many almost to reckon up nay i almost doubt whether the devil himself knows all the sorts of them for tis evident he has little or nothing to do with them i mean not in the way of their craft  these i take to be interlopers or with the guinea merchants leave separate traders and who act under the skreen and protection of satans power but without his license or authority no doubt these carry away a great deal of his trade that is to say the trade which otherwise the devil might have carried on by agents or his own i cannot but say that while these people would fain be thought devils tho they really are not it is but just they should be really made as much devils as they pretended to be or that satan should do himself justice upon them as he threatend to do upon old parsons of clithroe abovementiond and let the world know them     chap xi  of divination sorcery the blackart pawawing and such like pretenders      to devilism and how far the devil is or is not concernd in them   tho i am writing the history of the devil i have not undertaken to do the like of all the kinds of people male or female who set up for devils in the world this would be a task for the devil indeed and fit only for him to undertake for their number is and has been prodigious great and may with his other legions be rankd among the innumerable  what a world do we inhabit where there is not only with us a great roaringlyondevil daily seeking whom of us he may devour and innumerable millions of lesser devils hovering in the whole atmosphere over us nay and for ought we know other millions always invisibly moving about us and perhaps in us or at least in many of us but that have besides all these a vast many counterfeit hocus pocus devils human devils who are visible among us of our own species and fraternity conversing with us upon all occasions who like mountebanks set up their stages in every town chat with us at every teatable converse with us in every coffeehouse and impudently tell us to our faces that they are devils boast of it and use a thousand tricks and arts to make us believe it too and that too often with success  it must be confessd there is a strong propensity in mans nature especially the more ignorant part of mankind to resolve every strange thing or whether really strange or no if it be but strange to us into devilism and to say every thing is the devil that they can give no account of  thus the famous doctors of the faculty at paris when john faustus brought the first printed books that had then been seen in the world or at least seen there into the city and sold them for manuscripts they were surprizd at the performance and questiond faustus about it but he affirming they were manuscripts and that he kept a great many clarks employd to write them they were satisfied for a while  but looking farther into the work they observd the exact agreement of every book one with another that every line stood in the same place every page a like number of lines every line a like number of words if a word was misspelt in one it was misspelt also in all nay that if there was a blot in one it was alike in all they began again to muse how this should be in a word the learned divines not being able to comprehend the thing and that was always sufficient concluded it must be the devil that it was done by magick and witchcraft and that in short poor faustus who was indeed nothing but a meer printer dealt with the devil       n b john faustus was servant or journeyman or compositor or         what you please to call it to koster of harlem the first         inventor of printing and having printed the psalter sold them at         paris as manuscripts because as such they yielded a better         price   but the learned doctors not being able to understand how the work was performd concluded as above it was all the devil and that the man was a witch accordingly they took him up for a magician and a conjurer and one that workd by the black art that is to say by the help of the devil and in a word they threatend to hang him for a witch and in order to it commencd a process against him in their criminal courts which made such a noise in the world as raisd the fame of poor john faustus to a frightful height till at last he was obligd for fear of the gallows to discover the whole secret to them       n b this is the true original of the famous dr faustus or         foster of whom we have believd such strange things as that it         is become a proverb as great as the devil and dr foster         whereas poor faustus was no doctor and knew no more of the         devil than another body   thus the magistrates of bern and switzerland finding a gang of french actors of puppetshew opend their stage in the town upon hearing the surprizing accounts which the people gave of their wonderful puppets how they made them speak answer questions and discourse appear and disappear in a moment pop up here as if they rise out of the earth and down there as if they vanishd and abundance more feats of art censurd them as demons and if they had not packd up their trinkets and disappeared almost as dextrously as their puppets they had certainly condemnd the poor puppets to the flames for devils and censurd if not otherwise punished their masters see the count de rochforts memoirs p 179  wonderful operations astonish the mind especially where the head is not overburthend with brains and custom has made it so natural to give the devil either the honour or scandal of every thing that we cannot otherwise account for that it is not possible to put the people out of the road of it  the magicians were in the chaldean monarchy calld the wisemen and tho they are joined with the sorcerers and astrologers in the same place dan ii 4 yet they were generally so understood among those people but in our language we understand them to be people that have an art to reveal secrets interpret dreams foretel events c and that use enchantments and sorceries by all which we understand the same thing which now in a more vulgar way we express by one general coarse expression dealing with the devil  the scripture speaks of a spirit of divination acts xvi 16 and a wench that was possessd by this spirit brought her master much gain by southsaying that is to say according to the learned by oracling or answering questions whence you will see in the margin that this southsaying devil is there calld python that is apollo who is often calld python and who at the oracle of delphos gave out such answers and double entendres as this wench possibly did and hence all those spirits which were calld spirits of divination were in another sense calld pythons  now when the apostle st paul came to see this creature this spirit takes upon it to declare that those men meaning st paul and timotheus were the servants of the most high god which shewd unto them the way of salvation this was a good turn of the devil to preserve his authority in the possessd girl she brought them gain by southsaying that is to say resolving difficult questions answering doubts interpreting dreams c among these doubts he makes her give testimony to paul and timotheus to wheedle in with the new christians and perhaps tho very ignorantly even with paul and timotheus themselves so to give a kind of credit and respect to her for speaking  but the devil who never speaks truth but with some sinister end was discoverd here and detected his flattering recognition not accepted and he himself unkenneld as he deservd there the devil was overshot in his own bow again  here now was a real possession and the evil spirits who possessd her did stoop to sundry little acts of servitude that we could give little or no reason for only that the girls master might get money by her but perhaps this was a particular case and prepard to honour the authority and power the apostles had over evil spirits  but we find these things carried a great way farther in many cases that is to say where the parties are thus really possessd namely the devil makes agents of the possessd parties to do many things for the propagating his interest and kingdom and particularly for the carrying on his dominion in the world but i am for the present not so much upon the real possession as the pretended and particularly we have had many that have believed themselves possessd when the devil never believed it of them and perhaps knew them better some of these are really poor devils to be pitied and are what i call diables imaginaire these have notwithstanding done the devil good service and brought their masters good gain by southsaying  we find possessions acknowledgd in scripture to be really and personally the devil or according to the text legions of devils in the plural the devil or devils rather which possessed the man among the tombs is positively affirmd to be the devil in the scripture all the evangelists agree in calling him so and his very works shew it namely the mischief he did as well to the poor creature among the tombs who was made so fierce that he was the terror of all the country as to the herd of swine and to the country in the loss of them  i might preach you a lecture here of the devils terror upon the approach of our saviour the dread of his government and how he acknowledgd that there was a time for his torment which was not yet come art thou come to torment us before our time it is evident the devil apprehended that christ would chain them up before the day of judgment and therefore some think the devil here being as it were caught out of his due bounds possessing the poor man in such a furious manner was afraid and petitiond christ not to chain him up for it and as the text says they besought him to suffer them to go away c that is to say when they say art thou come to torment us before the time the meaning is they beggd he would not cast them into torment before the time which was already fixd but that if he would cast them out of the man he would let them go away c  the evangelist st luke says the devil besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep our learned annotators think that part is not rightly renderd adding that they do not believe the devil fears drowning but with submission i believe the meaning is that they would not be confind to the vast ocean where no inhabitants being to be seen they would be effectually imprisond and tied down from doing mischief which would be a hell to them as to their going into the swine that might afford us some allegory but i am not disposed to jest with the scripture no nor with the devil neither farther than needs must  it is evident the devil makes use of very mean instruments sometimes such as the damsel possessd with a spirit of divination and several others  i remember a story how true i know not of a weak creature next door to an ideot who was establishd in the country for an oracle and would tell people strange things that should be long before they came to pass when people were sick would tell them whether they should live or die if people were married tell how many children they should have and a hundred such things as filld the people with admiration and they were the easier brought to believe that the girl was possessd but then they were divided about her too and that was the finest spun thread the devil could work for he carried a great point in it some said she had a good spirit and some a bad some said she was a prophetess and some that she was the devil  now had i been there to decide the question i should certainly have given it for the latter if it were only upon this account namely that the devil has often found fools very necessary agents for the propagating his interest and kingdom but we never knew the good spirits do so on the other hand it does not seem likely that heaven should deprive a poor creature of its senses and as it were take her soul from her and then make her an instrument of instruction to others and an oracle to declare his decrees by this does not seem to be rational  but as far as this kind of divination is in use in our days yet i do not find room to charge the devil with making any great use of fools unless it be such as he has particularly qualified for his work for as to ideots and naturals they are perfectly useless to him but a sort of fools calld the magi indeed we have some reason to think he often works with  we are not arrivd to a certainty yet in the settling this great point namely what magick is whether a diabolical art or a branch of the mathematicks our most learned lexicon technicum is of the latter opinion and gives the magic square and the magic lantern two terms of art  the magic square is when numbers in arithmetical proportion are disposd into such parallels or equal ranks as that the sums of each row as well diagonally as laterally shall be all equal for example 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 place these nine in a square of three they will directly and diagonally make 18 thus        5  10  3        4   6  8        9   2  7      this he calls the magic square but gives no reason for the term nor any account of what infernal operations are wrought by this concurrence of the numbers neither do i see that there can be any such use made of it  the magic lantern is an optic machine by the means of which are represented on a wall in the dark many phantasms and terrible appearances but no devil in all this only that they are taken for the effects of magic by those that are not acquainted with the secret  all this is done by the help of several little painted pieces of glass only so and so situated placd in certain oppositions to one another and painted with different figures the most formidable being placd foremost and such as are most capable of terrifying the spectators and by this all the figures may be represented upon the opposite wall in the largest size  i cannot but take notice that this very piece of optic delusion seems too much akin to the mock possessions and infernal accomplishments which most of the possessionists of this age pretend to so that they are most of them meer phantasms and appearances and no more nor is the spirit of divination the magic the necromancing and other arts which were calld diabolical found to be of any use in modern practice at least in these parts of the world but the devil seems to do most of his work himself and by shorter methods for he has so compleat an influence among those that he now lists in his service that he brings all the common affairs of mankind into a narrower compass in his management with a dexterity particular to himself and by which he carries on his interest silently and surely much more to the detriment of virtue and good government and consequently much more to his satisfaction than ever he did before  there is a kind of magic or sorcery or what else you may please to call it which tho unknown to us is yet it seems still very much encouragd by the devil but this is a great way off and in countries where the politer instruments which he finds here are not to be had namely among the indians of northamerica this is calld pawawing and they have their divines which they call pawaws or witches who use strange gestures distortions horrid smokes burnings and scents and several such things which the sorcerers and witches in ancient times are said to use in casting nativities in philtres and in determining or as they pretended directing the fate of persons by burning such and such herbs and roots such as helebore wormwood storax devilwort mandrake nightshade and abundance more such which are calld noxious plants or the product of noxious plants also melting such and such minerals gums and poisonous things and by several hellish mutterings and markings over them the like do these pawaws and the devil is pleased it seems or is permitted to fall in with these things and as some people think appears often to them for their assistance upon those occasions  but be that as it will he is easd of all that trouble here he can pawaw here himself without their aid and having laid them all aside he negotiates much of his business without ambassadors he is his own plenipotentiary for he finds man so easy to come at and so easy when he is come at that he stands in no need of secret emissaries or at least not so much as he used to do  upon the whole as the world within the compass of a few passd years is advancd in all kinds of knowledge and arts and every useful branch of what they knew before improvd and innumerable useful parts of knowledge which were conceald before are discoverd why should we think the devil alone should stand at a stay has taken no steps to his farther accomplishment and made no useful discoveries in his way that he alone should stand at a stay and be just the same unimprovd devil that he was before no no as the world is improvd every day and every age is grown wiser and wiser than their fathers so no doubt he has bestirrd himself too in order to an encrease of knowledge and discovery and that he finds every day a nearer way to go to work with mankind than he had before  besides as men in general seem to have alterd their manner and that they move in a higher and more exalted sphere especially as to vice and virtue so the devil may have been obliged to change his measures and alter his way of working particularly those things which would take in former times and which a stupid age would come easily into wont go down with us now as the taste of vice and virtue alters the devil is forcd to bait his hook with new compositions the very thing calld temptation is alterd in its nature and that which servd to delude our ancestors whose gross conceptions of things caused them to be manageable with less art will not do now the case is quite alterd in some things perhaps as i hinted above we come into crime with ease and may be led by a finger but when we come to a more refind way of sinning which our ancestors never understood other and more refind politics must be made use of and the devil has been put upon many useful projects and inventions to make many new discoveries and experiments to carry on his affairs and to speak impartially he is strangely improvd either in knowledge or experiment within these few years he has found out a great many new inventions to shorten his own labour and carry on his business in the world currently which he never was master of before or at least we never knew he was  no wonder then that he has changd hands too and that he has left of pawawing in these parts of the world that we dont find our houses disturbd as they used to be and the stools and chairs walking about out of one room into another as formerly that children dont vomit crooked pins and rusty stub nails as of old the air is not full of noises nor the churchyard full of hobgoblins ghosts dont walk about in windingsheets and the good old scolding wives visit and plague their husbands after they are dead as they did when they were alive  the age is grown too wise to be agitated by these dull scarecrow things which their forefathers were tickled with satan has been obliged to lay by his puppetshews and his tumblers those things are grown stale his morricedancing devils his mountebanking and quacking wont do now those things as they may be supposed to be very troublesome to him and but that he has servants enough would be chargeable too are now of no great use in the new management of his affairs  in a word men are too much devils themselves in the sense that i have calld them so to be frighted with such little low prizd appearances as these they are better acquainted with the old archangel than so and they seem to tell him they must be treated after another manner and that then as they are goodnaturd and tractable he may deal with them upon better terms  hence the devil goes to work with mankind a much shorter way for instead of the art of wheedling and whining together with the laborious part of tricking and sharping hurrying and driving frighting and terrifying all which the devil was put to the trouble of before in short he acts the grand manner as the architects call it i dont know whether our freemasons may understand the word and therefore i may hereafter explain it as it is to be diabolically as well as mathematically understood  at present my meaning is he acts with them immediately and personally by a magnificent transformation making them meer devils to themselves upon all needful occasions and devils to one another too whenever he satan has need of their service  this way of embarking mankind in the devils particular engagement is really very modern and tho the devil himself may have been long acquainted with the method and as i have heard began to practise it towards the close of the roman empire when men began to act upon very polite principles and were capable of the most refind wickedness and afterwards with some popes who likewise were a kind of church devils such as satan himself could hardly expect to find in the world yet i do not find that he was ever able to bring it into practice at least not so universally as he does now but now the case is alterd and men being generally more expert in wickedness than they were formerly they suffer the smaller alteration of the species in being transmigrated in a word they turn into devils with no trouble at all hardly either to the devil or to themselves  this particular would want much the less explanation could i obtain a license from sir hellebore wormwood bart or from my lord thwartover baron of scoundrel hall in the kingdom of ireland to write the true history of their own conduct and how early and above all how easily they commencd devils without the least impeachment of their characters as wise men and without any diminution of that part of their denomination which establishd them for fools  how many mad fellows appear among us every day in the critical juncture of their transmigration just when they have so much of the man left as to be known by their names and enough of the devil taken up to settle their characters this easiness of the devils access to these people and the great convenience it is to him in his general business is a proof to me that he has no more occasion of diviners magicians sorcerers and whatever else we please to call those people who were formerly so great with him for what occasion has he to employ devils and wizards to confound mankind when he is arrivd to such a perfection of art as to bring men at least in these parts of the world to do it all themselves upon this account we do not find any of the old sorcerers and diviners magicians or witches appear among us not that the devil might not be as well able to employ such people as formerly and qualify them for the employment too but that really there is no need of them hereabout the devil having a shorter way and mankind being much more easily possessd not the old herd of swine were sooner agitated tho there was full 2000 of them together nature has opend the door and the devil has egress and regress at pleasure so that witches and diviners are quite out of the question  nor let any man be alarmd at this alteration in the case as it stands between mankind and the devil and think the devil having gaind so much ground may in time by encroachment come to a general possession of the whole race and so we should all come to be devils incarnate i say let us not be alarmd for satan does not get these advantages by encroachment and by his infernal power or art no not at all but tis the man himself does it by his indolence and negligence on one hand and his complaisance to the devil on the other and both ways he as it were opens the door to him beckons him with his very hand to come in and the devil has nothing to do but enter and take possession now if it be so and man is so frank to him you know the devil is no fool not to take the advantage when tis offerd him and therefore tis no wonder if the consequences which i have been just now naming follow  but let no man be discouragd by this from reaffirming his natural and religious powers and venturing to shut the devil out for the case is plain he may be shut out the soul is a strong castle and has a good garrison placd within to defend it if the garrison behave well and do their duty it is impregnable and the cowardly devil must raise his siege and be gone nay he must fly or as we call it make his escape lest he be laid by the heels that is lest his weakness be exposed and all his lurking lying in wait ambuscadetricks this part would bear a great enlargement but i have not room to be witty upon him so you must take it in the gross the devil lies at blye bush as our country people call it to watch your coming out of your hold and if you happen to go abroad unarmd he seizes upon and masters you with ease  unarmd youll say what arms should i take what fence against a flail what weapons can a man take to fight the devil i could tell you what to fight him with and what you might fright him with for the devil is to be frighted with several things besides holy water but tis too serious for you and youll tell me i am a preaching and a canting and the like so i must let the devil manage you rather than displease you with talking scripture and religion  well but may not the devil be fought with some of his own weapons is there no dealing with him in a way of human nature this would require a long answer and some philosophy might be acted or at least imitated and some magic perhaps for they tells us there are spells to draw away even the devil himself as in some places they nail horseshoes upon the threshold of the door to keep him out in other places old pieces of flint with so many holes and so many corners and the like but i must answer in the negative i dont know what satan might be scard at in those days but he is either grown cunninger since or bolder for he values none of those things now i question much whether he would value st dunstan and his red hot tongs if he was to meet him now or st francis or any of the saints no not the host itself in full procession and therefore tho you dont care i should preach yet in short if you are afraid he should charge upon you and attack you if you wont make use of those scripture weapons i should have mentiond and which you may hear of if you enquire at eph vi 16 you must look for better where you think you can find them  but to go on with my work the devil i say is not to be feard with maukins nor does he employ his old instruments but does much of his work himself without instruments  and yet i must enter a caveat here too against being misunderstood in my saying the devil stands in no need of agents for when i speak so i am to be taken in a limited sense i dont say he needs them no where but only that he does not need them in those polite parts of the world which i have been speaking of and perhaps not much here but in many remote countries tis otherwise still the indians of america are particularly said to have witches among them as well in those countries where the spaniards and the english and other nations have planted themselves as amongst those where the european nations seldom come for example the people of canada that is of the countries under the french government of quebeck the equimeaux and other northern climates have magicians wizards and witches who they call pilloatas or pillotoas these pretend they speak intimately and familiarly with the devil and receive from him the knowledge of things to come all which by the way i take to be little more than this that these fellows being a little more cunning than the rest think that by pretending to something more than human they shall make the stronger impressions on the ignorant people as mahomet amusd the world with his pigeon using it to pick peas out of his ear and persuaded the people it brought him superior revelations and inspirations from paradise  thus these pillotoas gaining an opinion among the people behave like so many mountebanks of hell pretending to understand dark things cure diseases practise surgery physick and necromancy altogether i will not say but satan may pick out such tools to work with and i believe does in those parts but i think he has found a nearer way to the wood with us and that is sufficient to my present purpose  some would persuade me the devil had a great hand in the late religious breaches in france among the clergy viz about the popes constitution unigenitus and that he made a fair attempt to set the pope and the gallican church together by the ears for they were all just upon the point or breaking out into a church war that for ought we knew might have gone farther than the devil himself card it should now i am of the quite contrary opinion i believe the devil really did not make the breach but rather heald it for fear it should have gone so far among them as to have set them all in a flame and have opend the door to the return of the hugonots again which it was in a fair way to have done  but be it one way or tother the historical part seems to be a little against me for tis certain the devil both wanted and made use of legions of agents as well human as infernal visible and invisible in that great and important affair and we cannot doubt but he has innumerable instruments still at work about it  like as in poland i make no question but the devil has thousands of his banditti at work at this time and in another country not far from it perhaps preparing matters for the next general diet taking care to prevent giving any relaxation to the protestants and to justify the moderate executions at thorn to excite a nation to quarrel with every body who are able to fight with no body to erect the apostate race of sy upon a throne which they have no title to and turn an elective throne into an hereditary in favour of popery  i might anticipate all your objections by granting the busy devil at this time employing all his agents and instruments for i never told you they were idle and useless in striving to enflame the christian world and bring a new war to overspread europe i might perhaps point out to you some of the measures he takes the provocatives which his state physicians administer to the courts and counsellors of princes to foment and ferment the spirits and members of nations kingdoms empires and states in the world in order to bring these glorious ends of blood and war to pass for you cannot think but he that knows so much of the devils affairs as to write his history must know something of all these matters more than those that do not know so much as he  but all this is remote to the present case for this is no impeachment of satans new methods with mankind in this part of the world and in his private and separate capacity all this only signifies that in his more general and national affairs the devil acts still by his old methods and when he is to seduce or embroil nations he like other conquerors subdues them by armies employs mighty squadrons of devils and sends out strong detachments with generals and generalissimos to lead them some to one part of the world some to another some to influence one nation some to manage and direct another according as business presents and his occasions require that his affairs may be carried on currently and to his satisfaction  if it were not thus but that the devil by his new and exquisite management of which i have said so much had brought mankind in general to be the agents of their own mischiefs and that the world were so at his beck that he need but command them to go and fight declare war raise armies destroy cities kingdoms countries and people the world would be a field of blood indeed and all things would run into confusion presently  but this is not the case at all heaven has not let go the government of the creation to his subdud enemy the devil that would overturn the whole system of god and give satan more power than ever he was or will be vested with when therefore i speak of a few forward wretches in our day who are so warm in their wickedness that they anticipate the devil save him the trouble to tempt turn devils to themselves and gallop hellward faster than he drives i speak of them as single persons and acting in their own personal and private capacity but when i speak of nations and kingdoms there the devil is obligd to go on in the old road and act by stratagem by his proper machinery and to make use of all his arts and all his agents just as he has done in all ages from the beginning of his politic government to this day  and if it was not thus too what would become of all his numberless legions of which all ages have heard so much and all parts of the world have had so much fatal experience they would seem to be quite out of employment and be renderd useless in the world of spirits where it is to be supposed they reside not the devil himself could find any business for them which by the way to busy and mischievous spirits as they are would be a hell to them even before their time they would be as it were doomd to a state of inactivity which we may suppose was one part of their expulsion from blessedness and the creation of man or as they were for the surprising interval between the destruction of mankind by the deluge and noahs coming out of the ark when indeed they might be said to have nothing at all to do  but this is not satans case and therefore let me tell you too that you may not think i treat the case with more levity than i really do and than i am sure i intend to do tho it is too true that our modern and modish sinners have arrived to more exquisite ways of being wicked than their fathers and really seem as i have said to need no devil to tempt them nay that they do satans work for him as to others also and make themselves devils to their neighbours tempting others to crime even faster than the devil desires them running before they are sent and going of the devils errands gratis by which means satans work is as to them done to his hand and they may be said to save him a great deal of trouble yet after all the devil has still a great deal of business upon his hands and as well himself as all his legions find themselves a full employment in disturbing the world and opposing the glory and kingdom of their great superior whose kingdom it is their whole business however vain in its end to overthrow and destroy if they were able or at least to endeavour it  this being the case it follows of course that the general mischiefs of mankind as well national and public as family mischiefs and even personal except as before excepted lie all still at the devils door as much as ever let his advocates bring him off of it if they can and this brings us back again to the manner of the devils management and the way of his working by human agents or if you will the way of human devils working in affairs of low life such as we call divination sorcery blackart necromancy and the like all which i take to consist of two material parts and both very necessary for us to be rightly informd of       1 the part which satan by himself or his inferior devils      empowers such people to do as he is in confederacy with here on      earth to whom he may be said like the master of an opera or      comedy to give their parts to act and to qualify them to act it      whether he obliges them to a rehearsal in his presence to try      their talents and see that they are capable of performing that      indeed i have not enquird into       2 that part which these empowerd people do voluntier or beyond      their commission to shew their diligence in the service of their      new master and either 1 to bring grist to their own mill and      make their market of their employment in the best manner they can      or 2 to gain applause be admird wonderd at and applauded      as if they were ten times more devils than really they are   in a word the matter consists of what the devil does by the help of these people and what they do in his name without him the devil is sometimes cheated in his own business there are pretenders to witchcraft and blackart who satan never made any bargain with but who he connives at because at least they do his cause no harm tho their business is rather to get money than to render him any service of which i gave you a remarkable instance before  but to go back to his real agents of which i reckon two       1 those who act by direction and confederacy as i have said      already many do       2 those whom he acts in and by and they perhaps know it not of      which sort history gives us plenty of examples from machiavels      first disciple  to the famous cardinal alberoni and even to      some more modern than his eminence of whom i can say no more till      farther occasion offers   1 those who act by immediate direction of the devil and in confederacy with him these are such as i mentiond in the beginning of this chapter whose arts are truly black because really infernal it will be very hard to decide the dispute between those who really act thus in confederacy with the devil and those who only pretend to it so i shall leave that dispute where i find it but that there are or at least have been a set of people in the world who really are of his acquaintance and very intimate with him and tho as i have said he has much alterd his schemes and changd hands of late yet that there are such people perhaps of all sorts and that the devil keeps up his correspondence with them i must not venture to deny that part lest i bring upon me the whole posse of the conjuring and bewitching crew male and female and they should mob me for pretending to deny them the honour of dealing with the devil which they are so exceeding willing to have the fame of  not that i am hereby obligd to believe all the strange things the witches and wizards who have been allowd to be such nay who have been hangd for it have said of themselves nay that they have confessd of themselves even at the gallows and if i come to have an occasion to speak freely of the matter i may perhaps convince you that the devils possessing power is much lessend of late and that he either is limited and his fetter shortened more than it has been or that he does not find the old way as i said before so fit for his purpose as he did formerly and therefore takes other measures but i must adjourn that to a time and place by itself but we are told that there are another sort of people and perhaps a great many of them too in whom and by whom the devil really acts and they know it not  it would take up a great deal of time and room too much for this place so near the close of this work to describe and mark out the involuntary devils which there are in the world of whom it may be truly said that really the devil is in them and they know it not now tho the devil is cunning and managing and can be very silent where he finds it for his interest not to be known yet it is very hard for him to conceal himself and to give so little disturbance in the house as that the family should not know who lodged in it yet i say the devil is so subtle and so mischievous an agent that he uses all manner of methods and craft to reside in such people as he finds for his purpose whether they will or no and which is more whether they know it or no  and let none of my readers be angry or think themselves ill used when i tell them the devil may be in them and may act them and by them and they not know it for i must add it may perhaps be one of the greatest pieces of human wisdom in the world for a man to know when the devil is in him and when not when he is a tool and agent of hell and when he is not in a word when he is doing the devils work and under his direction and when not  it is true this is a very weighty point and might deserve to be handled in a more serious way than i seem to be talking in all this book but give me leave to talk of things my own way and withall to tell you that there is no part of this work so seemingly ludicrous but a grave and well weighd mind may make a serious and solid application of it if they please nor is there any part of this work in which a clear sight and a good sense may not see that the authors design is that they should do so and as i am now so near the end of my book i thought it was meet to tell you so and lead you to it as far as i can  i say tis a great part of human wisdom to know when the devil is acting in us and by us and when not the next and still greatest part would be to prevent him put a stop to his progress bid him go about his business and let him know he should carry on his designs no farther in that manner that we will be his tools no longer in short to turn him out of doors and bring a stronger power to take possession but this indeed is too solid a subject and too great to begin with here  but now as to the bare knowing when he is at work with us i say this tho it is considerable may be done nor is it so very difficult for example you have no more to do but look a little into the microcosm of the soul and see there how the passions which are the blood and the affections which are the spirit move in their particular vessels how they circulate and in what temper the pulse beats there and you may easily see who turns the wheel if a perfect calm possesses the soul if peace and temper prevail and the mind feels no tempests rising if the affections are regular and exalted to vertuous and sublime objects the spirits cool and the mind sedate the man is in a general rectitude of mind he may be truly said to be his own man heaven shines upon his soul with its benign influences and he is out of the reach of the evil spirit for the divine spirit is an influence of peace all calm and bright happy and sweet like it self and tending to every thing that is good both present and future  but on the other hand if at any time the mind is ruffled if vapours rise clouds gather if passions swell the breast if anger envy revenge hatred wrath strife if these or any of these hover over you much more if you feel them within you if the affections are possessd and the soul hurried down the stream to embrace low and base objects if those spirits which are the life and enlivening powers of the soul are drawn off to parties and to be engagd in a vicious and corrupt manner shooting out wild and wicked desires and running the man headlong into crime the case is easily resolvd the man is possessd the devil is in him and having taken the fort or at least the counterscarp and outworks is making his lodgment to cover and secure himself in his hold that he may not be dispossessd  nor can he be easily dispossessd when he has got such hold as this and tis no wonder that being lodgd thus upon the outworks of the soul he continues to sap the foundation of the rest and by his incessant and furious assaults reduces the man at last to a surrender  if the allegory be not as just and apposite as you would have it be you may however see by it in a full view the state of the man and how the devil carries on his designs nothing is more common and i believe there are few thinking minds but may reflect upon it in their own compass than for our passions and affections to flow out of the ordinary channel the spirits and blood of the soul to be extravasated the passions grow violent and outragious the affections impetuous corrupt and violently vicious whence does all this proceed from heaven we cant pretend it comes if we must not say tis the devil whose door must it lie at pride swells the passions avarice moves the affections and what is pride and what is avarice but the devil in the inside of the man ay as personally and really as ever he was in the herd of swine  let not any man then who is a slave to his passions or who is chaind down to his covetousness pretend to take it ill when i say he has the devil in him or that he is a devil what else can it be and how comes it to pass that passion and revenge so often dispossess the man of himself as to lead him to commit murther to lay plots and snares for the life of his enemies and so to thirst for blood how comes this but by the devils putting those spirits of the soul into so violent a ferment into a fever that the circulation is precipitated to that degree and that the man too is precipitated into mischief and at last into ruin tis all the devil tho the man does not know it  in like manner avarice leads him to rob plunder and destroy for money and to commit sometimes the worst of violences to obtain the wicked reward how many have had their throats cut for their money have been murtherd on the highway or in their beds for the desire of what they had it is the same thing in other articles every vice is the devil in a man lust of rule is the devil of great men and that ambition is their devil as much as whoring is father s devil one has a devil of one class acting him one another and every mans reigning vice is a devil to him  thus the devil has his involuntary instruments as well as those who act in confederacy with him he has a very great share in many of us and acts us and in us unknown to our selves tho we know nothing of it and indeed tho we may not suspect it of our selves like hazael the assyrian who when the prophet told him how he would act the devil upon the poor israelites answerd with detestation is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing and yet he was that dog and did all those cruel things for all that the devil acting him or acting in him to make him wickeder than ever he thought it was possible for him to be     the conclusion  of the devils last scene of liberty and what may be supposed to be      his end with what we are to understand of his being tormented for      ever and ever   as the devil is a prince of the power of the air his kingdom is mortal and must have an end and as he is calld the god of this world that is the great usurper of the homage and reverence which mankind ought of right to pay to their maker so his usurpation also like the world it self must have an end satan is calld the god of the world as men too much prostrate and prostitute themselves to him yet he is not the governor of this world and therefore the homage and worship he has from the world is an usurpation and this will have an end because the world it self will have an end and all mankind as they had a beginning in time so must expire and be removd before the end of time  since then the devils empire is to expire and come to an end and that the devil himself and all his host of devils are immortal seraphs spirits that are not embodied and cannot die but are to remain in being the question before us next will be what is to become of him what is his state to be whether is he to wander and in what condition is he to remain to that eternity to which he is still to exist  i hope no man will mistake me so much in what i have said as to spirits which are all flame not being affected with fire as if i supposed there was no place of punishment for the devil nor any kind of punishment that could affect them and so of our spirits also when transformd into flame  i must be allowd to speak there of that material fire by which as by an allegory all the terrors of an eternal state are represented to us in scripture and in the writings of the learned commentators and by which the pain of sense is describd this perhaps i do not understand as they seem to do and therefore have said  when were all flame that is all spirit we shall all fire that is all such fire as this despise and thus i claim to be understood  it does not follow from hence neither do i suggest or so much as think that infinite power cannot form a something tho inconceivable to us here which shall be as tormenting and as insupportable to a devil an apostate seraph and to a spirit tho exalted unembodied and rarified into flame as fire would be to other bodies in which i think i am orthodox and do not give the least occasion to an enemy to charge me with profane speaking in those words or to plead for thinking prophanely himself  it must be atheistical to the last degree to suggest that whereas the devil has been heaping up and amassing guilt ever since the creation of man encreasing in hatred of god and rebellion against him and in all possible endeavour to dethrone and depose the majesty of heaven that yet heaven had not prepard or could not prepare a just penalty for him and that it should not all end in gods entire victory over hell and in satans open condemnation heaven could not be just to its own glory if he should not avenge himself upon this rebel for all his superlative wickedness in his modern as well as ancient station for the blood of so many millions of his faithful subjects and saints whom he has destroyd and if nothing else offerd it self to prove this part it would appear undoubted to me but this i confess does not belong to satans history and therefore i have reservd it to this place and shall also be the shorter in it  that his condition is to be a state of punishment and that by torment the devil himself has ownd and his calling out to our blessed lord when he cast him out of the furious man among the tombs is a proof of it what have we to do with thee and art thou come to torment us before the time luke viii 28 where the devil acknowledges four things and three of them are directly to my present purpose and if you wont believe the word of god i hope you will believe the devil especially when tis an open confession against himself  1 he confess christ to be the son of god that by the way and no thanks to him for that does not want the devils evidence  2 he acknowledges he may be tormented  3 he acknowledges christ was able to torment him  4 he acknowledges that there is a time appointed when he shall be tormented  as to how in what manner and by what means this tormenting the devil is to be performed or executed that i take to be as needless to us as tis impossible to know and being not at present inclined to fill your heads and thoughts with weak and imperfect guesses i leave it where i find it  it is enough to us that this torment of the devil is represented to us by fire it being impossible for our confind thoughts to conceive of torment by any thing in the world more exquisite whence i conclude that devils shall at last receive a punishment suitable to their spirituous nature and as exquisitely tormenting as a burning fire would be to our bodies  having thus settld my own belief of this matter and stated it so as i think will let you see tis rightly sounded the matter stands thus  satan having been let loose to play his game in this world has improvd his time to the utmost he has not faild on all occasions to exert his hatred rage and malice at his conqueror and enemy namely his maker he has nor faild from principles of meer envy and pride to pursue mankind with all possible rancour in order to deprive him of the honour and felicity which he was created for namely to succeed the devil and his angels in the state of glory from which they fell  this hatred of god and envy at man having broken out in so many several ways in the whole series of time from the creation must necessarily have greatly encreased his guilt and as heaven is righteous to judge him must terminate in an encrease of punishment adequate to his crime and sufficient to his nature  some have suggested that there is yet a time to come when the devil shall exert more rage and do more mischief than ever yet he has been permitted to do whether he shall break his chain or be unchaind for a time they cannot tell nor i neither and tis happy for my work that even this part too does not belong to his history if ever it shall be given an account of by mankind it must be after it is come to pass for my part is not prophesy of foretelling what the devil shall do but history of what he has done  thus good people i have brought the history of the devil down to your own times i have as it were raisd him for you and set him in your view that you may know him and have a care of him  if any cunninger men among you think they are able now to lay him again and so dispose of him out of your sight that you shall be troubled no more with him either here or hereafter let them go to work with him their own way you know things future do not belong to an historian so i leave him among you wishing you may be able to give no worse an account of him for the time to come than i have done for the time past   finis     footnotes  1 n b he never refusd setting his hand to any opinion which he thought it for his interest to acknowledge  2 meant of nothing  3 mr pools words are these some
