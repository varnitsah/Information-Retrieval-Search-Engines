40997316	fugitive pieces  by  george gordon noËl byron   reproduced from the first edition   with a bibliographical note  by  marcel kessel    published for  the facsimile text society  by  columbia university press  new york mcmxxxiii     bibliographical note   fugitive pieces byrons first volume of verse was privately printed in the autumn of 1806 when byron was eighteen years of age passages in byrons correspondence indicate that as early as august of that year some of the poems were in the printers hands and that during the latter part of august and during september the printing was suspended in order that byron might give his poems an entire new form the new form consisted in part in an enlargement for he wrote to elizabeth pigot about september that he had nearly doubled his poems partly by the discovery of some i conceived to be lost and partly by some new productions according to moore fugitive pieces was ready for distribution in november the last poem in the volume bears the date of november 16 1806  a difficulty in supposing the date of completion of the volume to be about november 16 is that two copies contain inscriptions in byrons hand with earlier dates on the copy of the late mr ja spoor of chicago the inscription reads october 21st tuesday 1806haec poemata ex dono suntgeorgii gordon byron vale that on the copy in the morgan library reads nov 8 1806 hpedsggb southwellvalebyron the initials evidently standing for the latin words of the preceding inscription the latin vale in each inscription however suggests that it commemorates a leavetaking the date referring not to the presentation but to the farewell  it has been suggested that copies of the volume were distributed earlier than november and that some of the poems printed separately and distributed in flyleaf form were added later this would explain such discrepancies as the early dates of the inscriptions and the presence of byrons name on pages 46 and 48 in a volume otherwise anonymous but there is little evidence to support it  moores account of fugitive pieces is that it was distributed in november byron presenting the first copy to the reverend jt becher prebendary of southwell minster who objected to what he considered the too voluptuous coloring of the poem to mary the objection led byron to suppress the edition immediately he himself burning nearly every copy this account is corroborated in part by miss pigot and in part by byron  immediately after the destruction byron began the preparation of a second volume to replace fugitive pieces this appeared in january 1807 as poems on various occasions byron describing it as vastly correct and miraculously chaste of the 38 poems that constitute fugitive pieces all except to mary to caroline and the last six stanzas of to miss ep were reprinted in poems on various occasions nineteen of the original 38 poems occur in byrons third work hours of idleness published in june or july 1807 all three editions were printed by s and j ridge booksellers of newark england  byron himself never reprinted the poems to mary or to caroline or the last six stanzas of to miss ep except in a limited facsimile of fugitive pieces supervised by h buxton forman in 1886 to mary has never been reprintednot even in supposedly complete editions of byrons works  only four copies of fugitive pieces are known today and one of these is incomplete the copy from which the present facsimile is made was originally given by byron to becher and preserved by him in spite of his objections to the poem to mary from bechers family it passed into the possession of mr faulkner of louth solicitor for the becher family in 1885 it was in the possession of hw ball antiquary and bookseller of bartononhumber who sold it to h buxton forman forman used it for his facsimile but incorporated certain manuscript corrections of the original so that his facsimile is not exact the original is now owned by mr thomas j wise who has kindly permitted its use for the present facsimile  of the other three copies the incomplete one lacking pages 1720 to mary and all after page 58 is in the possession of the family of the late mr hc roe of nottingham this was originally sent by byron to pigot then studying medicine in edinburgh byron later asked pigot to destroy the copy and pigot seems to have complied so far as to tear out the offending verses to mary for many years it was thought that only the pigot and becher copies had escaped destruction at byrons hands but another complete copy came to light in 1907 and is now in the pierpont morgan library in new york this contains numerous manuscript corrections and alterations and seems to have been used as a proof copy for poems on various occasions not as has sometimes been stated for hours of idleness a fourth copy also complete was offered at public sale in 1912 and is now in the hands of the executors of the late mr ja spoor of chicago  the present facsimile is an exact photographic reproduction of the text with all typographical and other errors as in the original except that certain manuscript corrections which appear in the original perforce appear in the photographic reproduction as follows    page 3 to e line 2           me has been inserted by hand    page 8 stanza 5 line 2            a letter s has been erased

say    though deep the grief thy tears exprest     when love and hope lay both oerthrown   yet still my girl this bleeding breast     throbbd with deep sorrow as thine own    but when our cheeks with anguish glowd     when thy sweet lips where joind to mine   the tears that from my eyelids flowd     were lost in those which fell from thine    thou couldst not feel my burning cheek     thy gushing tears had quenchd its flame   and as thy tongue essayd to speak     in sighs alone it breathd my name    and yet my girl we weep in vain     in vain our fate in sighs deplore   remembrance only can

that breast with ardour glow   with me alone it joy could know   or feel with me the listless woe     which racks my heart when far from thee  3    wheneer we meet my blushes rise     and mantle through my purpled cheek   but yet no blush to mine replies     nor een your eyes your love bespeak  4    your voice alone declares your flame   and though so sweet it breaths my name   our passions still are not the same     alas you cannot love like me  5    for een your lip seems steepd in snow     and though so oft it meets my kiss   it burns with no responsive glow     nor melts like mine in dewy bliss  6    ah what are words to love like mine   though uttered by a voice like thine   i still in murmurs must repine     and think that love can neer be true  7    which meets me with no joyous sign     without a sigh which bids adieu   how different is my love from thine     how keen my grief when leaving you  8    your image fills my anxious breast   till day declines adown the west   and when at night i sink to rest     in dreams your fancied form i view  9    tis then your breast no longer cold     with equal ardour seems to burn   while close your arms around me fold     your lips my kiss with warmth return  10    ah would these joyous moments last   vain hope the gay delusions past   that voiceah no tis but the blast     which echoes through the neighbouring grove  11

your eyes is tracd   you may be prudent fair and chaste     but ah my girl you do not love                                        to maria      since now the hour is come at last     when you must

one so dear     departing for a distant shore    well we have passd some happy hours     and joy will mingle with our tears   when thinking on these ancient towers     the shelter of our infant years    where from this gothic casements height     we viewd the lake the park the dell   and still though tears obstruct our sight     we lingering look a last farewell    oer fields through which we usd to run     and spend the hours in childish play   oer shades where when our race was done     reposing on my breast you lay    whilst i admiring too remiss     forgot to scare the hovering flies   yet envied every fly the kiss     it dard to give your slumbering eyes    see still the little painted bark     in which i rowd you oer the lake   see there high waving oer the park     the elm i clamberd for your sake    these times are past our joys are gone     you leave me leave this happy vale   these scenes i must retrace alone     without thee what will they avail    who can conceive who has not provd     the anguish of a last embrace   when torn from all you fondly lovd     you bid a long adieu to peace    this is the deepest of our woes     for this these tears our cheeks bedew   this is of

chosen   on winter nights to sigh half frozen   in leafless shades to sue for pardon   only because the scenes a garden   for gardens seem by one consent   since shakespeare set the precedent   since
