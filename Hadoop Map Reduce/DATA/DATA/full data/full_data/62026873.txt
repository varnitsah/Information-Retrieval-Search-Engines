62026873	quentin durward   by sir walter scott bart     authors introduction   the scene of this romance is laid in the fifteenth century when the feudal system which had been the sinews and nerves of national defence and the spirit of chivalry by which as by a vivifying soul that system was animated began to be innovated upon and abandoned by those grosser characters who centred their sum of happiness in procuring the personal objects on which they had fixed their own exclusive attachment the same egotism had indeed displayed itself even in more primitive ages but it was now for the first time openly avowed as a professed principle of action the spirit of chivalry had in it this point of excellence that however overstrained and fantastic many of its doctrines may appear to us they were all founded on generosity and self denial of which if the earth were deprived it would be difficult to conceive the existence of virtue among the human race  among those who were the first to ridicule and abandon the self denying principles in which the young knight was instructed and to which he was so carefully trained up louis xi of france was the chief that sovereign was of a character so purely selfishso guiltless of entertaining any purpose unconnected with his ambition covetousness and desire of selfish enjoymentthat he almost seems an incarnation of the devil himself permitted to do his utmost to corrupt our ideas of honour in its very source nor is it to be forgotten that louis possessed to a great extent that caustic wit which can turn into ridicule all that a man does for any other persons advantage but his own and was therefore peculiarly qualified to play the part of a cold hearted and sneering fiend  the cruelties the perjuries the suspicions of this prince were rendered more detestable rather than amended by the gross and debasing superstition which he constantly practised the devotion to the heavenly saints of which he made such a parade was upon the miserable principle of some petty deputy in office who endeavours to hide or atone for the malversations of which he is conscious by liberal gifts to those whose duty it is to observe his conduct and endeavours to support a system of fraud by an attempt to corrupt the incorruptible in no other light can we regard his creating the virgin mary a countess and colonel of his guards or the cunning that admitted to one or two peculiar forms of oath the force of a binding obligation which he denied to all other strictly preserving the secret which mode of swearing he really accounted obligatory as one of the most valuable of state mysteries  to a total want of scruple or it would appear of any sense whatever of moral obligation louis xi added great natural firmness and sagacity of character with a system of policy so highly refined considering the times he lived in that he sometimes overreached himself by giving way to its dictates  probably there is no portrait so dark as to be without its softer shades he understood the interests of france and faithfully pursued them so long as he could identify them with his own he carried the country safe through the dangerous crisis of the war termed for the public good in thus disuniting and dispersing this grand and dangerous alliance of the great crown vassals of france against the sovereign a king of a less cautious and temporizing character and of a more bold and less crafty disposition than louis xi would in all probability have failed louis had also some personal accomplishments not inconsistent with his public character he was cheerful and witty in society and none was better able to sustain and extol the superiority of the coarse and selfish reasons by which he endeavoured to supply those nobler motives for exertion which his predecessors had derived from the high spirit of chivalry  in fact that system was now becoming ancient and had even while in its perfection something so overstrained and fantastic in its principles as rendered it peculiarly the object of ridicule whenever like other old fashions it began to fall out of repute and the weapons of raillery could be employed against it without exciting the disgust and horror with which they would have been rejected at an early period as a species of blasphemy the principles of chivalry were cast aside and their aid supplied by baser stimulants instead of the high spirit which pressed every man forward in the defence of his country louis xi substituted the exertions of the ever ready mercenary soldier and persuaded his subjects among whom the mercantile class began to make a figure that it was better to leave to mercenaries the risks and labours of war and to supply the crown with the means of paying them than to peril themselves in defence of their own substance the merchants were easily persuaded by this reasoning the hour did not arrive in the days of louis xi when the landed gentry and nobles could be in like manner excluded from the ranks of war but the wily monarch commenced that system which acted upon by his successors at length threw the whole military defence of the state into the hands of the crown  he was equally forward in altering the principles which were wont to regulate the intercourse of the sexes the doctrines of chivalry had established in theory at least a system in which beauty was the governing and remunerating divinityvalour her slave who caught his courage from her eye and gave his life for her slightest service it is true the system here as in other branches was stretched to fantastic extravagance and cases of scandal not unfrequently arose still they were generally such as those mentioned by burke where frailty was deprived of half its guilt by being purified from all its grossness in louis xis practice it was far otherwise he was a low voluptuary seeking pleasure without sentiment and despising the sex from whom he desired to obtain it by selecting his favourites and ministers from among the dregs of the people louis showed the slight regard which he paid to eminent station and high birth and although this might be not only excusable but meritorious where the monarchs fiat promoted obscure talent or called forth modest worth it was very different when the king made his favourite associates of such men as the chief of his police tristan lhermite  nor were louiss sayings and actions in private or public of a kind which could redeem such gross offences against the character of a man of honour his word generally accounted the most sacred test of a mans character and the least impeachment of which is a capital offence by the code of honour was forfeited without scruple on the slightest occasion and often accompanied by the perpetration of the most enormous crimes it is more than probable that in thus renouncing almost openly the ties of religion honour and morality by which mankind at large feel themselves influenced louis sought to obtain great advantages in his negotiations with parties who might esteem themselves bound while he himself enjoyed liberty he started from the goal he might suppose like the racer who has got rid of the weights with which his competitors are still encumbered and expects to succeed of course but providence seems always to unite the existence of peculiar danger with some circumstance which may put those exposed to the peril upon their guard the constant suspicion attached to any public person who becomes badly eminent for breach of faith is to him what the rattle is to the poisonous serpent and men come at last to calculate not so much on what their antagonist says as upon that which he is likely to do a degree of mistrust which tends to counteract the intrigues of such a character more than his freedom from the scruples of conscientious men can afford him advantage  indeed although the reign of louis had been as successful in a political point of view as he himself could have desired the spectacle of his deathbed might of itself be a warning piece against the seduction of his example jealous of every one but chiefly of his own son he immured himself in his castle of plessis intrusting his person exclusively to the doubtful faith of his scottish mercenaries he never stirred from his chamber he admitted no one into it and wearied heaven and every saint with prayers not for forgiveness of his sins but for the prolongation of his life with a poverty of spirit totally inconsistent with his shrewd worldly sagacity he importuned his physicians until they insulted as well as plundered him  it was not the least singular circumstance of this course that bodily health and terrestrial felicity seemed to be his only object making any mention of his sins when talking on the state of his health was strictly prohibited and when at his command a priest recited a prayer to saint eutropius in which he recommended the kings welfare both in body and soul louis caused the two last words to be omitted saying it was not prudent to importune the blessed saint by too many requests at once perhaps he thought by being silent on his crimes he might suffer them to pass out of the recollection of the celestial patrons whose aid he invoked for his body  so great were the well merited tortures of this tyrants deathbed that philip de comines enters into a regular comparison between them and the numerous cruelties inflicted on others by his order and considering both comes to express an opinion that the worldly pangs and agony suffered by louis were such as might compensate the crimes he had committed and that after a reasonable quarantine in purgatory he might in mercy he found duly qualified for the superior regions the instructive but appalling scene of this tyrants sufferings was at length closed by death 30th august 1483  the selection of this remarkable person as the principal character in the romancefor it will be easily comprehended that the little love intrigue of quentin is only employed as the means of bringing out the storyafforded considerable facilities to the author in louis xis time extraordinary commotions existed throughout all europe englands civil wars were ended rather in appearance than reality by the short lived ascendancy of the house of york switzerland was asserting that freedom which was afterwards so bravely defended in the empire and in france the great vassals of the crown were endeavouring to emancipate themselves from its control while charles of burgundy by main force and louis more artfully by indirect means laboured to subject them to subservience to their respective sovereignties louis while with one hand he circumvented and subdued his own rebellious vassals laboured secretly with the other to aid and encourage the large trading towns of flanders to rebel against the duke of burgundy to which their wealth and irritability naturally disposed them in the more woodland districts of flanders the duke of gueldres and william de la marck called from his ferocity the wild boar of ardennes were throwing off the habits of knights and gentlemen to practise the violences and brutalities of common bandits  chapter i gives a further account of the conditions of the period which quentin durward portrays  a hundred secret combinations existed in the different provinces of france and flanders numerous private emissaries of the restless louis bohemians pilgrims beggars or agents disguised as such were everywhere spreading the discontent which it was his policy to maintain in the dominions of burgundy  amidst so great an abundance of materials it was difficult to select such as should be most intelligible and interesting to the reader and the author had to regret that though he made liberal use of the power of departing from the reality of history he felt by no means confident of having brought his story into a pleasing compact and sufficiently intelligible form the mainspring of the plot is that which all who know the least of the feudal system can easily understand though the facts are absolutely fictitious the right of a feudal superior was in nothing more universally acknowledged than in his power to interfere in the marriage of a female vassal this may appear to exist as a contradiction both of the civil and canon laws which declare that marriage shall be free while the feudal or municipal jurisprudence in case of a fief passing to a female acknowledges an interest in the superior of the fief to dictate the choice of her companion in marriage this is accounted for on the principle that the superior was by his bounty the original granter of the fief and is still interested that the marriage of the vassal shall place no one there who may be inimical to his liege lord on the other hand it might be reasonably pleaded that this right of dictating to the vassal to a certain extent in the choice of a husband is only competent to the superior from whom the fief is originally derived there is therefore no violent improbability in a vassal of burgundy flying to the protection of the king of france to whom the duke of burgundy himself was vassal not is it a great stretch of probability to affirm that louis unscrupulous as he was should have formed the design of betraying the fugitive into some alliance which might prove inconvenient if not dangerous to his formidable kinsman and vassal of burgundy  some of these departures from historical accuracy as when the death of the bishop of liege is antedated are duly set forth in the notes it should be mentioned that mr j f kirk in his elaborate history of charles the bold claims that in some points injustice has been done to the duke in this romance he says the faults of charles were sufficiently glaring and scarcely admitted of exaggeration but his breeding had been that of a prince his education had been better than that of other princes of his time his tastes and habits were more not less refined than theirs and the restraint he imposed upon his sensual appetites was as conspicuous a trait as his sternness and violence  abbotsford 1830    quentin durward was published in june 1823 and was scotts first venture on foreign ground while well received at home the sensation it created in paris was comparable to that caused by the appearance of waverley in edinburgh and ivanhoe in london in germany also where the author was already popular the new novel had a specially enthusiastic welcome the scene of the romance was partly suggested by a journal kept by sir walters dear friend mr james skene of rubislaw during a french tour the diary being illustrated by a vast number of clever drawings the author in telling this tale laid in unfamiliar scenes encountered difficulties of a kind quite new to him as it necessitated much study of maps gazetteers and books of travel for the history he naturally found above all else the memoirs of philip de comines the very key of the period though it need not be said that the lesser chroniclers received due attention it is interesting to note that in writing to his friend daniel terry the actor and manager scott says i have no idea my present labours will be dramatic in situation as to character that of louis xi the sagacious perfidious superstitious jocular politic tyrant would be for a historical chronicle containing his life and death one of the most powerful ever brought on the stage so thought the poet casimir delavignewriting when scotts influence was marked upon french literaturewhose powerful drama louis xi was a great parisian success later charles kean and henry irving made an english version of it well known in england and america    chapter i the contrast       look here upon this picture and on this      the counterfeit presentment of two brothers       hamlet   the latter part of the fifteenth century prepared a train of future events that ended by raising france to that state of formidable power which has ever since been from time to time the principal object of jealousy to the other european nations before that period she had to struggle for her very existence with the english already possessed of her fairest provinces while the utmost exertions of her king and the gallantry of her people could scarcely protect the remainder from a foreign yoke nor was this her sole danger the princes who possessed the grand fiefs of the crown and in particular the dukes of burgundy and bretagne had come to wear their feudal bonds so lightly that they had no scruple in lifting the standard against their liege and sovereign lord the king of france on the slightest pretence when at peace they reigned as absolute princes in their own provinces and the house of burgundy possessed of the district so called together with the fairest and richest part of flanders was itself so wealthy and so powerful as to yield nothing to the crown either in splendour or in strength  in imitation of the grand feudatories each inferior vassal of the crown assumed as much independence as his distance from the sovereign power the extent of his fief or the strength of his chateau enabled him to maintain and these petty tyrants no longer amenable to the exercise of the law perpetrated with impunity the wildest excesses of fantastic oppression and cruelty in auvergne alone a report was made of more than three hundred of these independent nobles to whom incest murder and rapine were the most ordinary and familiar actions  besides these evils another springing out of the long continued wars betwixt the french and english added no small misery to this distracted kingdom numerous bodies of soldiers collected into bands under officers chosen by themselves from among the bravest and most successful adventurers had been formed in various parts of france out of the refuse of all other countries these hireling combatants sold their swords for a time to the best bidder and when such service was not to be had they made war on their own account seizing castles and towers which they used as the places of their retreat making prisoners and ransoming them exacting tribute from the open villages and the country around themand acquiring by every species of rapine the appropriate epithets of tondeurs and ecorcheurs that is clippers and flayers  in the midst of the horrors and miseries arising from so distracted a state of public affairs reckless and profuse expense distinguished the courts of the lesser nobles as well as of the superior princes and their dependents in imitation expended in rude but magnificent display the wealth which they extorted from the people a tone of romantic and chivalrous gallantry which however was often disgraced by unbounded license characterized the intercourse between the sexes and the language of knight errantry was yet used and its observances followed though the pure spirit of honourable love and benevolent enterprise which it inculcates had ceased to qualify and atone for its extravagances the jousts and tournaments the entertainments and revels which each petty court displayed invited to france every wandering adventurer and it was seldom that when arrived there he failed to employ his rash courage and headlong spirit of enterprise in actions for which his happier native country afforded no free stage  at this period and as if to save this fair realm from the various woes with which it was menaced the tottering throne was ascended by louis xi whose character evil as it was in itself met combated and in a great degree neutralized the mischiefs of the timeas poisons of opposing qualities are said in ancient books of medicine to have the power of counteracting each other  brave enough for every useful and political purpose louis had not a spark of that romantic valour or of the pride generally associated with it which fought on for the point of honour when the point of utility had been long gained calm crafty and profoundly attentive to his own interest he made every sacrifice both of pride and passion which could interfere with it he was careful in disguising his real sentiments and purposes from all who approached him and frequently used the expressions that the king knew not how to reign who knew not how to dissemble and that for himself if he thought his very cap knew his secrets he would throw it into the fire no man of his own or of any other time better understood how to avail himself of the frailties of others and when to avoid giving any advantage by the untimely indulgence of his own  he was by nature vindictive and cruel even to the extent of finding pleasure in the frequent executions which he commanded but as no touch of mercy ever induced him to spare when he could with safety condemn so no sentiment of vengeance ever stimulated him to a premature violence he seldom sprang on his prey till it was fairly within his grasp and till all hope of rescue was vain and his movements were so studiously disguised that his success was generally what first announced to the world the object he had been manoeuvring to attain  in like manner the avarice of louis gave way to apparent profusion when it was necessary to bribe the favourite or minister of a rival prince for averting any impending attack or to break up any alliance confederated against him he was fond of license and pleasure but neither beauty nor the chase though both were ruling passions ever withdrew him from the most regular attendance to public business and the affairs of his kingdom his knowledge of mankind was profound and he had sought it in the private walks of life in which he often personally mingled and though naturally proud and haughty he hesitated not with an inattention to the arbitrary divisions of society which was then thought something portentously unnatural to raise from the lowest rank men whom he employed on the most important duties and knew so well how to choose them that he was rarely disappointed in their qualities yet there were contradictions in the character of this artful and able monarch for human nature is rarely uniform himself the most false and insincere of mankind some of the greatest errors of his life arose from too rash a confidence in the honour and integrity of others when these errors took place they seem to have arisen from an over refined system of policy which induced louis to assume the appearance of undoubting confidence in those whom it was his object to overreach for in his general conduct he was as jealous and suspicious as any tyrant who ever breathed  two other points may be noticed to complete the sketch of this formidable character by which he rose among the rude chivalrous sovereigns of the period to the rank of a keeper among wild beasts who by superior wisdom and policy by distribution of food and some discipline by blows comes finally to predominate over those who if unsubjected by his arts would by main strength have torn him to pieces  the first of these attributes was louiss excessive superstition a plague with which heaven often afflicts those who refuse to listen to the dictates of religion the remorse arising from his evil actions louis never endeavoured to appease by any relaxation in his machiavellian stratagems on account of the alleged political immorality of machiavelli an illustrious italian of the sixteenth century this expression has come to mean destitute of political morality habitually using duplicity and bad faith cent dict but laboured in vain to soothe and silence that painful feeling by superstitious observances severe penance and profuse gifts to the ecclesiastics the second property with which the first is sometimes found strangely united was a disposition to low pleasures and obscure debauchery the wisest or at least the most crafty sovereign of his time he was fond of low life and being himself a man of wit enjoyed the jests and repartees of social conversation more than could have been expected from other points of his character he even mingled in the comic adventures of obscure intrigue with a freedom little consistent with the habitual and guarded jealousy of his character and he was so fond of this species of humble gallantry that he caused a number of its gay and licentious anecdotes to be enrolled in a collection well known to book collectors in whose eyes and the work is unfit for any other the right edition is very precious  this editio princeps which when in good preservation is much sought after by connoisseurs is entitled les cent nouvelles nouvelles contenant cent histoires nouveaux qui sont moult plaisans a raconter en toutes bonnes compagnies par maniere de joyeuxete paris antoine verard sans date dannee dimpression en folio gotique see de bure s  by means of this monarchs powerful and prudent though most unamiable character it pleased heaven who works by the tempest as well as by the soft small rain to restore to the great french nation the benefits of civil government which at the time of his accession they had nearly lost  ere he succeeded to the crown louis had given evidence of his vices rather than of his talents his first wife margaret of scotland was done to death by slanderous tongues in her husbands court where but for the encouragement of louis himself not a word would have been breathed against that amiable and injured princess he had been an ungrateful and a rebellious son at one time conspiring to seize his fathers person and at another levying open war against him for the first offence he was banished to his appanage of dauphine which he governed with much sagacity for the second he was driven into absolute exile and forced to throw himself on the mercy and almost on the charity of the duke of burgundy and his son where he enjoyed hospitality afterwards indifferently requited until the death of his father in 1461  in the very outset of his reign louis was almost overpowered by a league formed against him by the great vassals of france with the duke of burgundy or rather his son the count de charalois at its head they levied a powerful army blockaded paris fought a battle of doubtful issue under its very walls and placed the french monarchy on the brink of actual destruction it usually happens in such cases that the more sagacious general of the two gains the real fruit though perhaps not the martial fame of the disputed field louis who had shown great personal bravery during the battle of montlhery was able by his prudence to avail himself of its undecided character as if it had been a victory on his side he temporized until the enemy had broken up their leaguer and showed so much dexterity in sowing jealousies among those great powers that their alliance for the public weal as they termed it but in reality for the overthrow of all but the external appearance of the french monarchy dissolved itself and was never again renewed in a manner so formidable from this period louis relieved of all danger from england by the civil wars of york and lancaster was engaged for several years like an unfeeling but able physician in curing the wounds of the body politic or rather in stopping now by gentle remedies now by the use of fire and steel the progress of those mortal gangrenes with which it was then infected the brigandage of the free companies troops that acknowledged no authority except that of their leaders and who hired themselves out at will and the unpunished oppression of the nobility he laboured to lessen since he could not actually stop them and by dint of unrelaxed attention he gradually gained some addition to his own regal authority or effected some diminution of those by whom it was counterbalanced  still the king of france was surrounded by doubt and danger the members of the league for the public weal though not in unison were in existence and like a scotched snake see macbeth iii ii 13 we have scotchd the snake not killd it might reunite and become dangerous again but a worse danger was the increasing power of the duke of burgundy then one of the greatest princes of europe and little diminished in rank by the very slight dependence of his duchy upon the crown of france  charles surnamed the bold or rather the audacious for his courage was allied to rashness and frenzy then wore the ducal coronet of burgundy which he burned to convert into a royal and independent regal crown the character of this duke was in every respect the direct contrast to that of louis xi  the latter was calm deliberate and crafty never prosecuting a desperate enterprise and never abandoning one likely to be successful however distant the prospect the genius of the duke was entirely different he rushed on danger because he loved it and on difficulties because he despised them as louis never sacrificed his interest to his passion so charles on the other hand never sacrificed his passion or even his humour to any other consideration notwithstanding the near relationship that existed between them and the support which the duke and his father had afforded to louis in his exile when dauphin there was mutual contempt and hatred betwixt them the duke of burgundy despised the cautious policy of the king and imputed to the faintness of his courage that he sought by leagues purchases and other indirect means those advantages which in his place the duke would have snatched with an armed hand he likewise hated the king not only for the ingratitude he had manifested for former kindnesses and for personal injuries and imputations which the ambassadors of louis had cast upon him when his father was yet alive but also and especially because of the support which he afforded in secret to the discontented citizens of ghent liege and other great towns in flanders these turbulent cities jealous of their privileges and proud of their wealth were frequently in a state of insurrection against their liege lords the dukes of burgundy and never failed to find underhand countenance at the court of louis who embraced every opportunity of fomenting disturbance within the dominions of his overgrown vassal  the contempt and hatred of the duke were retaliated by louis with equal energy though he used a thicker veil to conceal his sentiments it was impossible for a man of his profound sagacity not to despise the stubborn obstinacy which never resigned its purpose however fatal perseverance might prove and the headlong impetuosity which commenced its career without allowing a moments consideration for the obstacles to be encountered yet the king hated charles even more than he contemned him and his scorn and hatred were the more intense that they were mingled with fear for he know that the onset of the mad bull to whom he likened the duke of burgundy must ever be formidable though the animal makes it with shut eyes it was not alone the wealth of the burgundian provinces the discipline of the warlike inhabitants and the mass of their crowded population which the king dreaded for the personal qualities of their leader had also much in them that was dangerous the very soul of bravery which he pushed to the verge of rashness and beyond itprofuse in expendituresplendid in his court his person and his retinue in all which he displayed the hereditary magnificence of the house of burgundy charles the bold drew into his service almost all the fiery spirits of the age whose tempers were congenial and louis saw too clearly what might be attempted and executed by such a train of resolute adventurers following a leader of a character as ungovernable as their own  there was yet another circumstance which increased the animosity of louis towards his overgrown vassal he owed him favours which he never meant to repay and was under the frequent necessity of temporizing with him and even of enduring bursts of petulant insolence injurious to the regal dignity without being able to treat him otherwise than as his fair cousin of burgundy  it was about the year 1468 when their feuds were at the highest though a dubious and hollow truce as frequently happened existed for the time betwixt them that the present narrative opens the person first introduced on the stage will be found indeed to be of a rank and condition the illustration of whose character scarcely called for a dissertation on the relative position of two great princes but the passions of the great their quarrels and their reconciliations involve the fortunes of all who approach them and it will be found on proceeding farther in our story that this preliminary chapter is necessary for comprehending the history of the individual whose adventures we are about to relate    chapter ii the wanderer       why then the worlds mine oyster which i with sword will open       ancient pistol   it was upon a delicious summer morning before the sun had assumed its scorching power and while the dews yet cooled and perfumed the air that a youth coming from the northeastward approached the ford of a small river or rather a large brook tributary to the cher near to the royal castle of plessis les tours whose dark and multiplied battlements rose in the background over the extensive forest with which they were surrounded these woodlands comprised a noble chase or royal park fenced by an enclosure termed in the latin of the middle ages plexitium which gives the name of plessis to so many villages in france the castle and village of which we particularly speak was called plessis les tours to distinguish it from others and was built about two miles to the southward of the fair town of that name the capital of ancient touraine whose rich plain has been termed the garden of france  on the bank of the above mentioned brook opposite to that which the traveller was approaching two men who appeared in deep conversation seemed from time to time to watch his motions for as their station was much more elevated they could remark him at considerable distance  the age of the young traveller might be about nineteen or betwixt that and twenty and his face and person which were very prepossessing did not however belong to the country in which he was now a sojourner his short gray cloak and hose were rather of flemish than of french fashion while the smart blue bonnet with a single sprig of holly and an eagles feather was already recognized as the scottish head gear his dress was very neat and arranged with the precision of a youth conscious of possessing a fine person he had at his back a satchel which seemed to contain a few necessaries a hawking gauntlet on his left hand though he carried no bird and in his right a stout hunters pole over his left shoulder hung an embroidered scarf which sustained a small pouch of scarlet velvet such as was then used by fowlers of distinction to carry their hawks food and other matters belonging to that much admired sport this was crossed by another shoulder belt to which was hung a hunting knife or couteau de chasse instead of the boots of the period he wore buskins of half dressed deers skin  although his form had not yet attained its full strength he was tall and active and the lightness of the step with which he advanced showed that his pedestrian mode of travelling was pleasure rather than pain to him his complexion was fair in spite of a general shade of darker hue with which the foreign sun or perhaps constant exposure to the atmosphere in his own country had in some degree embrowned it  his features without being quite regular were frank open and pleasing a half smile which seemed to arise from a happy exuberance of animal spirits showed now and then that his teeth were well set and as pure as ivory whilst his bright blue eye with a corresponding gaiety had an appropriate glance for every object which it encountered expressing good humour lightness of heart and determined resolution  he received and returned the salutation of the few travellers who frequented the road in those dangerous times with the action which suited each the strolling spearman half soldier half brigand measured the youth with his eye as if balancing the prospect of booty with the chance of desperate resistance and read such indications of the latter in the fearless glance of the passenger that he changed his ruffian purpose for a surly good morrow comrade which the young scot answered with as martial though a less sullen tone the wandering pilgrim or the begging friar answered his reverent greeting with a paternal benedicite equivalent to the english expression bless you and the dark eyed peasant girl looked after him for many a step after they had passed each other and interchanged a laughing good morrow in short there was an attraction about his whole appearance not easily escaping attention and which was derived from the combination of fearless frankness and good humour with sprightly looks and a handsome face and person it seemed too as if his whole demeanour bespoke one who was entering on life with no apprehension of the evils with which it is beset and small means for struggling with its hardships except a lively spirit and a courageous disposition and it is with such tempers that youth most readily sympathizes and for whom chiefly age and experience feel affectionate and pitying interest  the youth whom we have described had been long visible to the two persons who loitered on the opposite side of the small river which divided him from the park and the castle but as he descended the rugged bank to the waters edge with the light step of a roe which visits the fountain the younger of the two said to the other it is our manit is the bohemian if he attempts to cross the ford he is a lost manthe water is up and the ford impassable  let him make that discovery himself gossip an intimate friend or companion obsolete said the elder personage it may perchance save a rope and break a proverb refers to the old saw who is born to be hanged will never be drowned  i judge him by the blue cap said the other for i cannot see his face hark sir he hallooes to know whether the water be deep  nothing like experience in this world answered the other let him try  the young man in the meanwhile receiving no hint to the contrary and taking the silence of those to whom he applied as an encouragement to proceed entered the stream without farther hesitation than the delay necessary to take off his buskins the elder person at the same moment hallooed to him to beware adding in a lower tone to his companion mortdieugossipyou have made another mistakethis is not the bohemian chatterer  but the intimation to the youth came too late he either did not hear or could not profit by it being already in the deep stream to one less alert and practised in the exercise of swimming death had been certain for the brook was both deep and strong  by saint anne but he is a proper youth said the elder man run gossip and help your blunder by giving him aid if thou canst he belongs to thine own troopif old saws speak truth water will not drown him  indeed the young traveller swam so strongly and buffeted the waves so well that notwithstanding the strength of the current he was carried but a little way down from the ordinary landing place  by this time the younger of the two strangers was hurrying down to the shore to render assistance while the other followed him at a graver pace saying to himself as he approached i knew water would never drown that young fellowby my halidome originally something regarded as sacred as a relic formerly much used in solemn oaths he is ashore and grasps his poleif i make not the more haste he will beat my gossip for the only charitable action which i ever saw him perform or attempt to perform in the whole course of his life  there was some reason to augur such a conclusion of the adventure for the bonny scot had already accosted the younger samaritan who was hastening to his assistance with these ireful words discourteous dog why did you not answer when i called to know if the passage was fit to be attempted may the foul fiend catch me but i will teach you the respect due to strangers on the next occasion  this was accompanied with that significant flourish with his pole which is called le moulinet because the artist holding it in the middle brandishes the two ends in every direction like the sails of a windmill in motion his opponent seeing himself thus menaced laid hand upon his sword for he was one of those who on all occasions are more ready for action than for speech but his more considerate comrade who came up commanded him to forbear and turning to the young man accused him in turn of precipitation in plunging into the swollen ford and of intemperate violence in quarrelling with a man who was hastening to his assistance  the young man on hearing himself thus reproved by a man of advanced age and respectable appearance immediately lowered his weapon and said he would be sorry if he had done them injustice but in reality it appeared to him as if they had suffered him to put his life in peril for want of a word of timely warning which could be the part neither of honest men nor of good christians far less of respectable burgesses such as they seemed to be  fair son said the elder person you seem from your accent and complexion a stranger and you should recollect your dialect is not so easily comprehended by us as perhaps it may be uttered by you  well father answered the youth i do not care much about the ducking i have had and i will readily forgive your being partly the cause provided you will direct me to some place where i can have my clothes dried for it is my only suit and i must keep it somewhat decent  for whom do you take us fair son said the elder stranger in answer to this question  for substantial burgesses unquestionably said the youth orhold you master may be a money broker or a corn merchant and this man a butcher or grazier  you have hit our capacities rarely said the elder smiling my business is indeed to trade in as much money as i can and my gossips dealings are somewhat of kin to the butchers as to your accommodation we will try to serve you but i must first know who you are and whither you are going for in these times the roads are filled with travellers on foot and horseback who have anything in their head but honesty and the fear of god  the young man cast another keen and penetrating glance on him who spoke and on his silent companion as if doubtful whether they on their part merited the confidence they demanded and the result of his observation was as follows  the eldest and most remarkable of these men in dress and appearance resembled the merchant or shopkeeper of the period his jerkin hose and cloak were of a dark uniform colour but worn so threadbare that the acute young scot conceived that the wearer must be either very rich or very poor probably the former the fashion of the dress was close and short a kind of garment which was not then held decorous among gentry or even the superior class of citizens who generally wore loose gowns which descended below the middle of the leg  the expression of this mans countenance was partly attractive and partly forbidding his strong features sunk cheeks and hollow eyes had nevertheless an expression of shrewdness and humour congenial to the character of the young adventurer but then those same sunken eyes from under the shroud of thick black eyebrows had something in them that was at once commanding and sinister perhaps this effect was increased by the low fur cap much depressed on the forehead and adding to the shade from under which those eyes peered out but it is certain that the young stranger had some difficulty to reconcile his looks with the meanness of his appearance in other respects his cap in particular in which all men of any quality displayed either a brooch of gold or of silver was ornamented with a paltry image of the virgin in lead such as the poorer sort of pilgrims bring from loretto a city in italy containing the sanctuary of the virgin mary called the santa casa reputed to have been brought there by angels  his comrade was a stout formed middle sized man more than ten years younger than his companion with a down looking visage and a very ominous smile when by chance he gave way to that impulse which was never except in reply to certain secret signs that seemed to pass between him and the elder stranger this man was armed with a sword and dagger and underneath his plain habit the scotsman observed that he concealed a jazeran or flexible shirt of linked mail which as being often worn by those even of peaceful professions who were called upon at that perilous period to be frequently abroad confirmed the young man in his conjecture that the wearer was by profession a butcher grazier or something of that description called upon to be much abroad the young stranger comprehending in one glance the result of the observation which has taken us some time to express answered after a moments pause i am ignorant whom i may have the honour to address making a slight reverence at the same time but i am indifferent who knows that i am a cadet of scotland and that i come to seek my fortune in france or elsewhere after the custom of my countrymen  pasques dieu and a gallant custom it is said the elder stranger you seem a fine young springald and at the right age to prosper whether among men or women what say you i am a merchant and want a lad to assist in my traffic i suppose you are too much a gentleman to assist in such mechanical drudgery  fair sir said the youth if your offer be seriously madeof which i have my doubtsi am bound to thank you for it and i thank you accordingly but i fear i should be altogether unfit for your service  what said the senior i warrant thou knowest better how to draw the bow than how to draw a bill of chargescanst handle a broadsword better than a penha  i am master answered the young scot a braeman and therefore as we say a bowman but besides that i have been in a convent where the good fathers taught me to read and write and even to cipher  pasques dieu that is too magnificent said the merchant by our lady of embrun a town in france containing a cathedral in which was a wooden statue of the virgin mary said to have been sculptured by st luke thou art a prodigy man  rest you merry fair master said the youth who was not much pleased with his new acquaintances jocularity i must go dry myself instead of standing dripping here answering questions  the merchant only laughed louder as he spoke and answered pasques dieu the proverb never failsfier comme un ecossois proud or haughty as a scotchmanbut come youngster you are of a country i have a regard for having traded in scotland in my timean honest poor set of folks they are and if you will come with us to the village i will bestow on you a cup of burnt sack and a warm breakfast to atone for your drenchingbut tete bleau what do you with a hunting glove on your hand know you not there is no hawking permitted in a royal chase  i was taught that lesson answered the youth by a rascally forester of the duke of burgundy i did but fly the falcon i had brought with me from scotland and that i reckoned on for bringing me into some note at a heron near peronne and the rascally schelm rogue rascal obsolete or scotch shot my bird with an arrow  what did you do said the merchant  beat him said the youngster brandishing his staff as near to death as one christian man should belabour anotheri wanted not to have his blood to answer for  know you said the burgess that had you fallen into the duke of burgundys hands he would have hung you up like a chestnut  ay i am told he is as prompt as the king of france for that sort of work but as this happened near peronne i made a leap over the frontiers and laughed at him if he had not been so hasty i might perhaps have taken service with him  he will have a heavy miss of such a paladin as you are if the truce should break off said the merchant and threw a look at his own companion who answered him with one of the downcast lowering smiles which gleamed along his countenance enlivening it as a passing meteor enlivens a winter sky  the young scot suddenly stopped pulled his bonnet over his right eyebrow as one that would not be ridiculed and said firmly my masters and especially you sir the elder and who should be the wiser you will find i presume no sound or safe jesting at my expense i do not altogether like the tone of your conversation i can take a jest with any man and a rebuke too from my elder and say thank you sir if i know it to be deserved but i do not like being borne in hand as if i were a child when god wot i find myself man enough to belabour you both if you provoke me too far  the eldest man seemed like to choke with laughter at the lads demeanourhis companions hand stole to his sword hilt which the youth observing dealt him a blow across the wrist which made him incapable of grasping it while his companions mirth was only increased by the incident  hold hold he cried most doughty scot even for thine own dear countrys sake and you gossip forbear your menacing look pasquesdieu let us be just traders and set off the wetting against the knock on the wrist which was given with so much grace and alacrityand hark ye my young friend he said to the young man with a grave sternness which in spite of all the youth could do damped and overawed him no more violence i am no fit object for it and my gossip as you may see has had enough of it let me know your name  i can answer a civil question civilly said the youth and will pay fitting respect to your age if you do not urge my patience with mockery since i have been here in france and flanders men have called me in their fantasy the varlet with the velvet pouch because of this hawk purse which i carry by my side but my true name when at home is quentin durward  durward said the querist is it a gentlemans name  by fifteen descents in our family said the young man and that makes me reluctant to follow any other trade than arms  a true scot plenty of blood plenty of pride and right great scarcity of ducats i warrant theewell gossip he said to his companion go before us and tell them to have some breakfast ready yonder at the mulberry grove for this youth will do as much honour to it as a starved mouse to a housewifes cheese and for the bohemianhark in thy ear  his comrade answered by a gloomy but intelligent smile and set forward at a round pace while the elder man continued addressing young durward you and i will walk leisurely forward together and we may take a mass at saint huberts chapel in our way through the forest for it is not good to think of our fleshly before our spiritual wants  this silvan saint was passionately fond of the chase and used to neglect attendance on divine worship for this amusement while he was once engaged in this pastime a stag appeared before him having a crucifix bound betwixt his horns and he heard a voice which menaced him with eternal punishment if he did not repent of his sins he retired from the world and took orders hubert afterwards became bishop of maestrecht and liege s  durward as a good catholic had nothing to object against this proposal although he might probably have been desirous in the first place to have dried his clothes and refreshed himself meanwhile they soon lost sight of their downward looking companion but continued to follow the same path which he had taken until it led them into a wood of tall trees mixed with thickets and brushwood traversed by long avenues through which were seen as through a vista the deer trotting in little herds with a degree of security which argued their consciousness of being completely protected  you asked me if i were a good bowman said the young scot give me a bow and a brace of shafts and you shall have a piece of venison in a moment  pasques dieu my young friend said his companion take care of that my gossip yonder hath a special eye to the deer they are under his charge and he is a strict keeper  he hath more the air of a butcher than of a gay forester answered durward i cannot think yon hang dog look of his belongs to any one who knows the gentle rules of woodcraft  ah my young friend answered his companion my gossip hath somewhat an ugly favour to look upon at the first but those who become acquainted with him never are known to complain of him  quentin durward found something singularly and disagreeably significant in the tone with which this was spoken and looking suddenly at the speaker thought he saw in his countenance in the slight smile that curled his upper lip and the accompanying twinkle of his keen dark eye something to justify his unpleasing surprise i have heard of robbers he thought to himself and of wily cheats and cutthroatswhat if yonder fellow be a murderer and this old rascal his decoy duck i will be on my guardthey will get little by me but good scottish knocks  while he was thus reflecting they came to a glade where the large forest trees were more widely separated from each other and where the ground beneath cleared of underwood and bushes was clothed with a carpet of the softest and most lovely verdure which screened from the scorching heat of the sun was here more beautifully tender than it is usually to be seen in france the trees in this secluded spot were chiefly beeches and elms of huge magnitude which rose like great hills of leaves into the air amidst these magnificent sons of the earth there peeped out in the most open spot of the glade a lowly chapel near which trickled a small rivulet its architecture was of the rudest and most simple kind and there was a very small lodge beside it for the accommodation of a hermit or solitary priest who remained there for regularly discharging the duty of the altar in a small niche over the arched doorway stood a stone image of saint hubert with the bugle horn around his neck and a leash of greyhounds at his feet the situation of the chapel in the midst of a park or chase so richly stocked with game made the dedication to the sainted huntsman peculiarly appropriate  towards this little devotional structure the old man directed his steps followed by young durward and as they approached the priest dressed in his sacerdotal garments made his appearance in the act of proceeding from his cell to the chapel for the discharge doubtless of his holy office durward bowed his body reverently to the priest as the respect due to his sacred office demanded whilst his companion with an appearance of still more deep devotion kneeled on one knee to receive the holy mans blessing and then followed him into church with a step and manner expressive of the most heartfelt contrition and humility  the inside of the chapel was adorned in a manner adapted to the occupation of the patron saint while on earth the richest furs of such animals as are made the objects of the chase in different countries supplied the place of tapestry and hangings around the altar and elsewhere and the characteristic emblazonments of bugles bows quivers and other emblems of hunting surrounded the walls and were mingled with the heads of deer wolves and other animals considered beasts of sport the whole adornments took an appropriate and silvan character and the mass itself being considerably shortened proved to be of that sort which is called a hunting mass because in use before the noble and powerful who while assisting at the solemnity are usually impatient to commence their favourite sport  yet during this brief ceremony durwards companion seemed to pay the most rigid and scrupulous attention while durward not quite so much occupied with religious thoughts could not forbear blaming himself in his own mind for having entertained suspicions derogatory to the character of so good and so humble a man far from now holding him as a companion and accomplice of robbers he had much to do to forbear regarding him as a saintlike personage  when mass was ended they retired together from the chapel and the elder said to his young comrade it is but a short walk from hence to the villageyou may now break your fast with an unprejudiced consciencefollow me  turning to the right and proceeding along a path which seemed gradually to ascend he recommended to his companion by no means to quit the track but on the contrary to keep the middle of it as nearly as he could durward could not help asking the cause of this precaution  you are now near the court young man answered his guide and pasquesdieu there is some difference betwixt walking in this region and on your own heathy hills every yard of this ground excepting the path which we now occupy is rendered dangerous and well nigh impracticable by snares and traps armed with scythe blades which shred off the unwary passengers limb as sheerly as a hedge bill lops a hawthorn sprigand calthrops that would pierce your foot through and pitfalls deep enough to bury you in them for ever for you are now within the precincts of the royal demesne and we shall presently see the front of the chateau  were i the king of france said the young man i would not take so much trouble with traps and gins but would try instead to govern so well that no man should dare to come near my dwelling with a bad intent and for those who came there in peace and goodwill why the more of them the merrier we should be  his companion looked round affecting an alarmed gaze and said hush hush sir varlet with the velvet pouch for i forgot to tell you that one great danger of these precincts is that the very leaves of the trees are like so many ears which carry all which is spoken to the kings own cabinet  i care little for that answered quentin durward i bear a scottish tongue in my head bold enough to speak my mind to king louiss face god bless himand for the ears you talk of if i could see them growing on a human head i would crop them out of it with my wood knife    chapter iii the castle       full in the midst a mighty pile arose      where iron grated gates their strength oppose      to each invading stepand strong and steep      the battled walls arose the fosse sunk deep      slow round the fortress rolld the sluggish stream      and high in middle air the warders turrets gleam       anonymous   while durward and his acquaintance thus spoke they came in sight of the whole front of the castle of plessis les tours which even in those dangerous times when the great found themselves obliged to reside within places of fortified strength was distinguished for the extreme and jealous care with which it was watched and defended  from the verge of the wood where young durward halted with his companion in order to take a view of this royal residence extended or rather arose though by a very gentle elevation an open esplanade devoid of trees and bushes of every description excepting one gigantic and half withered old oak this space was left open according to the rules of fortification in all ages in order that an enemy might not approach the walls under cover or unobserved from the battlements and beyond it arose the castle itself  there were three external walls battlemented and turreted from space to space and at each angle the second enclosure rising higher than the first and being built so as to command the exterior defence in case it was won by the enemy and being again in the same manner itself commanded by the third and innermost barrier  around the external wall as the frenchman informed his young companion for as they stood lower than the foundation of the wall he could not see it was sunk a ditch of about twenty feet in depth supplied with water by a dam head on the river cher or rather on one of its tributary branches in front of the second enclosure he said there ran another fosse and a third both of the same unusual dimensions was led between the second and the innermost inclosure the verge both of the outer and inner circuit of this triple moat was strongly fenced with palisades of iron serving the purpose of what are called chevaux de frise in modern fortification the top of each pale being divided into a cluster of sharp spikes which seemed to render any attempt to climb over an act of self destruction  from within the innermost enclosure arose the castle itself containing buildings of all periods crowded around and united with the ancient and grim looking donjon keep which was older than any of them and which rose like a black ethiopian giant high into the air while the absence of any windows larger than shot holes irregularly disposed for defence gave the spectator the same unpleasant feeling which we experience on looking at a blind man the other buildings seemed scarcely better adapted for the purposes of comfort for the windows opened to an inner and enclosed courtyard so that the whole external front looked much more like that of a prison than a palace the reigning king had even increased this effect for desirous that the additions which he himself had made to the fortifications should be of a character not easily distinguished from the original building for like many jealous persons he loved not that his suspicions should be observed the darkest coloured brick and freestone were employed and soot mingled with the lime so as to give the whole castle the same uniform tinge of extreme and rude antiquity  this formidable place had but one entranceat least durward saw none along the spacious front except where in the centre of the first and outward boundary arose two strong towers the usual defences of a gateway and he could observe their ordinary accompaniments portcullis and drawbridgeof which the first was lowered and the last raised similar entrance towers were visible on the second and third bounding wall but not in the same line with those on the outward circuit because the passage did not cut right through the whole three enclosures at the same point but on the contrary those who entered had to proceed nearly thirty yards betwixt the first and second wall exposed if their purpose were hostile to missiles from both and again when the second boundary was passed they must make a similar digression from the straight line in order to attain the portal of the third and innermost enclosure so that before gaining the outer court which ran along the front of the building two narrow and dangerous defiles were to be traversed under a flanking discharge of artillery and three gates defended in the strongest manner known to the age were to be successively forced  coming from a country alike desolated by foreign war and internal feudsa country too whose unequal and mountainous surface abounding in precipices and torrents affords so many situations of strength young durward was sufficiently acquainted with all the various contrivances by which men in that stern age endeavoured to secure their dwellings but he frankly owned to his companion that he did not think it had been in the power of art to do so much for defence where nature had done so little for the situation as we have hinted was merely the summit of a gentle elevation ascending upwards from the place where they were standing  to enhance his surprise his companion told him that the environs of the castle except the single winding path by which the portal might be safely approached were like the thickets through which they had passed surrounded with every species of hidden pitfall snare and gin to entrap the wretch who should venture thither without a guide that upon the walls were constructed certain cradles of iron called swallows nests from which the sentinels who were regularly posted there could without being exposed to any risk take deliberate aim at any who should attempt to enter without the proper signal or password of the day and that the archers of the royal guard performed that duty day and night for which they received high pay rich clothing and much honour and profit at the hands of king louis and now tell me young man he continued did you ever see so strong a fortress and do you think there are men bold enough to storm it  the young man looked long and fixedly on the place the sight of which interested him so much that he had forgotten in the eagerness of youthful curiosity the wetness of his dress his eye glanced and his colour mounted to his cheek like that of a daring man who meditates an honourable action as he replied it is a strong castle and strongly guarded but there is no impossibility to brave men  are there any in your country who could do such a feat said the elder rather scornfully  i will not affirm that answered the youth but there are thousands that in a good cause would attempt as bold a deed  umph said the senior perhaps you are yourself such a gallant  i should sin if i were to boast where there is no danger answered young durward but my father has done as bold an act and i trust i am no bastard  well said his companion smiling you might meet your match and your kindred withal in the attempt for the scottish archers of king louiss life guards stand sentinels on yonder wallsthree hundred gentlemen of the best blood in your country  and were i king louis said the youth in reply i would trust my safety to the faith of the three hundred scottish gentlemen throw down my bounding walls to fill up the moat call in my noble peers and paladins and live as became me amid breaking of lances in gallant tournaments and feasting of days with nobles and dancing of nights with ladies and have no more fear of a foe than i have of a fly  his companion again smiled and turning his back on the castle which he observed they had approached a little too nearly he led the way again into the wood by a more broad and beaten path than they had yet trodden this he said leads us to the village of plessis as it is called where you as a stranger will find reasonable and honest accommodation about two miles onward lies the fine city of tours which gives name to this rich and beautiful earldom but the village of plessis or plessis of the park as it is sometimes called from its vicinity to the royal residence and the chase with which it is encircled will yield you nearer and as convenient hospitality  i thank you kind master for your information said the scot but my stay will be so short here that if i fail not in a morsel of meat and a drink of something better than water my necessities in plessis be it of the park or the pool will be amply satisfied  nay answered his companion i thought you had some friend to see in this quarter  and so i havemy mothers own brother answered durward and as pretty a man before he left the braes of angus hills and moors of angus in forfarshire scotland as ever planted brogue on heather  what is his name said the senior we will inquire him out for you for it is not safe for you to go up to the castle where you might be taken for a spy  now by my fathers hand said the youth i taken for a spyby heaven he shall brook cold iron that brands me with such a chargebut for my uncles name i care not who knows itit is lesly leslyan honest and noble name  and so it is i doubt not said the old man but there are three of the name in the scottish guard  my uncles name is ludovic lesly said the young man  of the three leslys answered the merchant two are called ludovic  they call my kinsman ludovic with the scar said quentin our family names are so common in a scottish house that where there is no land in the case we always give a toname surname  a nom de guerre the war name formerly taken by french soldiers on entering the service hence a fictitious name assumed for other purposes i suppose you to mean answered his companion and the man you speak of we i think call le balafre from that scar on his facea proper man and a good soldier i wish i may be able to help you to an interview with him for he belongs to a set of gentlemen whose duty is strict and who do not often come out of garrison unless in the immediate attendance on the kings personand now young man answer me one question i will wager you are desirous to take service with your uncle in the scottish guard it is a great thing if you propose so especially as you are very young and some years experience is necessary for the high office which you aim at  perhaps i may have thought on some such thing said durward carelessly but if i did the fancy is off  how so young man said the frenchman something sternly do you speak thus of a charge which the most noble of your countrymen feel themselves emulous to be admitted to  i wish them joy of it said quentin composedly to speak plain i should have liked the service of the french king full well only dress me as fine and feed me as high as you will i love the open air better than being shut up in a cage or a swallows nest yonder as you call these same grated pepper boxes besides he added in a lower voice to speak truth i love not the castle when the covin tree bears such acorns as i see yonder  the large tree in front of a scottish castle was sometimes called so it is difficult to trace the derivation but at that distance from the castle the laird received guests of rank and thither he conveyed them on their departure s  i guess what you mean said the frenchman but speak yet more plainly  to speak more plainly then said the youth there grows a fair oak some flight shot or so from yonder castleand on that oak hangs a man in a gray jerkin such as this which i wear  ay and indeed said the man of francepasques dieu see what it is to have youthful eyes why i did see something but only took it for a raven among the branches but the sight is no ways strange young man when the summer fades into autumn and moonlight nights are long and roads become unsafe you will see a cluster of ten ay of twenty such acorns hanging on that old doddered oakbut what thenthey are so many banners displayed to scare knaves and for each rogue that hangs there an honest man may reckon that there is a thief a traitor a robber on the highway a pilleur and oppressor of the people the fewer in france these young man are signs of our sovereigns justice  i would have hung them farther from my palace though were i king louis said the youth in my country we hang up dead corbies where living corbies haunt but not in our gardens or pigeon houses the very scent of the carrionfaughreached my nostrils at the distance where we stood  if you live to be an honest and loyal servant of your prince my good youth answered the frenchman you will know there is no perfume to match the scent of a dead traitor  i shall never wish to live till i lose the scent of my nostrils or the sight of my eyes said the scot show me a living traitor and here are my hand and my weapon but when life is out hatred should not live longerbut here i fancy we come upon the village where i hope to show you that neither ducking nor disgust have spoiled mine appetite for my breakfast so my good friend to the hostelrie with all the speed you mayyet ere i accept of your hospitality let me know by what name to call you  men call me maitre pierre answered his companion i deal in no titles a plain man that can live on mine own goodthat is my designation  so be it maitre pierre said quentin and i am happy my good chance has thrown us together for i want a word of seasonable advice and can be thankful for it  while they spoke thus the tower of the church and a tall wooden crucifix rising above the trees showed that they were at the entrance of the village  but maitre pierre deflecting a little from the road which had now joined an open and public causeway said to his companion that the inn to which he intended to introduce him stood somewhat secluded and received only the better sort of travellers  if you mean those who travel with the better filled purses answered the scot i am none of the number and will rather stand my chance of your flayers on the highway than of your flayers in the hostelrie  pasques dieu said his guide how cautious your countrymen of scotland are an englishman now throws himself headlong into a tavern eats and drinks of the best and never thinks of the reckoning till his belly is full but you forget master quentin since quentin is your name you forget i owe you a breakfast for the wetting which my mistake procured youit is the penance of my offence towards you  in truth said the light hearted young man i had forgot wetting offence and penance and all i have walked my clothes dry or nearly so but i will not refuse your offer in kindness for my dinner yesterday was a light one and supper i had none you seem an old and respectable burgess and i see no reason why i should not accept your courtesy  the frenchman smiled aside for he saw plainly that the youth while he was probably half famished had yet some difficulty to reconcile himself to the thoughts of feeding at a strangers cost and was endeavouring to subdue his inward pride by the reflection that in such slight obligations the acceptor performed as complaisant a part as he by whom the courtesy was offered  in the meanwhile they descended a narrow lane overshadowed by tall elms at the bottom of which a gateway admitted them into the courtyard of an inn of unusual magnitude calculated for the accommodation of the nobles and suitors who had business at the neighbouring castle where very seldom and only when such hospitality was altogether unavoidable did louis xi permit any of his court to have apartments a scutcheon bearing the fleur de lys hung over the principal door of the large irregular building but there was about the yard and the offices little or none of the bustle which in those days when attendants were maintained both in public and in private houses marked that business was alive and custom plenty it seemed as if the stern and unsocial character of the royal mansion in the neighbourhood had communicated a portion of its solemn and terrific gloom even to a place designed according to universal custom elsewhere for the temple of social indulgence merry society and good cheer  maitre pierre without calling any one and even without approaching the principal entrance lifted the latch of a side door and led the way into a large room where a faggot was blazing on the hearth and arrangements made for a substantial breakfast  my gossip has been careful said the frenchman to the scot you must be cold and i have commanded a fire you must be hungry and you shall have breakfast presently  he whistled and the landlord enteredanswered maitre pierres bon jour with a reverencebut in no respect showed any part of the prating humour properly belonging to a french publican of all ages  i expected a gentleman said maitre pierre to order breakfasthath he done so  in answer the landlord only bowed and while he continued to bring and arrange upon the table the various articles of a comfortable meal omitted to extol their merits by a single word and yet the breakfast merited such eulogiums as french hosts are wont to confer upon their regales as the reader will be informed in the next chapter    chapter iv the dejeuner       sacred heaven what masticators what bread       yoricks travels   we left our young stranger in france situated more comfortably than he had found himself since entering the territories of the ancient gauls the breakfast as we hinted in the conclusion of the last chapter was admirable there was a pate de perigord over which a gastronome would have wished to live and die like homers lotus eaters see the odyssey chap ix where odysseus arrives at the land of the lotus eaters whosoever of them ate the lotuss honeyed fruit resolved to bring tidings back no more and never to leave the place but with the lotus eaters there desired to stay to feed on lotus and forget his going home palmers translation forgetful of kin native country and all social obligations whatever its vast walls of magnificent crust seemed raised like the bulwarks of some rich metropolitan city an emblem of the wealth which they are designed to protect there was a delicate ragout with just that petit point de lail a little flavor of garlic the french is ungrammatical which gascons love and scottishmen do not hate there was besides a delicate ham which had once supported a noble wild boar in the neighbouring wood of mountrichart there was the most exquisite white bread made into little round loaves called boules whence the bakers took their french name of boulangers of which the crust was so inviting that even with water alone it would have been a delicacy but the water was not alone for there was a flask of leather called bottrine which contained about a quart of exquisite vin de beaulne so many good things might have created appetite under the ribs of death what effect then must they have produced upon a youngster of scarce twenty who for the truth must be told had eaten little for the two last days save the scarcely ripe fruit which chance afforded him an opportunity of plucking and a very moderate portion of barley bread he threw himself upon the ragout and the plate was presently vacanthe attacked the mighty pasty marched deep into the bowels of the land and seasoning his enormous meal with an occasional cup of wine returned to the charge again and again to the astonishment of mine host and the amusement of maitre pierre  the latter indeed probably because he found himself the author of a kinder action than he had thought of seemed delighted with the appetite of the young scot and when at length he observed that his exertions began to languish endeavoured to stimulate him to new efforts by ordering confections darioles cream cakes and any other light dainties he could think of to entice the youth to continue his meal while thus engaged maitre pierres countenance expressed a kind of good humour almost amounting to benevolence which appeared remote from its ordinary sharp caustic and severe character the aged almost always sympathize with the enjoyments of youth and with its exertions of every kind when the mind of the spectator rests on its natural poise and is not disturbed by inward envy or idle emulation  quentin durward also while thus agreeably employed could do no otherwise than discover that the countenance of his entertainer which he had at first found so unprepossessing mended when it was seen under the influence of the vin de beaulne and there was kindness in the tone with which he reproached maitre pierre that he amused himself with laughing at his appetite without eating anything himself  i am doing penance said maitre pierre and may not eat anything before noon save some comfiture and a cup of waterbid yonder lady he added turning to the innkeeper bring them hither to me  the innkeeper left the room and maitre pierre proceeded well have i kept faith with you concerning the breakfast i promised you  the best meal i have eaten said the youth since i left glen houlakin  glenwhat demanded maitre pierre are you going to raise the devil that you use such long tailed words  glen houlakin answered quentin good humouredly which is to say the glen of the midges is the name of our ancient patrimony my good sir you have bought the right to laugh at the sound if you please  i have not the least intention to offend said the old man but i was about to say since you like your present meal so well that the scottish archers of the guard eat as good a one or a better every day  no wonder said durward for if they be shut up in the swallows nests all night they must needs have a curious appetite in the morning  and plenty to gratify it upon said maitre pierre they need not like the burgundians choose a bare back that they may have a full bellythey dress like counts and feast like abbots  it is well for them said durward  and wherefore will you not take service here young man your uncle might i dare say have you placed on the file when there should a vacancy occur and hark in your ear i myself have some little interest and might be of some use to you you can ride i presume as well as draw the bow  our race are as good horsemen as ever put a plated shoe into a steel stirrup and i know not but i might accept of your kind offer yet look you food and raiment are needful things but in my case men think of honour and advancement and brave deeds of arms your king louisgod bless him for he is a friend and ally of scotlandbut he lies here in this castle or only rides about from one fortified town to another and gains cities and provinces by politic embassies and not in fair fighting now for me i am of the douglases mind who always kept the fields because they loved better to hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak  young man said maitre pierre do not judge too rashly of the actions of sovereigns louis seeks to spare the blood of his subjects and cares not for his own he showed himself a man of courage at montlhery  ay but that was some dozen years ago or more answered the youthi should like to follow a master that would keep his honour as bright as his shield and always venture foremost in the very throng of the battle  why did you not tarry at brussels then with the duke of burgundy he would put you in the way to have your bones broken every day and rather than fail would do the job for you himselfespecially if he heard that you had beaten his forester  very true said quentin my unhappy chance has shut that door against me  nay there are plenty of daredevils abroad with whom mad youngsters may find service said his adviser what think you for example of william de la marck  what exclaimed durward serve him with the beardserve the wild boar of ardennesa captain of pillagers and murderers who would take a mans life for the value of his gaberdine and who slays priests and pilgrims as if they were so many lance knights and men at arms it would be a blot on my fathers scutcheon for ever  well my young hot blood replied maitre pierre if you hold the sanglier wild boar too unscrupulous wherefore not follow the young duke of gueldres  adolphus son of arnold and of catherine de bourbon he made war against his father in which unnatural strife he made the old man prisoner and used him with the most brutal violence proceeding it is said even to the length of striking him with his hand arnold in resentment of this usage disinherited the unprincipled wretch and sold to charles of burgundy whatever rights he had over the duchy of gueldres and earldom of zutphen s  follow the foul fiend as soon said quentin hark in your earhe is a burden too heavy for earth to carryhell gapes for him men say that he keeps his own father imprisoned and that he has even struck himcan you believe it  maitre pierre seemed somewhat disconcerted with the naive horror with which the young scotsman spoke of filial ingratitude and he answered you know not young man how short a while the relations of blood subsist amongst those of elevated rank then changed the tone of feeling in which he had begun to speak and added gaily besides if the duke has beaten his father i warrant you his father hath beaten him of old so it is but a clearing of scores  i marvel to hear you speak thus said the scot colouring with indignation gray hairs such as yours ought to have fitter subjects for jesting if the old duke did beat his son in childhood he beat him not enough for better he had died under the rod than have lived to make the christian world ashamed that such a monster had ever been baptized  at this rate said maitre pierre as you weigh the characters of each prince and leader i think you had better become a captain yourself for where will one so wise find a chieftain fit to command him  you laugh at me maitre pierre said the youth good humouredly and perhaps you are right but you have not named a man who is a gallant leader and keeps a brave party up here under whom a man might seek service well enough  i cannot guess whom you mean  why he that hangs like mahomets coffin there is a tradition that mahomets coffin is suspended in mid air without any support the most generally accepted explanation being that the coffin is of iron and is placed between two magnets a curse be upon mahomet between the two loadstoneshe that no man can call either french or burgundian but who knows to hold the balance between them both and makes both of them fear and serve him for as great princes as they be  i cannot guess whom you mean said maitre pierre thoughtfully  why whom should i mean but the noble louis de luxembourg count of saint paul the high constable of france yonder he makes his place good with his gallant little army holding his head as high as either king louis or duke charles and balancing between them like the boy who stands on the midst of a plank while two others are swinging on the opposite ends  this part of louis xis reign was much embarrassed by the intrigues of the constable saint paul who affected independence and carried on intrigues with england france and burgundy at the same time according to the usual fate of such variable politicians the constable ended by drawing upon himself the animosity of all the powerful neighbours whom he had in their turn amused and deceived he was delivered up by the duke of burgundy to the king of france tried and hastily executed for treason a d 1475 s  he is in danger of the worst fall of the three said maitre pierre and hark ye my young friend you who hold pillaging such a crime do you know that your politic count of saint paul was the first who set the example of burning the country during the time of war and that before the shameful devastation which he committed open towns and villages which made no resistance were spared on all sides  nay faith said durward if that be the case i shall begin to think no one of these great men is much better than another and that a choice among them is but like choosing a tree to be hung upon but this count de saint paul this constable hath possessed himself by clean conveyance of the town which takes its name from my honoured saint and patron saint quentin it was by his possession of this town of saint quentin that the constable was able to carry on those political intrigues which finally cost him so dear s here he crossed himself and methinks were i dwelling there my holy patron would keep some look out for mehe has not so many named after him as your more popular saintsand yet he must have forgotten me poor quentin durward his spiritual godson since he lets me go one day without food and leaves me the next morning to the harbourage of saint julian and the chance courtesy of a stranger purchased by a ducking in the renowned river cher or one of its tributaries  blaspheme not the saints my young friend said maitre pierre saint julian is the faithful patron of travellers and peradventure the blessed saint quentin hath done more and better for thee than thou art aware of  as he spoke the door opened and a girl rather above than under fifteen years old entered with a platter covered with damask on which was placed a small saucer of the dried plums which have always added to the reputation of tours and a cup of the curiously chased plate which the goldsmiths of that city were anciently famous for executing with a delicacy of workmanship that distinguished them from the other cities of france and even excelled the skill of the metropolis the form of the goblet was so elegant that durward thought not of observing closely whether the material was of silver or like what had been placed before himself of a baser metal but so well burnished as to resemble the richer ore  but the sight of the young person by whom this service was executed attracted durwards attention far more than the petty minutiae of the duty which she performed  he speedily made the discovery that a quantity of long black tresses which in the maiden fashion of his own country were unadorned by any ornament except a single chaplet lightly woven out of ivy leaves formed a veil around a countenance which in its regular features dark eyes and pensive expression resembled that of melpomene the muse of tragedy though there was a faint glow on the cheek and an intelligence on the lips and in the eye which made it seem that gaiety was not foreign to a countenance so expressive although it might not be its most habitual expression quentin even thought he could discern that depressing circumstances were the cause why a countenance so young and so lovely was graver than belongs to early beauty and as the romantic imagination of youth is rapid in drawing conclusions from slight premises he was pleased to infer from what follows that the fate of this beautiful vision was wrapped in silence and mystery  how now jacqueline said maitre pierre when she entered the apartment wherefore this did i not desire that dame perette should bring what i wantedpasques dieuis she or does she think herself too good to serve me  my kinswoman is ill at ease answered jacqueline in a hurried yet a humble toneill at ease and keeps her chamber  she keeps it alone i hope replied maitre pierre with some emphasis i am vieux routier one who is experienced in the ways of the world and none of those upon whom feigned disorders pass for apologies  jacqueline turned pale and even tottered at the answer of maitre pierre for it must be owned that his voice and looks at all times harsh caustic and unpleasing had when he expressed anger or suspicion an effect both sinister and alarming  the mountain chivalry of quentin durward was instantly awakened and he hastened to approach jacqueline and relieve her of the burden she bore and which she passively resigned to him while with a timid and anxious look she watched the countenance of the angry burgess it was not in nature to resist the piercing and pity craving expression of her looks and maitre pierre proceeded not merely with an air of diminished displeasure but with as much gentleness as he could assume in countenance and manner i blame not thee jacqueline and thou art too young to be what it is pity to think thou must be one daya false and treacherous thing like the rest of thy giddy sex no man ever lived to mans estate but he had the opportunity to know you all he louis entertained great contempt for the understanding and not less for the character of the fair sex s here is a scottish cavalier will tell you the same  jacqueline looked for an instant on the young stranger as if to obey maitre pierre but the glance momentary as it was appeared to durward a pathetic appeal to him for support and sympathy and with the promptitude dictated by the feelings of youth and the romantic veneration for the female sex inspired by his education he answered hastily that he would throw down his gage to any antagonist of equal rank and equal age who should presume to say such a countenance as that which he now looked upon could be animated by other than the purest and the truest mind  the young woman grew deadly pale and cast an apprehensive glance upon maitre pierre in whom the bravado of the young gallant seemed only to excite laughter more scornful than applausive quentin whose second thoughts generally corrected the first though sometimes after they had found utterance blushed deeply at having uttered what might be construed into an empty boast in presence of an old man of a peaceful profession and as a sort of just and appropriate penance resolved patiently to submit to the ridicule which he had incurred he offered the cup and trencher to maitre pierre with a blush in his cheek and a humiliation of countenance which endeavoured to disguise itself under an embarrassed smile  you are a foolish young man said maitre pierre and know as little of women as of princeswhose hearts he said crossing himself devoutly god keeps in his right hand  and who keeps those of the women then said quentin resolved if he could help it not to be borne down by the assumed superiority of this extraordinary old man whose lofty and careless manner possessed an influence over him of which he felt ashamed  i am afraid you must ask of them in another quarter said maitre pierre composedly  quentin was again rebuffed but not utterly disconcerted surely he said to himself i do not pay this same burgess of tours all the deference which i yield him on account of the miserable obligation of a breakfast though it was a right good and substantial meal dogs and hawks are attached by feeding onlyman must have kindness if you would bind him with the cords of affection and obligation but he is an extraordinary person and that beautiful emanation that is even now vanishingsurely a thing so fair belongs not to this mean place belongs not even to the money gathering merchant himself though he seems to exert authority over her as doubtless he does over all whom chance brings within his little circle it is wonderful what ideas of consequence these flemings and frenchmen attach to wealthso much more than wealth deserves that i suppose this old merchant thinks the civility i pay to his age is given to his money i a scottish gentleman of blood and coat armour and he a mechanic of tours  such were the thoughts which hastily traversed the mind of young durward while maitre pierre said with a smile and at the same time patting jacquelines heed from which hung down her long tresses this young man will serve me jacqueline thou mayst withdraw i will tell thy negligent kinswoman she does ill to expose thee to be gazed on unnecessarily  it was only to wait on you said the maiden i trust you will not be displeased with my kinswoman since  pasques dieu said the merchant interrupting her but not harshly do you bandy words with me you brat or stay you to gaze upon the youngster herebegonehe is noble and his services will suffice me  jacqueline vanished and so much was quentin durward interested in her sudden disappearance that it broke his previous thread of reflection and he complied mechanically when maitre pierre said in the tone of one accustomed to be obeyed as he threw himself carelessly upon a large easy chair place that tray beside me  the merchant then let his dark eyebrows sink over his keen eyes so that the last became scarce visible or but shot forth occasionally a quick and vivid ray like those of the sun setting behind a dark cloud through which its beams are occasionally darted but singly and for an instant  that is a beautiful creature said the old man at last raising his head and looking steadily and firmly at quentin when he put the questiona lovely girl to be the servant of an auberge an inn she might grace the board of an honest burgess but tis a vile education a base origin  it sometimes happens that a chance shot will demolish a noble castle in the air and the architect on such occasions entertains little goodwill towards him who fires it although the damage on the offenders part may be wholly unintentional quentin was disconcerted and was disposed to be angryhe himself knew not whywith this old man for acquainting him that this beautiful creature was neither more nor less than what her occupation announced the servant of the aubergean upper servant indeed and probably a niece of the landlord or such like but still a domestic and obliged to comply with the humour of the customers and particularly of maitre pierre who probably had sufficiency of whims and was rich enough to ensure their being attended to  the thought the lingering thought again returned on him that he ought to make the old gentleman understand the difference betwixt their conditions and call on him to mark that how rich soever he might be his wealth put him on no level with a durward of glen houlakin yet whenever he looked on maitre pierres countenance with such a purpose there was notwithstanding the downcast look pinched features and mean and miserly dress something which prevented the young man from asserting the superiority over the merchant which he conceived himself to possess on the contrary the oftener and more fixedly quentin looked at him the stronger became his curiosity to know who or what this man actually was and he set him down internally for at least a syndic or high magistrate of tours or one who was in some way or other in the full habit of exacting and receiving deference meantime the merchant seemed again sunk into a reverie from which he raised himself only to make the sign of the cross devoutly and to eat some of the dried fruit with a morsel of biscuit he then signed to quentin to give him the cup adding however by way of question as he presented it you are noble you say  i surely am replied the scot if fifteen descents can make me soso i told you before but do not constrain yourself on that account maitre pierrei have always been taught it is the duty of the young to assist the more aged  an excellent maxim said the merchant availing himself of the youths assistance in handing the cup and filling it from a ewer which seemed of the same materials with the goblet without any of those scruples in point of propriety which perhaps quentin had expected to excite  the devil take the ease and familiarity of this old mechanical burgher said durward once more to himself he uses the attendance of a noble scottish gentleman with as little ceremony as i would that of a gillie from glen isla  the merchant in the meanwhile having finished his cup of water said to his companion from the zeal with which you seem to relish the vin de beaulne i fancy you would not care much to pledge me in this elemental liquor but i have an elixir about me which can convert even the rock water into the richest wines of france  as he spoke he took a large purse from his bosom made of the fur of the sea otter and streamed a shower of small silver pieces into the goblet until the cup which was but a small one was more than half full  you have reason to be more thankful young man said maitre pierre both to your patron saint quentin and to saint julian than you seemed to be but now i would advise you to bestow alms in their name remain in this hostelry until you see your kinsman le balafre who will be relieved from guard in the afternoon i will cause him to be acquainted that he may find you here for i have business in the castle  quentin durward would have said something to have excused himself from accepting the profuse liberality of his new friend but maitre pierre bending his dark brows and erecting his stooping figure into an attitude of more dignity than he had yet seen him assume said in a tone of authority no reply young man but do what you are commanded  with these words he left the apartment making a sign as he departed that quentin must not follow him  the young scotsman stood astounded and knew not what to think of the matter his first most natural though perhaps not most dignified impulse drove him to peer into the silver goblet which assuredly was more than half full of silver pieces to the number of several scores of which perhaps quentin had never called twenty his own at one time during the course of his whole life but could he reconcile it to his dignity as a gentleman to accept the money of this wealthy plebeianthis was a trying question for though he had secured a good breakfast it was no great reserve upon which to travel either back to dijon in case he chose to hazard the wrath and enter the service of the duke of burgundy or to saint quentin if he fixed on that of the constable saint paul for to one of those powers if not to the king of france he was determined to offer his services he perhaps took the wisest resolution in the circumstances in resolving to be guided by the advice of his uncle and in the meantime he put the money into his velvet hawking pouch and called for the landlord of the house in order to restore the silver cupresolving at the same time to ask him some questions about this liberal and authoritative merchant  the man of the house appeared presently and if not more communicative was at least more loquacious than he had been formerly he positively declined to take back the silver cup it was none of his he said but maitre pierres who had bestowed it on his guest he had indeed four silver hanaps of his own which had been left him by his grandmother of happy memory but no more like the beautiful carving of that in his guests hand than a peach was like a turnipthat was one of the famous cups of tours wrought by martin dominique an artist who might brag all paris  and pray who is this maitre pierre said durward interrupting him who confers such valuable gifts on strangers  who is maitre pierre said the host dropping the words as slowly from his mouth as if he had been distilling them  ay said durward hastily and peremptorily who is this maitre pierre and why does he throw about his bounties in this fashion and who is the butcherly looking fellow whom he sent forward to order breakfast  why fair sir as to who maitre pierre is you should have asked the question of himself and for the gentleman who ordered breakfast to be made ready may god keep us from his closer acquaintance  there is something mysterious in all this said the young scot this maitre pierre tells me he is a merchant  and if he told you so said the innkeeper surely he is a merchant  what commodities does he deal in  oh many a fair matter of traffic said the host and especially he has set up silk manufactories here which match those rich bales that the venetians bring from india and cathay you might see the rows of mulberry trees as you came hither all planted by maitre pierres command to feed the silk worms  and that young person who brought in the confections who is she my good friend said the guest  my lodger sir with her guardian some sort of aunt or kinswoman as i think replied the innkeeper  and do you usually employ your guests in waiting on each other said durward for i observed that maitre pierre would take nothing from your hand or that of your attendant  rich men may have their fancies for they can pay for them said the landlord this is not the first time maitre pierre has found the true way to make gentlefolks serve at his beck  the young scotsman felt somewhat offended at the insinuation but disguising his resentment he asked whether he could be accommodated with an apartment at this place for a day and perhaps longer  certainly the innkeeper replied for whatever time he was pleased to command it  could he be permitted he asked to pay his respects to the ladies whose fellow lodger he was about to become  the innkeeper was uncertain they went not abroad he said and received no one at home  with the exception i presume of maitre pierre said durward  i am not at liberty to name any exceptions answered the man firmly but respectfully  quentin who carried the notions of his own importance pretty high considering how destitute he was of means to support them being somewhat mortified by the innkeepers reply did not hesitate to avail himself of a practice common enough in that age carry to the ladies he said a flask of vernat with my humble duty and say that quentin durward of the house of glen houlakin a scottish cavalier of honour and now their fellow lodger desires the permission to dedicate his homage to them in a personal interview  the messenger departed and returned almost instantly with the thanks of the ladies who declined the proffered refreshment and with their acknowledgments to the scottish cavalier regretted that residing there in privacy they could not receive his visit  quentin bit his lip took a cup of the rejected vernat which the host had placed on the table by the mass but this is a strange country said he to himself where merchants and mechanics exercise the manners and munificence of nobles and little travelling damsels who hold their court in a cabaret a public house keep their state like disguised princesses i will see that black browed maiden again or it will go hard however and having formed this prudent resolution he demanded to be conducted to the apartment which he was to call his own  the landlord presently ushered him up a turret staircase and from thence along a gallery with many doors opening from it like those of cells in a convent a resemblance which our young hero who recollected with much ennui an early specimen of a monastic life was far from admiring the host paused at the very end of the gallery selected a key from the large bunch which he carried at his girdle opened the door and showed his guest the interior of a turret chamber small indeed but which being clean and solitary and having the pallet bed and the few articles of furniture in unusually good order seemed on the whole a little palace  i hope you will find your dwelling agreeable here fair sir said the landlord i am bound to pleasure every friend of maitre pierre  oh happy ducking exclaimed quentin durward cutting a caper on the floor so soon as his host had retired never came good luck in a better or a wetter form i have been fairly deluged by my good fortune  as he spoke thus he stepped towards the little window which as the turret projected considerably from the principal line of the building not only commanded a very pretty garden of some extent belonging to the inn but overlooked beyond its boundary a pleasant grove of those very mulberry trees which maitre pierre was said to have planted for the support of the silk worm besides turning the eye from these more remote objects and looking straight along the wall the turret of quentin was opposite to another turret and the little window at which he stood commanded a similar little window in a corresponding projection of the building now it would be difficult for a man twenty years older than quentin to say why this locality interested him more than either the pleasant garden or the grove of mulberry trees for alas eyes which have been used for forty years and upwards look with indifference on little turret windows though the lattice be half open to admit the air while the shutter is half closed to exclude the sun or perhaps a too curious eyenay even though there hang on the one side of the casement a lute partly mantled by a light veil of sea green silk but at durwards happy age such accidents as a painter would call them form sufficient foundation for a hundred airy visions and mysterious conjectures at recollection of which the full grown man smiles while he sighs and sighs while he smiles  as it may be supposed that our friend quentin wished to learn a little more of his fair neighbour the owner of the lute and veilas it may be supposed he was at least interested to know whether she might not prove the same whom he had seen in humble attendance on maitre pierre it must of course be understood that he did not produce a broad staring visage and person in full front of his own casement durward knew better the art of bird catching and it was to his keeping his person skilfully withdrawn on one side of his window while he peeped through the lattice that he owed the pleasure of seeing a white round beautiful arm take down the instrument and that his ears had presently after their share in the reward of his dexterous management  the maid of the little turret of the veil and of the lute sang exactly such an air as we are accustomed to suppose flowed from the lips of the high born dames of chivalry when knights and troubadours listened and languished the words had neither so much sense wit or fancy as to withdraw the attention from the music nor the music so much of art as to drown all feeling of the words the one seemed fitted to the other and if the song had been recited without the notes or the air played without the words neither would have been worth noting it is therefore scarcely fair to put upon record lines intended not to be said or read but only to be sung but such scraps of old poetry have always had a sort of fascination for us and as the tune is lost for ever unless bishop sir henry rowley an english composer and professor of music at oxford in 1848 among his most popular operas are guy mannering and the kniqht of snowdon happens to find the notes or some lark teaches stephens catherine 17941882 a vocalist and actress who created susanna in the marriage of figaro and various parts in adaptation of scott to warble the airwe will risk our credit and the taste of the lady of the lute by preserving the verses simple and even rude as they are        ah county guy the hour is nigh      the sun has left the lea      the orange flower perfumes the bower      the breeze is on the sea      the lark his lay who thrilld all day      sits hushd his partner nigh      breeze bird and flower confess the hour      but where is county guy       the village maid steals through the shade      her shepherds suit to hear      to beauty shy by lattice high      sings high born cavalier      the star of love all stars above      now reigns oer earth and sky      and high and low the influence know      but where is county guy   whatever the reader may think of this simple ditty it had a powerful effect on quentin when married to heavenly airs and sung by a sweet and melting voice the notes mingling with the gentle breezes which wafted perfumes from the garden and the figure of the songstress being so partially and obscurely visible as threw a veil of mysterious fascination over the whole  at the close of the air the listener could not help showing himself more boldly than he had yet done in a rash attempt to see more than he had yet been able to discover the music instantly ceasedthe casement was closed and a dark curtain dropped on the inside put a stop to all farther observation on the part of the neighbour in the next turret  durward was mortified and surprised at the consequence of his precipitance but comforted himself with the hope that the lady of the lute could neither easily forego the practice of an instrument which seemed so familiar to her nor cruelly resolve to renounce the pleasures of fresh air and an open window for the churlish purpose of preserving for her own exclusive ear the sweet sounds which she created there came perhaps a little feeling of personal vanity to mingle with these consolatory reflections if as he shrewdly suspected there was a beautiful dark tressed damsel inhabitant of the one turret he could not but be conscious that a handsome young roving bright locked gallant a cavalier of fortune was the tenant of the other and romances those prudent instructors had taught his youth that if damsels were shy they were yet neither void of interest nor of curiosity in their neighbours affairs  whilst quentin was engaged in these sage reflections a sort of attendant or chamberlain of the inn informed him that a cavalier desired to speak with him below    chapter v the man at arms       full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard      seeking the bubble reputation      even in the cannons mouth       as you like it   the cavalier who awaited quentin durwards descent into the apartment where he had breakfasted was one of those of whom louis xi had long since said that they held in their hands the fortune of france as to them were intrusted the direct custody and protection of the royal person  charles the sixth had instituted this celebrated body the archers as they were called of the scottish bodyguard with better reason than can generally be alleged for establishing round the throne a guard of foreign and mercenary troops the divisions which tore from his side more than half of france together with the wavering and uncertain faith of the nobility who yet acknowledged his cause rendered it impolitic and unsafe to commit his personal safety to their keeping the scottish nation was the hereditary enemy of the english and the ancient and as it seemed the natural allies of france they were poor courageous faithful their ranks were sure to be supplied from the superabundant population of their own country than which none in europe sent forth more or bolder adventurers their high claims of descent too gave them a good title to approach the person of a monarch more closely than other troops while the comparative smallness of their numbers prevented the possibility of their mutinying and becoming masters where they ought to be servants  on the other hand the french monarchs made it their policy to conciliate the affections of this select band of foreigners by allowing them honorary privileges and ample pay which last most of them disposed of with military profusion in supporting their supposed rank each of them ranked as a gentleman in place and honour and their near approach to the kings person gave them dignity in their own eyes as well as importance in those of the nation of france they were sumptuously armed equipped and mounted and each was entitled to allowance for a squire a valet a page and two yeomen one of whom was termed coutelier from the large knife which he wore to dispatch those whom in the melee his master had thrown to the ground with these followers and a corresponding equipage an archer of the scottish guard was a person of quality and importance and vacancies being generally filled up by those who had been trained in the service as pages or valets the cadets of the best scottish families were often sent to serve under some friend and relation in those capacities until a chance of preferment should occur  the coutelier and his companion not being noble or capable of this promotion were recruited from persons of inferior quality but as their pay and appointments were excellent their masters were easily able to select from among their wandering countrymen the strongest and most courageous to wait upon them in these capacities  ludovic lesly or as we shall more frequently call him le balafre by which name he was generally known in france was upwards of six feet high robust strongly compacted in person and hard favoured in countenance which latter attribute was much increased by a large and ghastly scar which beginning on his forehead and narrowly missing his right eye had laid bare the cheek bone and descended from thence almost to the tip of his ear exhibiting a deep seam which was sometimes scarlet sometimes purple sometimes blue and sometimes approaching to black but always hideous because at variance with the complexion of the face in whatever state it chanced to be whether agitated or still flushed with unusual passion or in its ordinary state of weatherbeaten and sunburnt swarthiness  his dress and arms were splendid he wore his national bonnet crested with a tuft of feathers and with a virgin mary of massive silver for a brooch these brooches had been presented to the scottish guard in consequence of the king in one of his fits of superstitions piety having devoted the swords of his guard to the service of the holy virgin and as some say carried the matter so far as to draw out a commission to our lady as their captain general the archers gorget arm pieces and gauntlets were of the finest steel curiously inlaid with silver and his hauberk or shirt of mail was as clear and bright as the frostwork of a winter morning upon fern or brier he wore a loose surcoat or cassock of rich blue velvet open at the sides like that of a herald with a large white st andrews cross of embroidered silver bisecting it both before and behind his knees and legs were protected by hose of mail and shoes of steel a broad strong poniard called the mercy of god hung by his right side the baldric for his two handed sword richly embroidered hung upon his left shoulder but for convenience he at present carried in his hand that unwieldy weapon which the rules of his service forbade him to lay aside  st andrew was the first called to apostleship he made many converts to christianity and was finally crucified on a cross of peculiar form which has since been called the st andrews cross certain of his relics were brought to scotland in the fourth century and he has since that time been honoured as the patron saint of that country he is also the patron saint of the burgundian order the golden fleece  quentin durwardthough like the scottish youth of the period he had been early taught to look upon arms and warthought he had never seen a more martial looking or more completely equipped and accomplished man at arms than now saluted him in the person of his mothers brother called ludovic with the scar or le balafre yet he could not but shrink a little from the grim expression of his countenance while with its rough moustaches he brushed first the one and then the other cheek of his kinsman welcomed his nephew to france and in the same breath asked what news from scotland  little good tidings dear uncle replied young durward but i am glad that you know me so readily  i would have known thee boy in the landes of bourdeaux had i met thee marching there like a crane on a pair of stilts the crutches or stilts which in scotland are used to pass rivers they are employed by the peasantry of the country near bordeaux to traverse those deserts of loose sand called landes s but sit thee downsit thee downif there is sorrow to hear of we will have wine to make us bear itho old pinch measure our good host bring us of thy best and that in an instant  the well known sound of the scottish french was as familiar in the taverns near plessis as that of the swiss french in the modern guinguettes common inns of paris and promptlyay with the promptitude of fear and precipitation was it heard and obeyed a flagon of champagne stood before them of which the elder took a draught while the nephew helped himself only to a moderate sip to acknowledge his uncles courtesy saying in excuse that he had already drunk wine that morning  that had been a rare good apology in the mouth of thy sister fair nephew said le balafre you must fear the wine pot less if you would wear beard on your face and write yourself soldier but comecomeunbuckle your scottish mail baggive us the news of glen houlakinhow doth my sister  dead fair uncle answered quentin sorrowfully  dead echoed his uncle with a tone rather marked by wonder than sympathywhy she was five years younger than i and i was never better in my life dead the thing is impossible i have never had so much as a headache unless after revelling out of my two or three days furlough with the brethren of the joyous scienceand my poor sister is deadand your father fair nephew hath he married again  and ere the youth could reply he read the answer in his surprise at the question and said what noi would have sworn that allan durward was no man to live without a wife he loved to have his house in orderloved to look on a pretty woman too and was somewhat strict in life withalmatrimony did all this for him now i care little about these comforts and i can look on a pretty woman without thinking on the sacrament of wedlocki am scarce holy enough for that  alas dear uncle my mother was left a widow a year since when glen houlakin was harried by the ogilvies my father and my two uncles and my two elder brothers and seven of my kinsmen and the harper and the tasker and some six more of our people were killed in defending the castle and there is not a burning hearth or a standing stone in all glen houlakin  cross of saint andrew said le balafre that is what i call an onslaught ay these ogilvies were ever but sorry neighbours to glen houlakinan evil chance it was but fate of warfate of warwhen did this mishap befall fair nephew with that he took a deep draught of wine and shook his head with much solemnity when his kinsman replied that his family had been destroyed upon the festival of saint jude october 28 last bypast  look ye there said the soldier i said it was all chanceon that very day i and twenty of my comrades carried the castle of roche noir by storm from amaury bras de fer a captain of free lances whom you must have heard of i killed him on his own threshold and gained as much gold as made this fair chain which was once twice as long as it now isand that minds me to send part of it on an holy errandhere andrewandrew  andrew his yeoman entered dressed like the archer himself in the general equipment but without the armour for the limbsthat of the body more coarsely manufacturedhis cap without a plume and his cassock made of serge or ordinary cloth instead of rich velvet untwining his gold chain from his neck balafre twisted off with his firm and strong set teeth about four inches from the one end of it and said to his attendant here andrew carry this to my gossip jolly father boniface the monk of st martins greet him well from me by the same token that he could not say god save ye when we last parted at midnighttell my gossip that my brother and sister and some others of my house are all dead and gone and i pray him to say masses for their souls as far as the value of these links will carry him and to do on trust what else may be necessary to free them from purgatory and hark ye as they were just living people and free from all heresy it may be that they are well nigh out of limbo already so that a little matter may have them free of the fetlocks and in that case look ye ye will say i desire to take out the balance of the gold in curses upon a generation called the ogilvies of angus shire in what way soever the church may best come at them you understand all this andrew  the coutelier nodded  then look that none of the links find their way to the wine house ere the monk touches them for if it so chance thou shalt taste of saddle girth and stirrup leather till thou art as raw as saint bartholomew he was flayed alive in michael angelos last judgment he is represented as holding his skin in his handyet hold i see thy eye has fixed on the wine measure and thou shalt not go without tasting  so saying he filled him a brimful cup which the coutelier drank off and retired to do his patrons commission  and now fair nephew let us hear what was your own fortune in this unhappy matter  i fought it out among those who were older and stouter than i was till we were all brought down said durward and i received a cruel wound  not a worse slash than i received ten years since myself said le balafre look at this now my fair nephew tracing the dark crimson gash which was imprinted on his facean ogilvys sword never ploughed so deep a furrow  they ploughed deep enough answered quentin sadly but they were tired at last and my mothers entreaties procured mercy for me when i was found to retain some spark of life but although a learned monk of aberbrothik who chanced to be our guest at the fatal time and narrowly escaped being killed in the fray was permitted to bind my wounds and finally to remove me to a place of safety it was only on promise given both by my mother and him that i should become a monk  a monk exclaimed the uncle holy saint andrew that is what never befell me no one from my childhood upwards ever so much as dreamed of making me a monk and yet i wonder when i think of it for you will allow that bating the reading and writing which i could never learn and the psalmody which i could never endure and the dress which is that of a mad beggarour lady forgive me here he crossed himself and their fasts which do not suit my appetite i would have made every whit as good a monk as my little gossip at st martins yonder but i know not why none ever proposed the station to meoh so fair nephew you were to be a monk thenand wherefore i pray you  that my fathers house might be ended either in the cloister or in the tomb answered quentin with deep feeling  i see answered his unclei comprehend cunning roguesvery cunning they might have been cheated though for look ye fair nephew i myself remember the canon robersart who had taken the vows and afterwards broke out of cloister and became a captain of free companions he had a mistress the prettiest wench i ever saw and three as beautiful childrenthere is no trusting monks fair nephewno trusting themthey may become soldiers and fathers when you least expect itbut on with your tale  i have little more to tell said durward except that considering my poor mother to be in some degree a pledge for me i was induced to take upon me the dress of a novice and conformed to the cloister rules and even learned to read and write  to read and write exclaimed le balafre who was one of that sort of people who think all knowledge is miraculous which chances to exceed their own to write sayst thou and to read i cannot believe itnever durward could write his name that ever i heard of nor lesly either i can answer for one of themi can no more write than i can fly now in saint louiss name how did they teach it you  it was troublesome at first said durward but became more easy by use and i was weak with my wounds and loss of blood and desirous to gratify my preserver father peter and so i was the more easily kept to my task but after several months languishing my good kind mother died and as my health was now fully restored i communicated to my benefactor who was also sub prior of the convent my reluctance to take the vows and it was agreed between us since my vocation lay not to the cloister that i should be sent out into the world to seek my fortune and that to save the sub prior from the anger of the ogilvies my departure should have the appearance of flight and to colour it i brought off the abbots hawk with me but i was regularly dismissed as will appear from the hand and seal of the abbot himself  that is right that is well said his uncle our king cares little what other theft thou mayst have made but hath a horror at anything like a breach of the cloister and i warrant thee thou hadst no great treasure to bear thy charges  only a few pieces of silver said the youth for to you fair uncle i must make a free confession  alas replied le balafre that is hard now though i am never a hoarder of my pay because it doth ill to bear a charge about one in these perilous times yet i always have and i would advise you to follow my example some odd gold chain or bracelet or carcanet that serves for the ornament of my person and can at need spare a superfluous link or two or it may be a superfluous stone for sale that can answer any immediate purpose but you may ask fair kinsman how you are to come by such toys as this he shook his chain with complacent triumph they hang not on every bushthey grow not in the fields like the daffodils with whose stalks children make knights collars what thenyou may get such where i got this in the service of the good king of france where there is always wealth to be found if a man has but the heart to seek it at the risk of a little life or so  i understood said quentin evading a decision to which he felt himself as yet scarcely competent that the duke of burgundy keeps a more noble state than the king of france and that there is more honour to be won under his bannersthat good blows are struck there and deeds of arms done while the most christian king they say gains his victories by his ambassadors tongues  you speak like a foolish boy fair nephew answered he with the scar and yet i bethink me when i came hither i was nearly as simple i could never think of a king but what i supposed him either sitting under the high deas and feasting amid his high vassals and paladins eating blanc mange with a great gold crown upon his head or else charging at the head of his troops like charlemagne in the romaunts or like robert bruce or william wallace in our own true histories such as barbour and the minstrel hark in thine ear manit is all moonshine in the water policypolicy does it all but what is policy you will say it is an art this french king of ours has found out to fight with other mens swords and to wage his soldiers out of other mens purses ah it is the wisest prince that ever put purple on his backand yet he weareth not much of that neitheri see him often go plainer than i would think befitted me to do  charlemagne 742814 king of the franks and crowned emperor of the holy roman empire in 800 his kingdom included germany and france the greater part of italy and spain as far as the ebro as emperor of the west he bore the title caesar augustus he established churches and monasteries and encouraged arts and learning he figures largely in mediaeval minstrelsy where the achievements of his knights or paladins rival those of arthurs court  robert bruce the grandson of robert bruce the competitor with john baliol for the scottish throne he defeated the english forces at bannockburn in 1314 and thus secured the independence of scotland an independence which lasted until the two kingdoms were united under one crown in 1707  william wallace another brave scottish leader in the war for independence against edward i of england wallace was betrayed in 1305 and carried to london where he was cruelly executed as a traitor  barbour an eminent scottish poet contemporary with chaucer his principal work the bruce records the life and deeds of robert bruce  harry the minstrel or blind harry was the author of a poem on the life and deeds of wallace which was held in peculiar reverence by the scotch people  but you meet not my exception fair uncle answered young durward i would serve since serve i must in a foreign land somewhere where a brave deed were it my hap to do one might work me a name  i understand you my fair nephew said the royal man at arms i understand you passing well but you are unripe in these matters the duke of burgundy is a hot brained impetuous pudding headed iron ribbed dare all he charges at the head of his nobles and native knights his liegemen of artois and hainault think you if you were there or if i were there myself that we could be much farther forward than the duke and all his brave nobles of his own land if we were not up with them we had a chance to be turned on the provost marshals hands for being slow in making to if we were abreast of them all would be called well and we might be thought to have deserved our pay and grant that i was a spears length or so in the front which is both difficult and dangerous in such a melee where all do their best why my lord duke says in his flemish tongue when he sees a good blow struck ha gut getroffen well struck a good lancea brave scotgive him a florin to drink our health but neither rank nor lands nor treasures come to the stranger in such a serviceall goes to the children of the soil  and where should it go in heavens name fair uncle demanded young durward  to him that protects the children of the soil said balafre drawing up his gigantic height thus says king louis my good french peasantmine honest jacques bonhomme get you to your tools your plough and your harrow your pruning knife and your hoehere is my gallant scot that will fight for you and you shall only have the trouble to pay him and you my most serene duke my illustrious count and my most mighty marquis een rein up your fiery courage till it is wanted for it is apt to start out of the course and to hurt its master here are my companies of ordnancehere are my french guardshere are above all my scottish archers and mine honest ludovic with the scar who will fight as well or better than you will fight with all that undisciplined valour which in your fathers time lost cressy and azincour two famous victories in the hundred years war gained over the french by the english near the towns of crecy and agincourt in 1346 and 1415 see shakespeares henry v for a description of the latter now see you not in which of these states a cavalier of fortune holds the highest rank and must come to the highest honour  i think i understand you fair uncle answered the nephew but in my mind honour cannot be won where there is no risk sure this isi pray pardon mean easy and almost slothful life to mount guard round an elderly man whom no one thinks of harming to spend summer day and winter night up in yonder battlements and shut up all the while in iron cages for fear you should desert your postsuncle uncle it is but a hawk upon his perch who is never carried out to the fields  now by saint martin of tours the boy has some spirit a right touch of the lesly in him much like myself though always with a little more folly in it hark ye youthlong live the king of francescarce a day but there is some commission in hand by which some of his followers may win both coin and credit think not that the bravest and most dangerous deeds are done by daylight i could tell you of some as scaling castles making prisoners and the like where one who shall be nameless hath run higher risk and gained greater favour than any desperado in the train of desperate charles of burgundy and if it please his majesty to remain behind and in the background while such things are doing he hath the more leisure of spirit to admire and the more liberality of hand to reward the adventurers whose dangers perhaps and whose feats of arms he can better judge of than if he had personally shared them oh t is a sagacious and most politic monarch  his nephew paused and then said in a low but impressive tone of voice the good father peter used often to teach me there might be much danger in deeds by which little glory was acquired i need not say to you fair uncle that i do in course suppose that these secret commissions must needs be honourable  for whom or for what take you me fair nephew said balafre somewhat sternly i have not been trained indeed in the cloister neither can i write or read but i am your mothers brother i am a loyal lesly think you that i am like to recommend to you anything unworthy the best knight in france du guesclin himself if he were alive again might be proud to number my deeds among his achievements  i cannot doubt your warranty fair uncle said the youth you are the only adviser my mishap has left me but is it true as fame says that this king keeps a meagre court here at his castle of plessis no repair of nobles or courtiers none of his grand feudatories in attendance none of the high officers of the crown half solitary sports shared only with the menials of his household secret councils to which only low and obscure men are invited rank and nobility depressed and men raised from the lowest origin to the kingly favourall this seems unregulated resembles not the manners of his father the noble charles who tore from the fangs of the english lion this more than half conquered kingdom of france  you speak like a giddy child said le balafre and even as a child you harp over the same notes on a new string look you if the king employs oliver dain his barber to do what oliver can do better than any peer of them all is not the kingdom the gainer if he bids his stout provost marshal tristan arrest such or such a seditious burgher take off such or such a turbulent noble the deed is done and no more of it when were the commission given to a duke or peer of france he might perchance send the king back a defiance in exchange if again the king pleases to give to plain ludovic le balafre a commission which he will execute instead of employing the high constable who would perhaps betray it doth it not show wisdom above all doth not a monarch of such conditions best suit cavaliers of fortune who must go where their services are most highly prized and most frequently in demandno no child i tell thee louis knows how to choose his confidants and what to charge them with suiting as they say the burden to each mans back he is not like the king of castile who choked with thirst because the great butler was not beside to hand his cupbut hark to the bell of st martins i must hasten back to the castlefarewellmake much of yourself and at eight tomorrow morning present yourself before the drawbridge and ask the sentinel for me take heed you step not off the straight and beaten path in approaching the portal there are such traps and snap haunches as may cost you a limb which you will sorely miss you shall see the king and learn to judge him for yourselffarewell  so saying balafre hastily departed forgetting in his hurry to pay for the wine he had called for a shortness of memory incidental to persons of his description and which his host overawed perhaps by the nodding bonnet and ponderous two handed sword did not presume to use any efforts for correcting it might have been expected that when left alone durward would have again betaken himself to his turret in order to watch for the repetition of those delicious sounds which had soothed his morning reverie but that was a chapter of romance and his uncles conversation had opened to him a page of the real history of life it was no pleasing one and for the present the recollections and reflections which it excited were qualified to overpower other thoughts and especially all of a light and soothing nature  quentin resorted to a solitary walk along the banks of the rapid cher having previously inquired of his landlord for one which he might traverse without fear of disagreeable interruption from snares and pitfalls and there endeavoured to compose his turmoiled and scattered thoughts and consider his future motions upon which his meeting with his uncle had thrown some dubiety    chapter vi the bohemians       sae rantingly sae wantingly      sae dantingly gaed he      he playd a spring and danced a round      beneath the gallows tree       old song   the bohemians in guy mannering the reader will find some remarks on the gipsies as they are found in scotland their first appearance in europe took place in the beginning of the fifteenth century the account given by these singular people was that it was appointed to them as a penance to travel for a certain number of years their appearance however and manners strongly contradicted the allegation that they travelled from any religious motive their dress and accoutrements were at once showy and squalid those who acted as captains and leaders of any horde were arrayed in dresses of the most showy colours such as scarlet or light green were well mounted assumed the title of dukes and counts and affected considerable consequence the rest of the tribe were most miserable in their diet and apparel fed without hesitation on animals which had died of disease and were clad in filthy and scanty rags their complexion was positively eastern approaching to that of the hindoos their manners were as depraved as their appearance was poor and beggarly the men were in general thieves and the women of the most abandoned character the few arts which they studied with success were of a slight and idle though ingenious description they practised working in iron but never upon any great scale many were good sportsmen good musicians but their ingenuity never ascended into industry their pretensions to read fortunes by palmistry and by astrology acquired them sometimes respect but oftener drew them under suspicion as sorcerers the universal accusation that they augmented their horde by stealing children subjected them to doubt and execration the pretension set up by these wanderers of being pilgrims in the act of penance although it in many instances obtained them protection from the governments of the countries through which they travelled was afterwards totally disbelieved and they were considered as incorrigible rogues and vagrants a curious and accurate account of their arrival in france is quoted by pasquier on august 27th 1427 came to paris twelve penitents viz a duke an earl and ten men all on horseback and calling themselves good christians they were of lower egypt and gave out that not long before the christians had subdued their country and obliged them to embrace christianity on pain of being put to death those who were baptized were great lords in their own country and had a king and queen there soon after their conversion the saracens overran the country and obliged them to renounce christianity when the emperor of germany the king of poland and other christian princes heard of this they fell upon them and obliged the whole of them both great and small to quit the country and go to the pope at rome who enjoined them seven years penance to wander over the world without lying in a bed they had been wandering five years when they came to paris first nearly all of them had their ears bored and wore two silver rings in each the men were black their hair curled the women remarkably black their only clothes a large old duffle garment tied over the shoulders with a cloth or cord and under it a miserable rocket notwithstanding their poverty there were among them women who by looking into peoples hands told their fortunes and what was worse they picked peoples pockets of their money and got it into their own by telling these things through airy magic et cetera pasquier remarks upon this singular journal that however the story of a penance savours of a trick these people wandered up and down france under the eye and with the knowledge of the magistrates for more than a hundred years and it was not till 1561 that a sentence of banishment was passed against them in that kingdom the arrival of the egyptians as these singular people were called in various parts of europe corresponds with the period in which timur or tamerlane invaded hindostan affording its natives the choice between the koran and death there can be little doubt that these wanderers consisted originally of the hindostanee tribes who displaced and flying from the sabres of the mohammedans undertook this species of wandering life without well knowing whither they were going when they are in closest contact with the ordinary peasants around them they still keep their language a mystery there is little doubt however that it is a dialect of the hindostanee from the specimens produced by grellman hoyland and others who have written on the subject s  the manner in which quentin durward had been educated was not of a kind to soften the heart or perhaps to improve the moral feeling he with the rest of his family had been trained to the chase as an amusement and taught to consider war as their only serious occupation and that it was the great duty of their lives stubbornly to endure and fiercely to retaliate the attacks of their feudal enemies by whom their race had been at last almost annihilated and yet there mixed with these feuds a spirit of rude chivalry and even courtesy which softened their rigour so that revenge their only justice was still prosecuted with some regard to humanity and generosity the lessons of the worthy old monk better attended to perhaps during a long illness and adversity than they might have been in health and success had given young durward still farther insight into the duties of humanity towards others and considering the ignorance of the period the general prejudices entertained in favour of a military life and the manner in which he himself had been bred the youth was disposed to feel more accurately the moral duties incumbent on his station than was usual at the time  he reflected on his interview with his uncle with a sense of embarrassment and disappointment his hopes had been high for although intercourse by letters was out of the question yet a pilgrim or an adventurous trafficker or a crippled soldier sometimes brought leslys name to glen houlakin and all united in praising his undaunted courage and his success in many petty enterprises which his master had intrusted to him quentins imagination had filled up the sketch in his own way and assimilated his successful and adventurous uncle whose exploits probably lost nothing in the telling to some of the champions and knights errant of whom minstrels sung and who won crowns and kings daughters by dint of sword and lance he was now compelled to rank his kinsman greatly lower in the scale of chivalry but blinded by the high respect paid to parents and those who approach that charactermoved by every early prejudice in his favourinexperienced besides and passionately attached to his mothers memory he saw not in the only brother of that dear relation the character he truly held which was that of an ordinary mercenary soldier neither much worse nor greatly better than many of the same profession whose presence added to the distracted state of france  without being wantonly cruel le balafre was from habit indifferent to human life and human suffering he was profoundly ignorant greedy of booty unscrupulous how he acquired it and profuse in expending it on the gratification of his passions the habit of attending exclusively to his own wants and interests had converted him into one of the most selfish animals in the world so that he was seldom able as the reader may have remarked to proceed far in any subject without considering how it applied to himself or as it is called making the case his own though not upon feelings connected with the golden rule but such as were very different to this must be added that the narrow round of his duties and his pleasures had gradually circumscribed his thoughts hopes and wishes and quenched in a great measure the wild spirit of honour and desire of distinction in arms by which his youth had been once animated  balafre was in short a keen soldier hardened selfish and narrow minded active and bold in the discharge of his duty but acknowledging few objects beyond it except the formal observance of a careless devotion relieved by an occasional debauch with brother boniface his comrade and confessor had his genius been of a more extended character he would probably have been promoted to some important command for the king who knew every soldier of his bodyguard personally reposed much confidence in balafres courage and fidelity and besides the scot had either wisdom or cunning enough perfectly to understand and ably to humour the peculiarities of that sovereign still however his capacity was too much limited to admit of his rising to higher rank and though smiled on and favoured by louis on many occasions balafre continued a mere life guardsman or scottish archer  without seeing the full scope of his uncles character quentin felt shocked at his indifference to the disastrous extirpation of his brother in laws whole family and could not help being surprised moreover that so near a relative had not offered him the assistance of his purse which but for the generosity of maitre pierre he would have been under the necessity of directly craving from him he wronged his uncle however in supposing that this want of attention to his probable necessities was owing to avarice not precisely needing money himself at that moment it had not occurred to balafre that his nephew might be in exigencies otherwise he held a near kinsman so much a part of himself that he would have provided for the weal of the living nephew as he endeavoured to do for that of his deceased sister and her husband but whatever was the motive the neglect was very unsatisfactory to young durward and he wished more than once he had taken service with the duke of burgundy before he quarrelled with his forester whatever had then become of me he thought to himself i should always have been able to keep up my spirits with the reflection that i had in case of the worst a stout back friend in this uncle of mine but now i have seen him and woe worth him there has been more help in a mere mechanical stranger than i have found in my own mothers brother my countryman and a cavalier one would think the slash that has carved all comeliness out of his face had let at the same time every drop of gentle blood out of his body  durward now regretted he had not had an opportunity to mention maitre pierre to le balafre in the hope of obtaining some farther account of that personage but his uncles questions had followed fast on each other and the summons of the great bell of saint martin of tours had broken off their conference rather suddenly that old man he thought to himself was crabbed and dogged in appearance sharp and scornful in language but generous and liberal in his actions and such a stranger is worth a cold kinsman  what says our old scottish proverbbetter kind fremit than fremit kindred better kind strangers than estranged kindred the motto is engraved on a dirk belonging to a person who had but too much reason to choose such a device it was left by him to my father the weapon is now in my possession s i will find out that man which methinks should be no difficult task since he is so wealthy as mine host bespeaks him he will give me good advice for my governance at least and if he goes to strange countries as many such do i know not but his may be as adventurous a service as that of those guards of louis  as quentin framed this thought a whisper from those recesses of the heart in which lies much that the owner does not know of or will not acknowledge willingly suggested that perchance the lady of the turret she of the veil and lute might share that adventurous journey as the scottish youth made these reflections he met two grave looking men apparently citizens of tours whom doffing his cap with the reverence due from youth to age he respectfully asked to direct him to the house of maitre pierre  the house of whom my fair son said one of the passengers  of maitre pierre the great silk merchant who planted all the mulberry trees in the park yonder said durward  young man said one of them who was nearest to him you have taken up an idle trade a little too early  and have chosen wrong subjects to practise your fooleries upon said the farther one still more gruffly the syndic of tours is not accustomed to be thus talked to by strolling jesters from foreign parts  quentin was so much surprised at the causeless offence which these two decent looking persons had taken at a very simple and civil question that he forgot to be angry at the rudeness of their reply and stood staring after them as they walked on with amended pace often looking back at him as if they were desirous to get as soon as possible out of his reach  he next met a party of vine dressers and addressed to them the same question and in reply they demanded to know whether he wanted maitre pierre the schoolmaster or maitre pierre the carpenter or maitre pierre the beadle or half a dozen of maitre pierres besides when none of these corresponded with the description of the person after whom he inquired the peasants accused him of jesting with them impertinently and threatened to fall upon him and beat him in guerdon of his raillery the oldest amongst them who had some influence over the rest prevailed on them to desist from violence  you see by his speech and his fools cap said he that he is one of the foreign mountebanks who are come into the country and whom some call magicians and soothsayers and some jugglers and the like and there is no knowing what tricks they have amongst them i have heard of such a ones paying a liard a small copper coin worth a quarter of a cent current in france in the fifteenth century to eat his bellyfull of grapes in a poor mans vineyard and he ate as many as would have loaded a wain and never undid a button of his jerkinand so let him pass quietly and keep his way as we will keep oursand you friend if you would shun worse walk quietly on in the name of god our lady of marmoutier and saint martin of tours and trouble us no more about your maitre pierre which may be another name for the devil for aught we know  the scot finding himself much the weaker party judged it his wisest course to walk on without reply but the peasants who at first shrunk from him in horror at his supposed talents for sorcery and grape devouring took heart of grace as he got to a distance and having uttered a few cries and curses finally gave them emphasis with a shower of stones although at such a distance as to do little or no harm to the object of their displeasure quentin as he pursued his walk began to think in his turn either that he himself lay under a spell or that the people of touraine were the most stupid brutal and inhospitable of the french peasants the next incident which came under his observation did not tend to diminish this opinion  on a slight eminence rising above the rapid and beautiful cher in the direct line of his path two or three large chestnut trees were so happily placed as to form a distinguished and remarkable group and beside them stood three or four peasants motionless with their eyes turned upwards and fixed apparently upon some object amongst the branches of the tree next to them the meditations of youth are seldom so profound as not to yield to the slightest impulse of curiosity as easily as the lightest pebble dropped casually from the hand breaks the surface of a limpid pool quentin hastened his pace and ran lightly up the rising ground in time enough to witness the ghastly spectacle which attracted the notice of these gazerswhich was nothing less than the body of a man convulsed by the last agony suspended on one of the branches  why do you not cut him down said the young scot whose hand was as ready to assist affliction as to maintain his own honour when he deemed it assailed  one of the peasants turning on him an eye from which fear had banished all expression but its own and a face as pale as clay pointed to a mark cut upon the bark of the tree having the same rude resemblance to a fleur de lys which certain talismanic scratches well known to our revenue officers bear to a broad arrow neither understanding nor heeding the import of this symbol young durward sprung lightly as the ounce up into the tree drew from his pouch that most necessary implement of a highlander or woodsman the trusty skene dhu black knife a species of knife without clasp or hinge formerly much used by the highlanders who seldom travelled without such an ugly weapon though it is now rarely used s and calling to those below to receive the body on their hands cut the rope asunder in less than a minute after he had perceived the exigency  but his humanity was ill seconded by the bystanders so far from rendering durward any assistance they seemed terrified at the audacity of his action and took to flight with one consent as if they feared their merely looking on might have been construed into accession to his daring deed the body unsupported from beneath fell heavily to earth in such a manner that quentin who presently afterwards jumped down had the mortification to see that the last sparks of life were extinguished he gave not up his charitable purpose however without farther efforts he freed the wretched mans neck from the fatal noose undid the doublet threw water on the face and practised the other ordinary remedies resorted to for recalling suspended animation  while he was thus humanely engaged a wild clamour of tongues speaking a language which he knew not arose around him and he had scarcely time to observe that he was surrounded by several men and women of a singular and foreign appearance when he found himself roughly seized by both arms while a naked knife at the same moment was offered to his throat  pale slave of eblis in mohammedan religion the name of the chief of the fallen angels said a man in imperfect french are you robbing him you have murderedbut we have youand you shall abuy it  there were knives drawn on every side of him as these words were spoken and the grim and distorted countenances which glared on him were like those of wolves rushing on their prey  still the young scots courage and presence of mind bore him out what mean ye my masters he said if that be your friends body i have just now cut him down in pure charity and you will do better to try to recover his life than to misuse an innocent stranger to whom he owes his chance of escape  the women had by this time taken possession of the dead body and continued the attempts to recover animation which durward had been making use of though with the like bad success so that desisting from their fruitless efforts they seemed to abandon themselves to all the oriental expressions of grief the women making a piteous wailing and tearing their long black hair while the men seemed to rend their garments and to sprinkle dust upon their heads they gradually became so much engaged in their mourning rites that they bestowed no longer any attention on durward of whose innocence they were probably satisfied from circumstances it would certainly have been his wisest plan to have left these wild people to their own courses but he had been bred in almost reckless contempt of danger and felt all the eagerness of youthful curiosity  the singular assemblage both male and female wore turbans and caps more similar in general appearance to his own bonnet than to the hats commonly worn in france several of the men had curled black beards and the complexion of all was nearly as dark as that of africans one or two who seemed their chiefs had some tawdry ornaments of silver about their necks and in their ears and wore showy scarfs of yellow or scarlet or light green but their legs and arms were bare and the whole troop seemed wretched and squalid in appearance there were no weapons among them that durward saw except the long knives with which they had lately menaced him and one short crooked sabre or moorish sword which was worn by an active looking young man who often laid his hand upon the hill while he surpassed the rest of the party in his extravagant expressions of grief and seemed to mingle with them threats of vengeance  the disordered and yelling group were so different in appearance from any beings whom quentin had yet seen that he was on the point of concluding them to be a party of saracens of those heathen hounds who were the opponents of gentle knights and christian monarchs in all the romances which he had heard or read and was about to withdraw himself from a neighbourhood so perilous when a galloping of horse was heard and the supposed saracens who had raised by this time the body of their comrade upon their shoulders were at once charged by a party of french soldiers  this sudden apparition changed the measured wailing of the mourners into irregular shrieks of terror the body was thrown to the ground in an instant and those who were around it showed the utmost and most dexterous activity in escaping under the bellies as it were of the horses from the point of the lances which were levelled at them with exclamations of down with the accursed heathen thievestake and killbind them like beastsspear them like wolves  these cries were accompanied with corresponding acts of violence but such was the alertness of the fugitives the ground being rendered unfavourable to the horsemen by thickets and bushes that only two were struck down and made prisoners one of whom was the young fellow with the sword who had previously offered some resistance quentin whom fortune seemed at this period to have chosen for the butt of her shafts was at the same time seized by the soldiers and his arms in spite of his remonstrances bound down with a cord those who apprehended him showing a readiness and dispatch in the operation which proved them to be no novices in matters of police  looking anxiously to the leader of the horsemen from whom he hoped to obtain liberty quentin knew not exactly whether to be pleased or alarmed upon recognising in him the down looking and silent companion of maitre pierre true whatever crime these strangers might be accused of this officer might know from the history of the morning that he durward had no connection with them whatever but it was a more difficult question whether this sullen man would be either a favourable judge or a willing witness in his behalf and he felt doubtful whether he would mend his condition by making any direct application to him  but there was little leisure for hesitation trois eschelles and petit andre said the down looking officer to two of his band these same trees stand here quite convenient i will teach these misbelieving thieving sorcerers to interfere with the kings justice when it has visited any of their accursed race dismount my children and do your office briskly  trois eschelles and petit andre were in an instant on foot and quentin observed that they had each at the crupper and pommel of his saddle a coil or two of ropes which they hastily undid and showed that in fact each coil formed a halter with the fatal noose adjusted ready for execution the blood ran cold in quentins veins when he saw three cords selected and perceived that it was proposed to put one around his own neck he called on the officer loudly reminded him of their meeting that morning claimed the right of a free born scotsman in a friendly and allied country and denied any knowledge of the persons along with whom he was seized or of their misdeed  the officer whom durward thus addressed scarce deigned to look at him while he was speaking and took no notice whatever of the claim he preferred to prior acquaintance he barely turned to one or two of the peasants who were now come forward either to volunteer their evidence against the prisoners or out of curiosity and said gruffly was yonder young fellow with the vagabonds  that he was sir and it please your noble provostship answered one of the clowns he was the very first blasphemously to cut down the rascal whom his majestys justice most deservedly hung up as we told your worship  ill swear by god and saint martin of tours to have seen him with their gang said another when they pillaged our metairie a small farm  nay but said a boy yonder heathen was black and this youth is fair yonder one had short curled hair and this hath long fair locks  ay child said the peasant and perhaps you will say yonder one had a green coat and this a gray jerkin but his worship the provost knows that they can change their complexions as easily as their jerkins so that i am still minded he was the same  it is enough that you have seen him intermeddle with the course of the kings justice by attempting to recover an executed traitor said the officertrois eschelles and petit andre dispatch  stay signior officer exclaimed the youth in mortal agony hear me speaklet me not die guiltlesslymy blood will be required of you by my countrymen in this world and by heavens justice in that which is to follow  i will answer for my actions in both said the provost coldly and made a sign with his left hand to the executioners then with a smile of triumphant malice touched with his forefinger his right arm which hung suspended in a scarf disabled probably by the blow which durward had dealt him that morning  miserable vindictive wretch answered quentin persuaded by that action that private revenge was the sole motive of this mans rigour and that no mercy whatever was to be expected from him  the poor youth raves said the functionary speak a word of comfort to him ere he make his transit trois eschelles thou art a comfortable man in such cases when a confessor is not to be had give him one minute of ghostly advice and dispatch matters in the next i must proceed on the roundssoldiers follow me  the provost rode on followed by his guard excepting two or three who were left to assist in the execution the unhappy youth cast after him an eye almost darkened by despair and thought he heard in every tramp of his horses retreating hoofs the last slight chance of his safety vanish he looked around him in agony and was surprised even in that moment to see the stoical indifference of his fellow prisoners they had previously testified every sign of fear and made every effort of escape but now when secured and destined apparently to inevitable death they awaited its arrival with the utmost composure the scene of fate before them gave perhaps a more yellow tinge to their swarthy cheeks but it neither agitated their features nor quenched the stubborn haughtiness of their eye they seemed like foxes which after all their wiles and artful attempts at escape are exhausted die with a silent and sullen fortitude which wolves and bears the fiercer objects of the chase do not exhibit they were undaunted by the conduct of the fatal executioners who went about their work with more deliberation than their master had recommended and which probably arose from their having acquired by habit a sort of pleasure in the discharge of their horrid office we pause an instant to describe them because under a tyranny whether despotic or popular the character of the hangman becomes a subject of grave importance  these functionaries were essentially different in their appearance and manners louis used to call them democritus and heraclitus and their master the provost termed them jean qui pleure and jean qui rit  democritus and heraclitus two greek philosophers of the fifth century the former because of his propensity to laugh at the follies of men was called the laughing philosopher the latter according to a current notion probably unfounded habitually wept over the follies of mankind  jean qui pleure and jean qui rit john who weeps and john who laughs one of these two persons might with more accuracy have been called petit jean than petit andre this was actually the name of the son of henry de cousin master executioner of the high court of justice s  trois eschelles was a tall thin ghastly man with a peculiar gravity of visage and a large rosary round his neck the use of which he was accustomed piously to offer to those sufferers on whom he did his duty he had one or two latin texts continually in his mouth on the nothingness and vanity of human life and had it been regular to have enjoyed such a plurality he might have held the office of confessor to the jail in commendam with that of executioner petit andre on the contrary was a joyous looking round active little fellow who rolled about in execution of his duty as if it were the most diverting occupation in the world he seemed to have a sort of fond affection for his victims and always spoke of them in kindly and affectionate terms they were his poor honest fellows his pretty dears his gossips his good old fathers as their age or sex might be and as trois eschelles endeavoured to inspire them with a philosophical or religious regard to futurity petit andre seldom failed to refresh them with a jest or two as if to induce them to pass from life as something that was ludicrous contemptible and not worthy of serious consideration  i cannot tell why or wherefore it was but these two excellent persons notwithstanding the variety of their talents and the rare occurrence of such among persons of their profession were both more utterly detested than perhaps any creatures of their kind whether before or since and the only doubt of those who knew aught of them was whether the grave and pathetic trois eschelles or the frisky comic alert petit andre was the object of the greatest fear or of the deepest execration it is certain they bore the palm in both particulars over every hangman in france unless it were perhaps their master tristan lhermite the renowned provost marshal or his master louis xi  it must not be supposed that these reflections were of quentin durwards making life death time and eternity were swimming before his eyesa stunning and overwhelming prospect from which human nature recoiled in its weakness though human pride would fain have borne up he addressed himself to the god of his fathers and when he did so the little rude and unroofed chapel which now held almost all his race but himself rushed on his recollection  our feudal enemies gave my kindred graves in our own land he thought but i must feed the ravens and kites of a foreign land like an excommunicated felon  the tears gushed involuntarily from his eyes trois eschelles touching one shoulder gravely congratulated him on his heavenly disposition for death and pathetically exclaiming beati qui in domino moriuntur blessed are they who die in the lord remarked the soul was happy that left the body while the tear was in the eye petit andre slapping the other shoulder called out courage my fair son since you must begin the dance let the ball open gaily for all the rebecs are in tune twitching the halter at the same time to give point to his joke as the youth turned his dismayed looks first on one and then on the other they made their meaning plainer by gently urging him forward to the fatal tree and bidding him be of good courage for it would be over in a moment  in this fatal predicament the youth cast a distracted look around him is there any good christian who hears me he said that will tell ludovic lesly of the scottish guard called in this country le balafre that his nephew is here basely murdered the words were spoken in good time for an archer of the scottish guard attracted by the preparations for the execution was standing by with one or two other chance passengers to witness what was passing  take heed what you do he said to the executioners if this young man be of scottish birth i will not permit him to have foul play  heaven forbid sir cavalier said trois eschelles but we must obey our orders drawing durward forward by one arm the shortest play is ever the fairest said petit andre pulling him onward by the other  but quentin had heard words of comfort and exerting his strength he suddenly shook off both the finishers of the law and with his arms still bound ran to the scottish archer stand by me countryman he said in his own language for the love of scotland and saint andrew i am innocenti am your own native landsman stand by me as you shall answer at the last day  by saint andrew they shall make at you through me said the archer and unsheathed his sword  cut my bonds countryman said quentin and i will do something for myself  this was done with a touch of the archers weapon and the liberated captive springing suddenly on one of the provosts guard wrested from him a halbert with which he was armed and now he said come on if you dare  the two officers whispered together  ride thou after the provost marshal said trois eschelles and i will detain them here if i can soldiers of the provosts guard stand to your arms  petit andre mounted his horse and left the field and the other marshals men in attendance drew together so hastily at the command of trois eschelles that they suffered the other two prisoners to make their escape during the confusion perhaps they were not very anxious to detain them for they had of late been sated with the blood of such wretches and like other ferocious animals were through long slaughter become tired of carnage but the pretext was that they thought themselves immediately called upon to attend to the safety of trois eschelles for there was a jealousy which occasionally led to open quarrels betwixt the scottish archers and the marshal guards who executed the orders of their provost  we are strong enough to beat the proud scots twice over if it be your pleasure said one of these soldiers to trois eschelles  but that cautious official made a sign to him to remain quiet and addressed the scottish archer with great civility surely sir this is a great insult to the provost marshal that you should presume to interfere with the course of the kings justice duly and lawfully committed to his charge and it is no act of justice to me who am in lawful possession of my criminal neither is it a well meant kindness to the youth himself seeing that fifty opportunities of hanging him may occur without his being found in so happy a state of preparation as he was before your ill advised interference  if my young countryman said the scot smiling be of opinion i have done him an injury i will return him to your charge without a word more dispute  no nofor the love of heaven no exclaimed quentin i would rather you swept my head off with your long swordit would better become my birth than to die by the hands of such a foul churl  hear how he revileth said the finisher of the law alas how soon our best resolutions pass awayhe was in a blessed frame for departure but now and in two minutes he has become a contemner of authorities  tell me at once said the archer what has this young man done  interfered answered trois eschelles with some earnestness to take down the dead body of a criminal when the fleur de lys was marked on the tree where he was hung with my own proper hand  how is this young man said the archer how came you to have committed such an offence  as i desire your protection answered durward i will tell you the truth as if i were at confession i saw a man struggling on the tree and i went to cut him down out of mere humanity i thought neither of fleur de lys nor of clove gilliflower and had no more idea of offending the king of france than our father the pope  what a murrain had you to do with the dead body then said the archer you ll see them hanging in the rear of this gentleman like grapes on every tree and you will have enough to do in this country if you go agleaning after the hangman however i will not quit a countrymans cause if i can help ithark ye master marshals man you see this is entirely a mistake you should have some compassion on so young a traveller in our country at home he has not been accustomed to see such active proceedings as yours and your masters  not for want of need of them signior archer said petit andre who returned at this moment stand fast trois eschelles for here comes the provost marshal we shall presently see how he will relish having his work taken out of his hand before it is finished  and in good time said the archer here come some of my comrades  accordingly as the provost tristan rode up with his patrol on one side of the little bill which was the scene of the altercation four or five scottish archers came as hastily up on the other and at their head the balafre himself  upon this urgency lesly showed none of that indifference towards his nephew of which quentin had in his heart accused him for he no sooner saw his comrade and durward standing upon their defence than he exclaimed cunningham i thank theegentlemencomrades lend me your aidit is a young scottish gentlemanmy nephewlindesayguthrietyrie draw and strike in  there was now every prospect of a desperate scuffle between the parties who were not so disproportioned in numbers but that the better arms of the scottish cavaliers gave them an equal chance of victory but the provost marshal either doubting the issue of the conflict or aware that it would be disagreeable to the king made a sign to his followers to forbear from violence while he demanded of balafre who now put himself forward as the head of the other party what he a cavalier of the kings bodyguard purposed by opposing the execution of a criminal  i deny that i do so answered the balafre saint martin patron saint of tours lucca and of penitent drunkards he was greatly honoured in the middle ages there is i think some difference between the execution of a criminal and a slaughter of my own nephew  your nephew may be a criminal as well as another said the provost marshal and every stranger in france is amenable to the laws of france  yes but we have privileges we scottish archers said balafre have we not comrades  yes yes they all exclaimed together privilegesprivileges long live king louislong live the bold balafrelong live the scottish guardand death to all who would infringe our privileges  take reason with you gentlemen cavaliers said the provost marshal consider my commission  we will have no reason at your hand said cunningham our own officers shall do us reason we will be judged by the kings grace or by our own captain now that the lord high constable is not in presence  and we will be hanged by none said lindesay but sandie wilson the auld marshals man of our ain body  it would be a positive cheating of sandie who is as honest a man as ever tied noose upon hemp did we give way to any other proceeding said the balafre were i to be hanged myself no other should tie tippet about my craig  but hear ye said the provost marshal this young fellow belongs not to you and cannot share what you call your privileges  what we call our privileges all shall admit to be such said cunningham  we will not hear them questioned was the universal cry of the archers  ye are mad my masters said tristan lhermite no one disputes your privileges but this youth is not one of you  he is my nephew said the balafre with a triumphant air  but no archer of the guard i think retorted tristan lhermite  the archers looked on each other in some uncertainty  stand to it yet comrade whispered cunningham to balafre say he is engaged with us  saint martin you say well fair countryman answered lesly and raising his voice swore that he had that day enrolled his kinsman as one of his own retinue this declaration was a decisive argument  it is well gentlemen said the provost tristan who was aware of the kings nervous apprehension of disaffection creeping in among his guards you know as you say your privileges and it is not my duty to have brawls with the kings guards if it is to be avoided but i will report this matter for the kings own decision and i would have you to be aware that in doing so i act more mildly than perhaps my duty warrants  so saying he put his troop into motion while the archers remaining on the spot held a hasty consultation what was next to be done we must report the matter to lord crawford our captain in the first place and have the young fellows name put on the roll  but gentlemen and my worthy friends and preservers said quentin with some hesitation i have not yet determined whether to take service with you or no  then settle in your own mind said his uncle whether you choose to do so or be hangedfor i promise you that nephew of mine as you are i see no other chance of your scaping the gallows  this was an unanswerable argument and reduced quentin at once to acquiesce in what he might have otherwise considered as no very agreeable proposal but the recent escape from the halter which had been actually around his neck would probably have reconciled him to a worse alternative than was proposed  he must go home with us to our caserne said cunningham there is no safety for him out of our bounds whilst these man hunters are prowling  may i not then abide for this night at the hostelry where i breakfasted fair uncle said the youththinking perhaps like many a new recruit that even a single night of freedom was something gained  yes fair nephew answered his uncle ironically that we may have the pleasure of fishing you out of some canal or moat or perhaps out of a loop of the loire knit up in a sack for the greater convenience of swimmingfor that is like to be the end ont the provost marshal smiled on us when we parted continued he addressing cunningham and that is a sign his thoughts were dangerous  i care not for his danger said cunningham such game as we are beyond his bird bolts but i would have thee tell the whole to the devils oliver oliver dain olivers name or nickname was le diable which was bestowed on him by public hatred in exchange for le daim or le dain he was originally the kings barber but afterwards a favourite counsellor s who is always a good friend to the scottish guard and will see father louis before the provost can for he is to shave him tomorrow  but hark you said balafre it is ill going to oliver empty handed and i am as bare as the birch in december  so are we all said cunningham oliver must not scruple to take our scottish words for once we will make up something handsome among us against the next payday and if he expects to share let me tell you the payday will come about all the sooner  and now for the chateau said balafre and my nephew shall tell us by the way how he brought the provost marshal on his shoulders that we may know how to frame our report both to crawford and oliver    chapter vii the enrolment       justice of peace      here hand me down the statuteread the articles      swear kiss the booksubscribe and be a hero      drawing a portion from the public stock      for deeds of valour to be done hereafter      sixpence per day subsistence and arrears       the recruiting officer   an attendant upon the archers having been dismounted quentin durward was accommodated with his horse and in company of his martial countrymen rode at a round pace towards the castle of plessis about to become although on his own part involuntarily an inhabitant of that gloomy fortress the outside of which had that morning struck him with so much surprise  in the meanwhile in answer to his uncles repeated interrogations he gave him an exact account of the accident which had that morning brought him into so much danger although he himself saw nothing in his narrative save what was affecting he found it was received with much laughter by his escort  and yet it is no good jest either said his uncle for what in the devils name could lead the senseless boy to meddle with the body of a cursed misbelieving jewish moorish pagan  had he quarrelled with the marshals men about a pretty wench as michael of moffat did there had been more sense in it said cunningham  but i think it touches our honour that tristan and his people pretend to confound our scottish bonnets with these pilfering vagabondstorques and turbands as they call them said lindesay if they have not eyes to see the difference they must be taught by rule of hand but it s my belief tristan but pretends to mistake that he may snap up the kindly scots that come over to see their kinsfolks  may i ask kinsman said quentin what sort of people these are of whom you speak  in troth you may ask said his uncle but i know not fair nephew who is able to answer you not i i am sure although i know it may be as much as other people but they appeared in this land within a year or two just as a flight of locusts might do  ay said lindesay and jacques bonhomme that is our name for the peasant young manyou will learn our way of talk in timehonest jacques i say cares little what wind either brings them or the locusts so he but knows any gale that would carry them away again  do they do so much evil asked the young man  evil why boy they are heathens or jews or mahommedans at the least and neither worship our lady nor the saints crossing himself and steal what they can lay hands on and sing and tell fortunes added cunningham  and they say there are some goodly wenches amongst these said guthrie but cunningham knows that best  how brother said cunningham i trust ye mean me no reproach  i am sure i said ye none answered guthrie  i will be judged by the company said cunningham ye said as much as that i a scottish gentleman and living within pale of holy church had a fair friend among these off scourings of heathenesse  nay nay said balafre he did but jest we will have no quarrels among comrades  we must have no such jesting then said cunningham murmuring as if he had been speaking to his own beard  be there such vagabonds in other lands than france said lindesay  ay in good sooth are theretribes of them have appeared in germany and in spain and in england answered balafre by the blessing of good saint andrew scotland is free of them yet  scotland said cunningham is too cold a country for locusts and too poor a country for thieves  or perhaps john highlander will suffer no thieves to thrive there but his own said guthrie  i let you all know said balafre that i come from the braes of angus and have gentle highland kin in glen isla and i will not have the highlanders slandered  you will not deny that they are cattle lifters said guthrie  to drive a spreagh to plunder or so is no thievery said balafre and that i will maintain when and how you dare  for shame comrade said cunningham who quarrels now the young man should not see such mad misconstructioncome here we are at the chateau i will bestow a runlet of wine to have a rouse in friendship and drink to scotland highland and lowland both if you will meet me at dinner at my quarters  agreedagreed said balafre and i will bestow another to wash away unkindness and to drink a health to my nephew on his first entrance to our corps  at their approach the wicket was opened and the drawbridge fell one by one they entered but when quentin appeared the sentinels crossed their pikes and commanded him to stand while bows were bent and harquebusses aimed at him from the walls a rigour of vigilance used notwithstanding that the young stranger came in company of a party of the garrison nay of the very body which furnished the sentinels who were then upon duty  le balafre who had remained by his nephews side on purpose gave the necessary explanations and after some considerable hesitation and delay the youth was conveyed under a strong guard to the lord crawfords apartment  this scottish nobleman was one of the last relics of the gallant band of scottish lords and knights who had so long and so truly served charles vi in those bloody wars which decided the independence of the french crown and the expulsion of the english he had fought when a boy abreast with douglas and with buchan had ridden beneath the banner of the maid of arc and was perhaps one of the last of those associates of scottish chivalry who had so willingly drawn their swords for the fleur de lys against their auld enemies of england changes which had taken place in the scottish kingdom and perhaps his having become habituated to french climate and manners had induced the old baron to resign all thoughts of returning to his native country the rather that the high office which he held in the household of louis and his own frank and loyal character had gained a considerable ascendancy over the king who though in general no ready believer in human virtue or honour trusted and confided in those of the lord crawford and allowed him the greater influence because he was never known to interfere excepting in matters which concerned his charge  douglas fourth earl of douglas he was created duke of touraine in 1423 by charles vii of france  buchan regent of scotland and grandson of robert ii he entered the service of charles vii in 1420 and was appointed constable of france  maid of arc 14121431 joan of arc she believed that god had called her to liberate france from the curse of the english who were besieging orleans in person she led the french troops from victory to victory until she saw the dauphin crowned as charles vii at rheims she was then betrayed by her people into the hands of the english who in 1431 sentenced her to the flames  balafre and cunningham followed durward and the guard to the apartment of their officer by whose dignified appearance as well as with the respect paid to him by these proud soldiers who seemed to respect no one else the young man was much and strongly impressed  lord crawford was tall and through advanced age had become gaunt and thin yet retaining in his sinews the strength at least if not the elasticity of youth he was able to endure the weight of his armour during a march as well as the youngest man who rode in his band he was hard favoured with a scarred and weatherbeaten countenance and an eye that had looked upon death as his playfellow in thirty pitched battles but which nevertheless expressed a calm contempt of danger rather than the ferocious courage of a mercenary soldier his tall erect figure was at present wrapped in a loose chamber gown secured around him by his buff belt in which was suspended his richly hilted poniard he had round his neck the collar and badge of the order of saint michael a patron saint of france in 1469 a military order was instituted in his honour by louis xi he sat upon a couch covered with deers hide and with spectacles on his nose then a recent invention was labouring to read a huge manuscript called the rosier de la guerre a code of military and civil policy which louis had compiled for the benefit of his son the dauphin and upon which he was desirous to have the opinion of the experienced scottish warrior  lord crawford laid his book somewhat peevishly aside upon the entrance of these unexpected visitors and demanded in his broad national dialect what in the foul fiends name they lacked now  le balafre with more respect than perhaps he would have shown to louis himself stated at full length the circumstances in which his nephew was placed and humbly requested his lordships protection lord crawford listened very attentively he could not but smile at the simplicity with which the youth had interfered in behalf of the hanged criminal but he shook his head at the account which he received of the ruffle betwixt the scottish archers and the provost marshals guard  such disputes between the scots guards and the other constituted authorities of the ordinary military corps often occurred in 1474 two scotsmen had been concerned in robbing a fishmonger of a large sum of money they were accordingly apprehended by philip du four provost with some of his followers but ere they could lodge one of them in the prison of the chastellet they were attacked by two archers of the kings scottish guard who rescued the prisoner s  how often he said will you bring me such ill winded pirns to ravel out how often must i tell you and especially both you ludovic lesly and you archie cunningham that the foreign soldier should bear himself modestly and decorously towards the people of the country if you would not have the whole dogs of the town at your heels however if you must have a bargain a quarrel videlicet s i would rather it were with that loon of a provost than any one else and i blame you less for this onslaught than for other frays that you have made ludovic for it was but natural and kindlike to help your young kinsman this simple bairn must come to no skaith same as scathe neither so give me the roll of the company yonder down from the shelf and we will even add his name to the troop that he may enjoy the privileges  may it please your lordship said durward  is the lad crazed exclaimed his uncle would you speak to his lordship without a question asked  patience ludovic said lord crawford and let us hear what the bairn has to say  only this if it may please your lordship replied quentin that i told my uncle formerly i had some doubts about entering this service i have now to say that they are entirely removed since i have seen the noble and experienced commander under whom i am to serve for there is authority in your look  weel said my bairn said the old lord not insensible to the compliment we have had some experience had god sent us grace to improve by it both in service and in command there you stand quentin in our honourable corps of scottish bodyguards as esquire to your uncle and serving under his lance i trust you will do well for you should be a right man at arms if all be good that is upcome that is if your courage corresponds with your personal appearance s and you are come of a gentle kindredludovic you will see that your kinsman follow his exercise diligently for we will have spears breaking one of these days  by my hilts and i am glad of it my lordthis peace makes cowards of us all i myself feel a sort of decay of spirit closed up in this cursed dungeon of a castle  well a bird whistled in my ear continued lord crawford that the old banner will be soon dancing in the field again  i will drink a cup the deeper this evening to that very tune said balafre  thou wilt drink to any tune said lord crawford and i fear me ludovic you will drink a bitter browst as much liquor as is brewed at one time of your own brewing one day  lesly a little abashed replied that it had not been his wont for many a day but that his lordship knew the use of the company to have a carouse to the health of a new comrade  true said the old leader i had forgot the occasion i will send a few stoups of wine to assist your carouse but let it be over by sunset and hark yelet the soldiers for duty he carefully pricked off and see that none of them be more or less partakers of your debauch  your lordship shall be lawfully obeyed said ludovic and your health duly remembered  perhaps said lord crawford i may look in myself upon your mirthjust to see that all is carried decently  your lordship shall be most dearly welcome said ludovic and the whole party retreated in high spirits to prepare for their military banquet to which lesly invited about a score of his comrades who were pretty much in the habit of making their mess together  a soldiers festival is generally a very extempore affair providing there is enough of meat and drink to be had but on the present occasion ludovic bustled about to procure some better wine than ordinary observing that the old lord was the surest gear in their aught and that while he preached sobriety to them he himself after drinking at the royal table as much wine as he could honestly come by never omitted any creditable opportunity to fill up the evening over the wine pot  so you must prepare comrades he said to hear the old histories of the battles of vernoil and beauge in both these battles the scottish auxiliaries of france under stewart earl of buchan were distinguished s  the gothic apartment in which they generally met was therefore hastily put into the best order their grooms were dispatched to collect green rushes to spread upon the floor and banners under which the scottish guard had marched to battle or which they had taken from the enemies ranks were displayed by way of tapestry over the table and around the walls of the chamber  the next point was to invest the young recruit as hastily as possible with the dress and appropriate arms of the guard that he might appear in every respect the sharer of its important privileges in virtue of which and by the support of his countrymen he might freely brave the power and the displeasure of the provost marshalalthough the one was known to be as formidable as the other was unrelenting  the banquet was joyous in the highest degree and the guests gave vent to the whole current of their national partiality on receiving into their ranks a recruit from their beloved fatherland old scottish songs were sung old tales of scottish heroes toldthe achievements of their fathers and the scenes in which they were wrought were recalled to mind and for a time the rich plains of touraine seemed converted into the mountainous and sterile regions of caledonia  when their enthusiasm was at high flood and each was endeavouring to say something to enhance the dear remembrance of scotland it received a new impulse from the arrival of lord crawford who as le balafre had well prophesied sat as it were on thorns at the royal board until an opportunity occurred of making his escape to the revelry of his own countrymen a chair of state had been reserved for him at the upper end of the table for according to the manners of the age and the constitution of that body although their leader and commander under the king and high constable the members of the corps as we should now say the privates being all ranked as noble by birth their captain sat with them at the same table without impropriety and might mingle when he chose in their festivity without derogation from his dignity as commander  at present however lord crawford declined occupying the seat prepared for him and bidding them hold themselves merry stood looking on the revel with a countenance which seemed greatly to enjoy it  let him alone whispered cunningham to lindesay as the latter offered the wine to their noble captain let him alonehurry no mans cattlelet him take it of his own accord  in fact the old lord who at first smiled shook his head and placed the untasted winecup before him began presently as if it were in absence of mind to sip a little of the contents and in doing so fortunately recollected that it would be ill luck did he not drink a draught to the health of the gallant lad who had joined them this day the pledge was filled and answered as may well be supposed with many a joyous shout when the old leader proceeded to acquaint them that he had possessed master oliver with an account of what had passed that day  and as he said the scraper of chins hath no great love for the stretcher of throats he has joined me in obtaining from the king an order commanding the provost to suspend all proceedings under whatever pretence against quentin durward and to respect on all occasions the privileges of the scottish guard  another shout broke forth the cups were again filled till the wine sparkled on the brim and there was an acclaim to the health of the noble lord crawford the brave conservator of the privileges and rights of his countrymen the good old lord could not but in courtesy do reason to this pledge also and gliding into the ready chair as it were without reflecting what he was doing he caused quentin to come up beside him and assailed him with many more questions concerning the state of scotland and the great families there than he was well able to answer while ever and anon in the course of his queries the good lord kissed the wine cup by way of parenthesis remarking that sociality became scottish gentlemen but that young men like quentin ought to practise it cautiously lest it might degenerate into excess upon which occasion he uttered many excellent things until his own tongue although employed in the praises of temperance began to articulate something thicker than usual it was now that while the military ardour of the company augmented with each flagon which they emptied cunningham called on them to drink the speedy hoisting of the oriflamme the royal banner of france  and a breeze of burgundy to fan it echoed lindesay  with all the soul that is left in this worn body do i accept the pledge bairns echoed lord crawford and as old as i am i trust i may see it flutter yet hark ye my mates for wine had made him something communicative ye are all true servants to the french crown and wherefore should ye not know there is an envoy come from duke charles of burgundy with a message of an angry favour  i saw the count of crevecoeurs equipage horses and retinue said another of the guests down at the inn yonder at the mulberry grove they say the king will not admit him into the castle  now heaven send him an ungracious answer said guthrie but what is it he complains of  a world of grievances upon the frontier said lord crawford and latterly that the king hath received under his protection a lady of his land a young countess who hath fled from dijon because being a ward of the duke he would have her marry his favourite campobasso  and hath she actually come hither alone my lord said lindesay  nay not altogether alone but with the old countess her kinswoman who hath yielded to her cousins wishes in this matter  and will the king said cunningham he being the dukes feudal sovereign interfere between the duke and his ward over whom charles hath the same right which were he himself dead the king would have over the heiress of burgundy  the king will be ruled as he is wont by rules of policy and you know continued crawford that he hath not publicly received these ladies nor placed them under the protection of his daughters the lady of beaujeu or the princess joan so doubtless he will be guided by circumstances he is our masterbut it is no treason to say he will chase with the hounds and run with the hare with any prince in christendom  but the duke of burgundy understands no such doubling said cunningham  no answered the old lord and therefore it is likely to make work between them  wellsaint andrew further the fray said le balafre i had it foretold me ten ay twenty years since that i was to make the fortune of my house by marriage who knows what may happen if once we come to fight for honour and ladies love as they do in the old romaunts  thou name ladies love with such a trench in thy visage said guthrie  as well not love at all as love a bohemian woman of heathenesse retorted le balafre  hold there comrades said lord crawford no tilting with sharp weapons no jesting with keen scoffsfriends all and for the lady she is too wealthy to fall to a poor scottish lord or i would put in my own claim fourscore years and all or not very far from it but here is her health nevertheless for they say she is a lamp of beauty  i think i saw her said another soldier when i was upon guard this morning at the inner barrier but she was more like a dark lantern than a lamp for she and another were brought into the chateau in close litters  shame shame arnot said lord crawford a soldier on duty should say naught of what he sees besides he added after a pause his own curiosity prevailing over the show of discipline which he had thought it necessary to exert why should these litters contain this very same countess isabelle de croye  nay my lord replied arnot i know nothing of it save this that my coutelier was airing my horses in the road to the village and fell in with doguin the muleteer who brought back the litters to the inn for they belong to the fellow of the mulberry grove yonderhe of the fleur de lys i meanand so doguin asked saunders steed to take a cup of wine as they were acquainted which he was no doubt willing enough to do  no doubtno doubt said the old lord it is a thing i wish were corrected among you gentlemen but all your grooms and couteliers and jackmen as we should call them in scotland are but too ready to take a cup of wine with any oneit is a thing perilous in war and must be amended but andrew arnot this is a long tale of yours and we will cut it with a drink as the highlander says skeoch doch nan skial cut a tale with a drink an expression used when a man preaches over his liquor as bons vivants say in england s and that s good gaelichere is to the countess isabelle of croye and a better husband to her than campobasso who is a base italian cullionand now andrew arnot what said the muleteer to this yeoman of thine  why he told him in secrecy if it please your lordship continued arnot that these two ladies whom he had presently before convoyed up to the castle in the close litters were great ladies who had been living in secret at his house for some days and that the king had visited them more than once very privately and had done them great honour and that they had fled up to the castle as he believed for fear of the count de crevecoeur the duke of burgundys ambassador whose approach was just announced by an advanced courier  ay andrew come you there to me said guthrie then i will be sworn it was the countess whose voice i heard singing to the lute as i came even now through the inner courtthe sound came from the bay windows of the dauphins tower and such melody was there as no one ever heard before in the castle of plessis of the park by my faith i thought it was the music of the fairy melusinas making there i stoodthough i knew your board was covered and that you were all impatientthere i stood like  the fairy melusina a water fay who married a mortal on condition that she should be allowed to spend her saturdays in deep seclusion this promise after many years was broken and melusina half serpent half woman was discovered swimming in a bath for this breach of faith on the part of her husband melusina was compelled to leave her home she regularly returned however before the death of any of the lords of her family and by her wailings foretold that event her history is closely interwoven with the legends of the banshee and mermaid  like an ass johnny guthrie said his commander thy long nose smelling the dinner thy long ears hearing the music and thy short discretion not enabling thee to decide which of them thou didst preferhark is that not the cathedral bell tolling to vesperssure it cannot be that time yet the mad old sexton has tolld evensong an hour too soon  in faith the bell rings but too justly the hour said cunningham yonder the sun is sinking on the west side of the fair plain  ay said the lord crawford is it even sowell lads we must live within compassfair and soft goes farslow fire makes sweet maltto be merry and wise is a sound proverbone other rouse to the weal of old scotland and then each man to his duty  the parting cup was emptied and the guests dismissedthe stately old baron taking the balafres arm under pretence of giving him some instructions concerning his nephew but perhaps in reality lest his own lofty pace should seem in the public eye less steady than became his rank and high command a serious countenance did he bear as he passed through the two courts which separated his lodging from the festal chamber and solemn as the gravity of a hogshead was the farewell caution with which he prayed ludovic to attend his nephews motions especially in the matters of wenches and wine cups  meanwhile not a word that was spoken concerning the beautiful countess isabelle had escaped the young durward who conducted into a small cabin which he was to share with his uncles page made his new and lowly abode the scene of much high musing the reader will easily imagine that the young soldier should build a fine romance on such a foundation as the supposed or rather the assumed identification of the maiden of the turret to whose lay he had listened with so much interest and the fair cup bearer of maitre pierre with a fugitive countess of rank and wealth flying from the pursuit of a hated lover the favourite of an oppressive guardian who abused his feudal power there was an interlude in quentins vision concerning maitre pierre who seemed to exercise such authority even over the formidable officer from whose hands he had that day with much difficulty made his escape at length the youths reveries which had been respected by little will harper the companion of his cell were broken in upon by the return of his uncle who commanded quentin to bed that he might arise betimes in the morning and attend him to his majestys antechamber to which he was called by his hour of duty along with five of his comrades    chapter viii the envoy       be thou as lightning in the eyes of france      for ere thou canst report i will be there      the thunder of my cannon shall be heard      so hence be thou the trumpet of our wrath       king john   had sloth been a temptation by which durward was easily beset the noise with which the caserne of the guards resounded after the first toll of primes had certainly banished the siren from his couch but the discipline of his fathers tower and of the convent of aberbrothick had taught him to start with the dawn and he did on his clothes gaily amid the sounding of bugles and the clash of armour which announced the change of the vigilant guardssome of whom were returning to barracks after their nightly duty whilst some were marching out to that of the morningand others again amongst whom was his uncle were arming for immediate attendance upon the person of louis quentin durward soon put on with the feelings of so young a man on such an occasion the splendid dress and arms appertaining to his new situation and his uncle who looked with great accuracy and interest to see that he was completely fitted out in every respect did not conceal his satisfaction at the improvement which had been thus made in his nephews appearance  if thou dost prove as faithful and bold as thou art well favoured i shall have in thee one of the handsomest and best esquires in the guard which cannot but be an honour to thy mothers family follow me to the presence chamber and see thou keep close at my shoulder  so saying he took up a partisan large weighty and beautifully inlaid and ornamented and directing his nephew to assume a lighter weapon of a similar description they proceeded to the inner court of the palace where their comrades who were to form the guard of the interior apartments were already drawn up and under armsthe squires each standing behind their masters to whom they thus formed a second rank here were also in attendance many yeomen prickers with gallant horses and noble dogs on which quentin looked with such inquisitive delight that his uncle was obliged more than once to remind him that the animals were not there for his private amusement but for the kings who had a strong passion for the chase one of the few inclinations which he indulged even when coming in competition with his course of policy being so strict a protector of the game in the royal forests that it was currently said you might kill a man with greater impunity than a stag  on a signal given the guards were put into motion by the command of le balafre who acted as officer upon the occasion and after some minutiae of word and signal which all served to show the extreme and punctilious jealousy with which their duty was performed they marched into the hall of audience where the king was immediately expected  new as quentin was to scenes of splendour the effect of that which was now before him rather disappointed the expectations which he had formed of the brilliancy of a court there were household officers indeed richly attired there were guards gallantly armed and there were domestics of various degrees but he saw none of the ancient counsellors of the kingdom none of the high officers of the crown heard none of the names which in those days sounded an alarum to chivalry saw none either of those generals or leaders who possessed of the full prime of manhood were the strength of france or of the more youthful and fiery nobles those early aspirants after honour who were her pride the jealous habits the reserved manners the deep and artful policy of the king had estranged this splendid circle from the throne and they were only called around it upon certain stated and formal occasions when they went reluctantly and returned joyfully as the animals in the fable are supposed to have approached and left the den of the lion  the very few persons who seemed to be there in the character of counsellors were mean looking men whose countenances sometimes expressed sagacity but whose manners showed they were called into a sphere for which their previous education and habits had qualified them but indifferently one or two persons however did appear to durward to possess a more noble mien and the strictness of the present duty was not such as to prevent his uncles communicating the names of those whom he thus distinguished  with the lord crawford who was in attendance dressed in the rich habit of his office and holding a leading staff of silver in his hand quentin as well as the reader was already acquainted among others who seemed of quality the most remarkable was the count de dunois the son of that celebrated dunois known by the name of the bastard of orleans who fighting under the banner of jeanne darc acted such a distinguished part in liberating france from the english yoke his son well supported the high renown which had descended to him from such an honoured source and notwithstanding his connexion with the royal family and his hereditary popularity both with the nobles and the people dunois had upon all occasions manifested such an open frank loyalty of character that he seemed to have escaped all suspicion even on the part of the jealous louis who loved to see him near his person and sometimes even called him to his councils although accounted complete in all the exercises of chivalry and possessed of much of the character of what was then termed a perfect knight the person of the count was far from being a model of romantic beauty he was under the common size though very strongly built and his legs rather curved outwards into that make which is more convenient for horseback than elegant in a pedestrian his shoulders were broad his hair black his complexion swarthy his arms remarkably long and nervous the features of his countenance were irregular even to ugliness yet after all there was an air of conscious worth and nobility about the count de dunois which stamped at the first glance the character of the high born nobleman and the undaunted soldier his mien was bold and upright his step free and manly and the harshness of his countenance was dignified by a glance like an eagle and a frown like a lion his dress was a hunting suit rather sumptuous than gay and he acted on most occasions as grand huntsman though we are not inclined to believe that he actually held the office  upon the arm of his relation dunois walking with a step so slow and melancholy that he seemed to rest on his kinsman and supporter came louis duke of orleans the first prince of the blood royal afterwards king by the name of louis xii and to whom the guards and attendants rendered their homage as such the jealously watched object of louiss suspicions this prince who failing the kings offspring was heir to the kingdom was not suffered to absent himself from court and while residing there was alike denied employment and countenance the dejection which his degraded and almost captive state naturally impressed on the deportment of this unfortunate prince was at this moment greatly increased by his consciousness that the king meditated with respect to him one of the most cruel and unjust actions which a tyrant could commit by compelling him to give his hand to the princess joan of france the younger daughter of louis to whom he had been contracted in infancy but whose deformed person rendered the insisting upon such an agreement an act of abominable rigour  the exterior of this unhappy prince was in no respect distinguished by personal advantages and in mind he was of a gentle mild and beneficent disposition qualities which were visible even through the veil of extreme dejection with which his natural character was at present obscured quentin observed that the duke studiously avoided even looking at the royal guards and when he returned their salute that he kept his eyes bent on the ground as if he feared the kings jealousy might have construed the gesture of ordinary courtesy as arising from the purpose of establishing a separate and personal interest among them  very different was the conduct of the proud cardinal and prelate john of balue the favourite minister of louis for the time whose rise and character bore as close a resemblance to that of wolsey as the difference betwixt the crafty and politic louis and the headlong and rash henry viii of england would permit the former had raised his minister from the lowest rank to the dignity or at least to the emoluments of grand almoner of france loaded him with benefices and obtained for him the hat of a cardinal and although he was too cautious to repose in the ambitious balue the unbounded power and trust which henry placed in wolsey yet he was more influenced by him than by any other of his avowed counsellors the cardinal accordingly had not escaped the error incidental to those who are suddenly raised to power from an obscure situation for he entertained a strong persuasion dazzled doubtlessly by the suddenness of his elevation that his capacity was equal to intermeddling with affairs of every kind even those most foreign to his profession and studies tall and ungainly in his person he affected gallantry and admiration of the fair sex although his manners rendered his pretensions absurd and his profession marked them as indecorous some male or female flatterer had in evil hour possessed him with the idea that there was much beauty of contour in a pair of huge substantial legs which he had derived from his father a car man of limogesor according to other authorities a miller of verdun and with this idea he had become so infatuated that he always had his cardinals robes a little looped up on one side that the sturdy proportion of his limbs might not escape observation as he swept through the stately apartment in his crimson dress and rich cope he stopped repeatedly to look at the arms and appointments of the cavaliers on guard asked them several questions in an authoritative tone and took upon him to censure some of them for what he termed irregularities of discipline in language to which these experienced soldiers dared no reply although it was plain they listened to it with impatience and with contempt  wolsey 14711530 at one time the chief favourite of henry viii he was raised from obscurity by that sovereign to be archbishop of york lord chancellor of england and cardinal as legate of the pope he gained the ill will of henry by his failure to secure that kings divorce he was deprived of his offices his property was confiscated to the crown and in 1530 he was arrested for high treason but died on his way to trial  is the king aware said dunois to the cardinal that the burgundian envoy is peremptory in demanding an audience  he is answered the cardinal and here as i think comes the all sufficient oliver dain to let us know the royal pleasure  as he spoke a remarkable person who then divided the favour of louis with the proud cardinal himself entered from the inner apartment but without any of that important and consequential demeanour which marked the full blown dignity of the churchman on the contrary this was a little pale meagre man whose black silk jerkin and hose without either coat cloak or cassock formed a dress ill qualified to set off to advantage a very ordinary person he carried a silver basin in his hand and a napkin flung over his arm indicated his menial capacity his visage was penetrating and quick although he endeavoured to banish such expression from his features by keeping his eyes fixed on the ground while with the stealthy and quiet pace of a cat he seemed modestly rather to glide than to walk through the apartment but though modesty may easily obscure worth it cannot hide court favour and all attempts to steal unperceived through the presence chamber were vain on the part of one known to have such possession of the kings ear as had been attained by his celebrated barber and groom of the chamber oliver le dain called sometimes oliver le mauvais and sometimes oliver le diable epithets derived from the unscrupulous cunning with which he assisted in the execution of the schemes of his masters tortuous policy at present he spoke earnestly for a few moments with the count de dunois who instantly left the chamber while the tonsor glided quietly back towards the royal apartment whence he had issued every one giving place to him which civility he only acknowledged by the most humble inclination of the body excepting in a very few instances where he made one or two persons the subject of envy to all the other courtiers by whispering a single word in their ear and at the same time muttering something of the duties of his place he escaped from their replies as well as from the eager solicitations of those who wished to attract his notice ludovic lesly had the good fortune to be one of the individuals who on the present occasion was favoured by oliver with a single word to assure him that his matter was fortunately terminated  presently afterwards he had another proof of the same agreeable tidings for quentins old acquaintance tristan lhermite the provost marshal of the royal household entered the apartment and came straight to the place where balafre was posted this formidable officers uniform which was very rich had only the effect of making his sinister countenance and bad mien more strikingly remarkable and the tone which he meant for conciliatory was like nothing so much as the growling of a bear the import of his words however was more amicable than the voice in which they were pronounced he regretted the mistake which had fallen between them on the preceding day and observed it was owing to the sieur le balafres nephews not wearing the uniform of his corps or announcing himself as belonging to it which had led him into the error for which he now asked forgiveness  ludovic lesly made the necessary reply and as soon as tristan had turned away observed to his nephew that they had now the distinction of having a mortal enemy from henceforward in the person of this dreaded officer  but we are above his volee brood rank classa soldier said he who does his duty may laugh at the provost marshal  quentin could not help being of his uncles opinion for as tristan parted from them it was with the look of angry defiance which the bear casts upon the hunter whose spear has wounded him indeed even when less strongly moved the sullen eye of this official expressed a malevolence of purpose which made men shudder to meet his glance and the thrill of the young scot was the deeper and more abhorrent that he seemed to himself still to feel on his shoulders the grasp of the two death doing functionaries of this fatal officer  meanwhile oliver after he had prowled around the room in the stealthy manner which we have endeavoured to describeall even the highest officers making way for him and loading him with their ceremonious attentions which his modesty seemed desirous to avoidagain entered the inner apartment the doors of which were presently thrown open and king louis entered the presence chamber  quentin like all others turned his eyes upon him and started so suddenly that he almost dropped his weapon when he recognised in the king of france that silk merchant maitre pierre who had been the companion of his morning walk singular suspicions respecting the real rank of this person had at different times crossed his thoughts but this the proved reality was wilder than his wildest conjecture  the stern look of his uncle offended at this breach of the decorum of his office recalled him to himself but not a little was he astonished when the king whose quick eye had at once discovered him walked straight to the place where he was posted without taking notice of any one else  so he said young man i am told you have been brawling on your first arrival in touraine but i pardon you as it was chiefly the fault of a foolish old merchant who thought your caledonian blood required to be heated in the morning with vin de beaulne if i can find him i will make him an example to those who debauch my guardsbalafre he added speaking to lesly your kinsman is a fair youth though a fiery we love to cherish such spirits and mean to make more than ever we did of the brave men who are around us let the year day hour and minute of your nephews birth be written down and given to oliver dain  le balafre bowed to the ground and reassumed his erect military position as one who would show by his demeanour his promptitude to act in the kings quarrel or defence quentin in the meantime recovered from his first surprise studied the kings appearance more attentively and was surprised to find how differently he now construed his deportment and features than he had done at their first interview  these were not much changed in exterior for louis always a scorner of outward show wore on the present occasion an old dark blue hunting dress not much better than the plain burgher suit of the preceding day and garnished with a huge rosary of ebony which had been sent to him by no less a personage than the grand seignior with an attestation that it had been used by a coptic hermit on mount lebanon a personage of profound sanctity and instead of his cap with a single image he now wore a hat the band of which was garnished with at least a dozen of little paltry figures of saints stamped in lead but those eyes which according to quentins former impression only twinkled with the love of gain had now that they were known to be the property of an able and powerful monarch a piercing and majestic glance and those wrinkles on the brow which he had supposed were formed during a long series of petty schemes of commerce seemed now the furrows which sagacity had worn while toiling in meditation upon the fate of nations  presently after the kings appearance the princesses of france with the ladies of their suite entered the apartment with the eldest afterwards married to peter of bourbon and known in french history by the name of the lady of beaujeu our story has but little to do she was tall and rather handsome possessed eloquence talent and much of her fathers sagacity who reposed great confidence in her and loved her as well perhaps as he loved any one  the younger sister the unfortunate joan the destined bride of the duke of orleans advanced timidly by the side of her sister conscious of a total want of those external qualities which women are most desirous of possessing or being thought to possess she was pale thin and sickly in her complexion her shape visibly bent to one side and her gait was so unequal that she might be called lame a fine set of teeth and eyes which were expressive of melancholy softness and resignation with a quantity of light brown locks were the only redeeming points which flattery itself could have dared to number to counteract the general homeliness of her face and figure to complete the picture it was easy to remark from the princesss negligence in dress and the timidity of her manner that she had an unusual and distressing consciousness of her own plainness of appearance and did not dare to make any of those attempts to mend by manners or by art what nature had left amiss or in any other way to exert a power of pleasing the king who loved her not stepped hastily to her as she entered  how now he said our world contemning daughterare you robed for a hunting party or for the convent this morning speakanswer  for which your highness pleases sire said the princess scarce raising her voice above her breath  ay doubtless you would persuade me it is your desire to quit the court joan and renounce the world and its vanitiesha maiden wouldst thou have it thought that we the first born of holy church would refuse our daughter to heavenour lady and saint martin forbid we should refuse the offering were it worthy of the altar or were thy vocation in truth thitherward  so saying the king crossed himself devoutly looking in the meantime as appeared to quentin very like a cunning vassal who was depreciating the merit of something which he was desirous to keep to himself in order that he might stand excused for not offering it to his chief or superior  dares he thus play the hypocrite with heaven thought durward and sport with god and the saints as he may safely do with men who dare not search his nature too closely  louis meantime resumed after a moments mental devotion no fair daughter i and another know your real mind better ha fair cousin of orleans do we not approach fair sir and lead this devoted vestal of ours to her horse  orleans started when the king spoke and hastened to obey him but with such precipitation of step and confusion that louis called out nay cousin rein your gallantry and look before you why what a headlong matter a gallants haste is on some occasions you had well nigh taken annes hand instead of her sisterssir must i give joans to you myself  the unhappy prince looked up and shuddered like a child when forced to touch something at which it has instinctive horrorthen making an effort took the hand which the princess neither gave nor yet withheld as they stood her cold damp fingers enclosed in his trembling hand with their eyes looking on the ground it would have been difficult to say which of these two youthful beings was rendered more utterly miserablethe duke who felt himself fettered to the object of his aversion by bonds which he durst not tear asunder or the unfortunate young woman who too plainly saw that she was an object of abhorrence to him to gain whose kindness she would willingly have died  and now to horse gentlemen and ladieswe will ourselves lead forth our daughter of beaujeu said the king and gods blessing and saint huberts be on our mornings sport  i am i fear doomed to interrupt it sire said the comte de dunois the burgundian envoy is before the gates of the castle and demands an audience  demands an audience dunois replied the king did you not answer him as we sent you word by oliver that we were not at leisure to see him todayand that tomorrow was the festival of saint martin which please heaven we would disturb by no earthly thoughtsand that on the succeeding day we were designed for amboisebut that we would not fail to appoint him as early an audience when we returned as our pressing affairs would permit  all this i said answered dunois but yet sire  pasques dieu man what is it that thus sticks in thy throat said the king this burgundians terms must have been hard of digestion  had not my duty your graces commands and his character as an envoy restrained me said dunois he should have tried to digest them himself for by our lady of orleans i had more mind to have made him eat his own words than to have brought them to your majesty  body of me said the king it is strange that thou one of the most impatient fellows alive should have so little sympathy with the like infirmity in our blunt and fiery cousin charles of burgundy why man i mind his blustering messages no more than the towers of this castle regard the whistling of the northeast wind which comes from flanders as well as this brawling envoy  know then sire replied dunois that the count of crevecoeur tarries below with his retinue of pursuivants and trumpets and says that since your majesty refuses him the audience which his master has instructed him to demand upon matters of most pressing concern he will remain there till midnight and accost your majesty at whatever hour you are pleased to issue from your castle whether for business exercise or devotion and that no consideration except the use of absolute force shall compel him to desist from this  he is a fool said the king with much composure does the hot headed hainaulter think it any penance for a man of sense to remain for twentyfour hours quiet within the walls of his castle when he hath the affairs of a kingdom to occupy him these impatient coxcombs think that all men like themselves are miserable save when in saddle and stirrup let the dogs be put up and well looked to gentle dunoiswe will hold council today instead of hunting  my liege answered dunois you will not thus rid yourself of crevecoeur for his masters instructions are that if he hath not this audience which he demands he shall nail his gauntlet to the palisade before the castle in token of mortal defiance on the part of his master shall renounce the dukes fealty to france and declare instant war  ay said louis without any perceptible alteration of voice but frowning until his piercing dark eyes became almost invisible under his shaggy eyebrows is it even so will our ancient vassal prove so masterfulour dear cousin treat us thus unkindlynay then dunois we must unfold the oriflamme and cry dennis montjoye  montjoie st denis a former war cry of the french soldiers saint denis was a patron saint of france who suffered martyrdom in the third century montjoie mont and joie may be the name of the hill where the saint met his death or it may signify that any such place is a hill of joy  marry and amen and in a most happy hour said the martial dunois and the guards in the hall unable to resist the same impulse stirred each upon his post so as to produce a low but distinct sound of clashing arms the king cast his eye proudly round and for a moment thought and looked like his heroic father  but the excitement of the moment presently gave way to the host of political considerations which at that conjuncture rendered an open breach with burgundy so peculiarly perilous edward iv a brave and victorious king who had in his own person fought thirty battles was now established on the throne of england was brother to the duchess of burgundy and it might well be supposed waited but a rupture between his near connexion and louis to carry into france through the ever open gate of calais those arms which had been triumphant in the english civil wars and to obliterate the recollection of internal dissensions by that most popular of all occupations amongst the english an invasion of france to this consideration was added the uncertain faith of the duke of bretagne and other weighty subjects of reflection so that after a deep pause when louis again spoke although in the same tone it was with an altered spirit but god forbid he said that aught less than necessity should make us the most christian king give cause to the effusion of christian blood if anything short of dishonour may avert such a calamity we tender our subjects safety dearer than the ruffle which our own dignity may receive from the rude breath of a malapert ambassador who hath perhaps exceeded the errand with which he was chargedadmit the envoy of burgundy to our presence  beati pacifici blessed are the peace makers said the cardinal balue  true and your eminence knoweth that they who humble themselves shall be exalted added the king  the cardinal spoke an amen to which few assented for even the pale cheek of orleans kindled with shame and balafre suppressed his feelings so little as to let the butt end of his partisan fall heavily on the floora movement of impatience for which he underwent a bitter reproof from the cardinal with a lecture on the mode of handling his arms when in presence of the sovereign the king himself seemed unusually embarrassed at the silence around him  you are pensive dunois he said you disapprove of our giving way to this hot headed envoy  by no means said dunois i meddle not with matters beyond my sphere i was thinking of asking a boon of your majesty  a boon dunoiswhat is it you are an unfrequent suitor and may count on our favour  i would then your majesty would send me to evreux to regulate the clergy said dunois with military frankness  that were indeed beyond thy sphere replied the king smiling  i might order priests as well replied the count as my lord bishop of evreux or my lord cardinal if he likes the title better can exercise the soldiers of your majestys guard  the king smiled again and more mysteriously while he whispered dunois the time may come when you and i will regulate the priests togetherbut this is for the present a good conceited animal of a bishop ah dunois rome rome puts him and other burdens upon usbut patience cousin and shuffle the cards till our hand is a stronger one  dr dryasdust here remarks that cards said to have been invented in a preceding reign for the amusement of charles v during the intervals of his mental disorder seem speedily to have become common among the courtiers the alleged origin of the invention of cards produced one of the shrewdest replies i have ever heard given in evidence it was made by the late dr gregory of edinburgh to a counsel of great eminence at the scottish bar the doctors testimony went to prove the insanity of the party whose mental capacity was the point at issue on a cross interrogation he admitted that the person in question played admirably at whist and do you seriously say doctor said the learned counsel that a person having a superior capacity for a game so difficult and which requires in a preeminent degree memory judgment and combination can be at the same time deranged in his understandingi am no card player said the doctor with great address but i have read in history that cards were invented for the amusement of an insane king the consequences of this reply were decisive s  the flourish of trumpets in the courtyard now announced the arrival of the burgundian nobleman all in the presence chamber made haste to arrange themselves according to their proper places of precedence the king and his daughters remaining in the centre of the assembly  the count of crevecoeur a renowned and undaunted warrior entered the apartment and contrary to the usage among the envoys of friendly powers he appeared all armed excepting his head in a gorgeous suit of the most superb milan armour made of steel inlaid and embossed with gold which was wrought into the fantastic taste called the arabesque around his neck and over his polished cuirass hung his masters order of the golden fleece one of the most honoured associations of chivalry then known in christendom a handsome page bore his helmet behind him a herald preceded him bearing his letters of credence which he offered on his knee to the king while the ambassador himself paused in the midst of the hall as if to give all present time to admire his lofty look commanding stature and undaunted composure of countenance and manner the rest of his attendants waited in the antechamber or courtyard  the military order of the golden fleece was instituted by philip the good duke of burgundy in the year 1429 the king of spain being grand master of the order as duke of burgundy  approach seignior count de crevecoeur said louis after a moments glance at his commission we need not our cousins letters of credence either to introduce to us a warrior so well known or to assure us of your highly deserved credit with your master we trust that your fair partner who shares some of our ancestral blood is in good health had you brought her in your hand seignior count we might have thought you wore your armour on this unwonted occasion to maintain the superiority of her charms against the amorous chivalry of france as it is we cannot guess the reason of this complete panoply  sire replied the ambassador the count of crevecoeur must lament his misfortune and entreat your forgiveness that he cannot on this occasion reply with such humble deference as is due to the royal courtesy with which your majesty has honoured him but although it is only the voice of philip crevecoeur de cordes which speaks the words which he utters must be those of his gracious lord and sovereign the duke of burgundy  and what has crevecoeur to say in the words of burgundy said louis with an assumption of sufficient dignity yet holdremember that in this presence philip crevecoeur de cordes speaks to him who is his sovereigns sovereign  crevecoeur bowed and then spoke aloud king of france the mighty duke of burgundy once more sends you a written schedule of the wrongs and oppressions committed on his frontiers by your majestys garrisons and officers and the first point of inquiry is whether it is your majestys purpose to make him amends for these injuries  the king looking slightly at the memorial which the herald delivered to him upon his knee said these matters have been already long before our council of the injuries complained of some are in requital of those sustained by my subjects some are affirmed without any proof some have been retaliated by the dukes garrisons and soldiers and if there remain any which fall under none of those predicaments we are not as a christian prince averse to make satisfaction for wrongs actually sustained by our neighbour though committed not only without our countenance but against our express order  i will convey your majestys answer said the ambassador to my most gracious master yet let me say that as it is in no degree different from the evasive replies which have already been returned to his just complaints i cannot hope that it will afford the means of reestablishing peace and friendship betwixt france and burgundy  be that at gods pleasure said the king it is not for dread of thy masters arms but for the sake of peace only that i return so temperate an answer to his injurious reproaches proceed with thine errand  my masters next demand said the ambassador is that your majesty will cease your secret and underhand dealings with his towns of ghent liege and malines he requests that your majesty will recall the secret agents by whose means the discontents of his good citizens of flanders are inflamed and dismiss from your majestys dominions or rather deliver up to the condign punishment of their liege lord those traitorous fugitives who having fled from the scene of their machinations have found too ready a refuge in paris orleans tours and other french cities  say to the duke of burgundy replied the king that i know of no such indirect practices as those with which he injuriously charges me that many subjects of france have frequent intercourse with the good cities of flanders for the purpose of mutual benefit by free traffic which it would be as much contrary to the dukes interest as mine to interrupt and that many flemings have residence in my kingdom and enjoy the protection of my laws for the same purpose but none to our knowledge for those of treason or mutiny against the duke proceed with your messageyou have heard my answer  as formerly sire with pain replied the count of crevecoeur it not being of that direct or explicit nature which the duke my master will accept in atonement for a long train of secret machinations not the less certain though now disavowed by your majesty but i proceed with my message the duke of burgundy farther requires the king of france to send back to his dominions without delay and under a secure safeguard the persons of isabelle countess of croye and of her relation and guardian the countess hameline of the same family in respect the said countess isabelle being by the law of the country and the feudal tenure of her estates the ward of the said duke of burgundy hath fled from his dominions and from the charge which he as a careful guardian was willing to extend over her and is here maintained in secret by the king of france and by him fortified in her contumacy to the duke her natural lord and guardian contrary to the laws of god and man as they ever have been acknowledged in civilized europeonce more i pause for your majestys reply  you did well count de crevecoeur said louis scornfully to begin your embassy at an early hour for if it be your purpose to call on me to account for the flight of every vassal whom your masters heady passion may have driven from his dominions the head roll may last till sunset who can affirm that these ladies are in my dominions who can presume to say if it be so that i have either countenanced their flight hither or have received them with offers of protection nay who is it will assert that if they are in france their place of retirement is within my knowledge  sire said crevecoeur may it please your majesty i was provided with a witness on this subjectone who beheld these fugitive ladies in the inn called the fleur de lys not far from this castleone who saw your majesty in their company though under the unworthy disguise of a burgess of toursone who received from them in your royal presence messages and letters to their friends in flandersall which he conveyed to the hand and ear of the duke of burgundy  bring them forward said the king place the man before my face who dares maintain these palpable falsehoods  you speak in triumph my lord for you are well aware that this witness no longer exists when he lived he was called zamet magraubin by birth one of those bohemian wanderers he was yesterdayas i have learnedexecuted by a party of your majestys provost marshal to prevent doubtless his standing here to verify what he said of this matter to the duke of burgundy in presence of his council and of me philip crevecoeur de cordes  now by our lady of embrun said the king so gross are these accusations and so free of consciousness am i of aught that approaches them that by the honour of a king i laugh rather than am wroth at them my provost guard daily put to death as is their duty thieves and vagabonds and is my crown to be slandered with whatever these thieves and vagabonds may have said to our hot cousin of burgundy and his wise counsellors i pray you tell my kind cousin if he loves such companions he had best keep them in his own estates for here they are like to meet short shrift and a tight cord  my master needs no such subjects sir king answered the count in a tone more disrespectful than he had yet permitted himself to make use of for the noble duke uses not to inquire of witches wandering egyptians or others upon the destiny and fate of his neighbours and allies  we have had patience enough and to spare said the king interrupting him and since thy sole errand here seems to be for the purpose of insult we will send some one in our name to the duke of burgundyconvinced in thus demeaning thyself towards us thou hast exceeded thy commission whatever that may have been  on the contrary said crevecoeur i have not yet acquitted myself of ithearken louis of valois king of francehearken nobles and gentlemen who may be presenthearken all good and true menand thou toison dor addressing the herald make proclamation after mei philip crevecoeur of cordes count of the empire and knight of the honourable and princely order of the golden fleece in the name of the most puissant lord and prince charles by the grace of god duke of burgundy and lotharingia of brabant and limbourg of luxembourg and of gueldres earl of flanders and of artois count palatine of hainault of holland zealand namur and zutphen marquis of the holy empire lord of friezeland salines and malines do give you louis king of france openly to know that you having refused to remedy the various griefs wrongs and offences done and wrought by you or by and through your aid suggestion and instigation against the said duke and his loving subjects he by my mouth renounces all allegiance and fealty towards your crown and dignitypronounces you false and faithless and defies you as a prince and as a man there lies my gage in evidence of what i have said  so saying he plucked the gauntlet off his right hand and flung it down on the floor of the hall  until this last climax of audacity there had been a deep silence in the royal apartment during the extraordinary scene but no sooner had the clash of the gauntlet when cast down been echoed by the deep voice of toison dor the burgundian herald with the ejaculation vive bourgogne than there was a general tumult while dunois orleans old lord crawford and one or two others whose rank authorized their interference contended which should lift up the gauntlet the others in the hall exclaimed strike him down cut him to pieces comes he here to insult the king of france in his own palace  but the king appeased the tumult by exclaiming in a voice like thunder which overawed and silenced every other sound silence my lieges lay not a hand on the man not a finger on the gageand you sir count of what is your life composed or how is it warranted that you thus place it on the cast of a die so perilous or is your duke made of a different metal from other princes since he thus asserts his pretended quarrel in a manner so unusual  he is indeed framed of a different and more noble metal than the other princes of europe said the undaunted count of crevecoeur for when not one of them dared to give shelter to youto you i say king louiswhen you were yet only dauphin an exile from france and pursued by the whole bitterness of your fathers revenge and all the power of his kingdom you were received and protected like a brother by my noble master whose generosity of disposition you have so grossly misused farewell sire my mission is discharged  so saying the count de crevecoeur left the apartment abruptly and without farther leave taking  after himafter himtake up the gauntlet and after him said the king i mean not you dunois nor you my lord of crawford who methinks may be too old for such hot frays nor you cousin of orleans who are too young for themmy lord cardinalmy lord bishop of auxerreit is your holy office to make peace among princes do you lift the gauntlet and remonstrate with count crevecoeur on the sin he has committed in thus insulting a great monarch in his own court and forcing us to bring the miseries of war upon his kingdom and that of his neighbour  upon this direct personal appeal the cardinal balue proceeded to lift the gauntlet with such precaution as one would touch an adderso great was apparently his aversion to this symbol of warand presently left the royal apartment to hasten after the challenger  louis paused and looked round the circle of his courtiers most of whom except such as we have already distinguished being men of low birth and raised to their rank in the kings household for other gifts than courage or feats of arms looked pale on each other and had obviously received an unpleasant impression from the scene which had been just acted louis gazed on them with contempt and then said aloud although the count of crevecoeur be presumptuous and overweening it must be confessed that in him the duke of burgundy hath as bold a servant as ever bore message for a prince i would i knew where to find as faithful an envoy to carry back my answer  you do your french nobles injustice sire said dunois not one of them but would carry a defiance to burgundy on the point of his sword  and sire said old crawford you wrong also the scottish gentlemen who serve you i or any of my followers being of meet rank would not hesitate a moment to call yonder proud count to a reckoning my own arm is yet strong enough for the purpose if i have but your majestys permission  but your majesty continued dunois will employ us in no service through which we may win honour to ourselves to your majesty or to france  say rather said the king that i will not give way dunois to the headlong impetuosity which on some punctilio of chivalry would wreck yourselves the throne france and all there is not one of you who knows not how precious every hour of peace is at this moment when so necessary to heal the wounds of a distracted country yet there is not one of you who would not rush into war on account of the tale of a wandering gipsy or of some errant damosel whose reputation perhaps is scarce higherhere comes the cardinal and we trust with more pacific tidingshow now my lordhave you brought the count to reason and to temper  sire said balue my task hath been difficult i put it to yonder proud count how he dared to use towards your majesty the presumptuous reproach with which his audience had broken up and which must be understood as proceeding not from his master but from his own insolence and as placing him therefore in your majestys discretion for what penalty you might think proper  you said right replied the king and what was his answer  the count continued the cardinal had at that moment his foot in the stirrup ready to mount and on hearing my expostulation he turned his head without altering his position had i said he been fifty leagues distant and had heard by report that a question vituperative of my prince had been asked by the king of france i had even at that distance instantly mounted and returned to disburden my mind of the answer which i gave him but now  i said sirs said the king turning around without any show of angry emotion that in the count philip of crevecoeur our cousin the duke possesses as worthy a servant as ever rode at a princes right handbut you prevailed with him to stay  to stay for twentyfour hours and in the meanwhile to receive again his gage of defiance said the cardinal he has dismounted at the fleur de lys  see that he be nobly attended and cared for at our charges said the king such a servant is a jewel in a princes crown twentyfour hours he added muttering to himself and looking as if he were stretching his eyes to see into futurity twentyfour hours it is of the shortest yet twentyfour hours ably and skilfully employed may be worth a year in the hand of indolent or incapable agentswellto the forestto the forest my gallant lordsorleans my fair kinsman lay aside that modesty though it becomes you mind not my joans coyness the loire may as soon avoid mingling with the cher as she from favouring your suit or you from preferring it he added as the unhappy prince moved slowly on after his betrothed bride and now for your boar spears gentlemenfor allegre my pricker hath harboured one that will try both dog and mandunois lend me your speartake mine it is too weighty for me but when did you complain of such a fault in your lanceto horseto horse gentlemen  and all the chase rode on    chapter ix the boar hunt       i will converse with unrespective boys      and iron witted fools  none are for me      that look into me with suspicious eyes       king richard   all the experience which the cardinal had been able to collect of his masters disposition did not upon the present occasion prevent his falling into a great error of policy his vanity induced him to think that he had been more successful in prevailing upon the count of crevecoeur to remain at tours than any other moderator whom the king might have employed would in all probability have been and as he was well aware of the importance which louis attached to the postponement of a war with the duke of burgundy he could not help showing that he conceived himself to have rendered the king great and acceptable service he pressed nearer to the kings person than he was wont to do and endeavoured to engage him in conversation on the events of the morning  this was injudicious in more respects than one for princes love not to see their subjects approach them with an air conscious of deserving and thereby seeming desirous to extort acknowledgment and recompense for their services and louis the most jealous monarch that ever lived was peculiarly averse and inaccessible to any one who seemed either to presume upon service rendered or to pry into his secrets  yet hurried away as the most cautious sometimes are by the self satisfied humour of the moment the cardinal continued to ride on the kings right hand turning the discourse whenever it was possible upon crevecoeur and his embassy which although it might be the matter at that moment most in the kings thoughts was nevertheless precisely that which he was least willing to converse on at length louis who had listened to him with attention yet without having returned any answer which could tend to prolong the conversation signed to dunois who rode at no great distance to come up on the other side of his horse  we came hither for sport and exercise said he but the reverend father here would have us hold a council of state  i hope your highness will excuse my assistance said dunois i am born to fight the battles of france and have heart and hand for that but i have no head for her councils  my lord cardinal hath a head turned for nothing else dunois answered louis he hath confessed crevecoeur at the castle gate and he hath communicated to us his whole shriftsaid you not the whole he continued with an emphasis on the word and a glance at the cardinal which shot from betwixt his long dark eyelashes as a dagger gleams when it leaves the scabbard  the cardinal trembled as endeavouring to reply to the kings jest he said that though his order were obliged to conceal the secrets of their penitents in general there was no sigillum confessionis seal of confession which could not be melted at his majestys breath  and as his eminence said the king is ready to communicate the secrets of others to us he naturally expects that we should be equally communicative to him and in order to get upon this reciprocal footing he is very reasonably desirous to know if these two ladies of croye be actually in our territories we are sorry we cannot indulge his curiosity not ourselves knowing in what precise place errant damsels disguised princesses distressed countesses may lie leaguer within our dominions which are we thank god and our lady of embrun rather too extensive for us to answer easily his eminences most reasonable inquiries but supposing they were with us what say you dunois to our cousins peremptory demand  i will answer you my liege if you will tell me in sincerity whether you want war or peace replied dunois with a frankness which while it arose out of his own native openness and intrepidity of character made him from time to time a considerable favourite with louis who like all astucious persons was as desirous of looking into the hearts of others as of concealing his own  by my halidome said he i should be as well contented as thyself dunois to tell thee my purpose did i myself but know it exactly but say i declared for war what should i do with this beautiful and wealthy young heiress supposing her to be in my dominions  bestow her in marriage on one of your own gallant followers who has a heart to love and an arm to protect her said dunois  upon thyself ha said the king pasques dieu thou art more politic than i took thee for with all thy bluntness  nay answered dunois i am aught except politic by our lady of orleans i come to the point at once as i ride my horse at the ring your majesty owes the house of orleans at least one happy marriage  and i will pay it count pasques dieu i will pay itsee you not yonder fair couple  the king pointed to the unhappy duke of orleans and the princess who neither daring to remain at a greater distance from the king nor in his sight appear separate from each other were riding side by side yet with an interval of two or three yards betwixt them a space which timidity on the one side and aversion on the other prevented them from diminishing while neither dared to increase it  dunois looked in the direction of the kings signal and as the situation of his unfortunate relative and the destined bride reminded him of nothing so much as of two dogs which forcibly linked together remain nevertheless as widely separated as the length of their collars will permit he could not help shaking his head though he ventured not on any other reply to the hypocritical tyrant louis seemed to guess his thoughts  it will be a peaceful and quiet household they will keepnot much disturbed with children i should augur but these are not always a blessing  here the king touches on the very purpose for which he pressed on the match with such tyrannic severity which was that as the princesss personal deformity admitted little chance of its being fruitful the branch of orleans which was next in succession to the crown might be by the want of heirs weakened or extinguished  it was perhaps the recollection of his own filial ingratitude that made the king pause as he uttered the last reflection and which converted the sneer that trembled on his lip into something resembling an expression of contrition but he instantly proceeded in another tone  frankly my dunois much as i revere the holy sacrament of matrimony here he crossed himself i would rather the house of orleans raised for me such gallant soldiers as thy father and thyself who share the blood royal of france without claiming its rights than that the country should be torn to pieces like to england by wars arising from the rivalry of legitimate candidates for the crown the lion should never have more than one cub  dunois sighed and was silent conscious that contradicting his arbitrary sovereign might well hurt his kinsmans interests but could do him no service yet he could not forbear adding in the next moment  since your majesty has alluded to the birth of my father i must needs own that setting the frailty of his parents on one side he might be termed happier and more fortunate as the son of lawless love than of conjugal hatred  thou art a scandalous fellow dunois to speak thus of holy wedlock answered louis jestingly but to the devil with the discourse for the boar is unharbouredlay on the dogs in the name of the holy saint hubertha ha tralalaliralaand the kings horn rang merrily through the woods as he pushed forward on the chase followed by two or three of his guards amongst whom was our friend quentin durward and here it was remarkable that even in the keen prosecution of his favourite sport the king in indulgence of his caustic disposition found leisure to amuse himself by tormenting cardinal balue  it was one of that able statesmans weaknesses as we have elsewhere hinted to suppose himself though of low rank and limited education qualified to play the courtier and the man of gallantry he did not indeed actually enter the lists of chivalrous combat like becket or levy soldiers like wolsey but gallantry in which they also were proficients was his professed pursuit and he likewise affected great fondness for the martial amusement of the chase yet however well he might succeed with certain ladies to whom his power his wealth and his influence as a statesman might atone for deficiencies in appearance and manners the gallant horses which he purchased at almost any price were totally insensible to the dignity of carrying a cardinal and paid no more respect to him than they would have done to his father the carter miller or tailor whom he rivalled in horsemanship the king knew this and by alternately exciting and checking his own horse he brought that of the cardinal whom he kept close by his side into such a state of mutiny against his rider that it became apparent they must soon part company and then in the midst of its starting bolting rearing and lashing out alternately the royal tormentor rendered the rider miserable by questioning him upon many affairs of importance and hinting his purpose to take that opportunity of communicating to him some of those secrets of state which the cardinal had but a little while before seemed so anxious to learn  in imputing to the cardinal a want of skill in horsemanship i recollected his adventure in paris when attacked by assassins on which occasion his mule being scared by the crowd ran away with the rider and taking its course to a monastery to the abbot of which he formerly belonged was the means of saving his masters life s  a more awkward situation could hardly be imagined than that of a privy councillor forced to listen to and reply to his sovereign while each fresh gambade of his unmanageable horse placed him in a new and more precarious attitudehis violet robe flying loose in every direction and nothing securing him from an instant and perilous fall save the depth of the saddle and its height before and behind dunois laughed without restraint while the king who had a private mode of enjoying his jest inwardly without laughing aloud mildly rebuked his minister on his eager passion for the chase which would not permit him to dedicate a few moments to business  i will no longer be your hindrance to a course continued he addressing the terrified cardinal and giving his own horse the rein at the same time  before balue could utter a word by way of answer or apology his horse seizing the bit with his teeth went forth at an uncontrollable gallop soon leaving behind the king and dunois who followed at a more regulated pace enjoying the statesmans distressed predicament if any of our readers has chanced to be run away with in his time as we ourselves have in ours he will have a full sense at once of the pain peril and absurdity of the situation those four limbs of the quadruped which noway under the riders control nor sometimes under that of the creature they more properly belong to fly at such a rate as if the hindermost meant to overtake the foremost those clinging legs of the biped which we so often wish safely planted on the greensward but which now only augment our distress by pressing the animals sidesthe hands which have forsaken the bridle for the manethe body which instead of sitting upright on the centre of gravity as old angelo a celebrated riding and fencing master at the beginning of the nineteenth century used to recommend or stooping forward like a jockeys at newmarket the scene of the annual horse races has been at newmarket heath since the time of james i lies rather than hangs crouched upon the back of the animal with no better chance of saving itself than a sack of corncombine to make a picture more than sufficiently ludicrous to spectators however uncomfortable to the exhibiter but add to this some singularity of dress or appearance on the part of the unhappy cavaliera robe of office a splendid uniform or any other peculiarity of costumeand let the scene of action be a race course a review a procession or any other place of concourse and public display and if the poor wight would escape being the object of a shout of inextinguishable laughter he must contrive to break a limb or two or which will be more effectual to be killed on the spot for on no slighter condition will his fall excite anything like serious sympathy on the present occasion the short violet coloured gown of the cardinal which he used as riding dress having changed his long robes before he left the castle his scarlet stockings and scarlet hat with the long strings hanging down together with his utter helplessness gave infinite zest to his exhibition of horsemanship  the horse having taken matters entirely into his own hand flew rather than galloped up a long green avenue overtook the pack in hard pursuit of the boar and then having overturned one or two yeomen prickers who little expected to be charged in the rearhaving ridden down several dogs and greatly confused the chaseanimated by the clamorous expostulations and threats of the huntsman carried the terrified cardinal past the formidable animal itself which was rushing on at a speedy trot furious and embossed with the foam which he churned around his tusks balue on beholding himself so near the boar set up a dreadful cry for help which or perhaps the sight of the boar produced such an effect on his horse that the animal interrupted its headlong career by suddenly springing to one side so that the cardinal who had long kept his seat only because the motion was straight forward now fell heavily to the ground the conclusion of balues chase took place so near the boar that had not the animal been at that moment too much engaged about his own affairs the vicinity might have proved as fatal to the cardinal as it is said to have done to favila king of the visigoths of spain he was killed by a bear while hunting the powerful churchman got off however for the fright and crawling as hastily as he could out of the way of hounds and huntsmen saw the whole chase sweep by him without affording him assistance for hunters in those days were as little moved by sympathy for such misfortunes as they are in our own the king as he passed said to dunois yonder lies his eminence low enoughhe is no great huntsman though for a fisher when a secret is to be caught he may match saint peter himself he has however for once i think met with his match  the cardinal did not hear the words but the scornful look with which they were spoken led him to suspect their general import the devil is said to seize such opportunities of temptation as were now afforded by the passions of balue bitterly moved as they had been by the scorn of the king the momentary fright was over so soon as he had assured himself that his fall was harmless but mortified vanity and resentment against his sovereign had a much longer influence on his feelings after all the chase had passed him a single cavalier who seemed rather to be a spectator than a partaker of the sport rode up with one or two attendants and expressed no small surprise to find the cardinal upon the ground without a horse or attendants and in such a plight as plainly showed the nature of the accident which had placed him there to dismount and offer his assistance in this predicamentto cause one of his attendants to resign a staid and quiet palfrey for the cardinals useto express his surprise at the customs of the french court which thus permitted them to abandon to the dangers of the chase and forsake in his need their wisest statesman were the natural modes of assistance and consolation which so strange a rencontre supplied to crevecoeur for it was the burgundian ambassador who came to the assistance of the fallen cardinal  he found the minister in a lucky time and humour for essaying some of those practices on his fidelity to which it is well known that balue had the criminal weakness to listen already in the morning as the jealous temper of louis had suggested more had passed betwixt them than the cardinal durst have reported to his master but although he had listened with gratified ears to the high value which he was assured by crevecoeur the duke of burgundy placed upon his person and talents and not without a feeling of temptation when the count hinted at the munificence of his masters disposition and the rich benefices of flanders it was not until the accident as we have related had highly irritated him that stung with wounded vanity he resolved in a fatal hour to show louis xi that no enemy can be so dangerous as an offended friend and confidant on the present occasions he hastily requested crevecoeur to separate from him lest they should be observed but appointed him a meeting for the evening in the abbey of saint martins at tours after vesper service and that in a tone which assured the burgundian that his master had obtained an advantage hardly to have been hoped for except in such a moment of exasperation in the meanwhile louis who though the most politic prince of his time upon this as on other occasions had suffered his passions to interfere with his prudence followed contentedly the chase of the wild boar which was now come to an interesting point it had so happened that a sounder ie in the language of the period a boar of only two years old had crossed the track of the proper object of the chase and withdrawn in pursuit of him all the dogs except two or three couples of old stanch hounds and the greater part of the huntsmen the king saw with internal glee dunois as well as others follow upon this false scent and enjoyed in secret the thought of triumphing over that accomplished knight in the art of venerie which was then thought almost as glorious as war louis was well mounted and followed close on the hounds so that when the original boar turned to bay in a marshy piece of ground there was no one near him but the king himself louis showed all the bravery and expertness of an experienced huntsman for unheeding the danger he rode up to the tremendous animal which was defending itself with fury against the dogs and struck him with his boar spear yet as the horse shied from the boar the blow was not so effectual as either to kill or disable him no effort could prevail on the horse to charge a second time so that the king dismounting advanced on foot against the furious animal holding naked in his hand one of those short sharp straight and pointed swords which huntsmen used for such encounters the boar instantly quitted the dogs to rush on his human enemy while the king taking his station and posting himself firmly presented the sword with the purpose of aiming it at the boars throat or rather chest within the collarbone in which case the weight of the beast and the impetuosity of its career would have served to accelerate its own destruction but owing to the wetness of the ground the kings foot slipped just as this delicate and perilous manoeuvre ought to have been accomplished so that the point of the sword encountering the cuirass of bristles on the outside of the creatures shoulder glanced off without making any impression and louis fell flat on the ground this was so far fortunate for the monarch because the animal owing to the kings fall missed his blow in his turn and in passing only rent with his tusk the kings short hunting cloak instead of ripping up his thigh but when after running a little ahead in the fury of his course the boar turned to repeat his attack on the king at the moment when he was rising the life of louis was in imminent danger at this critical moment quentin durward who had been thrown out in the chase by the slowness of his horse but who nevertheless had luckily distinguished and followed the blast of the kings horn rode up and transfixed the animal with his spear  the king who had by this time recovered his feet came in turn to durwards assistance and cut the animals throat with his sword before speaking a word to quentin he measured the huge creature not only by paces but even by feetthen wiped the sweat from his brow and the blood from his handsthen took off his hunting cap hung it on a bush and devoutly made his orisons to the little leaden images which it containedand at length looking upon durward said to him is it thou my young scotthou hast begun thy woodcraft well and maitre pierre owes thee as good entertainment as he gave thee at the fleur de lys yonderwhy dost thou not speak thou hast lost thy forwardness and fire methinks at the court where others find both  quentin as shrewd a youth as ever scottish breeze breathed caution into had imbibed more awe than confidence towards his dangerous master and was far too wise to embrace the perilous permission of familiarity which he seemed thus invited to use he answered in very few and well chosen words that if he ventured to address his majesty at all it could be but to crave pardon for the rustic boldness with which he had conducted himself when ignorant of his high rank  tush man said the king i forgive thy sauciness for thy spirit and shrewdness i admired how near thou didst hit upon my gossip tristans occupation you have nearly tasted of his handiwork since as i am given to understand i bid thee beware of him he is a merchant who deals in rough bracelets and tight necklaces help me to my horsei like thee and will do thee good build on no mans favour but minenot even on thine uncles or lord crawfordsand say nothing of thy timely aid in this matter of the boar for if a man makes boast that he has served a king in such pinch he must take the braggart humour for its own recompense  the king then winded his horn which brought up dunois and several attendants whose compliments he received on the slaughter of such a noble animal without scrupling to appropriate a much greater share of merit than actually belonged to him for he mentioned durwards assistance as slightly as a sportsman of rank who in boasting of the number of birds which he has bagged does not always dilate upon the presence and assistance of the gamekeeper he then ordered dunois to see that the boars carcass was sent to the brotherhood of saint martin at tours to mend their fare on holydays and that they might remember the king in their private devotions  and said louis who hath seen his eminence my lord cardinal methinks it were but poor courtesy and cold regard to holy church to leave him afoot here in the forest  may it please you said quentin when he saw that all were silent i saw his lordship the cardinal accommodated with a horse on which he left the forest  heaven cares for its own replied the king set forward to the castle my lords well hunt no more this morningyou sir squire addressing quentin reach me my wood knifeit has dropt from the sheath beside the quarry there ride on dunoisi follow instantly  louis whose lightest motions were often conducted like stratagems thus gained an opportunity to ask quentin privately my bonny scot thou hast an eye i see canst thou tell me who helped the cardinal to a palfreysome stranger i should suppose for as i passed without stopping the courtiers would likely be in no hurry to do him such a timely good turn  i saw those who aided his eminence but an instant sire said quentin it was only a hasty glance for i had been unluckily thrown out and was riding fast to be in my place but i think it was the ambassador of burgundy and his people  ha said louis well be it so france will match them yet  there was nothing more remarkable happened and the king with his retinue returned to the castle    chapter x the sentinel       where should this music be  i the air or the earth       the tempest       i was all ear      and took in strains that might create a soul      under the ribs of death       comus   quentin had hardly reached his little cabin in order to make some necessary changes in his dress when his worthy relation required to know the full particulars of all that had befallen him at the hunt  the youth who could not help thinking that his uncles hand was probably more powerful than his understanding took care in his reply to leave the king in full possession of the victory which he had seemed desirous to appropriate le balafres reply was a boast of how much better he himself would have behaved in the like circumstances and it was mixed with a gentle censure of his nephews slackness in not making in to the kings assistance when he might be in imminent peril the youth had prudence in answer to abstain from all farther indication of his own conduct except that according to the rules of woodcraft he held it ungentle to interfere with the game attacked by another hunter unless he was specially called upon for his assistance the discussion was scarcely ended when occasion was afforded quentin to congratulate himself for observing some reserve towards his kinsman a low tap at the door announced a visitorit was presently opened and oliver dain or mauvais or diable for by all these names he was known entered the apartment  this able but most unprincipled man has been already described in so far as his exterior is concerned the aptest resemblance of his motions and manners might perhaps be to those of a domestic cat which while couching in seeming slumber or gliding through the apartment with slow stealthy and timid steps is now engaged in watching the hole of some unfortunate mouse now in rubbing herself with apparent confidence and fondness against those by whom she desires to be caressed and presently after is flying upon her prey or scratching perhaps the very object of her former cajolements  he entered with stooping shoulders a humble and modest look and threw such a degree of civility into his address to the seignior balafre that no one who saw the interview could have avoided concluding that he came to ask a boon of the scottish archer he congratulated lesly on the excellent conduct of his young kinsman in the chase that day which he observed had attracted the kings particular attention he here paused for a reply and with his eyes fixed on the ground save just when once or twice they stole upwards to take a side glance at quentin he heard balafre observe that his majesty had been unlucky in not having himself by his side instead of his nephew as he would questionless have made in and speared the brute a matter which he understood quentin had left upon his majestys royal hands so far as he could learn the story  but it will be a lesson to his majesty he said while he lives to mount a man of my inches on a better horse for how could my great hill of a flemish dray horse keep up with his majestys norman runner i am sure i spurred till his sides were furrowed it is ill considered master oliver and you must represent it to his majesty  master oliver only replied to this observation by turning towards the bold bluff speaker one of those slow dubious glances which accompanied by a slight motion of the hand and a gentle depression of the head to one side may be either interpreted as a mute assent to what is said or as a cautious deprecation of farther prosecution of the subject it was a keener more scrutinizing glance which he bent on the youth as he said with an ambiguous smile so young man is it the wont of scotland to suffer your princes to be endangered for the lack of aid in such emergencies as this of today  it is our custom answered quentin determined to throw no farther light on the subject not to encumber them with assistance in honourable pastimes when they can aid themselves without it we hold that a prince in a hunting field must take his chance with others and that he comes there for the very purpose what were woodcraft without fatigue and without danger  you hear the silly boy said his uncle that is always the way with him he hath an answer or a reason ready to be rendered to every one i wonder whence he hath caught the gift i never could give a reason for anything i have ever done in my life except for eating when i was ahungry calling the muster roll and such points of duty as the like  and pray worthy seignior said the royal tonsor looking at him from under his eyelids what might your reason be for calling the muster roll on such occasions  because the captain commanded me said le balafre by saint giles patron saint of lepers beggars and cripples he has been especially venerated in england and scotland i know no other reason if he had commanded tyrie or cunningham they must have done the same  a most military final cause said oliver but seignior le balafre you will be glad doubtless to learn that his majesty is so far from being displeased with your nephews conduct that he hath selected him to execute a piece of duty this afternoon  selected him said balafre in great surpriseselected me i suppose you mean  i mean precisely as i speak replied the barber in a mild but decided tone the king hath a commission with which to intrust your nephew  why wherefore and for what reason said balafre why doth he choose the boy and not me  i can go no farther back than your own ultimate cause seignior le balafre such are his majestys commands but said he if i might use the presumption to form a conjecture it may be his majesty hath work to do fitter for a youth like your nephew than for an experienced warrior like yourself seignior balafrewherefore young gentleman get your weapons and follow me bring with you a harquebuss for you are to mount sentinel  sentinel said the uncle are you sure you are right master oliver the inner guards of the castle have ever been mounted by those only who have like me served twelve years in our honourable body  i am quite certain of his majestys pleasure said oliver and must no longer delay executing it  but said le balafre my nephew is not even a free archer being only an esquire serving under my lance  pardon me answered oliver the king sent for the register not half an hour since and enrolled him among the guard have the goodness to assist to put your nephew in order for the service  balafre who had no ill nature or even much jealousy in his disposition hastily set about adjusting his nephews dress and giving him directions for his conduct under arms but was unable to refrain from larding them with interjections of surprise at such lucks chancing to fall upon the young man so early  it had never taken place before in the scottish guard he said not even in his own instance but doubtless his service must be to mount guard over the popinjays and indian peacocks which the venetian ambassador had lately presented to the kingit could be nothing else and such duty being only fit for a beardless boy here he twirled his own grim mustaches he was glad the lot had fallen on his fair nephew  quick and sharp of wit as well as ardent in fancy quentin saw visions of higher importance in this early summons to the royal presence and his heart beat high at the anticipation of rising into speedy distinction he determined carefully to watch the manners and language of his conductor which he suspected must in some cases at least be interpreted by contraries as soothsayers are said to discover the interpretation of dreams he could not but hug himself on having observed strict secrecy on the events of the chase and then formed a resolution which for so young a person had much prudence in it that while he breathed the air of this secluded and mysterious court he would keep his thoughts locked in his bosom and his tongue under the most careful regulation  his equipment was soon complete and with his harquebuss on his shoulder for though they retained the name of archers the scottish guard very early substituted firearms for the long bow in the use of which their nation never excelled he followed master oliver out of the barrack  his uncle looked long after him with a countenance in which wonder was blended with curiosity and though neither envy nor the malignant feelings which it engenders entered into his honest meditations there was yet a sense of wounded or diminished self importance which mingled with the pleasure excited by his nephews favourable commencement of service  he shook his head gravely opened a privy cupboard took out a large bottrine of stout old wine shook it to examine how low the contents had ebbed filled and drank a hearty cup then took his seat half reclining on the great oaken settle and having once again slowly shaken his head received so much apparent benefit from the oscillation that like the toy called a mandarin he continued the motion until he dropped into a slumber from which he was first roused by the signal to dinner  when quentin durward left his uncle to these sublime meditations he followed his conductor master oliver who without crossing any of the principal courts led him partly through private passages exposed to the open air but chiefly through a maze of stairs vaults and galleries communicating with each other by secret doors and at unexpected points into a large and spacious latticed gallery which from its breadth might have been almost termed a hall hung with tapestry more ancient than beautiful and with a very few of the hard cold ghastly looking pictures belonging to the first dawn of the arts which preceded their splendid sunrise these were designed to represent the paladins of charlemagne who made such a distinguished figure in the romantic history of france and as this gigantic form of the celebrated orlando constituted the most prominent figure the apartment acquired from him the title of rolandos hall or rolands gallery  charlemagne was accounted a saint during the dark ages and louis xi as one of his successors honoured his shrine with peculiar observance s  orlando also called roland his history may be read in the chanson de roland  you will keep watch here said oliver in a low whisper as if the hard delineations of monarchs and warriors around could have been offended at the elevation of his voice or as if he had feared to awaken the echoes that lurked among the groined vaults and gothic drop work on the ceiling of this huge and dreary apartment  what are the orders and signs of my watch answered quentin in the same suppressed tone  is your harquebuss loaded replied oliver without answering his query  that answered quentin is soon done and proceeded to charge his weapon and to light the slow match by which when necessary it was discharged at the embers of a wood fire which was expiring in the huge hall chimneya chimney itself so large that it might have been called a gothic closet or chapel appertaining to the hall  when this was performed oliver told him that he was ignorant of one of the high privileges of his own corps which only received orders from the king in person or the high constable of france in lieu of their own officers you are placed here by his majestys command young man added oliver and you will not be long here without knowing wherefore you are summoned meantime your walk extends along this gallery you are permitted to stand still while you list but on no account to sit down or quit your weapon you are not to sing aloud or whistle upon any account but you may if you list mutter some of the churchs prayers or what else you list that has no offence in it in a low voice farewell and keep good watch  good watch thought the youthful soldier as his guide stole away from him with that noiseless gliding step which was peculiar to him and vanished through a side door behind the arras  good watch but upon whom and against whomfor what save bats or rats are there here to contend with unless these grim old representatives of humanity should start into life for the disturbance of my guard well it is my duty i suppose and i must perform it  with the vigorous purpose of discharging his duty even to the very rigour he tried to while away the time with some of the pious hymns which he had learned in the convent in which he had found shelter after the death of his fatherallowing in his own mind that but for the change of a novices frock for the rich military dress which he now wore his soldierly walk in the royal gallery of france resembled greatly those of which he had tired excessively in the cloistered seclusion of aberbrothick  presently as if to convince himself he now belonged not to the cell but to the world he chanted to himself but in such tone as not to exceed the license given to him some of the ancient rude ballads which the old family harper had taught him of the defeat of the danes at aberlemno and forres the murder of king duffus at forfar and other pithy sonnets and lays which appertained to the history of his distant native country and particularly of the district to which he belonged this wore away a considerable space of time and it was now more than two hours past noon when quentin was reminded by his appetite that the good fathers of aberbrothick however strict in demanding his attendance upon the hours of devotion were no less punctual in summoning him to those of refection whereas here in the interior of a royal palace after a morning spent in exercise and a noon exhausted in duty no man seemed to consider it as a natural consequence that he must be impatient for his dinner  there are however charms in sweet sounds which can lull to rest even the natural feelings of impatience by which quentin was now visited at the opposite extremities of the long hall or gallery were two large doors ornamented with heavy architraves probably opening into different suites of apartments to which the gallery served as a medium of mutual communication as the sentinel directed his solitary walk betwixt these two entrances which formed the boundary of his duty he was startled by a strain of music which was suddenly waked near one of those doors and which at least in his imagination was a combination of the same lute and voice by which he had been enchanted on the preceding day all the dreams of yesterday morning so much weakened by the agitating circumstances which he had since undergone again arose more vivid from their slumber and planted on the spot where his ear could most conveniently drink in the sounds quentin remained with his harquebuss shouldered his mouth half open ear eye and soul directed to the spot rather the picture of a sentinel than a living formwithout any other idea than that of catching if possible each passing sound of the dulcet melody  these delightful sounds were but partially heardthey languished lingered ceased entirely and were from time to time renewed after uncertain intervals but besides that music like beauty is often most delightful or at least most interesting to the imagination when its charms are but partially displayed and the imagination is left to fill up what is from distance but imperfectly detailed quentin had matter enough to fill up his reverie during the intervals of fascination he could not doubt from the report of his uncles comrades and the scene which had passed in the presence chamber that morning that the siren who thus delighted his ears was not as he had profanely supposed the daughter or kinswoman of a base cabaretier inn keeper but the same disguised and distressed countess for whose cause kings and princes were now about to buckle on armour and put lance in rest a hundred wild dreams such as romantic and adventurous youth readily nourished in a romantic and adventurous age chased from his eyes the bodily presentiment of the actual scene and substituted their own bewildering delusions when at once and rudely they were banished by a rough grasp laid upon his weapon and a harsh voice which exclaimed close to his ear ha pasques dieu sir squire methinks you keep sleepy ward  the voice was the tuneless yet impressive and ironical tone of maitre pierre and quentin suddenly recalled to himself saw with shame and fear that he had in his reverie permitted louis himselfentering probably by some secret door and gliding along by the wall or behind the tapestryto approach him so nearly as almost to master his weapon  the first impulse of his surprise was to free his harquebuss by a violent exertion which made the king stagger backward into the hall his next apprehension was that in obeying the animal instinct as it may be termed which prompts a brave man to resist an attempt to disarm him he had aggravated by a personal struggle with the king the displeasure produced by the negligence with which he had performed his duty upon guard and under this impression he recovered his harquebuss without almost knowing what he did and having again shouldered it stood motionless before the monarch whom he had reason to conclude he had mortally offended  louis whose tyrannical disposition was less founded on natural ferocity or cruelty of temper than on cold blooded policy and jealous suspicion had nevertheless a share of that caustic severity which would have made him a despot in private conversation and he always seemed to enjoy the pain which he inflicted on occasions like the present but he did not push his triumph far and contented himself with saying thy service of the morning hath already overpaid some negligence in so young a soldierhast thou dined  quentin who rather looked to be sent to the provost marshal than greeted with such a compliment answered humbly in the negative  poor lad said louis in a softer tone than he usually spoke in hunger hath made him drowsyi know thine appetite is a wolf he continued and i will save thee from one wild beast as thou didst me from another thou hast been prudent too in that matter and i thank thee for itcanst thou yet hold out an hour without food  fourandtwenty sire replied durward or i were no true scot  i would not for another kingdom be the pasty which should encounter thee after such a vigil said the king but the question now is not of thy dinner but of my own i admit to my table this day and in strict privacy the cardinal balue and this burgundianthis count de crevecoeurand something may chance the devil is most busy when foes meet on terms of truce  he stopped and remained silent with a deep and gloomy look as the king was in no haste to proceed quentin at length ventured to ask what his duty was to be in these circumstances  to keep watch at the beauffet with thy loaded weapon said louis and if there is treason to shoot the traitor  treason sire and in this guarded castle exclaimed durward  you think it impossible said the king not offended it would seem by his frankness but our history has shown that treason can creep into an auger holetreason excluded by guards oh thou silly boyquis custodiat ipsos custodeswho shall exclude the treason of those very warders  their scottish honour answered durward boldly  true most rightthou pleasest me said the king cheerfully the scottish honour was ever true and i trust it accordingly but treasonhere he relapsed into his former gloomy mood and traversed the apartment with unequal stepsshe sits at our feasts she sparkles in our bowls she wears the beard of our counsellors the smiles of our courtiers the crazy laugh of our jestersabove all she lies hid under the friendly air of a reconciled enemy louis of orleans trusted john of burgundyhe was murdered in the rue barbette john of burgundy trusted the faction of orleanshe was murdered on the bridge of montereaui will trust no oneno one hark ye i will keep my eye on that insolent count ay and on the churchman too whom i hold not too faithful when i say ecosse en avant forward scotland shoot crevecoeur dead on the spot  it is my duty said quentin your majestys life being endangered  certainlyi mean it no otherwise said the king what should i get by slaying this insolent soldierwere it the constable saint paul indeedhere he paused as if he thought he had said a word too much but resumed laughing our brotherinlaw james of scotlandyour own james quentinponiarded the douglas when on a hospitable visit within his own royal castle of skirling  douglas the allusion in the text is to the fate of james earl of douglas who upon the faith of a safe conduct after several acts of rebellion visited james the second in the castle of stirling the king stabbed douglas who received his mortal wound from sir patrick grey one of the kings attendants  of stirling said quentin and so please your highnessit was a deed of which came little good  stirling call you the castle said the king overlooking the latter part of quentins speech well let it be stirlingthe name is nothing to the purpose but i meditate no injury to these mennoneit would serve me nothing they may not purpose equally fair by mei rely on thy harquebuss  i shall be prompt at the signal said quentin but yet  you hesitate said the king speak outi give thee full leave from such as thou art hints may be caught that are right valuable  i would only presume to say replied quentin that your majesty having occasion to distrust this burgundian i marvel that you suffer him to approach so near your person and that in privacy  oh content you sir squire said the king there are some dangers which when they are braved disappear and which yet when there is an obvious and apparent dread of them displayed become certain and inevitable when i walk boldly up to a surly mastiff and caress him it is ten to one i soothe him to good temper if i show fear of him he flies on me and rends me i will be thus far frank with theeit concerns me nearly that this man returns not to his headlong master in a resentful humour i run my risk therefore i have never shunned to expose my life for the weal of my kingdom follow me  louis led his young life guardsman for whom he seemed to have taken a special favour through the side door by which he had himself entered saying as he showed it him he who would thrive at court must know the private wickets and concealed staircasesay and the traps and pitfalls of the palace as well as the principal entrances folding doors and portals  after several turns and passages the king entered a small vaulted room where a table was prepared for dinner with three covers the whole furniture and arrangements of the room were plain almost to meanness a beauffet or folding and movable cupboard held a few pieces of gold and silver plate and was the only article in the chamber which had in the slightest degree the appearance of royalty behind this cupboard and completely hidden by it was the post which louis assigned to quentin durward and after having ascertained by going to different parts of the room that he was invisible from all quarters he gave him his last charge remember the word posse en avant and so soon as ever i utter these sounds throw down the screenspare not for cup or goblet and be sure thou take good aim at crevecoeurif thy piece fail cling to him and use thy knifeoliver and i can deal with the cardinal  having thus spoken he whistled aloud and summoned into the apartment oliver who was premier valet of the chamber as well as barber and who in fact performed all offices immediately connected with the kings person and who now appeared attended by two old men who were the only assistants or waiters at the royal table so soon as the king had taken his place the visitors were admitted and quentin though himself unseen was so situated as to remark all the particulars of the interview  the king welcomed his visitors with a degree of cordiality which quentin had the utmost difficulty to reconcile with the directions which he had previously received and the purpose for which he stood behind the beauffet with his deadly weapon in readiness not only did louis appear totally free from apprehension of any kind but one would have supposed that those visitors whom he had done the high honour to admit to his table were the very persons in whom he could most unreservedly confide and whom he was most willing to honour nothing could be more dignified and at the same time more courteous than his demeanour while all around him including even his own dress was far beneath the splendour which the petty princes of the kingdom displayed in their festivities his own language and manners were those of a mighty sovereign in his most condescending mood quentin was tempted to suppose either that the whole of his previous conversation with louis had been a dream or that the dutiful demeanour of the cardinal and the frank open and gallant bearing of the burgundian noble had entirely erased the kings suspicion  but whilst the guests in obedience to the king were in the act of placing themselves at the table his majesty darted one keen glance on them and then instantly directed his look to quentins post this was done in an instant but the glance conveyed so much doubt and hatred towards his guests such a peremptory injunction on quentin to be watchful in attendance and prompt in execution that no room was left for doubting that the sentiments of louis continued unaltered and his apprehensions unabated he was therefore more than ever astonished at the deep veil under which that monarch was able to conceal the movements of his jealous disposition  appearing to have entirely forgotten the language which crevecoeur had held towards him in the face of his court the king conversed with him of old times of events which had occurred during his own exile in the territories of burgundy and inquired respecting all the nobles with whom he had been then familiar as if that period had indeed been the happiest of his life and as if he retained towards all who had contributed to soften the term of his exile the kindest and most grateful sentiments  to an ambassador of another nation he said i would have thrown something of state into our reception but to an old friend who often shared my board at the castle of genappes during his residence in burgundy in his fathers lifetime genappes was the usual abode of louis s i wished to show myself as i love best to live old louis of valois as simple and plain as any of his parisian badauds idlers but i directed them to make some better cheer than ordinary for you sir count for i know your burgundian proverb mieux vault bon repas que bel habit a good meal is better than a beautiful coat present spelling is vaut and therefore i bid them have some care of our table for our wine you know well it is the subject of an old emulation betwixt france and burgundy which we will presently reconcile for i will drink to you in burgundy and you sir count shall pledge me in champagnehere oliver let me have a cup of vin dauxerre and he hummed gaily a song then well known        auxerre est le boisson des rois       auxerre wine is the beverage of kings   here sir count i drink to the health of the noble duke of burgundy our kind and loving cousinoliver replenish yon golden cup with vin de rheims and give it to the count on your kneehe represents our loving brothermy lord cardinal we will ourself fill your cup  you have already sire even to overflowing said the cardinal with the lowly mien of a favourite towards an indulgent master  because we know that your eminence can carry it with a steady hand said louis but which side do you espouse in the great controversy sillery or auxerrefrance or burgundy  i will stand neutral sire said the cardinal and replenish my cup with auvernat  a neutral has a perilous part to sustain said the king but as he observed the cardinal colour somewhat he glided from the subject and added but you prefer the auvernat because it is so noble a wine it endures not wateryou sir count hesitate to empty your cup i trust you have found no national bitterness at the bottom  i would sire said the count de crevecoeur that all national quarrels could be as pleasantly ended as the rivalry betwixt our vineyards  with time sir count answered the king with timesuch time as you have taken to your draught of champagneand now that it is finished favour me by putting the goblet in your bosom and keeping it as a pledge of our regard it is not to every one that we would part with it it belonged of yore to that terror of france henry v of england and was taken when rouen was reduced and those islanders expelled from normandy by the joint arms of france and burgundy it cannot be better bestowed than on a noble and valiant burgundian who well knows that on the union of these two nations depends the continuance of the freedom of the continent from the english yoke  the count made a suitable answer and louis gave unrestrained way to the satirical gaiety of disposition which sometimes enlivened the darker shades of his character leading of course the conversation his remarks always shrewd and caustic and often actually witty were seldom good natured and the anecdotes with which he illustrated them were often more humorous than delicate but in no one word syllable or letter did he betray the state of mind of one who apprehensive of assassination hath in his apartment an armed soldier with his piece loaded in order to prevent or anticipate an attack on his person  the count de crevecoeur gave frankly in to the kings humour the nature of louis xis coarse humour may be guessed at by those who have perused the cent nouvelles nouvelles which are grosser than most similar collections of the age s while the smooth churchman laughed at every jest and enhanced every ludicrous idea without exhibiting any shame at expressions which made the rustic young scot blush even in his place of concealment in about an hour and a half the tables were drawn and the king taking courteous leave of his guests gave the signal that it was his desire to be alone  so soon as all even oliver had retired he called quentin from his place of concealment but with a voice so faint that the youth could scarcely believe it to be the same which had so lately given animation to the jest and zest to the tale as he approached he saw an equal change in his countenance the light of assumed vivacity had left the kings eyes the smile had deserted his face and he exhibited all the fatigue of a celebrated actor when he has finished the exhausting representation of some favourite character in which while upon the stage he had displayed the utmost vivacity  thy watch is not yet over said he to quentin refresh thyself for an instantyonder table affords the means i will then instruct thee in thy farther duty meanwhile it is ill talking between a full man and a fasting  he threw himself back on his seat covered his brow with his hand and was silent    chapter xi the hall of roland       painters show cupid blindhath hymen eyes      or is his sight warpd by those spectacles      which parents guardians and advisers lent him      that he may look through them on lands and mansions      on jewels gold and all such rich dotations      and see their value ten times magnified      methinks t will brook a question       the miseries of enforced marriage   louis xi of france though the sovereign in europe who was fondest and most jealous of power desired only its substantial enjoyment and though he knew well enough and at times exacted strictly the observances due to his rank he was in general singularly careless of show  in a prince of sounder moral qualities the familiarity with which he invited subjects to his boardnay occasionally sat at theirsmust have been highly popular and even such as he was the kings homeliness of manners atoned for many of his vices with that class of his subjects who were not particularly exposed to the consequences of his suspicion and jealousy the tiers etat or commons of france who rose to more opulence and consequence under the reign of this sagacious prince respected his person though they loved him not and it was resting on their support that he was enabled to make his party good against the hatred of the nobles who conceived that he diminished the honour of the french crown and obscured their own splendid privileges by that very neglect of form which gratified the citizens and commons  with patience which most other princes would have considered as degrading and not without a sense of amusement the monarch of france waited till his life guardsman had satisfied the keenness of a youthful appetite it may be supposed however that quentin had too much sense and prudence to put the royal patience to a long or tedious proof and indeed he was repeatedly desirous to break off his repast ere louis would permit him  i see it in thine eye he said good naturedly that thy courage is not half abated go ongod and saint denischarge again i tell thee that meat and mass crossing himself never hindered the work of a good christian man take a cup of wine but mind thou be cautious of the wine potit is the vice of thy countrymen as well as of the english who lacking that folly are the choicest soldiers ever wore armour and now wash speedilyforget not thy benedicite and follow me  quentin obeyed and conducted by a different but as mazelike an approach as he had formerly passed he followed louis into the hall of roland  take notice said the king imperatively thou hast never left this postlet that be thine answer to thy kinsman and comradesand hark thee to bind the recollection on thy memory i give thee this gold chain flinging on his arm one of considerable value if i go not brave myself those whom i trust have ever the means to ruffle it with the best but when such chains as these bind not the tongue from wagging too freely my gossip lhermite hath an amulet for the throat which never fails to work a certain cure and now attendno man save oliver or i myself enters here this evening but ladies will come hither perhaps from the one extremity of the hall perhaps from the other perhaps one from each you may answer if they address you but being on duty your answer must be brief and you must neither address them in your turn nor engage in any prolonged discourse but hearken to what they say thine ears as well as thy hands are minei have bought thee body and soul therefore if thou hearest aught of their conversation thou must retain it in memory until it is communicated to me and then forget it and now i think better on it it will be best that thou pass for a scottish recruit who hath come straight down from his mountains and hath not yet acquired our most christian languagerightso if they speak to thee thou wilt not answerthis will free you from embarrassment and lead them to converse without regard to your presence you understand mefarewell be wary and thou hast a friend  the king had scarce spoken these words ere he disappeared behind the arras leaving quentin to meditate on what he had seen and heard the youth was in one of those situations from which it is pleasanter to look forward than to look back for the reflection that he had been planted like a marksman in a thicket who watches for a stag to take the life of the noble count of crevecoeur had in it nothing ennobling it was very true that the kings measures seemed on this occasion merely cautionary and defensive but how did the youth know but he might be soon commanded on some offensive operation of the same kind this would be an unpleasant crisis since it was plain from the character of his master that there would be destruction in refusing while his honour told him that there would be disgrace in complying he turned his thoughts from this subject of reflection with the sage consolation so often adopted by youth when prospective dangers intrude themselves on their mind that it was time enough to think what was to be done when the emergence actually arrived and that sufficient for the day was the evil thereof  quentin made use of this sedative reflection the more easily that the last commands of the king had given him something more agreeable to think of than his own condition the lady of the lute was certainly one of those to whom his attention was to be dedicated and well in his mind did he promise to obey one part of the kings mandate and listen with diligence to every word that might drop from her lips that he might know if the magic of her conversation equalled that of her music but with as much sincerity did he swear to himself that no part of her discourse should be reported by him to the king which might affect the fair speaker otherwise than favourably  meantime there was no fear of his again slumbering on his post each passing breath of wind which finding its way through the open lattice waved the old arras sounded like the approach of the fair object of his expectation he felt in short all that mysterious anxiety and eagerness of expectation which is always the companion of love and sometimes hath a considerable share in creating it  at length a door actually creaked and jingled for the doors even of palaces did not in the fifteenth century turn on their hinges so noiseless as ours but alas it was not at that end of the hall from which the lute had been heard it opened however and a female figure entered followed by two others whom she directed by a sign to remain without while she herself came forward into the hall by her imperfect and unequal gait which showed to peculiar disadvantage as she traversed this long gallery quentin at once recognised the princess joan and with the respect which became his situation drew himself up in an attitude of silent vigilance and lowered his weapon to her as she passed she acknowledged the courtesy by a gracious inclination of her head and he had an opportunity of seeing her countenance more distinctly than he had in the morning  there was little in the features of this ill fated princess to atone for the misfortune of her shape and gait her face was indeed by no means disagreeable in itself though destitute of beauty and there was a meek impression of suffering patience in her large blue eyes which were commonly fixed upon the ground but besides that she was extremely pallid in complexion her skin had the yellowish discoloured tinge which accompanies habitual bad health and though her teeth were white and regular her lips were thin and pale the princess had a profusion of flaxen hair but it was so light coloured as to be almost of a bluish tinge and her tire woman who doubtless considered the luxuriance of her mistresss tresses as a beauty had not greatly improved matters by arranging them in curls around her pale countenance to which they added an expression almost corpselike and unearthly to make matters still worse she had chosen a vest or cymar of a pale green silk which gave her on the whole a ghastly and even spectral appearance  while quentin followed this singular apparition with eyes in which curiosity was blended with compassion for every look and motion of the princess seemed to call for the latter feeling two ladies entered from the upper end of the apartment  one of these was the young person who upon louiss summons had served him with fruit while quentin made his memorable breakfast at the fleur de lys invested now with all the mysterious dignity belonging to the nymph of the veil and lute and proved besides at least in quentins estimation to be the high born heiress of a rich earldom her beauty made ten times the impression upon him which it had done when he beheld in her one whom he deemed the daughter of a paltry innkeeper in attendance upon a rich and humorous old burgher he now wondered what fascination could ever have concealed from him her real character yet her dress was nearly as simple as before being a suit of deep mourning without any ornaments her headdress was but a veil of crape which was entirely thrown back so as to leave her face uncovered and it was only quentins knowledge of her actual rank which gave in his estimation new elegance to her beautiful shape a dignity to her step which had before remained unnoticed and to her regular features brilliant complexion and dazzling eyes an air of conscious nobleness that enhanced their beauty  had death been the penalty durward must needs have rendered to this beauty and her companion the same homage which he had just paid to the royalty of the princess they received it as those who were accustomed to the deference of inferiors and returned it with courtesy but he thoughtperhaps it was but a youthful visionthat the young lady coloured slightly kept her eyes on the ground and seemed embarrassed though in a trifling degree as she returned his military salutation this must have been owing to her recollection of the audacious stranger in the neighbouring turret at the fleur de lys but did that discomposure express displeasure this question he had no means to determine  the companion of the youthful countess dressed like herself simply and in deep mourning was at the age when women are apt to cling most closely to that reputation for beauty which has for years been diminishing she had still remains enough to show what the power of her charms must once have been and remembering past triumphs it was evident from her manner that she had not relinquished the pretensions to future conquests she was tall and graceful though somewhat haughty in her deportment and returned the salute of quentin with a smile of gracious condescension whispering the next instant something into her companions ear who turned towards the soldier as if to comply with some hint from the elder lady but answered nevertheless without raising her eyes quentin could not help suspecting that the observation called on the young lady to notice his own good mien and he was i do not know why pleased with the idea that the party referred to did not choose to look at him in order to verify with her own eyes the truth of the observation probably he thought there was already a sort of mysterious connexion beginning to exist between them which gave importance to the slightest trifle  this reflection was momentary for he was instantly wrapped up in attention to the meeting of the princess joan with these stranger ladies she had stood still upon their entrance in order to receive them conscious perhaps that motion did not become her well and as she was somewhat embarrassed in receiving and repaying their compliments the elder stranger ignorant of the rank of the party whom she addressed was led to pay her salutation in a manner rather as if she conferred than received an honour through the interview  i rejoice she said with a smile which was meant to express condescension at once and encouragement that we are at length permitted the society of such a respectable person of our own sex as you appear to be i must say that my niece and i have had but little for which to thank the hospitality of king louisnay niece never pluck my sleevei am sure i read in the looks of this young lady sympathy for out situationsince we came hither fair madam we have been used little better than mere prisoners and after a thousand invitations to throw our cause and our persons under the protection of france the most christian king has afforded us at first but a base inn for our residence and now a corner of this moth eaten palace out of which we are only permitted to creep towards sunset as if we were bats or owls whose appearance in the sunshine is to be held matter of ill omen  i am sorry said the princess faltering with the awkward embarrassment of the interview that we have been unable hitherto to receive you according to your desertsyour niece i trust is better satisfied  muchmuch better than i can express answered the youthful countess i sought but safety and i have found solitude and secrecy besides the seclusion of our former residence and the still greater solitude of that now assigned to us augment in my eye the favour which the king vouchsafed to us unfortunate fugitives  silence my silly cousin said the elder lady and let us speak according to our conscience since at last we are alone with one of our own sexi say alone for that handsome young soldier is a mere statue since he seems not to have the use of his limbs and i am given to understand he wants that of his tongue at least in civilized languagei say since no one but this lady can understand us i must own there is nothing i have regretted equal to taking this french journey i looked for a splendid reception tournaments carousals pageants and festivals instead of which all has been seclusion and obscurity and the best society whom the king introduced to us was a bohemian vagabond by whose agency he directed us to correspond with our friends in flandersperhaps said the lady it is his politic intention to mew us up here until our lives end that he may seize on our estates after the extinction of the ancient house of croye the duke of burgundy was not so cruel he offered my niece a husband though he was a bad one  i should have thought the veil preferable to an evil husband said the princess with difficulty finding opportunity to interpose a word  one would at least wish to have the choice madam replied the voluble dame it is heaven knows on account of my niece that i speak for myself i have long laid aside thoughts of changing my condition i see you smile but by my halidome it is trueyet that is no excuse for the king whose conduct like his person hath more resemblance to that of old michaud the moneychanger of ghent than to the successor of charlemagne  hold said the princess with some asperity in her tone remember you speak of my father  of your father replied the burgundian lady in surprise  of my father repeated the princess with dignity i am joan of francebut fear not madam she continued in the gentle accent which was natural to her you designed no offence and i have taken none command my influence to render your exile and that of this interesting young person more supportable alas it is but little i have in my power but it is willingly offered  deep and submissive was the reverence with which the countess hameline de croye so was the elder lady called received the obliging offer of the princesss protection she had been long the inhabitant of courts was mistress of the manners which are there acquired and held firmly the established rule of courtiers of all ages who although their usual private conversation turns upon the vices and follies of their patrons and on the injuries and neglect which they themselves have sustained never suffer such hints to drop from them in the presence of the sovereign or those of his family the lady was therefore scandalised to the last degree at the mistake which had induced her to speak so indecorously in presence of the daughter of louis she would have exhausted herself in expressing regret and making apologies had she not been put to silence and restored to equanimity by the princess who requested in the most gentle manner yet which from a daughter of france had the weight of a command that no more might be said in the way either of excuse or of explanation  the princess joan then took her own chair with a dignity which became her and compelled the two strangers to sit one on either hand to which the younger consented with unfeigned and respectful diffidence and the elder with an affectation of deep humility and deference which was intended for such  they spoke together but in such a low tone that the sentinel could not overhear their discourse and only remarked that the princess seemed to bestow much of her regard on the younger and more interesting lady and that the countess hameline though speaking a great deal more attracted less of the princesss attention by her full flow of conversation and compliment than did her kinswoman by her brief and modest replies to what was addressed to her  the conversation of the ladies had not lasted a quarter of an hour when the door at the lower end of the hall opened and a man entered shrouded in a riding cloak mindful of the kings injunction and determined not to be a second time caught slumbering quentin instantly moved towards the intruder and interposing between him and the ladies requested him to retire instantly  by whose command said the stranger in a tone of contemptuous surprise  by that of the king said quentin firmly which i am placed here to enforce  not against louis of orleans said the duke dropping his cloak  the young man hesitated a moment but how enforce his orders against the first prince of the blood about to be allied as the report now generally went with the kings own family  your highness he said is too great that your pleasure should be withstood by me i trust your highness will bear me witness that i have done the duty of my post so far as your will permitted  go toyou shall have no blame young soldier said orleans and passing forward paid his compliments to the princess with that air of constraint which always marked his courtesy when addressing her  he had been dining he said with dunois and understanding there was society in rolands gallery he had ventured on the freedom of adding one to the number  the colour which mounted into the pale cheek of the unfortunate joan and which for the moment spread something of beauty over her features evinced that this addition to the company was anything but indifferent to her she hastened to present the prince to the two ladies of croye who received him with the respect due to his eminent rank and the princess pointing to a chair requested him to join their conversation party  the duke declined the freedom of assuming a seat in such society but taking a cushion from one of the settles he laid it at the feet of the beautiful young countess of croye and so seated himself that without appearing to neglect the princess he was enabled to bestow the greater share of his attention on her lovely neighbour  at first it seemed as if this arrangement rather pleased than offended his destined bride she encouraged the duke in his gallantries towards the fair stranger and seemed to regard them as complimentary to herself but the duke of orleans though accustomed to subject his mind to the stern yoke of his uncle when in the kings presence had enough of princely nature to induce him to follow his own inclinations whenever that restraint was withdrawn and his high rank giving him a right to overstep the ordinary ceremonies and advance at once to familiarity his praises of the countess isabelles beauty became so energetic and flowed with such unrestrained freedom owing perhaps to his having drunk a little more wine than usualfor dunois was no enemy to the worship of bacchusthat at length he seemed almost impassioned and the presence of the princess appeared well nigh forgotten  the tone of compliment which he indulged was grateful only to one individual in the circle for the countess hameline already anticipated the dignity of an alliance with the first prince of the blood by means of her whose birth beauty and large possessions rendered such an ambitious consummation by no means impossible even in the eyes of a less sanguine projector could the views of louis xi have been left out of the calculation of chances the younger countess listened to the dukes gallantries with anxiety and embarrassment and ever and anon turned an entreating look towards the princess as if requesting her to come to her relief but the wounded feelings and the timidity of joan of france rendered her incapable of an effort to make the conversation more general and at length excepting a few interjectional civilities of the lady hameline it was maintained almost exclusively by the duke himself though at the expense of the younger countess of croye whose beauty formed the theme of his high flown eloquence  nor must i forget that there was a third person the unregarded sentinel who saw his fair visions melt away like wax before the sun as the duke persevered in the warm tenor of his passionate discourse at length the countess isabelle de croye made a determined effort to cut short what was becoming intolerably disagreeable to her especially from the pain to which the conduct of the duke was apparently subjecting the princess  addressing the latter she said modestly but with some firmness that the first boon she had to claim from her promised protection was that her highness would undertake to convince the duke of orleans that the ladies of burgundy though inferior in wit and manners to those of france were not such absolute fools as to be pleased with no other conversation than that of extravagant compliment  i grieve lady said the duke preventing the princesss answer that you will satirize in the same sentence the beauty of the dames of burgundy and the sincerity of the knights of france if we are hasty and extravagant in the expression of our admiration it is because we love as we fight without letting cold deliberation come into our bosoms and surrender to the fair with the same rapidity with which we defeat the valiant  the beauty of our countrywomen said the young countess with more of reproof than she had yet ventured to use towards the high born suitor is as unfit to claim such triumphs as the valour of the men of burgundy is incapable of yielding them  i respect your patriotism countess said the duke and the last branch of your theme shall not be impugned by me till a burgundian knight shall offer to sustain it with lance in rest but for the injustice which you have done to the charms which your land produces i appeal from yourself to yourselflook there he said pointing to a large mirror the gift of the venetian republic and then of the highest rarity and value and tell me as you look what is the heart that can resist the charms there represented  the princess unable to sustain any longer the neglect of her lover here sunk backwards on her chair with a sigh which at once recalled the duke from the land of romance and induced the lady hameline to ask whether her highness found herself ill  a sudden pain shot through my forehead said the princess attempting to smile but i shall be presently better  her increasing paleness contradicted her words and induced the lady hameline to call for assistance as the princess was about to faint  the duke biting his lip and cursing the folly which could not keep guard over his tongue ran to summon the princesss attendants who were in the next chamber and when they came hastily with the usual remedies he could not but as a cavalier and gentleman give his assistance to support and to recover her his voice rendered almost tender by pity and self reproach was the most powerful means of recalling her to herself and just as the swoon was passing away the king himself entered the apartment    chapter xii the politician       this is a lecturer so skilld in policy      that no disparagement to satans cunning      he well might read a lesson to the devil      and teach the old seducer new temptations       old play   as louis entered the gallery he bent his brows in the manner we have formerly described as peculiar to him and sent from under his gathered and gloomy eyebrows a keen look on all around in darting which as quentin afterwards declared his eyes seemed to turn so small so fierce and so piercing as to resemble those of an aroused adder looking through the bush of heath in which he lies coiled  when by this momentary and sharpened glance the king had reconnoitered the cause of the bustle which was in the apartment his first address was to the duke of orleans  you here my fair cousin he saidand turning to quentin added sternly had you not charge  forgive the young man sire said the duke he did not neglect his duty but i was informed that the princess was in this gallery  and i warrant you would not be withstood when you came hither to pay your court said the king whose detestable hypocrisy persisted in representing the duke as participating in a passion which was felt only on the side of his unhappy daughter and it is thus you debauch the sentinels of my guard young manbut what cannot be pardoned to a gallant who only lives par amours by his love affairs  the duke of orleans raised his head as if about to reply in some manner which might correct the opinion conveyed in the kings observation but the instinctive reverence not to say fear of louis in which he had been bred from childhood chained up his voice  and joan hath been ill said the king but do not be grieved louis it will soon pass away lend her your arm to her apartment while i will conduct these strange ladies to theirs  the order was given in a tone which amounted to a command and orleans accordingly made his exit with the princess at one extremity of the gallery while the king ungloving his right hand courteously handed the countess isabelle and her kinswoman to their apartment which opened from the other he bowed profoundly as they entered and remained standing on the threshold for a minute after they had disappeared then with great composure shut the door by which they had retired and turning the huge key took it from the lock and put it into his girdlean appendage which gave him still more perfectly the air of some old miser who cannot journey in comfort unless he bear with him the key of his treasure closet  with slow and pensive step and eyes fixed on the ground louis now paced towards quentin durward who expecting his share of the royal displeasure viewed his approach with no little anxiety  thou hast done wrong said the king raising his eyes and fixing them firmly on him when he had come within a yard of himthou hast done foul wrong and deservest to diespeak not a word in defencewhat hadst thou to do with dukes or princesseswhat with any thing but my order  so please your majesty said the young soldier what could i do  what couldst thou do when thy post was forcibly passed answered the king scornfullywhat is the use of that weapon on thy shoulder thou shouldst have levelled thy piece and if the presumptuous rebel did not retire on the instant he should have died within this very hall gopass into these farther apartments in the first thou wilt find a large staircase which leads to the inner bailley there thou wilt find oliver dain the inner bailey contained the stables and often the chapel it communicated directly with the keep send him to medo thou begone to thy quartersas thou dost value thy life be not so loose of thy tongue as thou hast been this day slack of thy hand  well pleased to escape so easily yet with a soul which revolted at the cold blooded cruelty which the king seemed to require from him in the execution of his duty durward took the road indicated hastened down stairs and communicated the royal pleasure to oliver who was waiting in the court beneath the wily tonsor bowed sighed and smiled as with a voice even softer than ordinary he wished the youth a good evening and they parted quentin to his quarters and oliver to attend the king  in this place the memoirs which we have chiefly followed in compiling this true history were unhappily defective for founded chiefly on information supplied by quentin they do not convey the purport of the dialogue which in his absence took place between the king and his secret counsellor fortunately the library of hautlieu contains a manuscript copy of the chronique scandaleuse of jean de troyes the marquis de hautlieu is the name of an imaginary character in whose library scott declares himself to have found the memorials which form the basis of the novel of quentin durward much more full than that which has been printed to which are added several curious memoranda which we incline to think must have been written down by oliver himself after the death of his master and before he had the happiness to be rewarded with the halter which he had so long merited from this we have been able to extract a very full account of the obscure favourites conversation with louis upon the present occasion which throws a light upon the policy of that prince which we might otherwise have sought for in vain  when the favourite attendant entered the gallery of roland he found the king pensively seated upon the chair which his daughter had left some minutes before well acquainted with his temper he glided on with his noiseless step until he had just crossed the line of the kings sight so as to make him aware of his presence then shrank modestly backward and out of sight until he should be summoned to speak or to listen the monarchs first address was an unpleasant one so oliver your fine schemes are melting like snow before the south windi pray to our lady of embrun that they resemble not the ice heaps of which the switzer churls tell such stories and come rushing down upon our heads  i have heard with concern that all is not well sire answered oliver  not well exclaimed the king rising and hastily marching up and down the gallery all is ill manand as ill nearly as possible so much for thy fond romantic advice that i of all men should become a protector of distressed damsels i tell thee burgundy is arming and on the eve of closing an alliance with england and edward who hath his hands idle at home will pour his thousands upon us through that unhappy gate of calais singly i might cajole or defy them but united unitedand with the discontent and treachery of that villain saint paulall thy fault oliver who counselled me to receive the women and to use the services of that damned bohemian to carry messages to their vassals  my lord said oliver you know my reasons the countesss domains lie between the frontiers of burgundy and flandersher castle is almost impregnableher rights over neighbouring estates are such as if well supported cannot but give much annoyance to burgundy were the lady but wedded to one who should be friendly to france  it is it is a tempting bait said the king and could we have concealed her being here we might have arranged such a marriage for this rich heiress as would have highly profitedfrance but that cursed bohemian how couldst thou recommend such a heathen hound for a commission which required trust  please you said oliver to remember it was your graces self who trusted him too farmuch farther than i recommended he would have borne a letter trustily enough to the countesss kinsman telling him to hold out her castle and promising speedy relief but your highness must needs put his prophetic powers to the test and thus he became possessed of secrets which were worth betraying to duke charles  i am ashamed i am ashamed said louis and yet oliver they say that these heathen people are descended from the sage chaldeans who did read the mysteries of the stars in the plains of shinar they lie between the tigris and euphrates  well aware that his master with all his acuteness and sagacity was but the more prone to be deceived by soothsayers astrologers diviners and all that race of pretenders to occult science and that he even conceived himself to have some skill in these arts oliver dared to press this point no farther and only observed that the bohemian had been a bad prophet on his own account else he would have avoided returning to tours and saved himself from the gallows he had merited  it often happens that those who are gifted with prophetic knowledge answered louis with much gravity have not the power of foreseeing those events in which they themselves are personally interested  under your majestys favour replied the confidant that seems as if a man could not see his own hand by means of the candle which he holds and which shows him every other object in the apartment  he cannot see his own features by the light which shows the faces of others replied louis and that is the more faithful illustration of the casebut this is foreign to my purpose at present the bohemian hath had his reward and peace be with himbut these ladiesnot only does burgundy threaten us with war for harbouring them but their presence is like to interfere with my projects in my own family my simple cousin of orleans hath barely seen this damsel and i venture to prophesy that the sight of her is like to make him less pliable in the matter of his alliance with joan  your majesty answered the counsellor may send these ladies of croye back to burgundy and so make your peace with the duke many might murmur at this as dishonourable but if necessity demands the sacrifice  if profit demanded the sacrifice oliver the sacrifice should be made without hesitation answered the king i am an old experienced salmon and use not to gulp the anglers hook because it is busked up with a feather called honour but what is worse than a lack of honour there were in returning those ladies to burgundy a forfeiture of those views of advantage which moved us to give them an asylum it were heart breaking to renounce the opportunity of planting a friend to ourselves and an enemy to burgundy in the very centre of his dominions and so near to the discontented cities of flanders oliver i cannot relinquish the advantages which our scheme of marrying the maiden to a friend of our own house seems to hold out to us  your majesty said oliver after a moments thought might confer her hand on some right trusty friend who would take all blame on himself and serve your majesty secretly while in public you might disown him  and where am i to find such a friend said louis were i to bestow her upon any one of our mutinous and ill ruled nobles would it not be rendering him independent and hath it not been my policy for years to prevent them from becoming sodunois indeedhim and him only i might perchance trusthe would fight for the crown of france whatever were his condition but honours and wealth change mens natureseven dunois i will not trust  your majesty may find others said oliver in his smoothest manner and in a tone more insinuating than that which he usually employed in conversing with the king who permitted him considerable freedom men dependent entirely on your own grace and favour and who could no more exist without your countenance than without sun or airmen rather of head than of actionmen who  men who resemble thyself ha said king louis no oliver by my faith that arrow was too rashly shotwhat because i indulge thee with my confidence and let thee in reward poll my lieges a little now and then dost thou think it makes thee fit to be the husband of that beautiful vision and a count of the highest class to boottheethee i say low born and lower bred whose wisdom is at best a sort of dinning and whose courage is more than doubtful  your majesty imputes to me a presumption of which i am not guilty in supposing me to aspire so highly said oliver  i am glad to hear it man said the king and truly i hold your judgment the healthier that you disown such a reverie but methinks thy speech sounded strangely in that keywell to returni dare not wed this beauty to one of my subjectsi dare not return her to burgundyi dare not transmit her to england or to germany where she is likely to become the prize of some one more apt to unite with burgundy than with france and who would be more ready to discourage the honest malcontents in ghent and liege than to yield them that wholesome countenance which might always find charles the hardy enough to exercise his valour on without stirring from his domainsand they were in so ripe a humour for insurrection the men of liege in especial that they alone well heated and supported would find my fair cousin work for more than a twelvemonth and backed by a warlike count of croyeo oliver the plan is too hopeful to be resigned without a strugglecannot thy fertile brain devise some scheme  oliver paused for a long timethen at last replied what if a bridal could be accomplished betwixt isabelle of croye and young adolphus the duke of gueldres  what said the king in astonishment sacrifice her and she too so lovely a creature to the furious wretch who deposed imprisoned and has often threatened to murder his own fatherno oliver no that were too unutterably cruel even for you and me who look so steadfastly to our excellent end the peace and the welfare of france and respect so little the means by which it is attained besides he lies distant from us and is detested by the people of ghent and liegeno noi will none of adolphus of gueldresthink on some one else  my invention is exhausted sire said the counsellor i can remember no one who as husband to the countess of croye would be likely to answer your majestys views he must unite such various qualitiesa friend to your majestyan enemy to burgundyof policy enough to conciliate the ghentois and liegeois and of valour sufficient to defend his little dominions against the power of duke charlesof noble birth besidesthat your highness insists upon and of excellent and virtuous character to the boot of all  nay oliver said the king i leaned not so muchthat is so very much on character but methinks isabelles bridegroom should be something less publicly and generally abhorred than adolphus of gueldres for example since i myself must suggest some onewhy not william de la marck  on my halidome sire said oliver i cannot complain of your demanding too high a standard of moral excellence in the happy man if the wild boar of ardennes can serve your turn de la marckwhy he is the most notorious robber and murderer on all the frontiersexcommunicated by the pope for a thousand crimes  we will have him released from the sentence friend oliverholy church is merciful  almost an outlaw continued oliver and under the ban of the empire by an ordinance of the chamber at ratisbon  ratisbon was the seat of the german reichstag from 1663 to 1806  we will have the ban taken off friend oliver continued the king in the same tone the imperial chamber will hear reason  a supreme court of appeals established in 1495 by maximilian i the first law court established in germany  and admitting him to be of noble birth said oliver he hath the manners the face and the outward form as well as the heart of a flemish butchershe will never accept of him  his mode of wooing if i mistake him not said louis will render it difficult for her to make a choice  i was far wrong indeed when i taxed your majesty with being over scrupulous said the counsellor on my life the crimes of adolphus are but virtues to those of de la marckand then how is he to meet with his bride your majesty knows he dare not stir far from his own forest of ardennes  that must be cared for said the king and in the first place the two ladies must be acquainted privately that they can be no longer maintained at this court except at the expense of a war between france and burgundy and that unwilling to deliver them up to my fair cousin of burgundy i am desirous they should secretly depart from my dominions  they will demand to be conveyed to england said oliver and we shall have her return to flanders with an island lord having a round fair face long brown hair and three thousand archers at his back  nono replied the king we dare not you understand me so far offend our fair cousin of burgundy as to let her pass to england it would bring his displeasure as certainly as our maintaining her here no noto the safety of the church alone we will venture to commit her and the utmost we can do is to connive at the ladies hameline and isabelle de croye departing in disguise and with a small retinue to take refuge with the bishop of liege who will place the fair isabelle for the time under the safeguard of a convent  and if that convent protect her from william de la marck when he knows of your majestys favourable intentions i have mistaken the man  why yes answered the king thanks to our secret supplies of money de la marck hath together a handsome handful of as unscrupulous soldiery as ever were outlawed with which he contrives to maintain himself among the woods in such a condition as makes him formidable both to the duke of burgundy and the bishop of liege he lacks nothing but some territory which he may call his own and this being so fair an opportunity to establish himself by marriage i think that pasques dieu he will find means to win and wed without more than a hint on our part the duke of burgundy will then have such a thorn in his side as no lancet of our time will easily cut out from his flesh the boar of ardennes whom he has already outlawed strengthened by the possession of that fair ladys lands castles and seigniory with the discontented liegeois to boot who by may faith will not be in that case unwilling to choose him for their captain and leaderlet charles then think of wars with france when he will or rather let him bless his stars if she war not with himhow dost thou like the scheme oliver ha  rarely said oliver save and except the doom which confers that lady on the wild boar of ardennesby my halidome saving in a little outward show of gallantry tristan the provost marshal were the more proper bridegroom of the two  anon thou didst propose master oliver the barber said louis but friend oliver and gossip tristan though excellent men in the way of counsel and execution are not the stuff that men make counts ofknow you not that the burghers of flanders value birth in other men precisely because they have it not themselvesa plebeian mob ever desire an aristocratic leader yonder ked or cade orhow called they himin england was fain to lure his rascal rout after him by pretending to the blood of the mortimers jack cade was the leader of cades rebellion calling himself mortimer and claiming to be a cousin of richard duke of york in 1450 at the head of twenty thousand men he took formal possession of london his alleged object was to procure representation for the people and so reduce excessive taxation william de la marck comes of the blood of the princes of sedan as noble as mine ownand now to business i must determine the ladies of croye to a speedy and secret flight under sure guidance this will be easily donewe have but to hint the alternative of surrendering them to burgundy thou must find means to let william de la marck know of their motions and let him choose his own time and place to push his suit i know a fit person to travel with them  may i ask to whom your majesty commits such an important charge asked the tonsor  to a foreigner be sure replied the king one who has neither kin nor interest in france to interfere with the execution of my pleasure and who knows too little of the country and its factions to suspect more of my purpose than i choose to tell himin a word i design to employ the young scot who sent you hither but now  oliver paused in a manner which seemed to imply a doubt of the prudence of the choice and then added your majesty has reposed confidence in that stranger boy earlier than is your wont  i have my reasons answered the king thou knowest and he crossed himself my devotion for the blessed saint julian i had been saying my orisons to that holy saint late in the night before last wherein as he is known to be the guardian of travellers i made it my humble petition that he would augment my household with such wandering foreigners as might best establish throughout our kingdom unlimited devotion to our will and i vowed to the good saint in guerdon that i would in his name receive and relieve and maintain them  and did saint julian said oliver send your majesty this long legged importation from scotland in answer to your prayers  although the barber who well knew that his master had superstition in a large proportion to his want of religion and that on such topics nothing was more easy than to offend himalthough i say he knew the royal weakness and therefore carefully put the preceding question in the softest and most simple tone of voice louis felt the innuendo which it contained and regarded the speaker with high displeasure  sirrah he said thou art well called oliver the devil who darest thus to sport at once with thy master and with the blessed saints i tell thee wert thou one grain less necessary to me i would have thee hung up on yonder oak before the castle as an example to all who scoff at things holyknow thou infidel slave that mine eyes were no sooner closed than the blessed saint julian was visible to me leading a young man whom he presented to me saying that his fortune should be to escape the sword the cord the river and to bring good fortune to the side which he should espouse and to the adventures in which he should be engaged i walked out on the succeeding morning and i met with this youth whose image i had seen in my dream in his own country he hath escaped the sword amid the massacre of his whole family and here within the brief compass of two days he hath been strangely rescued from drowning and from the gallows and hath already on a particular occasion as i but lately hinted to thee been of the most material service to me i receive him as sent hither by saint julian to serve me in the most difficult the most dangerous and even the most desperate services  the king as he thus expressed himself doffed his hat and selecting from the numerous little leaden figures with which the hat band was garnished that which represented saint julian he placed it on the table as was often his wont when some peculiar feeling of hope or perhaps of remorse happened to thrill across his mind and kneeling down before it muttered with an appearance of profound devotion sancte juliane adsis precibus nostris ora ora pro nobis st julian give heed to our prayers plead plead for us  this was one of those ague fits of superstitious devotion which often seized on louis in such extraordinary times and places that they gave one of the most sagacious monarchs who ever reigned the appearance of a madman or at least of one whose mind was shaken by some deep consciousness of guilt  while he was thus employed his favourite looked at him with an expression of sarcastic contempt which he scarce attempted to disguise indeed it was one of this mans peculiarities that in his whole intercourse with his master he laid aside that fondling purring affectation of officiousness and humility which distinguished his conduct to others and if he still bore some resemblance to a cat it was when the animal is on its guardwatchful animated and alert for sudden exertion the cause of this change was probably olivers consciousness that his master was himself too profound a hypocrite not to see through the hypocrisy of others  the features of this youth then if i may presume to speak said oliver resemble those of him whom your dream exhibited  closely and intimately said the king whose imagination like that of superstitious people in general readily imposed upon itself i have had his horoscope cast besides by galeotti martivalle and i have plainly learned through his art and mine own observation that in many respects this unfriended youth has his destiny under the same constellation with mine  whatever oliver might think of the causes thus boldly assigned for the preference of an inexperienced stripling he dared make no farther objections well knowing that louis who while residing in exile had bestowed much of his attention on the supposed science of judicial astrology would listen to no raillery of any kind which impeached his skill he therefore only replied that he trusted the youth would prove faithful in the discharge of a task so delicate  we will take care he hath no opportunity to be otherwise said louis for he shall be privy to nothing save that he is sent to escort the ladies of croye to the residence of the bishop of liege of the probable interference of william de la marck he shall know as little as they themselves none shall know that secret but the guide and tristan or thou must find one fit for our purpose  but in that case said oliver judging of him from his country and his appearance the young man is like to stand to his arms as soon as the wild boar comes on them and may not come off so easily from the tusks as he did this morning  if they rend his heart strings said louis composedly saint julian blessed be his name can send me another in his stead it skills as little that the messenger is slain after his duty is executed as that the flask is broken when the wine is drunk outmeanwhile we must expedite the ladies departure and then persuade the count de crevecoeur that it has taken place without our connivance we having been desirous to restore them to the custody of our fair cousin which their sudden departure has unhappily prevented  the count is perhaps too wise and his master too prejudiced to believe it  holy mother said louis what unbelief would that be in christian men but oliver they shall believe us we will throw into our whole conduct towards our fair cousin duke charles such thorough and unlimited confidence that not to believe we have been sincere with him in every respect he must be worse than an infidel i tell thee so convinced am i that i could make charles of burgundy think of me in every respect as i would have him that were it necessary for silencing his doubts i would ride unarmed and on a palfrey to visit him in his tent with no better guard about me than thine own simple person friend oliver  and i said oliver though i pique not myself upon managing steel in any other shape than that of a razor would rather charge a swiss battalion of pikes than i would accompany your highness upon such a visit of friendship to charles of burgundy when he hath so many grounds to be well assured that there is enmity in your majestys bosom against him  thou art a fool oliver said the king with all thy pretensions to wisdomand art not aware that deep policy must often assume the appearance of the most extreme simplicity as courage occasionally shrouds itself under the show of modest timidity were it needful full surely would i do what i have saidthe saints always blessing our purpose and the heavenly constellations bringing round in their course a proper conjuncture for such an exploit  in these words did king louis xi give the first hint of the extraordinary resolution which he afterwards adopted in order to dupe his great rival the subsequent execution of which had very nearly proved his own ruin  he parted with his counsellor and presently afterwards went to the apartment of the ladies of croye few persuasions beyond his mere license would have been necessary to determine their retreat from the court of france upon the first hint that they might not be eventually protected against the duke of burgundy but it was not so easy to induce them to choose liege for the place of their retreat they entreated and requested to be transferred to bretagne or calais where under protection of the duke of bretagne or king of england they might remain in a state of safety until the sovereign of burgundy should relent in his rigorous purpose towards them but neither of these places of safety at all suited the plans of louis and he was at last successful in inducing them to adopt that which did coincide with them  the power of the bishop of liege for their defence was not to be questioned since his ecclesiastical dignity gave him the means of protecting the fugitives against all christian princes while on the other hand his secular forces if not numerous seemed at least sufficient to defend his person and all under his protection from any sudden violence the difficulty was to reach the little court of the bishop in safety but for this louis promised to provide by spreading a report that the ladies of croye had escaped from tours by night under fear of being delivered up to the burgundian envoy and had taken their flight towards bretagne he also promised them the attendance of a small but faithful retinue and letters to the commanders of such towns and fortresses as they might pass with instructions to use every means for protecting and assisting them in their journey  the ladies of croye although internally resenting the ungenerous and discourteous manner in which louis thus deprived them of the promised asylum in his court were so far from objecting to the hasty departure which he proposed that they even anticipated his project by entreating to be permitted to set forward that same night the lady hameline was already tired of a place where there were neither admiring courtiers nor festivities to be witnessed and the lady isabelle thought she had seen enough to conclude that were the temptation to become a little stronger louis xi not satisfied with expelling them from his court would not hesitate to deliver her up to her irritated suzerain the duke of burgundy lastly louis himself readily acquiesced in their hasty departure anxious to preserve peace with duke charles and alarmed lest the beauty of isabelle should interfere with and impede the favourite plan which he had formed for bestowing the hand of his daughter joan upon his cousin of orleans    chapter xiii the journey       talk not of kingsi scorn the poor comparison      i am a sage and can command the elements      at least men think i can and on that thought      i found unbounded empire       albumazar   occupation and adventure might be said to crowd upon the young scottishman with the force of a spring tide for he was speedily summoned to the apartment of his captain the lord crawford where to his astonishment he again beheld the king after a few words respecting the honour and trust which were about to be reposed in him which made quentin internally afraid that they were again about to propose to him such a watch as he had kept upon the count of crevecoeur or perhaps some duty still more repugnant to his feelings he was not relieved merely but delighted with hearing that he was selected with the assistance of four others under his command one of whom was a guide to escort the ladies of croye to the little court of their relative the bishop of liege in the safest and most commodious and at the same time in the most secret manner possible a scroll was given him in which were set down directions for his guidance for the places of halt generally chosen in obscure villages solitary monasteries and situations remote from towns and for the general precautions which he was to attend to especially on approaching the frontier of burgundy he was sufficiently supplied with instructions what he ought to say and do to sustain the personage of the maitre dhotel of two english ladies of rank who had been on a pilgrimage to saint martin of tours and were about to visit the holy city of cologne and worship the relics of the sage eastern monarchs who came to adore the nativity of bethlehem the relics of the three kings or magi were placed in the cathedral of cologne in 1162 for under that character the ladies of croye were to journey  without having any defined notions of the cause of his delight quentin durwards heart leapt for joy at the idea of approaching thus nearly to the person of the beauty of the turret and in a situation which entitled him to her confidence since her protection was in so great a degree intrusted to his conduct and courage he felt no doubt in his own mind that he should be her successful guide through the hazards of her pilgrimage youth seldom thinks of dangers and bred up free and fearless and self confiding quentin in particular only thought of them to defy them he longed to be exempted from the restraint of the royal presence that he might indulge the secret glee with which such unexpected tidings filled him and which prompted him to bursts of delight which would have been totally unfitting for that society  but louis had not yet done with him that cautious monarch had to consult a counsellor of a different stamp from oliver le diable who was supposed to derive his skill from the superior and astral intelligences as men judging from their fruits were apt to think the counsels of oliver sprang from the devil himself  louis therefore led the way followed by the impatient quentin to a separate tower of the castle of plessis in which was installed in no small ease and splendour the celebrated astrologer poet and philosopher galeotti marti or martius or martivalle a native of narni in italy the author of the famous treatise de vulgo incognitis concerning things unknown to the generality of mankind s and the subject of his ages admiration and of the panegyrics of paulus jovius an italian historian of the sixteenth century who lived at the popes court he had long flourished at the court of the celebrated matthias corvinus king of hungary from whom he was in some measure decoyed by louis who grudged the hungarian monarch the society and the counsels of a sage accounted so skilful in reading the decrees of heaven  martius galeotti was secretary to matthias carvinus king of hungary he left hungary in 1477 and was made prisoner at venice on a charge of having propagated heterodox opinions he might have suffered seriously but for the protection of sixtus iv then pope who had been one of his scholars he attached himself to louis xi and died in his service s  martivalle was none of those ascetic withered pale professors of mystic learning of those days who bleared their eyes over the midnight furnace and macerated their bodies by out watching the polar bear he indulged in all courtly pleasures and until he grew corpulent had excelled in all martial sports and gymnastic exercises as well as in the use of arms insomuch that janus pannonius a hungarian poet of the fifteenth century has left a latin epigram upon a wrestling match betwixt galeotti and a renowned champion of that art in the presence of the hungarian king and court in which the astrologer was completely victorious  the apartments of this courtly and martial sage were far more splendidly furnished than any which quentin had yet seen in the royal palace and the carving and ornamented woodwork of his library as well as the magnificence displayed in the tapestries showed the elegant taste of the learned italian out of his study one door opened to his sleeping apartment another led to the turret which served as his observatory a large open table in the midst of the chamber was covered with a rich turkey carpet the spoils of the tent of a pacha after the great battle of jaiza where the astrologer had fought abreast with the valiant champion of christendom matthias corvinus on the table lay a variety of mathematical and astrological instruments all of the most rich materials and curious workmanship his astrolabe of silver was the gift of the emperor of germany and his jacobs staff of ebony a divining rod made of a hazel fork jointed with gold and curiously inlaid was a mark of esteem from the reigning pope  there were various other miscellaneous articles disposed on the table or hanging around the walls amongst others two complete suits of armour one of mail the other of plate both of which from their great size seemed to call the gigantic astrologer their owner a spanish toledo a scottish broadsword a turkish scymetar with bows quivers and other warlike weapons musical instruments of several different kinds a silver crucifix a sepulchral antique vase and several of the little brazen penates of the ancient heathens with other curious nondescript articles some of which in the superstitious opinions of that period seemed to be designed for magical purposes the library of this singular character was of the same miscellaneous description with its other effects curious manuscripts of classical antiquity lay mingled with the voluminous labours of christian divines and of those painstaking sages who professed the chemical science and proffered to guide their students into the most secret recesses of nature by means of the hermetical philosophy a system of philosophy ascribed to the egyptian hermes thoth who was reputed to have written certain sacred books treating of religion and the natural sciences some were written in the eastern character and others concealed their sense or nonsense under the veil of hieroglyphics and cabalistic characters the whole apartment and its furniture of every kind formed a scene very impressive on the fancy considering the general belief then indisputably entertained concerning the truth of the occult sciences and that effect was increased by the manners and appearance of the individual himself who seated in a huge chair was employed in curiously examining a specimen just issued from the frankfort press of the newly invented art of printing  galeotti martivalle was a tall bulky yet stately man considerably past his prime and whose youthful habits of exercise though still occasionally resumed had not been able to contend with his natural tendency to corpulence increased by sedentary study and indulgence in the pleasures of the table his features though rather overgrown were dignified and noble and a santon might have envied the dark and downward sweep of his long descending beard his dress was a chamber robe of the richest genoa velvet with ample sleeves clasped with frogs of gold and lined with sables it was fastened round his middle by a broad belt of virgin parchment round which were represented in crimson characters the signs of the zodiac he rose and bowed to the king yet with the air of one to whom such exalted society was familiar and who was not at all likely even in the royal presence to compromise the dignity then especially affected by the pursuers of science  you are engaged father said the king and as i think with this new fashioned art of multiplying manuscripts by the intervention of machinery can things of such mechanical and terrestrial import interest the thoughts of one before whom heaven has unrolled her own celestial volumes  my brother replied martivalle for so the tenant of this cell must term even the king of france when he deigns to visit him as a disciplebelieve me that in considering the consequences of this invention i read with as certain augury as by any combination of the heavenly bodies the most awful and portentous changes when i reflect with what slow and limited supplies the stream of science hath hitherto descended to us how difficult to be obtained by those most ardent in its search how certain to be neglected by all who regard their ease how liable to be diverted altogether dried up by the invasions of barbarism can i look forward without wonder and astonishment to the lot of a succeeding generation on whom knowledge will descend like the first and second rain uninterrupted unabated unbounded fertilizing some grounds and overflowing others changing the whole form of social life establishing and overthrowing religions erecting and destroying kingdoms  hold galeotti said louis shall these changes come in our time  no my royal brother replied martivalle this invention may be likened to a young tree which is now newly planted but shall in succeeding generations bear fruit as fatal yet as precious as that of the garden of eden the knowledge namely of good and evil  louis answered after a moments pause let futurity look to what concerns themwe are men of this age and to this age we will confine our care sufficient for the day is the evil thereof  tell me hast thou proceeded farther in the horoscope which i sent to thee and of which you made me some report i have brought the party hither that you may use palmistry or chiromancy if such is your pleasure the matter is pressing  the bulky sage arose from his seat and approaching the young soldier fixed on him his keen large dark eyes as if he were in the act of internally spelling and dissecting every lineament and feature  blushing and borne down by this close examination on the part of one whose expression was so reverend at once and commanding quentin bent his eyes on the ground and did not again raise them till in the act of obeying the sonorous command of the astrologer look up and be not afraid but hold forth thy hand  when martivalle had inspected his palm according to the form of the mystic arts which he practised he led the king some steps aside  my royal brother he said the physiognomy of this youth together with the lines impressed on his hand confirm in a wonderful degree the report which i founded on his horoscope as well as that judgment which your own proficiency in our sublime arts induced you at once to form of him all promises that this youth will be brave and fortunate  and faithful said the king for valour and fortune square not always with fidelity  and faithful also said the astrologer for there is manly firmness in look and eye and his linea vitae the line of life a term used in palmistry is deeply marked and clear which indicates a true and upright adherence to those who do benefit or lodge trust in him but yet  but what said the king father galeotti wherefore do you now pause  the ears of kings said the sage are like the palates of those dainty patients which are unable to endure the bitterness of the drugs necessary for their recovery  my ears and my palate have no such niceness said louis let me hear what is useful counsel and swallow what is wholesome medicine i quarrel not with the rudeness of the one or the harsh taste of the other i have not been cockered in wantonness or indulgence my youth was one of exile and suffering my ears are used to harsh counsel and take no offence at it  then plainly sire replied galeotti if you have aught in your purposed commission whichwhich in short may startle a scrupulous conscienceintrust it not to this youth at least not till a few years exercise in your service has made him as unscrupulous as others  and is this what you hesitated to speak my good galeotti and didst thou think thy speaking it would offend me said the king alack i know that thou art well sensible that the path of royal policy cannot be always squared as that of private life ought invariably to be by the abstract maxims of religion and of morality wherefore do we the princes of the earth found churches and monasteries make pilgrimages undergo penances and perform devotions with which others may dispense unless it be because the benefit of the public and the welfare of our kingdoms force us upon measures which grieve our consciences as christians but heaven has mercy the church an unbounded stock of merits and the intercession of our lady of embrun and the blessed saints is urgent everlasting and omnipotent  he laid his hat on the table and devoutly kneeling before the images stuck into the hat band repeated in an earnest tone sancte huberte sancte juliane sancte martine sancta rosalia sancti quotquot adestis orate pro me peccatore st hubert st julian st martin st rosalia all ye saints who hear me pray for me a sinner he then smote his breast arose reassumed his hat and continued be assured good father that whatever there may be in our commission of the nature at which you have hinted the execution shall not be intrusted to this youth nor shall he be privy to such part of our purpose  in this said the astrologer you my royal brother will walk wiselysomething may be apprehended likewise from the rashness of this your young commissioner a failing inherent in those of sanguine complexion but i hold that by the rules of art this chance is not to be weighed against the other properties discovered from his horoscope and otherwise  will this next midnight be a propitious hour in which to commence a perilous journey said the king see here is your ephemeridesyou see the position of the moon in regard to saturn and the ascendence of jupiterthat should argue methinks in submission to your better art success to him who sends forth the expedition at such an hour  to him who sends forth the expedition said the astrologer after a pause this conjunction doth indeed promise success but methinks that saturn being combust threatens danger and infortune to the party sent whence i infer that the errand may be perilous or even fatal to those who are to journey violence and captivity methinks are intimated in that adverse conjunction  violence and captivity to those who are sent answered the king but success to the wishes of the senderruns it not thus my learned father  even so replied the astrologer  the king paused without giving any farther indication how far this presaging speech probably hazarded by the astrologer from his conjecture that the commission related to some dangerous purpose squared with his real object which as the reader is aware was to betray the countess isabelle of croye into the hands of william de la marck a nobleman indeed of high birth but degraded by his crimes into a leader of banditti distinguished for his turbulent disposition and ferocious bravery  the king then pulled forth a paper from his pocket and ere he gave it to martivalle said in a tone which resembled that of an apology learned galeotti be not surprised that possessing in you an oracular treasure superior to that lodged in the breast of any now alive not excepting the great nostradamus himself a french astrologer of the sixteenth century author of a book of prophecies which was condemned by the papal court in 1781 i am desirous frequently to avail myself of your skill in those doubts and difficulties which beset every prince who hath to contend with rebellion within his land and with external enemies both powerful and inveterate  when i was honoured with your request sire said the philosopher and abandoned the court of buda for that of plessis it was with the resolution to place at the command of my royal patron whatever my art had that might be of service to him  enough good martivallei pray thee attend to the import of this question  he proceeded to read from the paper in his hand a person having on hand a weighty controversy which is like to draw to debate either by law or by force of arms is desirous for the present to seek accommodation by a personal interview with his antagonist he desires to know what day will be propitious for the execution of such a purpose also what is likely to be the success of such a negotiation and whether his adversary will be moved to answer the confidence thus reposed in him with gratitude and kindness or may rather be likely to abuse the opportunity and advantage which such meeting may afford him  it is an important question said martivalle when the king had done reading and requires that i should set a planetary figure to prepare a diagram which would represent the heavens at that particular moment and give it instant and deep consideration  let it be so my good father in the sciences and thou shalt know what it is to oblige a king of france we are determined if the constellations forbid notand our own humble art leads us to think that they approve our purposeto hazard something even in our own person to stop these antichristian wars  may the saints forward your majestys pious intent said the astrologer and guard your sacred person  thanks learned father here is something the while to enlarge your curious library  he placed under one of the volumes a small purse of gold for economical even in his superstitions louis conceived the astrologer sufficiently bound to his service by the pensions he had assigned him and thought himself entitled to the use of his skill at a moderate rate even upon great exigencies  louis having thus in legal phrase added a refreshing fee to his general retainer turned from him to address durward  follow me he said my bonny scot as one chosen by destiny and a monarch to accomplish a bold adventure all must be got ready that thou mayest put foot in stirrup the very instant the bell of saint martins tolls twelve one minute sooner one minute later were to forfeit the favourable aspect of the constellations which smile on your adventure  thus saying the king left the apartment followed by his young guardsman and no sooner were they gone than the astrologer gave way to very different feelings from those which seemed to animate him during the royal presence  the niggardly slave he said weighing the purse in his handfor being a man of unbounded expense he had almost constant occasion for moneythe base sordid scullion a coxswains wife would give more to know that her husband had crossed the narrow seas in safety he acquire any tincture of humane lettersyes when prowling foxes and yelling wolves become musicians he read the glorious blazoning of the firmamentay when sordid moles shall become lynxes post tot promissaafter so many promises made to entice me from the court of the magnificent matthias where hun and turk christian and infidel the czar of muscovia and the cham of tartary themselves contended to load me with giftsdoth he think i am to abide in this old castle like a bullfinch in a cage fain to sing as oft as he chooses to whistle and all for seed and water not soaut inveniam viam aut faciami will discover or contrive a remedy the cardinal balue is politic and liberalthis query shall to him and it shall be his eminences own fault if the stars speak not as he would have them  he again took the despised guerdon and weighed it in his hand it may be he said there is some jewel or pearl of price concealed in this paltry casei have heard he can be liberal even to lavishness when it suits his caprice or interest  he emptied the purse which contained neither more nor less than ten gold pieces the indignation of the astrologer was extreme  thinks he that for such paltry rate of hire i will practise that celestial science which i have studied with the armenian abbot of istrahoff who had not seen the sun for forty yearswith the greek dubravius who is said to have raised the deadand have even visited the sheik ebn hali in his cave in the deserts of thebais no by heavenhe that contemns art shall perish through his own ignorance ten piecesa pittance which i am half ashamed to offer to toinette to buy her new breast laces  so saying the indignant sage nevertheless plunged the contemned pieces of gold into a large pouch which he wore at his girdle which toinette and other abettors of lavish expense generally contrived to empty fully faster than the philosopher with all his art could find the means of filling    chapter xiv the journey       i see thee yet fair francethou favourd land      of art and naturethou art still before me      thy sons to whom their labour is a sport      so well thy grateful soil returns its tribute      thy sunburnt daughters with their laughing eyes      and glossy raven locks but favourd france      thou hast had many a tale of woe to tell      in ancient times as now       anonymous   avoiding all conversation with any one for such was his charge quentin durward proceeded hastily to array himself in a strong but plain cuirass with thigh and arm pieces and placed on his head a good steel cap without any visor to these was added a handsome cassock of chamois leather finely dressed and laced down the seams with some embroidery such as might become a superior officer in a noble household  these were brought to his apartment by oliver who with his quiet insinuating smile and manner acquainted him that his uncle had been summoned to mount guard purposely that he might make no inquiries concerning these mysterious movements  your excuse will be made to your kinsman said oliver smiling again and my dearest son when you return safe from the execution of this pleasing trust i doubt not you will be found worthy of such promotion as will dispense with your accounting for your motions to any one while it will place you at the head of those who must render an account of theirs to you  so spoke oliver le diable calculating probably in his own mind the great chance there was that the poor youth whose hand he squeezed affectionately as he spoke must necessarily encounter death or captivity in the commission intrusted to his charge he added to his fair words a small purse of gold to defray necessary expenses on the road as a gratuity on the kings part  at a few minutes before twelve at midnight quentin according to his directions proceeded to the second courtyard and paused under the dauphins tower which as the reader knows was assigned for the temporary residence of the countesses of croye he found at this place of rendezvous the men and horses appointed to compose the retinue leading two sumpter mules already loaded with baggage and holding three palfreys for the two countesses and a faithful waiting woman with a stately war horse for himself whose steel plated saddle glanced in the pale moonlight not a word of recognition was spoken on either side the men sat still in their saddles as if they were motionless and by the same imperfect light quentin saw with pleasure that they were all armed and held long lances in their hands they were only three in number but one of them whispered to quentin in a strong gascon accent that their guide was to join them beyond tours  meantime lights glanced to and fro at the lattices of the tower as if there was bustle and preparation among its inhabitants at length a small door which led from the bottom of the tower to the court was unclosed and three females came forth attended by a man wrapped in a cloak they mounted in silence the palfreys which stood prepared for them while their attendant on foot led the way and gave the passwords and signals to the watchful guards whose posts they passed in succession thus they at length reached the exterior of these formidable barriers here the man on foot who had hitherto acted as their guide paused and spoke low and earnestly to the two foremost females  may heaven bless you sire said a voice which thrilled upon quentin durwards ear and forgive you even if your purposes be more interested than your words express to be placed in safety under the protection of the good bishop of liege is the utmost extent of my desire  the person whom she thus addressed muttered an inaudible answer and retreated back through the barrier gate while quentin thought that by the moon glimpse he recognized in him the king himself whose anxiety for the departure of his guests had probably induced him to give his presence in case scruples should arise on their part or difficulties on that of the guards of the castle  when the riders were beyond the castle it was necessary for some time to ride with great precaution in order to avoid the pitfalls snares and similar contrivances which were placed for the annoyance of strangers the gascon was however completely possessed of the clew to this labyrinth and in a quarter of an hours riding they found themselves beyond the limits of plessis le parc and not far distant from the city of tours  the moon which had now extricated herself from the clouds through which she was formerly wading shed a full sea of glorious light upon a landscape equally glorious they saw the princely loire rolling his majestic tide through the richest plain in france and sweeping along between banks ornamented with towers and terraces and with olives and vineyards they saw the walls of the city of tours the ancient capital of touraine raising their portal towers and embattlements white in the moonlight while from within their circle rose the immense gothic mass which the devotion of the sainted bishop perpetuus erected as early as the fifth century and which the zeal of charlemagne and his successors had enlarged with such architectural splendour as rendered it the most magnificent church in france the towers of the church of saint gatien the cathedral of tours were also visible and the gloomy strength of the castle which was said to have been in ancient times the residence of the emperor valentinian a roman emperor who strengthened the northern frontiers against the barbarians  even the circumstances in which he was placed though of a nature so engrossing did not prevent the wonder and delight with which the young scottishman accustomed to the waste though impressive landscape of his own mountains and the poverty even of his countrys most stately scenery looked on a scene which art and nature seemed to have vied in adorning with their richest splendour but he was recalled to the business of the moment by the voice of the elder lady pitched at least an octave higher than those soft tones which bade adieu to king louis demanding to speak with the leader of the band spurring his horse forward quentin respectfully presented himself to the ladies in that capacity and thus underwent the interrogatories of the lady hameline  what was his name and what his degree  he told both  was he perfectly acquainted with the road  he could not he replied pretend to much knowledge of the route but he was furnished with full instructions and he was at their first resting place to be provided with a guide in all respects competent to the task of directing their farther journey meanwhile a horseman who had just joined them and made the number of their guard four was to be their guide for the first stage  and wherefore were you selected for such a duty young gentleman said the lady i am told you are the same youth who was lately upon guard in the gallery in which we met the princess of france you seem young and inexperienced for such a chargea stranger too in france and speaking the language as a foreigner  i am bound to obey the commands of the king madam but am not qualified to reason on them answered the young soldier  are you of noble birth demanded the same querist  i may safely affirm so madam replied quentin  and are you not said the younger lady addressing him in her turn but with a timorous accent the same whom i saw when i was called to wait upon the king at yonder inn  lowering his voice perhaps from similar feelings of timidity quentin answered in the affirmative  then methinks my cousin said the lady isabelle addressing the lady hameline we must be safe under this young gentlemans safeguard he looks not at least like one to whom the execution of a plan of treacherous cruelty upon two helpless women could be with safety intrusted  on my honour said durward by the fame of my house by the bones of my ancestry i could not for france and scotland laid into one be guilty of treachery or cruelty towards you  you speak well young man said the lady hameline but we are accustomed to hear fair speeches from the king of france and his agents it was by these that we were induced when the protection of the bishop of liege might have been attained with less risk than now or when we might have thrown ourselves on that of winceslaus of germany or of edward of england to seek refuge in france and in what did the promises of the king result in an obscure and shameful concealing of us under plebeian names as a sort of prohibited wares in yonder paltry hostelry when wewho as thou knowest marthon addressing her domestic never put on our head tire save under a canopy and upon a dais of three degreeswere compelled to attire ourselves standing on the simple floor as if we had been two milkmaids  marthon admitted that her lady spoke a most melancholy truth  i would that had been the sorest evil dear kinswoman said the lady isabelle i could gladly have dispensed with state  but not with society said the elder countess that my sweet cousin was impossible  i would have dispensed with all my dearest kinswoman answered isabelle in a voice which penetrated to the very heart of her young conductor and guard with all for a safe and honourable retirement i wish notgod knows i never wishedto occasion war betwixt france and my native burgundy or that lives should be lost for such as i am i only implored permission to retire to the convent of marmoutier or to any other holy sanctuary  you spoke then like a fool my cousin answered the elder lady and not like a daughter of my noble brother it is well there is still one alive who hath some of the spirit of the noble house of croye how should a high born lady be known from a sunburnt milkmaid save that spears are broken for the one and only hazel poles shattered for the other i tell you maiden that while i was in the very earliest bloom scarcely older than yourself the famous passage of arms at haflinghem was held in my honour the challengers were four the assailants so many as twelve it lasted three days and cost the lives of two adventurous knights the fracture of one backbone one collarbone three legs and two arms besides flesh wounds and bruises beyond the heralds counting and thus have the ladies of our house ever been honoured ah had you but half the heart of your noble ancestry you would find means at some court where ladies love and fame in arms are still prized to maintain a tournament at which your hand should be the prize as was that of your great grandmother of blessed memory at the spear running of strasbourg and thus should you gain the best lance in europe to maintain the rights of the house of croye both against the oppression of burgundy and the policy of france  but fair kinswoman answered the younger countess i have been told by my old nurse that although the rhinegrave formerly a rhenish prince was the best lance at the great tournament at strasbourg and so won the hand of my respected ancestor yet the match was no happy one as he used often to scold and sometimes even to beat my great grandmother of blessed memory  and wherefore not said the elder countess in her romantic enthusiasm for the profession of chivalry why should those victorious arms accustomed to deal blows when abroad be bound to restrain their energies at home a thousand times rather would i be beaten twice a day by a husband whose arm was as much feared by others as by me than be the wife of a coward who dared neither to lift hand to his wife nor to any one else  i should wish you joy of such an active mate fair aunt replied isabelle without envying you for if broken bones be lovely in tourneys there is nothing less amiable in ladies bower  nay but the beating is no necessary consequence of wedding with a knight of fame in arms said the lady hameline though it is true that your ancestor of blessed memory the rhinegrave gottfried was something rough tempered and addicted to the use of rheinwein  the very perfect knight is a lamb among ladies and a lion among lances there was thibault of montignigod be with himhe was the kindest soul alive and not only was he never so discourteous as to lift hand against his lady but by our good dame he who beat all enemies without doors found a fair foe who could belabour him withinwell t was his own faulthe was one of the challengers at the passage of haflinghem and so well bestirred himself that if it had pleased heaven and your grandfather there might have been a lady of montigni who had used his gentle nature more gently  the countess isabelle who had some reason to dread this passage of haflinghem it being a topic upon which her aunt was at all times very diffuse suffered the conversation to drop and quentin with the natural politeness of one who had been gently nurtured dreading lest his presence might be a restraint on their conversation rode forward to join the guide as if to ask him some questions concerning their route  meanwhile the ladies continued their journey in silence or in such conversation as is not worth narrating until day began to break and as they had then been on horseback for several hours quentin anxious lest they should be fatigued became impatient to know their distance from the nearest resting place  i will show it you answered the guide in half an hour  and then you leave us to other guidance continued quentin  even so seignior archer replied the man my journeys are always short and straight when you and others seignior archer go by the bow i always go by the cord  the moon had by this time long been down and the lights of dawn were beginning to spread bright and strong in the east and to gleam on the bosom of a small lake on the verge of which they had been riding for a short space of time this lake lay in the midst of a wide plain scattered over with single trees groves and thickets but which might be yet termed open so that objects began to be discerned with sufficient accuracy quentin cast his eye on the person whom he rode beside and under the shadow of a slouched overspreading hat which resembled the sombrero of a spanish peasant he recognised the facetious features of the same petit andre whose fingers not long since had in concert with those of his lugubrious brother trois eschelles been so unpleasantly active about his throatimpelled by aversion not altogether unmixed with fear for in his own country the executioner is regarded with almost superstitious horror which his late narrow escape had not diminished durward instinctively moved his horses head to the right and pressing him at the same time with the spur made a demivolte which separated him eight feet from his hateful companion  ho ho ho ho exclaimed petit andre by our lady of the grave our young soldier remembers us of old what comrade you bear no malice i trustevery one wins his bread in this country no man need be ashamed of having come through my hands for i will do my work with any that ever tied a living weight to a dead treeand god hath given me grace to be such a merry fellow withalha ha hai could tell you such jests i have cracked between the foot of a ladder and the top of the gallows that by my halidome i have been obliged to do my job rather hastily for fear the fellows should die with laughing and so shame my mystery  as he thus spoke he edged his horse sideways to regain the interval which the scot had left between them saying at the same time come seignior archer let there be no unkindness betwixt usfor my part i always do my duty without malice and with a light heart and i never love a man better than when i have put my scant of wind collar about his neck to dub him knight of the order of saint patibularius patibulum a gibbet as the provosts chaplain the worthy father vaconeldiablo possibly baco bacchus el diablo the devil is wont to call the patron saint of the provostry  keep back thou wretched object exclaimed quentin as the finisher of the law again sought to approach him closer or i shall be tempted to teach you the distance that should be betwixt men of honour and such an outcast  la you there how hot you are said the fellow had you said men of honesty there had been some savour of truth in it but for men of honour good lack i have to deal with them every day as nearly and closely as i was about to do business with youbut peace be with you and keep your company to yourself i would have bestowed a flagon of auvernat upon you to wash away every unkindnessbut t is like you scorn my courtesywell be as churlish as you listi never quarrel with my customersmy jerry come tumbles my merry dancers my little playfellows as jacques butcher says to his lambsthose in fine who like your seigniorship have h e m p written on their foreheadsno no let them use me as they list they shall have my good service at lastand yourself shall see when you next come under petit andres hands that he knows how to forgive an injury  so saying and summing up the whole with a provoking wink and such an interjectional tchick as men quicken a dull horse with petit andre drew off to the other side of the path and left the youth to digest the taunts he had treated him with as his proud scottish stomach best might a strong desire had quentin to have belaboured him while the staff of his lance could hold together but he put a restraint on his passion recollecting that a brawl with such a character could be creditable at no time or place and that a quarrel of any kind on the present occasion would be a breach of duty and might involve the most perilous consequences he therefore swallowed his wrath at the ill timed and professional jokes of mons petit andre and contented himself with devoutly hoping that they had not reached the ears of his fair charge on which they could not be supposed to make an impression in favour of himself as one obnoxious to such sarcasms but he was speedily roused from such thoughts by the cry of both the ladies at once to look backlook backfor the love of heaven look yourself and uswe are pursued  quentin hastily looked back and saw that two armed men were in fact following them and riding at such a pace as must soon bring them up with their party it can he said be only some of the provostry making their rounds in the forestdo thou look he said to petit andre and see what they may be  petit andre obeyed and rolling himself jocosely in the saddle after he had made his observations replied these fair sir are neither your comrades nor mineneither archers nor marshals menfor i think they wear helmets with visors lowered and gorgets of the samea plague upon these gorgets of all other pieces of armouri have fumbled with them an hour before i could undo the rivets  do you gracious ladies said durward without attending to petit andre ride forwardnot so fast as to raise an opinion of your being in flight and yet fast enough to avail yourself of the impediment which i shall presently place between you and these men who follow us  the countess isabelle looked to their guide and then whispered to her aunt who spoke to quentin thus we have confidence in your care fair archer and will rather abide the risk of whatever may chance in your company than we will go onward with that man whose mien is we think of no good augury  be it as you will ladies said the youth there are but two who come after us and though they be knights as their arms seem to show they shall if they have any evil purpose learn how a scottish gentleman can do his devour in the presence and for the defence of such as you  which of you he continued addressing the guards whom he commanded is willing to be my comrade and to break a lance with these gallants  two of the men obviously faltered in resolution but the third bertrand guyot swore that cap de diou were they knights of king arthurs round table he would try their mettle for the honour of gascony  while he spoke the two knightsfor they seemed of no less rankcame up with the rear of the party in which quentin with his sturdy adherent had by this time stationed himself they were fully accoutred in excellent armour of polished steel without any device by which they could be distinguished  one of them as they approached called out to quentin sir squire give placewe come to relieve you of a charge which is above your rank and condition you will do well to leave these ladies in our care who are fitter to wait upon them especially as we know that in yours they are little better than captives  in return to your demand sirs replied durward know in the first place that i am discharging the duty imposed upon me by my present sovereign and next that however unworthy i may be the ladies desire to abide under my protection  out sirrah exclaimed one of the champions will you a wandering beggar put yourself on terms of resistance against belted knights  they are indeed terms of resistance said quentin since they oppose your insolent and unlawful aggression and if there be difference of rank between us which as yet i know not your discourtesy has done it away draw your sword or if you will use the lance take ground for your career  while the knights turned their horses and rode back to the distance of about a hundred and fifty yards quentin looking to the ladies bent low on his saddlebow as if desiring their favourable regard and as they streamed towards him their kerchiefs in token of encouragement the two assailants had gained the distance necessary for their charge  calling to the gascon to bear himself like a man durward put his steed into motion and the four horsemen met in full career in the midst of the ground which at first separated them the shock was fatal to the poor gascon for his adversary aiming at his face which was undefended by a visor ran him through the eye into the brain so that he fell dead from his horse  on the other hand quentin though labouring under the same disadvantage swayed himself in the saddle so dexterously that the hostile lance slightly scratching his cheek passed over his right shoulder while his own spear striking his antagonist fair upon the breast hurled him to the ground quentin jumped off to unhelm his fallen opponent but the other knight who had never yet spoken seeing the fortune of his companion dismounted still more speedily than durward and bestriding his friend who lay senseless exclaimed in the name of god and saint martin mount good fellow and get thee gone with thy womans wareventre saint gris they have caused mischief enough this morning  by your leave sir knight said quentin who could not brook the menacing tone in which this advice was given i will first see whom i have had to do with and learn who is to answer for the death of my comrade  that shalt thou never live to know or to tell answered the knight get thee back in peace good fellow if we were fools for interrupting your passage we have had the worst for thou hast done more evil than the lives of thee and thy whole hand could repaynay if thou wilt have it for quentin now drew his sword and advanced on him take it with a vengeance  so saying he dealt the scot such a blow on the helmet as till that moment though bred where good blows were plenty he had only read of in romance it descended like a thunderbolt beating down the guard which the young soldier had raised to protect his head and reaching his helmet of proof cut it through so far as to touch his hair but without farther injury while durward dizzy stunned and beaten down on one knee was for an instant at the mercy of the knight had it pleased him to second his blow but compassion for quentins youth or admiration of his courage or a generous love of fair play made him withhold from taking such advantage while durward collecting himself sprang up and attacked his antagonist with the energy of one determined to conquer or die and at the same time with the presence of mind necessary for fighting the quarrel out to the best advantage resolved not again to expose himself to such dreadful blows as he had just obtained he employed the advantage of superior agility increased by the comparative lightness of his armour to harass his antagonist by traversing on all sides with a suddenness of motion and rapidity of attack against which the knightin his heavy panoplyfound it difficult to defend himself without much fatigue  it was in vain that this generous antagonist called aloud to quentin that there now remained no cause of fight betwixt them and that he was loath to be constrained to do him injury listening only to the suggestions of a passionate wish to redeem the shame of his temporary defeat durward continued to assail him with the rapidity of lightningnow menacing him with the edge now with the point of his sword and ever keeping such an eye on the motions of his opponent of whose superior strength he had had terrible proof that he was ready to spring backward or aside from under the blows of his tremendous weapon  now the devil be with thee for an obstinate and presumptuous fool muttered the knight that cannot be quiet till thou art knocked on the head  so saying he changed his mode of fighting collected himself as if to stand on the defensive and seemed contented with parrying instead of returning the blows which quentin unceasingly aimed at him with the internal resolution that the instant when either loss of breath or any false or careless pass of the young soldier should give an opening he would put an end to the fight by a single blow it is likely he might have succeeded in this artful policy but fate had ordered it otherwise  the duel was still at the hottest when a large party of horse rode up crying hold in the kings name  both champions stepped backand quentin saw with surprise that his captain lord crawford was at the head of the party who had thus interrupted their combat there was also tristan lhermite with two or three of his followers making in all perhaps twenty horse    chapter xv the guide       he was a son of egypt as he told me      and one descended from those dread magicians      who waged rash war when israel dwelt in goshen      with israel and her prophetmatching rod      with his the sons of levisand encountering      jehovahs miracles with incantations      till upon egypt came the avenging angel      and those proud sages wept for their first born      as wept the unletterd peasant       anonymous   the arrival of lord crawford and his guard put an immediate end to the engagement which we endeavoured to describe in the last chapter and the knight throwing off his helmet hastily gave the old lord his sword saying crawford i render myselfbut hitherand lend me your eara word for gods sakesave the duke of orleans  howwhatthe duke of orleans exclaimed the scottish commander how came this in the name of the foul fiend it will ruin the gallant with the king for ever and a day  ask no questions said dunoisfor it was no other than heit was all my fault see he stirs i came forth but to have a snatch at yonder damsel and make myself a landed and a married manand see what is come on t keep back your canaillelet no man look upon him  so saying he opened the visor of orleans and threw water on his face which was afforded by the neighbouring lake  quentin durward meanwhile stood like one planet struck affected by the supposed influence of the planets so fast did new adventures pour in upon him he had now as the pale features of his first antagonist assured him borne to the earth the first prince of the blood in france and had measured swords with her best champion the celebrated dunoisboth of them achievements honourable in themselves but whether they might be called good service to the king or so esteemed by him was a very different question  the duke had now recovered his breath and was able to sit up and give attention to what passed betwixt dunois and crawford while the former pleaded eagerly that there was no occasion to mention in the matter the name of the most noble orleans while he was ready to take the whole blame on his own shoulders and to avouch that the duke had only come thither in friendship to him  lord crawford continued listening with his eyes fixed on the ground and from time to time he sighed and shook his head at length he said looking up thou knowest dunois that for thy fathers sake as well as thine own i would full fain do thee a service  it is not for myself i demand anything answered dunois thou hast my sword and i am your prisonerwhat needs more but it is for this noble prince the only hope of france if god should call the dauphin he only came hither to do me a favourin an effort to make my fortunein a matter which the king had partly encouraged  dunois replied crawford if another had told me thou hadst brought the noble prince into this jeopardy to serve any purpose of thine own i had told him it was false and now that thou dost pretend so thyself i can hardly believe it is for the sake of speaking the truth  noble crawford said orleans who had now entirely recovered from his swoon you are too like in character to your friend dunois not to do him justice it was indeed i that dragged him hither most unwillingly upon an enterprise of harebrained passion suddenly and rashly undertakenlook on me all who will he added rising up and turning to the soldiery i am louis of orleans willing to pay the penalty of my own folly i trust the king will limit his displeasure to me as is but justmeanwhile as a child of france must not give up his sword to any onenot even to you brave crawfordfare thee well good steel  so saying he drew his sword from its scabbard and flung it into the lake it went through the air like a stream of lightning and sank in the flashing waters which speedily closed over it all remained standing in irresolution and astonishment so high was the rank and so much esteemed was the character of the culprit while at the same time all were conscious that the consequences of his rash enterprise considering the views which the king had upon him were likely to end in his utter ruin  dunois was the first who spoke and it was in the chiding tone of an offended and distrusted friend so your highness hath judged it fit to cast away your best sword in the same morning when it was your pleasure to fling away the kings favour and to slight the friendship of dunois  my dearest kinsman said the duke when or how was it in my purpose to slight your friendship by telling the truth when it was due to your safety and my honour  what had you to do with my safety my most princely cousin i would pray to know answered dunois gruffly what in gods name was it to you if i had a mind to be hanged or strangled or flung into the loire or poniarded or broke on the wheel or hung up alive in an iron cage or buried alive in a castle fosse or disposed of in any other way in which it might please king louis to get rid of his faithful subjectyou need not wink and frown and point to tristan lhermitei see the scoundrel as well as you do but it would not have stood so hard with meand so much for my safety and then for your own honourby the blush of saint magdalene i think the honour would have been to have missed this mornings work or kept it out of sight here has your highness got yourself unhorsed by a wild scottish boy  tut tut said lord crawford never shame his highness for that it is not the first time a scottish boy hath broke a good lancei am glad the youth hath borne him well  i will say nothing to the contrary said dunois yet had your lordship come something later than you did there might have been a vacancy in your band of archers  ay ay answered lord crawford i can read your handwriting in that cleft morion some one take it from the lad and give him a bonnet which with its steel lining will keep his head better than that broken loomand let me tell your lordship that your own armour of proof is not without some marks of good scottish handwriting but dunois i must now request the duke of orleans and you to take horse and accompany me as i have power and commission to convey you to a place different from that which my goodwill might assign you  may i not speak one word my lord of crawford to yonder fair ladies said the duke of orleans  not one syllable answered lord crawford i am too much a friend of your highness to permit such an act of folly  then addressing quentin he added you young man have done your duty go on to obey the charge with which you are intrusted  under favour my lord said tristan with his usual brutality of manner the youth must find another guide i cannot do without petit andre when there is so like to be business on hand for him  the young man said petit andre now coming forward has only to keep the path which lies straight before him and it will conduct him to a place where he will find the man who is to act as his guide  i would not for a thousand ducats be absent from my chief this day i have hanged knights and esquires many a one and wealthy echevins during the middle ages royal officers possessing a large measure of power in local administration and burgomasters to booteven counts and marquises have tasted of my handiwork but ahumphhe looked at the duke as if to intimate that he would have filled up the blank with a prince of the blood  ho ho ho petit andre thou wilt be read of in chronicle  do you permit your ruffians to hold such language in such a presence said crawford looking sternly to tristan  why do you not correct him yourself my lord said tristan sullenly  because thy hand is the only one in this company that can beat him without being degraded by such an action  then rule your own men my lord and i will be answerable for mine said the provost marshal  lord crawford seemed about to give a passionate reply but as if he had thought better of it turned his back short upon tristan and requesting the duke of orleans and dunois to ride one on either hand of him he made a signal of adieu to the ladies and said to quentin god bless thee my child thou hast begun thy service valiantly though in an unhappy cause  he was about to go off when quentin could hear dunois whisper to crawford do you carry us to plessis  no my unhappy and rash friend answered crawford with a sigh to loches  to loches the name of a castle or rather prison yet more dreaded than plessis itself fell like a death toll upon the ear of the young scotchman he had heard it described as a place destined to the workings of those secret acts of cruelty with which even louis shamed to pollute the interior of his own residence there were in this place of terror dungeons under dungeons some of them unknown even to the keepers themselves living graves to which men were consigned with little hope of farther employment during the rest of their life than to breathe impure air and feed on bread and water at this formidable castle were also those dreadful places of confinement called cages in which the wretched prisoner could neither stand upright nor stretch himself at length an invention it is said of the cardinal balue who himself tenanted one of these dens for more than eleven years s de comines who also suffered this punishment describes the cage as eight feet wide and a foot higher than a man it is no wonder that the name of this place of horrors and the consciousness that he had been partly the means of dispatching thither two such illustrious victims struck so much sadness into the heart of the young scot that he rode for some time with his head dejected his eyes fixed on the ground and his heart filled with the most painful reflections  as he was now again at the head of the little troop and pursuing the road which had been pointed out to him the lady hameline had an opportunity to say to him methinks fair sir you regret the victory which your gallantry has attained in our behalf  there was something in the question which sounded like irony but quentin had tact enough to answer simply and with sincerity  i can regret nothing that is done in the service of such ladies as you are but methinks had it consisted with your safety i had rather have fallen by the sword of so good a soldier as dunois than have been the means of consigning that renowned knight and his unhappy chief the duke of orleans to yonder fearful dungeons  it was then the duke of orleans said the elder lady turning to her niece i thought so even at the distance from which we beheld the frayyou see kinswoman what we might have been had this sly and avaricious monarch permitted us to be seen at his court the first prince of the blood of france and the valiant dunois whose name is known as wide as that of his heroic fatherthis young gentleman did his devoir bravely and well but methinks t is pity that he did not succumb with honour since his ill advised gallantry has stood betwixt us and these princely rescuers  the countess isabelle replied in a firm and almost a displeased tone with an energy in short which quentin had not yet observed her use she said but that i know you jest i would say your speech is ungrateful to our brave defender to whom we owe more perhaps than you are aware of had these gentlemen succeeded so far in their rash enterprise as to have defeated our escort is it not still evident that on the arrival of the royal guard we must have shared their captivity for my own part i give tears and will soon bestow masses on the brave man who has fallen and i trust she continued more timidly that he who lives will accept my grateful thanks  as quentin turned his face towards her to return the fitting acknowledgments she saw the blood which streamed down on one side of his face and exclaimed in a tone of deep feeling holy virgin he is wounded he bleedsdismount sir and let your wound be bound  in spite of all that durward could say of the slightness of his hurt he was compelled to dismount and to seat himself on a bank and unhelmet himself while the ladies of croye who according to a fashion not as yet antiquated pretended some knowledge of leech craft washed the wound stanched the blood and bound it with the kerchief of the younger countess in order to exclude the air for so their practice prescribed  in modern times gallants seldom or never take wounds for ladies sake and damsels on their side never meddle with the cure of wounds each has a danger the less that which the men escape will be generally acknowledged but the peril of dressing such a slight wound as that of quentins which involved nothing formidable or dangerous was perhaps as real in its way as the risk of encountering it  we have already said the patient was eminently handsome and the removal of his helmet or more properly of his morion had suffered his fair locks to escape in profusion around a countenance in which the hilarity of youth was qualified by a blush of modesty at once and pleasure and then the feelings of the younger countess when compelled to hold the kerchief to the wound while her aunt sought in their baggage for some vulnerary remedy were mingled at once with a sense of delicacy and embarrassment a thrill of pity for the patient and of gratitude for his services which exaggerated in her eyes his good mien and handsome features in short this incident seemed intended by fate to complete the mysterious communication which she had by many petty and apparently accidental circumstances established betwixt two persons who though far different in rank and fortune strongly resembled each other in youth beauty and the romantic tenderness of an affectionate disposition it was no wonder therefore that from this moment the thoughts of the countess isabelle already so familiar to his imagination should become paramount in quentins bosom nor that if the maidens feelings were of a less decided character at least so far as known to herself she should think of her young defender to whom she had just rendered a service so interesting with more emotion than of any of the whole band of high born nobles who had for two years past besieged her with their adoration above all when the thought of campobasso the unworthy favourite of duke charles with his hypocritical mien his base treacherous spirit his wry neck and his squint occurred to her his portrait was more disgustingly hideous than ever and deeply did she resolve no tyranny should make her enter into so hateful a union  in the meantime whether the good lady hameline of croye understood and admired masculine beauty as much as when she was fifteen years younger for the good countess was at least thirtyfive if the records of that noble house speak the truth or whether she thought she had done their young protector less justice than she ought in the first view which she had taken of his services it is certain that he began to find favour in her eyes  my niece she said has bestowed on you a kerchief for the binding of your wound i will give you one to grace your gallantry and to encourage you in your farther progress in chivalry  so saying she gave him a richly embroidered kerchief of blue and silver and pointing to the housing of her palfrey and the plumes in her riding cap desired him to observe that the colours were the same  the fashion of the time prescribed one absolute mode of receiving such a favour which quentin followed accordingly by tying the napkin around his arm yet his manner of acknowledgment had more of awkwardness and loss of gallantry in it than perhaps it might have had at another time and in another presence for though the wearing of a ladys favour given in such a manner was merely matter of general compliment he would much rather have preferred the right of displaying on his arm that which bound the wound inflicted by the sword of dunois  meantime they continued their pilgrimage quentin now riding abreast of the ladies into whose society he seemed to be tacitly adopted he did not speak much however being filled by the silent consciousness of happiness which is afraid of giving too strong vent to its feelings the countess isabelle spoke still less so that the conversation was chiefly carried on by the lady hameline who showed no inclination to let it drop for to initiate the young archer as she said into the principles and practice of chivalry she detailed to him at full length the passage of arms at haflinghem where she had distributed the prizes among the victors  not much interested i am sorry to say in the description of this splendid scene or in the heraldic bearings of the different flemish and german knights which the lady blazoned with pitiless accuracy quentin began to entertain some alarm lest he should have passed the place where his guide was to join hima most serious disaster from which should it really have taken place the very worst consequences were to be apprehended  while he hesitated whether it would be better to send back one of his followers to see whether this might not be the case he heard the blast of a horn and looking in the direction from which the sound came beheld a horseman riding very fast towards them the low size and wild shaggy untrained state of the animal reminded quentin of the mountain breed of horses in his own country but this was much more finely limbed and with the same appearance of hardiness was more rapid in its movements the head particularly which in the scottish pony is often lumpish and heavy was small and well placed in the neck of this animal with thin jaws full sparkling eyes and expanded nostrils  the rider was even more singular in his appearance than the horse which he rode though that was extremely unlike the horses of france although he managed his palfrey with great dexterity he sat with his feet in broad stirrups something resembling shovels so short in the leathers that his knees were well nigh as high as the pommel of his saddle his dress was a red turban of small size in which he wore a sullied plume secured by a clasp of silver his tunic which was shaped like those of the estradiots a sort of troops whom the venetians at that time levied in the provinces on the eastern side of their gulf was green in colour and tawdrily laced with gold he wore very wide drawers or trowsers of white though none of the cleanest which gathered beneath the knee and his swarthy legs were quite bare unless for the complicated laces which bound a pair of sandals on his feet he had no spurs the edge of his large stirrups being so sharp as to serve to goad the horse in a very severe manner in a crimson sash this singular horseman wore a dagger on the right side and on the left a short crooked moorish sword and by a tarnished baldric over the shoulder hung the horn which announced his approach he had a swarthy and sunburnt visage with a thin beard and piercing dark eyes a well formed mouth and nose and other features which might have been pronounced handsome but for the black elf locks which hung around his face and the air of wildness and emaciation which rather seemed to indicate a savage than a civilized man  he also is a bohemian said the ladies to each other holy mary will the king again place confidence in these outcasts  i will question the man if it be your pleasure said quentin and assure myself of his fidelity as i best may  durward as well as the ladies of croye had recognised in this mans dress and appearance the habit and the manners of those vagrants with whom he had nearly been confounded by the hasty proceedings of trois eschelles and petit andre and he too entertained very natural apprehensions concerning the risk of reposing trust in one of that vagrant race  art thou come hither to seek us was his first question the stranger nodded and for what purpose  to guide you to the palace of him of liege  of the bishop  the bohemian again nodded  what token canst thou give me that we should yield credence to thee  even the old rhyme and no other answered the bohemian        the page slew the boar      the peer had the gloire   a true token said quentin lead on good fellowi will speak farther with thee presently  then falling back to the ladies he said i am convinced this man is the guide we are to expect for he hath brought me a password known i think but to the king and me but i will discourse with him farther and endeavour to ascertain how far he is to be trusted    chapter xvi the vagrant       i am as free as nature first made man      ere the base laws of servitude began      when wild in woods the noble savage ran       the conquest of grenada   while quentin held the brief communication with the ladies necessary to assure them that this extraordinary addition to their party was the guide whom they were to expect on the kings part he noticed for he was as alert in observing the motions of the stranger as the bohemian could be on his part that the man not only turned his head as far back as he could to peer at them but that with a singular sort of agility more resembling that of a monkey than of a man he had screwed his whole person around on the saddle so as to sit almost sidelong upon the horse for the convenience as it seemed of watching them more attentively  not greatly pleased with this manoeuvre quentin rode up to the bohemian and said to him as he suddenly assumed his proper position on the horse methinks friend you will prove but a blind guide if you look at the tail of your horse rather than his ears  and if i were actually blind answered the bohemian i could not the less guide you through any county in this realm of france or in those adjoining to it  yet you are no frenchman said the scot  i am not answered the guide  what countryman then are you demanded quentin  i am of no country answered the guide  how of no country repeated the scot  no answered the bohemian of none i am a zingaro a bohemian an egyptian or whatever the europeans in their different languages may choose to call our people but i have no country  are you a christian asked the scotchman  the bohemian shook his head  dog said quentin for there was little toleration in the spirit of catholicism in those days dost thou worship mahoun  mahoun mohammed it was a remarkable feature of the character of these wanderers that they did not like the jews whom they otherwise resembled in some particulars possess or profess any particular religion whether in form or principle they readily conformed as far as might be required with the religion of any country in which they happened to sojourn but they did not practise it more than was demanded of them s  no was the indifferent and concise answer of the guide who neither seemed offended nor surprised at the young mans violence of manner  are you a pagan then or what are you  i have no religion answered the bohemian  durward started back for though he had heard of saracens and idolaters it had never entered into his ideas or belief that any body of men could exist who practised no mode of worship whatever he recovered from his astonishment to ask his guide where he usually dwelt  wherever i chance to be for the time replied the bohemian i have no home  how do you guard your property  excepting the clothes which i wear and the horse i ride on i have no property  yet you dress gaily and ride gallantly said durward what are your means of subsistence  i eat when i am hungry drink when i am thirsty and have no other means of subsistence than chance throws in my way replied the vagabond  under whose laws do you live  i acknowledge obedience to none but an it suits my pleasure or my necessities said the bohemian  who is your leader and commands you  the father of our tribeif i choose to obey him said the guide otherwise i have no commander  you are then said the wondering querist destitute of all that other men are combined byyou have no law no leader no settled means of subsistence no house or home you have may heaven compassionate you no countryand may heaven enlighten and forgive you you have no god what is it that remains to you deprived of government domestic happiness and religion  i have liberty said the bohemian i crouch to no one obey no onerespect no onei go where i willlive as i canand die when my day comes  but you are subject to instant execution at the pleasure of the judge  be it so returned the bohemian i can but die so much the sooner  and to imprisonment also said the scot and where then is your boasted freedom  in my thoughts said the bohemian which no chains can bind while yours even when your limbs are free remain fettered by your laws and your superstitions your dreams of local attachment and your fantastic visions of civil policy such as i are free in spirit when our limbs are chainedyou are imprisoned in mind even when your limbs are most at freedom  yet the freedom of your thoughts said the scot relieves not the pressure of the gyves on your limbs  for a brief time that may be endured answered the vagrant and if within that period i cannot extricate myself and fail of relief from my comrades i can always die and death is the most perfect freedom of all  there was a deep pause of some duration which quentin at length broke by resuming his queries  yours is a wandering race unknown to the nations of europewhence do they derive their origin  i may not tell you answered the bohemian  when will they relieve this kingdom from their presence and return to the land from whence they came said the scot  when the day of their pilgrimage shall be accomplished replied his vagrant guide  are you not sprung from those tribes of israel which were carried into captivity beyond the great river euphrates said quentin who had not forgotten the lore which had been taught him at aberbrothick  had we been so answered the bohemian we had followed their faith and practised their rites  what is thine own name said durward  my proper name is only known to my brethren the men beyond our tents call me hayraddin maugrabinthat is hayraddin the african moor  thou speakest too well for one who hath lived always in thy filthy horde said the scot  i have learned some of the knowledge of this land said hayraddin when i was a little boy our tribe was chased by the hunters after human flesh an arrow went through my mothers head and she died i was entangled in the blanket on her shoulders and was taken by the pursuers a priest begged me from the provosts archers and trained me up in frankish learning for two or three years  how came you to part with him demanded durward  i stole money from himeven the god which he worshipped answered hayraddin with perfect composure he detected me and beat mei stabbed him with my knife fled to the woods and was again united to my people  wretch said durward did you murder your benefactor  what had he to do to burden me with his benefitsthe zingaro boy was no house bred cur to dog the heels of his master and crouch beneath his blows for scraps of foodhe was the imprisoned wolf whelp which at the first opportunity broke his chain rended his master and returned to his wilderness  there was another pause when the young scot with a view of still farther investigating the character and purpose of this suspicious guide asked hayraddin whether it was not true that his people amid their ignorance pretended to a knowledge of futurity which was not given to the sages philosophers and divines of more polished society  we pretend to it said hayraddin and it is with justice  how can it be that so high a gift is bestowed on so abject a race said quentin  can i tell you answered hayraddinyes i may indeed but it is when you shall explain to me why the dog can trace the footsteps of a man while man the nobler animal hath not power to trace those of the dog these powers which seem to you so wonderful are instinctive in our race from the lines on the face and on the hand we can tell the future fate of those who consult us even as surely as you know from the blossom of the tree in spring what fruit it will bear in the harvest  i doubt of your knowledge and defy you to the proof  defy me not sir squire said hayraddin maugrabin i can tell you that say what you will of your religion the goddess whom you worship rides in this company  peace said quentin in astonishment on thy life not a word farther but in answer to what i ask theecanst thou be faithful  i canall men can said the bohemian  but wilt thou be faithful  wouldst thou believe me the more should i swear it answered maugrabin with a sneer  thy life is in my hand said the young scot  strike and see whether i fear to die answered the bohemian  will money render thee a trusty guide demanded durward  if i be not such without it no replied the heathen  then what will bind thee asked the scot  kindness replied the bohemian  shall i swear to show thee such if thou art true guide to us on this pilgrimage  no replied hayraddin it were extravagant waste of a commodity so rare to thee i am bound already  how exclaimed durward more surprised than ever  remember the chestnut trees on the banks of the cher the victim whose body thou didst cut down was my brother zamet the maugrabin  and yet said quentin i find you in correspondence with those very officers by whom your brother was done to death for it was one of them who directed me where to meet with youthe same doubtless who procured yonder ladies your services as a guide  what can we do answered hayraddin gloomily these men deal with us as the sheepdogs do with the flock they protect us for a while drive us hither and thither at their pleasure and always end by guiding us to the shambles  quentin had afterwards occasion to learn that the bohemian spoke truth in this particular and that the provost guard employed to suppress the vagabond bands by which the kingdom was infested entertained correspondence among them and forbore for a certain time the exercise of their duty which always at last ended in conducting their allies to the gallows this is a sort of political relation between thief and officer for the profitable exercise of their mutual professions which has subsisted in all countries and is by no means unknown to our own  durward parting from the guide fell back to the rest of the retinue very little satisfied with the character of hayraddin and entertaining little confidence in the professions of gratitude which he had personally made to him he proceeded to sound the other two men who had been assigned him for attendants and he was concerned to find them stupid and as unfit to assist him with counsel as in the rencounter they had shown themselves reluctant to use their weapons  it is all the better said quentin to himself his spirit rising with the apprehended difficulties of his situation that lovely young lady shall owe all to me what one handay and one head can domethinks i can boldly count upon i have seen my fathers house on fire and he and my brothers lying dead amongst the flamesi gave not an inch back but fought it out to the last now i am two years older and have the best and fairest cause to bear me well that ever kindled mettle within a brave mans bosom  acting upon this resolution the attention and activity which quentin bestowed during the journey had in it something that gave him the appearance of ubiquity his principal and most favourite post was of course by the side of the ladies who sensible of his extreme attention to their safety began to converse with him in almost the tone of familiar friendship and appeared to take great pleasure in the naivete yet shrewdness of his conversation yet quentin did not suffer the fascination of this intercourse to interfere with the vigilant discharge of his duty  if he was often by the side of the countesses labouring to describe to the natives of a level country the grampian mountains and above all the beauties of glen houlakin he was as often riding with hayraddin in the front of the cavalcade questioning him about the road and the resting places and recording his answers in his mind to ascertain whether upon cross examination he could discover anything like meditated treachery as often again he was in the rear endeavouring to secure the attachment of the two horsemen by kind words gifts and promises of additional recompense when their task should be accomplished  in this way they travelled for more than a week through bypaths and unfrequented districts and by circuitous routes in order to avoid large towns nothing remarkable occurred though they now and then met strolling gangs of bohemians who respected them as under the conduct of one of their tribestraggling soldiers or perhaps banditti who deemed their party too strong to be attackedor parties of the marechaussee mounted police as they would now be termed whom louis who searched the wounds of the land with steel and cautery employed to suppress the disorderly bands which infested the interior these last suffered them to pursue their way unmolested by virtue of a password with which quentin had been furnished for that purpose by the king himself  their resting places were chiefly the monasteries most of which were obliged by the rules of their foundation to receive pilgrims under which character the ladies travelled with hospitality and without any troublesome inquiries into their rank and character which most persons of distinction were desirous of concealing while in the discharge of their vows the pretence of weariness was usually employed by the countesses of croye as an excuse for instantly retiring to rest and quentin as their majordomo arranged all that was necessary betwixt them and their entertainers with a shrewdness which saved them all trouble and an alacrity that failed not to excite a corresponding degree of good will on the part of those who were thus sedulously attended to  one circumstance gave quentin peculiar trouble which was the character and nation of his guide who as a heathen and an infidel vagabond addicted besides to occult arts the badge of all his tribe was often looked upon as a very improper guest for the holy resting places at which the company usually halted and was not in consequence admitted within even the outer circuit of their walls save with extreme reluctance this was very embarrassing for on the one hand it was necessary to keep in good humour a man who was possessed of the secret of their expedition and on the other quentin deemed it indispensable to maintain a vigilant though secret watch on hayraddins conduct in order that as far as might be he should hold no communication with any one without being observed this of course was impossible if the bohemian was lodged without the precincts of the convent at which they stopped and durward could not help thinking that hayraddin was desirous of bringing about this latter arrangement for instead of keeping himself still and quiet in the quarters allotted to him his conversation tricks and songs were at the same time so entertaining to the novices and younger brethren and so unedifying in the opinion of the seniors of the fraternity that in more cases than one it required all the authority supported by threats which quentin could exert over him to restrain his irreverent and untimeous jocularity and all the interest he could make with the superiors to prevent the heathen hound from being thrust out of the doors he succeeded however by the adroit manner in which he apologized for the acts of indecorum committed by their attendant and the skill with which he hinted the hope of his being brought to a better sense of principles and behaviour by the neighbourhood of holy relics consecrated buildings and above all of men dedicated to religion  but upon the tenth or twelfth day of their journey after they had entered flanders and were approaching the town of namur all the efforts of quentin became inadequate to suppress the consequences of the scandal given by his heathen guide the scene was a franciscan convent and of a strict and reformed order and the prior a man who afterwards died in the odour of sanctity after rather more than the usual scruples which were indeed in such a case to be expected had been surmounted the obnoxious bohemian at length obtained quarters in an out house inhabited by a lay brother who acted as gardener the ladies retired to their apartment as usual and the prior who chanced to have some distant alliances and friends in scotland and who was fond of hearing foreigners tell of their native countries invited quentin with whose mien and conduct he seemed much pleased to a slight monastic refection in his own cell finding the father a man of intelligence quentin did not neglect the opportunity of making himself acquainted with the state of affairs in the country of liege of which during the last two days of their journey he had heard such reports as made him very apprehensive for the security of his charge during the remainder of their route nay even of the bishops power to protect them when they should be safely conducted to his residence the replies of the prior were not very consolatory  he said that the people of liege were wealthy burghers who like jeshurun a designation for israel of old had waxed fat and kickedthat they were uplifted in heart because of their wealth and their privilegesthat they had divers disputes with the duke of burgundy their liege lord upon the subject of imports and immunities and that they had repeatedly broken out into open mutiny whereat the duke was so much incensed as being a man of a hot and fiery nature that he had sworn by saint george on the next provocation he would make the city of liege like to the desolation of babylon and the downfall of tyre a hissing and a reproach to the whole territory of flanders  babylon taken by cyrus in 538 b c see revelation xviii 21 a mighty angel took up a stone and cast it into the sea saying thus with violence shall that great city babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more  tyre conquered by alexander the great in 332 b c i will make thee a terror and thou shalt be no more yet shalt thou never be found again saith the lord god ezekiel xxvi 21  and he is a prince by all report likely to keep such a vow said quentin so the men of liege will probably beware how they give him occasion  it were to be so hoped said the prior and such are the prayers of the godly in the land who would not that the blood of the citizens were poured forth like water and that they should perish even as utter castaways ere they make their peace with heaven also the good bishop labours night and day to preserve peace as well becometh a servant of the altar for it is written in holy scripture beati pacifici buthere the good prior stopped with a deep sigh  quentin modestly urged the great importance of which it was to the ladies whom he attended to have some assured information respecting the internal state of the country and what an act of christian charity it would be if the worthy and reverend father would enlighten them upon that subject  it is one said the prior on which no man speaks with willingness for those who speak evil of the powerful etiam in cubiculo even in the bed chamber may find that a winged thing shall carry the matter to his ears nevertheless to render you who seem an ingenuous youth and your ladies who are devout votaresses accomplishing a holy pilgrimage the little service that is in my power i will be plain with you  he then looked cautiously round and lowered his voice as if afraid of being overheard  the people of liege he said are privily instigated to their frequent mutinies by men of belial in the bible this term is used as an appellative of satan who pretend but as i hope falsely to have commission to that effect from our most christian king whom however i hold to deserve that term better than were consistent with his thus disturbing the peace of a neighbouring state yet so it is that his name is freely used by those who uphold and inflame the discontents at liege there is moreover in the land a nobleman of good descent and fame in warlike affairs but otherwise so to speak lapis offensionis et petra scandaliand a stumbling block of offence to the countries of burgundy and flanders his name is william de la marck  called william with the beard said the young scot or the wild boar of ardennes  and rightly so called my son said the prior because he is as the wild boar of the forest which treadeth down with his hoofs and rendeth with his tusks and he hath formed to himself a band of more than a thousand men all like himself contemners of civil and ecclesiastical authority and holds himself independent of the duke of burgundy and maintains himself and his followers by rapine and wrong wrought without distinction upon churchmen and laymen imposuit manus in christos dominihe hath stretched forth his hand upon the anointed of the lord regardless of what is written touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no wrongeven to our poor house did he send for sums of gold and sums of silver as a ransom for our lives and those of our brethren to which we returned a latin supplication stating our inability to answer his demand and exhorting him in the words of the preacher ne moliaris amico tuo malum cum habet in te fiduciam devise not evil against thy neighbour who dwelleth by thee in security nevertheless this guilielmus barbatus this william de la marck as completely ignorant of humane letters as of humanity itself replied in his ridiculous jargon si non payatis brulabo monasterium vestrum if you do not pay i will burn your monastery a similar story is told of the duke of vendome who answered in this sort of macaronic latin the classical expostulations of a german convent against the imposition of a contribution s  of which rude latin however you my good father said the youth were at no loss to conceive the meaning  alas my son said the prior fear and necessity are shrewd interpreters and we were obliged to melt down the silver vessels of our altar to satisfy the rapacity of this cruel chief may heaven requite it to him seven fold pereat improbusamen amen anathema esto let the wicked perish let him be anathema in pronouncing an anathema against a person the church excludes him from her communion and he must if he continue obstinate perish eternally cent dict  i marvel said quentin that the duke of burgundy who is so strong and powerful doth not bait this boar to purpose of whose ravages i have already heard so much  alas my son said the prior the duke charles is now at peronne assembling his captains of hundreds and his captains of thousands to make war against france and thus while heaven hath set discord between the hearts of those great princes the country is misused by such subordinate oppressors but it is in evil time that the duke neglects the cure of these internal gangrenes for this william de la marck hath of late entertained open communication with rouslaer and pavillon the chiefs of the discontented at liege and it is to be feared he will soon stir them up to some desperate enterprise  but the bishop of liege said quentin he hath still power enough to subdue this disquieted and turbulent spirithath he not good father your answer to this question concerns me much  the bishop my child replied the prior hath the sword of saint peter as well as the keys he hath power as a secular prince and he hath the protection of the mighty house of burgundy he hath also spiritual authority as a prelate and he supports both with a reasonable forceof good soldiers and men at arms this william de la marck was bred in his household and bound to him by many benefits but he gave vent even in the court of the bishop to his fierce and bloodthirsty temper and was expelled thence for a homicide committed on one of the bishops chief domestics from thenceforward being banished from the good prelates presence he hath been his constant and unrelenting foe and now i grieve to say he hath girded his loins and strengthened his horn against him  you consider then the situation of the worthy prelate as being dangerous said quentin very anxiously  alas my son said the good franciscan what or who is there in this weary wilderness whom we may not hold as in danger but heaven forefend i should speak of the reverend prelate as one whose peril is imminent he has much treasure true counsellors and brave soldiers and moreover a messenger who passed hither to the eastward yesterday saith that the duke of burgundy hath dispatched upon the bishops request an hundred men at arms to his assistance this reinforcement with the retinue belonging to each lance are enough to deal with william de la marck on whose name be sorrowamen  at this crisis their conversation was interrupted by the sacristan who in a voice almost inarticulate with anger accused the bohemian of having practised the most abominable arts of delusion among the younger brethren he had added to their nightly meal cups of a heady and intoxicating cordial of ten times the strength of the most powerful wine under which several of the fraternity had succumbed and indeed although the sacristan had been strong to resist its influence they might yet see from his inflamed countenance and thick speech that even he the accuser himself was in some degree affected by this unhallowed potation moreover the bohemian had sung songs of worldly vanity and impure pleasures he had derided the cord of saint francis made jest of his miracles and termed his votaries fools and lazy knaves lastly he had practised palmistry and foretold to the young father cherubin that he was helped by a beautiful lady who should make him father to a thriving boy  the father prior listened to these complaints for some time in silence as struck with mute horror by their enormous atrocity when the sacristan had concluded he rose up descended to the court of the convent and ordered the lay brethren on pain of the worst consequences of spiritual disobedience to beat hayraddin out of the sacred precincts with their broom staves and cart whips  this sentence was executed accordingly in the presence of quentin durward who however vexed at the occurrence easily saw that his interference would be of no avail  the discipline inflicted upon the delinquent notwithstanding the exhortations of the superior was more ludicrous than formidable the bohemian ran hither and thither through the court amongst the clamour of voices and noise of blows some of which reached him not because purposely misaimed others sincerely designed for his person were eluded by his activity and the few that fell upon his back and shoulders he took without either complaint or reply the noise and riot was the greater that the inexperienced cudgel players among whom hayraddin ran the gauntlet hit each other more frequently than they did him till at length desirous of ending a scene which was more scandalous than edifying the prior commanded the wicket to be flung open and the bohemian darting through it with the speed of lightning fled forth into the moonlight during this scene a suspicion which durward had formerly entertained recurred with additional strength hayraddin had that very morning promised to him more modest and discreet behaviour than he was wont to exhibit when they rested in a convent on their journey yet he had broken his engagement and had been even more offensively obstreperous than usual something probably lurked under this for whatever were the bohemians deficiencies he lacked neither sense nor when he pleased self command and might it not be probable that he wished to hold some communication either with his own horde or some one else from which he was debarred in the course of the day by the vigilance with which he was watched by quentin and had recourse to this stratagem in order to get himself turned out of the convent  no sooner did this suspicion dart once more through quentins mind than alert as he always was in his motions he resolved to follow his cudgelled guide and observe secretly if possible how he disposed of himself accordingly when the bohemian fled as already mentioned out at the gate of the convent quentin hastily explaining to the prior the necessity of keeping sight of his guide followed in pursuit of him    chapter xvii the espied spy       what the rude ranger and spied spyhands off      you are for no such rustics       ben jonsons tale of robin hood   when quentin sallied from the convent he could mark the precipitate retreat of the bohemian whose dark figure was seen in the far moonlight flying with the speed of a flogged hound quite through the street of the little village and across the level meadow that lay beyond  my friend runs fast said quentin to himself but he must run faster yet to escape the fleetest foot that ever pressed the heather of glen houlakin  being fortunately without his cloak and armour the scottish mountaineer was at liberty to put forth a speed which was unrivalled in his own glens and which notwithstanding the rate at which the bohemian ran was likely soon to bring his pursuer up with him this was not however quentins object for he considered it more essential to watch hayraddins motions than to interrupt them he was the rather led to this by the steadiness with which the bohemian directed his course and which continuing even after the impulse of the violent expulsion had subsided seemed to indicate that his career had some more certain goal for its object than could have suggested itself to a person unexpectedly turned out of good quarters when midnight was approaching to seek a new place of repose he never even looked behind him and consequently durward was enabled to follow him unobserved at length the bohemian having traversed the meadow and attained the side of a little stream the banks of which were clothed with alders and willows quentin observed that he stood still and blew a low note on his horn which was answered by a whistle at some little distance  this is a rendezvous thought quentin but how shall i come near enough to overhear the import of what passes the sound of my steps and the rustling of the boughs through which i must force my passage will betray me unless i am cautiousi will stalk them by saint andrew as if they were glen isla deerthey shall learn that i have not conned woodcraft for naught yonder they meet the two shadowsand two of them there areodds against me if i am discovered and if their purpose be unfriendly as is much to be doubted and then the countess isabelle loses her poor friendwell and he were not worthy to be called such if he were not ready to meet a dozen in her behalf have i not crossed swords with dunois the best knight in france and shall i fear a tribe of yonder vagabonds pshawgod and saint andrew to friend they will find me both stout and wary  thus resolving and with a degree of caution taught him by his silvan habits our friend descended into the channel of the little stream which varied in depth sometimes scarce covering his shoes sometimes coming up to his knees and so crept along his form concealed by the boughs overhanging the bank and his steps unheard amid the ripple of the water we have ourselves in the days of yore thus approached the nest of the wakeful raven in this manner the scot drew near unperceived until he distinctly heard the voices of those who were the subject of his observation though he could not distinguish the words being at this time under the drooping branches of a magnificent weeping willow which almost swept the surface of the water he caught hold of one of its boughs by the assistance of which exerting at once much agility dexterity and strength he raised himself up into the body of the tree and sat secure from discovery among the central branches  from this situation he could discover that the person with whom hayraddin was now conversing was one of his own tribe and at the same time he perceived to his great disappointment that no approximation could enable him to comprehend their language which was totally unknown to him they laughed much and as hayraddin made a sign of skipping about and ended by rubbing his shoulder with his hand durward had no doubt that he was relating the story of the bastinading which he had sustained previous to his escape from the convent  on a sudden a whistle was again heard in the distance which was once more answered by a low tone or two of hayraddins horn presently afterwards a tall stout soldierly looking man a strong contrast in point of thews and sinews to the small and slender limbed bohemians made his appearance he had a broad baldric over his shoulder which sustained a sword that hung almost across his person his hose were much slashed through which slashes was drawn silk or tiffany of various colours they were tied by at least five hundred points or strings made of ribbon to the tight buff jacket which he wore the right sleeve of which displayed a silver boars head the crest of his captain a very small hat sat jauntily on one side of his head from which descended a quantity of curled hair which fell on each side of a broad face and mingled with as broad a beard about four inches long he held a long lance in his hand and his whole equipment was that of one of the german adventurers who were known by the name of lanzknechts in english spearmen who constituted a formidable part of the infantry of the period these mercenaries were of course a fierce and rapacious soldiery and having an idle tale current among themselves that a lanzknecht was refused admittance into heaven on account of his vices and into hell on the score of his tumultuous mutinous and insubordinate disposition they manfully acted as if they neither sought the one nor eschewed the other  donner and blitz thunder and lightning was his first salutation in a sort of german french which we can only imperfectly imitate why have you kept me dancing in attendance dis dree nights  i could not see you sooner meinherr said hayraddin very submissively there is a young scot with as quick an eye as the wildcat who watches my least motions he suspects me already and should he find his suspicion confirmed i were a dead man on the spot and he would carry back the women into france again  was henker what the deuce said the lanzknecht we are threewe will attack them tomorrow and carry the women off without going farther you said the two valets were cowardsyou and your comrade may manage them and the teufel the devil shall hold me but i match your scots wildcat  you will find that foolhardy said hayraddin for besides that we ourselves count not much in fighting this spark hath matched himself with the best knight in france and come off with honouri have seen those who saw him press dunois hard enough  hagel and sturmwetter hail and stormy weather it is but your cowardice that speaks said the german soldier  i am no more a coward than yourself said hayraddin but my trade is not fightingif you keep the appointment where it was laid it is wellif not i guide them safely to the bishops palace and william de la marck may easily possess himself of them there provided he is half as strong as he pretended a week since  poz tausend zounds said the soldier we are as strong and stronger but we hear of a hundreds of the lances of burgunddas ist see youfive men to a lance do make five hundreds and then hold me the devil they will be fainer to seek for us than we to seek for them for der bischoff hath a goot force on footingay indeed  you must then hold to the ambuscade at the cross of the three kings or give up the adventure said the bohemian  geb upgeb up the adventure of the rich bride for our noble hauptman leader or captainteufel i will charge through hell firstmein soul we will be all princes and hertzogs whom they call dukes and we will hab a snab at the wein kellar wine cellar and at the mouldy french crowns and it may be at the pretty garces too meaning the countesses when he with de beard is weary on them  the ambuscade at the cross of the three kings then still holds said the bohemian  mein gob ayyou will swear to bring them there and when they are on their knees before the cross and down from off their horses which all men do except such black heathens as thou we will make in on them and they are ours  ay but i promised this piece of necessary villainy only on one condition said hayraddini will not have a hair of the young mans head touched if you swear this to me by your three dead men of cologne i will swear to you by the seven night walkers that i will serve you truly as to the rest and if you break your oath the night walkers shall wake you seven nights from your sleep between night and morning and on the eighth they shall strangle and devour you  but donner and bagel what need you be so curious about the life of this boy who is neither your bloot nor kin said the german  no matter for that honest heinrick some men have pleasure in cutting throats some in keeping them wholeso swear to me that you will spare him life and limb or by the bright star aldebaran this matter shall go no fartherswear and by the three kings as you call them of colognei know you care for no other oath  du bist ein comische man thou art a droll fellow said the lanzknecht i swear  not yet said the bohemian face about brave lanzknecht and look to the east else the kings may not hear you  the soldier took the oath in the manner prescribed and then declared that he would be in readiness observing the place was quite convenient being scarce five miles from their present leaguer  but were it not making sure work to have a fahnlein a regiment or company of riders on the other road by the left side of the inn which might trap them if they go that way  the bohemian considered a moment and then answered nothe appearance of their troops in that direction might alarm the garrison of namur and then they would have a doubtful fight instead of assured success besides they shall travel on the right bank of the maes for i can guide them which way i will for sharp as this same scottish mountaineer is he hath never asked any ones advice save mine upon the direction of their route undoubtedly i was assigned to him by an assured friend whose word no man mistrusts till they come to know him a little  hark ye friend hayraddin said the soldier i would ask you somewhat you and your bruder were as you say yourself gross sternen deuter that is star lookers and geister seers seers of ghosts now what henker was it made you not foresee him your bruder zamet to be hanged  i will tell you heinrick said hayraddin if i could have known my brother was such a fool as to tell the counsel of king louis to duke charles of burgundy i could have foretold his death as sure as i can foretell fair weather in july louis hath both ears and hands at the court of burgundy and charless counsellors love the chink of french gold as well as thou dost the clatter of a wine potbut fare thee well and keep appointmenti must await my early scot a bow shot without the gate of the den of the lazy swine yonder else will he think me about some excursion which bodes no good to the success of his journey  take a draught of comfort first said the lanzknecht tendering him a flaskbut i forget thou art beast enough to drink nothing but water like a vile vassal of mahound and termagund the name of the god of the saracens in medieaval romances where he is linked with mahound  thou art thyself a vassal of the wine measure and the flagon said the bohemian i marvel not that thou art only trusted with the bloodthirsty and violent part of executing what better heads have devisedhe must drink no wine who would know the thoughts of others or hide his own but why preach to thee who hast a thirst as eternal as a sand bank in arabia  fare thee well take my comrade tuisco with theehis appearance about the monastery may breed suspicion  the two worthies parted after each had again pledged himself to keep the rendezvous at the cross of the three kings quentin durward watched until they were out of sight and then descended from his place of concealment his heart throbbing at the narrow escape which he and his fair charge had madeif indeed it could yet be achievedfrom a deep laid plan of villainy afraid on his return to the monastery of stumbling upon hayraddin he made a long detour at the expense of traversing some very rough ground and was thus enabled to return to his asylum on a different point from that by which he left it  on the route he communed earnestly with himself concerning the safest plan to be pursued he had formed the resolution when he first heard hayraddin avow his treachery to put him to death so soon as the conference broke up and his companions were at a sufficient distance but when he heard the bohemian express so much interest in saving his own life he felt it would be ungrateful to execute upon him in its rigour the punishment his treachery had deserved he therefore resolved to spare his life and even if possible still to use his services as a guide under such precautions as should ensure the security of the precious charge to the preservation of which his own life was internally devoted  but whither were they to turnthe countesses of croye could neither obtain shelter in burgundy from which they had fled nor in france from which they had been in a manner expelled the violence of duke charles in the one country was scarcely more to be feared than the cold and tyrannical policy of king louis in the other after deep thought durward could form no better or safer plan for their security than that evading the ambuscade they should take the road to liege by the left hand of the maes and throw themselves as the ladies originally designed upon the protection of the excellent bishop that prelates will to protect them could not be doubted and if reinforced by this burgundian party of men at arms he might be considered as having the power at any rate if the dangers to which he was exposed from the hostility of william de la marck and from the troubles in the city of liege appeared imminent he would still be able to protect the unfortunate ladies until they could be dispatched to germany with a suitable escort  to sum up this reasoningfor when is a mental argument conducted without some reference to selfish considerationquentin imagined that the death or captivity to which king louis had in cold blood consigned him set him at liberty from his engagements to the crown of france which therefore it was his determined purpose to renounce the bishop of liege was likely he concluded to need soldiers and he thought that by the interposition of his fair friends who now especially the elder countess treated him with much familiarity he might get some command and perhaps might have the charge of conducting the ladies of croye to some place more safe than the neighbourhood of liege and to conclude the ladies had talked although almost in a sort of jest of raising the countesss own vassals and as others did in those stormy times fortifying her strong castle against all assailants whatever they had jestingly asked quentin whether he would accept the perilous office of their seneschal and on his embracing the office with ready glee and devotion they had in the same spirit permitted him to kiss both their hands on that confidential and honourable appointment nay he thought that the hand of the countess isabelle one of the best formed and most beautiful to which true vassal ever did such homage trembled when his lips rested on it a moment longer than ceremony required and that some confusion appeared on her cheek and in her eye as she withdrew it something might come of all this and what brave man at quentin durwards age but would gladly have taken the thoughts which it awakened into the considerations which were to determine his conduct  this point settled he had next to consider in what degree he was to use the farther guidance of the faithless bohemian he had renounced his first thought of killing him in the wood and if he took another guide and dismissed him alive it would be sending the traitor to the camp of william de la marck with intelligence of their motions he thought of taking the prior into his counsels and requesting him to detain the bohemian by force until they should have time to reach the bishops castle but on reflection he dared not hazard such a proposition to one who was timid both as an old man and a friar who held the safety of his convent the most important object of his duty and who trembled at the mention of the wild boar of ardennes  at length durward settled a plan of operation on which he could the better reckon as the execution rested entirely upon himself and in the cause in which he was engaged he felt himself capable of everything with a firm and bold heart though conscious of the dangers of his situation quentin might be compared to one walking under a load of the weight of which he is conscious but which yet is not beyond his strength and power of endurance just as his plan was determined he reached the convent  upon knocking gently at the gate a brother considerately stationed for that purpose by the prior opened it and acquainted him that the brethren were to be engaged in the choir till daybreak praying heaven to forgive to the community the various scandals which had that evening taken place among them  the worthy friar offered quentin permission to attend their devotions but his clothes were in such a wet condition that the young scot was obliged to decline the opportunity and request permission instead to sit by the kitchen fire in order to his attire being dried before morning as he was particularly desirous that the bohemian when they should next meet should observe no traces of his having been abroad during the night the friar not only granted his request but afforded him his own company which fell in very happily with the desire which durward had to obtain information concerning the two routes which he had heard mentioned by the bohemian in his conversation with the lanzknecht the friar entrusted upon many occasions with the business of the convent abroad was the person in the fraternity best qualified to afford him the information he requested but observed that as true pilgrims it became the duty of the ladies whom quentin escorted to take the road on the right side of the maes by the cross of the kings where the blessed relics of caspar melchior and balthasar as the catholic church has named the eastern magi who came to bethlehem with their offerings had rested as they were transported to cologne and on which spot they had wrought many miracles  quentin replied that the ladies were determined to observe all the holy stations with the utmost punctuality and would certainly visit that of the cross either in going to or from cologne but they had heard reports that the road by the right side of the river was at present rendered unsafe by the soldiers of the ferocious william de la marck  now may heaven forbid said father francis that the wild boar of ardennes should again make his lair so near usnevertheless the broad maes will be a good barrier betwixt us even should it so chance  but it will be no barrier between my ladies and the marauder should we cross the river and travel on the right answered the scot  heaven will protect its own young man said the friar for it were hard to think that the kings of yonder blessed city of cologne who will not endure that a jew or infidel should even enter within the walls of their town could be oblivious enough to permit their worshippers coming to their shrine as true pilgrims to be plundered and misused by such a miscreant dog as this boar of ardennes who is worse than a whole desert of saracen heathens and all the ten tribes of israel to boot  whatever reliance quentin as a sincere catholic was bound to rest upon the special protection of melchior caspar and balthasar he could not but recollect that the pilgrim habits of the ladies being assumed out of mere earthly policy he and his charge could scarcely expect their countenance on the present occasion and therefore resolved as far as possible to avoid placing the ladies in any predicament where miraculous interposition might be necessary whilst in the simplicity of his good faith he himself vowed a pilgrimage to the three kings of cologne in his own proper person provided the simulate design of those over whose safety he was now watching should be permitted by those reasonable and royal as well as sainted personages to attain the desired effect  that he might enter into this obligation with all solemnity he requested the friar to show him into one of the various chapels which opened from the main body of the church of the convent where upon his knees and with sincere devotion he ratified the vow which he had made internally the distant sound of the choir the solemnity of the deep and dead hour which he had chosen for this act of devotion the effect of the glimmering lamp with which the little gothic building was illuminatedall contributed to throw quentins mind into the state when it most readily acknowledges its human frailty and seeks that supernatural aid and protection which in every worship must be connected with repentance for past sins and resolutions of future amendment that the object of his devotion was misplaced was not the fault of quentin and its purpose being sincere we can scarce suppose it unacceptable to the only true deity who regards the motives and not the forms of prayer and in whose eyes the sincere devotion of a heathen is more estimable than the specious hypocrisy of a pharisee  having commended himself and his helpless companions to the saints and to the keeping of providence quentin at length retired to rest leaving the friar much edified by the depth and sincerity of his devotion    chapter xviii palmistry       when many a many tale and many a song      cheerd the rough road we wishd the rough road long      the rough road then returning in a round      mockd our enchanted steps for all was fairy ground       samuel johnson   by peep of day quentin durward had forsaken his little cell had roused the sleepy grooms and with more than his wonted care seen that everything was prepared for the days journey girths and bridles the horse furniture and the shoes of the horses themselves were carefully inspected with his own eyes that there might be as little chance as possible of the occurrence of any of those casualties which petty as they seem often interrupt or disconcert travelling the horses were also under his own inspection carefully fed so as to render them fit for a long days journey or if that should be necessary for a hasty flight  quentin then betook himself to his own chamber armed himself with unusual care and belted on his sword with the feeling at once of approaching danger and of stern determination to dare it to the uttermost  these generous feelings gave him a loftiness of step and a dignity of manner which the ladies of croye had not yet observed in him though they had been highly pleased and interested by the grace yet naivete of his general behaviour and conversation and the mixture of shrewd intelligence which naturally belonged to him with the simplicity arising from his secluded education and distant country he let them understand that it would be necessary that they should prepare for their journey this morning rather earlier than usual and accordingly they left the convent immediately after a morning repast for which as well as the other hospitalities of the house the ladies made acknowledgment by a donation to the altar befitting rather their rank than their appearance but this excited no suspicion as they were supposed to be englishwomen and the attribute of superior wealth attached at that time to the insular character as strongly as in our own day  the prior blessed them as they mounted to depart and congratulated quentin on the absence of his heathen guide  for said the venerable man better stumble in the path than be upheld by the arm of a thief or robber  quentin was not quite of his opinion for dangerous as he knew the bohemian to be he thought he could use his services and at the same time baffle his treasonable purpose now that he saw clearly to what it tended but his anxiety upon this subject was soon at an end for the little cavalcade was not an hundred yards from the monastery and the village before maugrabin joined it riding as usual on his little active and wild looking jennet their road led them along the side of the same brook where quentin had overheard the mysterious conference the preceding evening and hayraddin had not long rejoined them ere they passed under the very willow tree which had afforded durward the means of concealment when he became an unsuspected hearer of what then passed betwixt that false guide and the lanzknecht  the recollections which the spot brought back stirred quentin to enter abruptly into conversation with his guide whom hitherto he had scarce spoken to  where hast thou found night quarter thou profane knave said the scot  your wisdom may guess by looking on my gaberdine answered the bohemian pointing to his dress which was covered with seeds of hay  a good haystack said quentin is a convenient bed for an astrologer and a much better than a heathen scoffer at our blessed religion and its ministers ever deserves  it suited my klepper better than me though said hayraddin patting his horse on the neck for he had food and shelter at the same time the old bald fools turned him loose as if a wise mans horse could have infected with wit or sagacity a whole convent of asses lucky that klepper knows my whistle and follows me as truly as a hound or we had never met again and you in your turn might have whistled for a guide  i have told thee more than once said durward sternly to restrain thy ribaldry when thou chancest to be in worthy mens company a thing which i believe hath rarely happened to thee in thy life before now and i promise thee that did i hold thee as faithless a guide as i esteem thee a blasphemous and worthless caitiff my scottish dirk and thy heathenish heart had ere now been acquainted although the doing such a deed were as ignoble as the sticking of swine  a wild boar is near akin to a sow said the bohemian without flinching from the sharp look with which quentin regarded him or altering in the slightest degree the caustic indifference which he affected in his language and many men he subjoined find both pride pleasure and profit in sticking them  astonished at the mans ready confidence and uncertain whether he did not know more of his own history and feelings than was pleasant for him to converse upon quentin broke off a conversation in which he had gained no advantage over maugrabin and fell back to his accustomed post beside the ladies  we have already observed that a considerable degree of familiarity had begun to establish itself between them the elder countess treated him being once well assured of the nobility of his birth like a favoured equal and though her niece showed her regard to their protector less freely yet under every disadvantage of bashfulness and timidity quentin thought he could plainly perceive that his company and conversation were not by any means indifferent to her  nothing gives such life and soul to youthful gaiety as the consciousness that it is successfully received and quentin had accordingly during the former period of their journey amused his fair charge with the liveliness of his conversation and the songs and tales of his country the former of which he sang in his native language while his efforts to render the latter into his foreign and imperfect french gave rise to a hundred little mistakes and errors of speech as diverting as the narratives themselves but on this anxious morning he rode beside the ladies of croye without any of his usual attempts to amuse them and they could not help observing his silence as something remarkable  our young companion has seen a wolf said the lady hameline alluding to an ancient superstition and he has lost his tongue in consequence  vox quoque moerim jam fugit ipsa lupi moerim videre priores virgilii ix ecloga the commentators add in explanation of this passage the opinion of pliny the being beheld by a wolf in italy is accounted noxious and is supposed to take away the speech of a man if these animals behold him ere he sees them s  to say i had tracked a fox were nearer the mark thought quentin but gave the reply no utterance  are you well seignior quentin said the countess isabelle in a tone of interest at which she herself blushed while she felt that it was something more than the distance between them warranted  he hath sat up carousing with the jolly friars said the lady hameline the scots are like the germans who spend all their mirth over the rheinwein and bring only their staggering steps to the dance in the evening and their aching heads to the ladies bower in the morning  nay gentle ladies said quentin i deserve not your reproach the good friars were at their devotions almost all night and for myself my drink was barely a cup of their thinnest and most ordinary wine  it is the badness of his fare that has put him out of humour said the countess isabelle cheer up seignior quentin and should we ever visit my ancient castle of bracquemont together if i myself should stand your cup bearer and hand it to you you shall have a generous cup of wine that the like never grew upon the vines of hochheim or johannisberg  a glass of water noble lady from your handthus far did quentin begin but his voice trembled and isabelle continued as if she had been insensible of the tenderness of the accentuation upon the personal pronoun  the wine was stocked in the deep vaults of bracquemont by my great grandfather the rhinegrave godfrey said the countess isabelle  who won the hand of her great grandmother interjected the lady hameline interrupting her niece by proving himself the best son of chivalry at the great tournament of strasbourgten knights were slain in the lists but those days are now over and no one now thinks of encountering peril for the sake of honour or to relieve distressed beauty  to this speech which was made in the tone in which a modern beauty whose charms are rather on the wane may be heard to condemn the rudeness of the present age quentin took upon him to reply that there was no lack of that chivalry which the lady hameline seemed to consider as extinct and that were it eclipsed everywhere else it would still glow in the bosoms of the scottish gentlemen  hear him said the lady hameline he would have us believe that in his cold and bleak country still lives the noble fire which has decayed in france and germany the poor youth is like a swiss mountaineer mad with partiality to his native landhe will next tell us of the vines and olives of scotland  no madam said durward of the wine and the oil of our mountains i can say little more than that our swords can compel these rich productions as tribute from our wealthier neighbours but for the unblemished faith and unfaded honour of scotland i must now put to the proof how far you can repose trust in them however mean the individual who can offer nothing more as a pledge of your safety  you speak mysteriouslyyou know of some pressing and present danger said the lady hameline  i have read it in his eye for this hour past exclaimed the lady isabelle clasping her hands sacred virgin what will become of us  nothing i hope but what you would desire answered durward and now i am compelled to askgentle ladies can you trust me  trust you answered the countess hameline certainly but why the question or how far do you ask our confidence  i on my part said the countess isabelle trust you implicitly and without condition if you can deceive us quentin i will no more look for truth save in heaven  gentle lady replied durward highly gratified you do me but justice my object is to alter our route by proceeding directly by the left bank of the maes to liege instead of crossing at namur this differs from the order assigned by king louis and the instructions given to the guide but i heard news in the monastery of marauders on the right bank of the maes and of the march of burgundian soldiers to suppress them both circumstances alarm me for your safety have i your permission so far to deviate from the route of your journey  my ample and full permission answered the younger lady  cousin said the lady hameline i believe with you that the youth means us wellbut bethink youwe transgress the instructions of king louis so positively iterated  and why should we regard his instructions said the lady isabelle i am i thank heaven for it no subject of his and as a suppliant he has abused the confidence he induced me to repose in him i would not dishonour this young gentleman by weighing his word for an instant against the injunctions of yonder crafty and selfish despot  now may god bless you for that very word lady said quentin joyously and if i deserve not the trust it expresses tearing with wild horses in this life and eternal tortures in the next were een too good for my deserts  so saying he spurred his horse and rejoined the bohemian this worthy seemed of a remarkably passive if not a forgiving temper injury or threat never dwelt or at least seemed not to dwell in his recollection and he entered into the conversation which durward presently commenced just as if there had been no unkindly word betwixt them in the course of the morning  the dog thought the scot snarls not now because he intends to clear scores with me at once and for ever when he can snatch me by the very throat but we will try for once whether we cannot foil a traitor at his own weapons  honest hayraddin he said thou hast travelled with us for ten days yet hast never shown us a specimen of your skill in fortune telling which you are nevertheless so fond of practising that you must needs display your gifts in every convent at which we stop at the risk of being repaid by a nights lodging under a haystack  you have never asked me for a specimen of my skill said the gipsy you are like the rest of the world contented to ridicule those mysteries which they do not understand  give me then a present proof of your skill said quentin and ungloving his hand he held it out to the gipsy  hayraddin carefully regarded all the lines which crossed each other on the scotchmans palm and noted with equally scrupulous attention the little risings or swellings at the roots of the fingers which were then believed as intimately connected with the disposition habits and fortunes of the individual as the organs of the brain are pretended to be in our own time  here is a hand said hayraddin which speaks of toils endured and dangers encountered i read in it an early acquaintance with the hilt of the sword and yet some acquaintance also with the clasps of the mass book  this of my past life you may have learned elsewhere said quentin tell me something of the future  this line from the hill of venus said the bohemian not broken off abruptly but attending and accompanying the line of life argues a certain and large fortune by marriage whereby the party shall be raised among the wealthy and the noble by the influence of successful love  such promises you make to all who ask your advice said quentin they are part of your art  what i tell you is as certain said hayraddin as that you shall in brief space be menaced with mighty danger which i infer from this bright blood red line cutting the table line transversely and intimating stroke of sword or other violence from which you shall only be saved by the attachment of a faithful friend  thyself ha said quentin somewhat indignant that the chiromantist should thus practise on his credulity and endeavour to found a reputation by predicting the consequences of his own treachery  my art replied the zingaro tells me naught that concerns myself  in this then the seers of my land said quentin excel your boasted knowledge for their skill teaches them the dangers by which they are themselves beset i left not my hills without having felt a portion of the double vision with which their inhabitants are gifted and i will give thee a proof of it in exchange for thy specimen of palmistry hayraddin the danger which threatens me lies on the right bank of the riveri will avoid it by travelling to liege on the left bank  the guide listened with an apathy which knowing the circumstances in which maugrabin stood quentin could not by any means comprehend  if you accomplish your purpose was the bohemians reply the dangerous crisis will be transferred from your lot to mine  i thought said quentin that you said but now that you could not presage your own fortune  not in the manner in which i have but now told you yours answered hayraddin but it requires little knowledge of louis of valois to presage that he will hang your guide because your pleasure was to deviate from the road which he recommended  the attaining with safety the purpose of the journey and ensuring its happy termination said quentin must atone for a deviation from the exact line of the prescribed route  ay replied the bohemian if you are sure that the king had in his own eye the same termination of the pilgrimage which he insinuated to you  and of what other termination is it possible that he could have been meditating or why should you suppose he had any purpose in his thought other than was avowed in his direction inquired quentin  simply replied the zingaro that those who know aught of the most christian king are aware that the purpose about which he is most anxious is always that which he is least willing to declare let our gracious louis send twelve embassies and i will forfeit my neck to the gallows a year before it is due if in eleven of them there is not something at the bottom of the ink horn more than the pen has written in the letters of credence  i regard not your foul suspicions answered quentin my duty is plain and peremptoryto convey these ladies in safety to liege and i take it on me to think that i best discharge that duty in changing our prescribed route and keeping the left side of the river maes it is likewise the direct road to liege by crossing the river we should lose time and incur fatigue to no purposewherefore should we do so  only because pilgrims as they call themselves destined for cologne said hayraddin do not usually descend the maes so low as liege and that the route of the ladies will be accounted contradictory of their professed destination  if we are challenged on that account said quentin we will say that alarms of the wicked duke of gueldres or of william de la marck or of the ecorcheurs flayers a name given to bands of wandering troops on account of their cruelty and lanzknechts on the right side of the river justify our holding by the left instead of our intended route  as you will my good seignior replied the bohemian i am for my part equally ready to guide you down the left as down the right side of the maes your excuse to your master you must make out for yourself  quentin although rather surprised was at the same time pleased with the ready or at least the unrepugnant acquiescence of hayraddin in their change of route for he needed his assistance as a guide and yet had feared that the disconcerting of his intended act of treachery would have driven him to extremity besides to expel the bohemian from their society would have been the ready mode to bring down william de la marck with whom he was in correspondence upon their intended route whereas if hayraddin remained with them quentin thought he could manage to prevent the moor from having any communication with strangers unless he was himself aware of it  abandoning therefore all thoughts of their original route the little party followed that by the left bank of the broad maes so speedily and successfully that the next day early brought them to the proposed end of their journey they found that the bishop of liege for the sake of his health as he himself alleged but rather perhaps to avoid being surprised by the numerous and mutinous population of the city had established his residence in his beautiful castle of schonwaldt about a mile without liege  just as they approached the castle they saw the prelate returning in long procession from the neighbouring city in which he had been officiating at the performance of high mass he was at the head of a splendid train of religious civil and military men mingled together or as the old ballad maker expresses it        with many a cross bearer before      and many a spear behind   the procession made a noble appearance as winding along the verdant banks of the broad maes it wheeled into and was as it were devoured by the huge gothic portal of the episcopal residence  but when the party came more near they found that circumstances around the castle argued a doubt and sense of insecurity which contradicted that display of pomp and power which they had just witnessed strong guards of the bishops soldiers were heedfully maintained all around the mansion and its immediate vicinity and the prevailing appearances in an ecclesiastical residence seemed to argue a sense of danger in the reverend prelate who found it necessary thus to surround himself with all the defensive precautions of war  the ladies of croye when announced by quentin were reverently ushered into the great hall where they met with the most cordial reception from the bishop who met them there at the head of his little court he would not permit them to kiss his hand but welcomed them with a salute which had something in it of gallantry on the part of a prince to fine women and something also of the holy affection of a pastor to the sisters of his flock  louis of bourbon the reigning bishop of liege was in truth a generous and kind hearted prince whose life had not indeed been always confined with precise strictness within the bounds of his clerical profession but who notwithstanding had uniformly maintained the frank and honourable character of the house of bourbon from which he was descended  in latter times as age advanced the prelate had adopted habits more beseeming a member of the hierarchy than his early reign had exhibited and was loved among the neighbouring princes as a noble ecclesiastic generous and magnificent in his ordinary mode of life though preserving no very ascetic severity of character and governing with an easy indifference which amid his wealthy and mutinous subjects rather encouraged than subdued rebellious purposes  the bishop was so fast an ally of the duke of burgundy that the latter claimed almost a joint sovereignty in his bishopric and repaid the good natured ease with which the prelate admitted claims which he might easily have disputed by taking his part on all occasions with the determined and furious zeal which was a part of his character he used to say he considered liege as his own the bishop as his brother indeed they might be accounted such in consequence of the dukes having married for his first wife the bishops sister and that he who annoyed louis of bourbon had to do with charles of burgundy a threat which considering the character and the power of the prince who used it would have been powerful with any but the rich and discontented city of liege where much wealth had according to the ancient proverb made wit waver  the prelate as we have said assured the ladies of croye of such intercession as his interest at the court of burgundy used to the uttermost might gain for them and which he hoped might be the more effectual as campobasso from some late discoveries stood rather lower than formerly in the dukes personal favour he promised them also such protection as it was in his power to afford but the sigh with which he gave the warrant seemed to allow that his power was more precarious than in words he was willing to admit  at every event my dearest daughters said the bishop with an air in which as in his previous salute a mixture of spiritual unction qualified the hereditary gallantry of the house of bourbon heaven forbid i should abandon the lamb to the wicked wolf or noble ladies to the oppression of faitours i am a man of peace though my abode now rings with arms but be assured i will care for your safety as for my own and should matters become yet more distracted here which with our ladys grace we trust will be rather pacified than inflamed we will provide for your safe conduct to germany for not even the will of our brother and protector charles of burgundy shall prevail with us to dispose of you in any respect contrary to your own inclinations we cannot comply with your request of sending you to a convent for alas such is the influence of the sons of belial among the inhabitants of liege that we know no retreat to which our authority extends beyond the bounds of our own castle and the protection of our soldiery but here you are most welcome and your train shall have all honourable entertainment especially this youth whom you recommend so particularly to our countenance and on whom in especial we bestow our blessing  quentin kneeled as in duty bound to receive the episcopal benediction  for yourselves proceeded the good prelate you shall reside here with my sister isabelle a canoness of triers with whom you may dwell in all honour even under the roof of so gay a bachelor as the bishop of liege  he gallantly conducted the ladies to his sisters apartment as he concluded the harangue of welcome and his master of the household an officer who having taken deacons orders held something between a secular and ecclesiastical character entertained quentin with the hospitality which his master enjoined while the other personages of the retinue of the ladies of croye were committed to the inferior departments  in this arrangement quentin could not help remarking that the presence of the bohemian so much objected to in the country convents seemed in the household of this wealthy and perhaps we might say worldly prelate to attract neither objection nor remark    chapter xix the city       good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up      to any sudden act of mutiny       julius caesar   separated from the lady isabelle whose looks had been for so many days his loadstar quentin felt a strange vacancy and chillness of the heart which he had not yet experienced in any of the vicissitudes to which his life had subjected him no doubt the cessation of the close and unavoidable intercourse and intimacy betwixt them was the necessary consequence of the countesss having obtained a place of settled residence for under what pretext could she had she meditated such an impropriety have had a gallant young squire such as quentin in constant attendance upon her  but the shock of the separation was not the more welcome that it seemed unavoidable and the proud heart of quentin swelled at finding he was parted with like an ordinary postilion or an escort whose duty is discharged while his eyes sympathised so far as to drop a secret tear or two over the ruins of all those airy castles so many of which he had employed himself in constructing during their too interesting journey he made a manly but at first a vain effort to throw off this mental dejection and so yielding to the feelings he could not suppress he sat him down in one of the deep recesses formed by a window which lighted the great gothic hall of schonwaldt and there mused upon his hard fortune which had not assigned him rank or wealth sufficient to prosecute his daring suit  quentin tried to dispel the sadness which overhung him by dispatching charlet one of the valets with letters to the court of louis announcing the arrival of the ladies of croye at liege at length his natural buoyancy of temper returned much excited by the title of an old romaunt a poetical romance which had been just printed at strasbourg and which lay beside him in the window the title of which set forth        how the squire of lowe degree      loved the kings daughter of hungarie  an old english poem reprinted in hazlitts remains of early popular poetry of england   while he was tracing the letters blake of the ditty so congenial to his own situation quentin was interrupted by a touch on the shoulder and looking up beheld the bohemian standing by him    hayraddin never a welcome sight was odious from his late treachery and quentin sternly asked him why he dared take the freedom to touch a christian and a gentleman  simply answered the bohemian because i wished to know if the christian gentleman had lost his feeling as well as his eyes and ears i have stood speaking to you these five minutes and you have stared on that scrap of yellow paper as if it were a spell to turn you into a statue and had already wrought half its purpose  well what dost thou want speak and begone  i want what all men want though few are satisfied with it said hayraddin i want my due ten crowns of gold for guiding the ladies hither  with what face darest thou ask any guerdon beyond my sparing thy worthless life said durward fiercely thou knowest that it was thy purpose to have betrayed them on the road  but i did not betray them said hayraddin if i had i would have asked no guerdon from you or from them but from him whom their keeping on the right hand side of the river might have benefited the party that i have served is the party who must pay me  thy guerdon perish with thee then traitor said quentin telling out the money get thee to the boar of ardennes or to the devil but keep hereafter out of my sight lest i send thee thither before thy time  the boar of ardennes repeated the bohemian with a stronger emotion of surprise than his features usually expressedit was then no vague guessno general suspicionwhich made you insist on changing the roadcan it beare there really in other lands arts of prophecy more sure than those of our wandering tribes the willow tree under which we spoke could tell no tales but nononodolt that i wasi have iti have itthe willow by the brook near yonder conventi saw you look towards it as you passed it about half a mile from yon hive of dronesthat could not indeed speak but it might hide one who could hear i will hold my councils in an open plain henceforth not a bunch of thistles shall be near me for a scot to shroud amongstha ha the scot hath beat the zingaro at his own subtle weapons but know quentin durward that you have foiled me to the marring of thine own fortuneyes the fortune i have told thee of from the lines on thy hand had been richly accomplished but for thine own obstinacy  by saint andrew said quentin thy impudence makes me laugh in spite of myselfhow or in what should thy successful villainy have been of service to me i heard indeed that you did stipulate to save my life which condition your worthy allies would speedily have forgotten had we once come to blowsbut in what thy betrayal of these ladies could have served me but by exposing me to death or captivity is a matter beyond human brains to conjecture  no matter thinking of it then said hayraddin for i mean still to surprise you with my gratitude had you kept back my hire i should have held that we were quit and had left you to your own foolish guidance as it is i remain your debtor for yonder matter on the banks of the cher  methinks i have already taken out the payment in cursing and abusing thee said quentin  hard words or kind ones said the zingaro are but wind which make no weight in the balance had you struck me indeed instead of threatening  i am likely enough to take out payment in that way if you provoke me longer  i would not advise it said the zingaro such payment made by a rash hand might exceed the debt and unhappily leave a balance on your side which i am not one to forget or forgive and now farewell but not for a long spacei go to bid adieu to the ladies of croye  thou said quentin in astonishmentthou be admitted to the presence of the ladies and here where they are in a manner recluses under the protection of the bishops sister a noble canoness it is impossible  marthon however waits to conduct me to their presence said the zingaro with a sneer and i must pray your forgiveness if i leave you something abruptly  he turned as if to depart but instantly coming back said with a tone of deep and serious emphasis i know your hopesthey are daring yet not vain if i aid them i know your fears they should teach prudence not timidity every woman may be won a count is but a nickname which will befit quentin as well as the other nickname of duke befits charles or that of king befits louis  ere durward could reply the bohemian had left the hall quentin instantly followed but better acquainted than the scot with the passages of the house hayraddin kept the advantage which he had gotten and the pursuer lost sight of him as he descended a small back staircase still durward followed though without exact consciousness of his own purpose in doing so the staircase terminated by a door opening into the alley of a garden in which he again beheld the zingaro hastening down a pleached walk  on two sides the garden was surrounded by the buildings of the castlea huge old pile partly castellated and partly resembling an ecclesiastical building on the other two sides the enclosure was a high embattled wall crossing the alleys of the garden to another part of the building where a postern door opened behind a large massive buttress overgrown with ivy hayraddin looked back and waved his hand in a signal of an exulting farewell to his follower who saw that in effect the postern door was opened by marthon and that the vile bohemian was admitted into the precincts as he naturally concluded of the apartment of the countesses of croye quentin bit his lips with indignation and blamed himself severely that he had not made the ladies sensible of the full infamy of hayraddins character and acquainted with his machinations against their safety the arrogating manner in which the bohemian had promised to back his suit added to his anger and his disgust and he felt as if even the hand of the countess isabelle would be profaned were it possible to attain it by such patronage  but it is all a deception he said a turn of his base juggling artifice he has procured access to those ladies upon some false pretence and with some mischievous intention it is well i have learned where they lodge i will watch marthon and solicit an interview with them were it but to place them on their guard it is hard that i must use artifice and brook delay when such as he have admittance openly and without scruple they shall find however that though i am excluded from their presence isabelles safety is the chief subject of my vigilance  while the young lover was thus meditating an aged gentleman of the bishops household approached him from the same door by which he had himself entered the garden and made him aware though with the greatest civility of manner that the garden was private and reserved only for the use of the bishop and guests of the very highest distinction  quentin heard him repeat this information twice ere he put the proper construction upon it and then starting as from a reverie he bowed and hurried out of the garden the official person following him all the way and overwhelming him with formal apologies for the necessary discharge of his duty nay so pertinacious was he in his attempts to remove the offence which he conceived durward to have taken that he offered to bestow his own company upon him to contribute to his entertainment until quentin internally cursing his formal foppery found no better way of escape then pretending a desire of visiting the neighbouring city and setting off thither at such a round pace as speedily subdued all desire in the gentleman usher to accompany him farther than the drawbridge in a few minutes quentin was within the walls of the city of liege then one of the richest in flanders and of course in the world  melancholy even love melancholy is not so deeply seated at least in minds of a manly and elastic character as the soft enthusiasts who suffer under it are fond of believing it yields to unexpected and striking impressions upon the senses to change of place to such scenes as create new trains of association and to the influence of the busy hum of mankind in a few minutes quentins attention was as much engrossed by the variety of objects presented in rapid succession by the busy streets of liege as if there had been neither a countess isabelle nor a bohemian in the world  the lofty housesthe stately though narrow and gloomy streetsthe splendid display of the richest goods and most gorgeous armour in the warehouses and shops aroundthe walks crowded by busy citizens of every description passing and repassing with faces of careful importance or eager bustlethe huge wains which transported to and fro the subjects of export and import the former consisting of broadcloths and serge arms of all kinds nails and iron work while the latter comprehended every article of use or luxury intended either for the consumption of an opulent city or received in barter and destined to be transported elsewhereall these objects combined to form an engrossing picture of wealth bustle and splendour to which quentin had been hitherto a stranger he admired also the various streams and canals drawn from and communicating with the maes which traversing the city in various directions offered to every quarter the commercial facilities of water carriage and he failed not to hear a mass in the venerable old church of saint lambert said to have been founded in the eighth century  it was upon leaving this place of worship that quentin began to observe that he who had been hitherto gazing on all around him with the eagerness of unrestrained curiosity was himself the object of attention to several groups of substantial looking burghers who seemed assembled to look upon him as he left the church and amongst whom arose a buzz and whisper which spread from one party to another while the number of gazers continued to augment rapidly and the eyes of each who added to it were eagerly directed to quentin with a stare which expressed much interest and curiosity mingled with a certain degree of respect  at length he now formed the centre of a considerable crowd which yet yielded before him while he continued to move forward while those who followed or kept pace with him studiously avoided pressing on him or impeding his motions yet his situation was too embarrassing to be long endured without making some attempt to extricate himself and to obtain some explanation  quentin looked around him and fixing upon a jolly stout made respectable man whom by his velvet cloak and gold chain he concluded to be a burgher of eminence and perhaps a magistrate he asked him whether he saw anything particular in his appearance to attract public attention in a degree so unusual or whether it was the ordinary custom of the people of liege thus to throng around strangers who chanced to visit their city  surely not good seignior answered the burgher the liegeois are neither so idly curious as to practise such a custom nor is there anything in your dress or appearance saving that which is most welcome to this city and which our townsmen are both delighted to see and desirous to honour  this sounds very polite worthy sir said quentin but by the cross of saint andrew i cannot even guess at your meaning  your oath answered the merchant of liege as well as your accent convinces me that we are right in our conjecture  by my patron saint quentin said durward i am farther off from your meaning than ever  there again now rejoined the liegeois looking as he spoke most provokingly yet most civilly politic and intelligent  it is surely not for us to see that which you worthy seignior deem it proper to conceal but why swear by saint quentin if you would not have me construe your meaningwe know the good count of saint paul who lies there at present wishes well to our cause  on my life said quentin you are under some delusioni know nothing of saint paul  nay we question you not said the burgher although hark yei say hark in your earmy name is pavillon  and what is my business with that seignior pavillon said quentin  nay nothingonly methinks it might satisfy you that i am trustworthyhere is my colleague rouslaer too  rouslaer advanced a corpulent dignitary whose fair round belly like a battering ram did shake the press before him and who whispering caution to his neighbour said in a tone of rebuke you forget good colleague the place is too openthe seignior will retire to your house or mine and drink a glass of rhenish and sugar and then we shall hear more of our good friend and ally whom we love with all our honest flemish hearts  i have no news for any of you said quentin impatiently i will drink no rhenish and i only desire of you as men of account and respectability to disperse this idle crowd and allow a stranger to leave your town as quietly as he came into it  nay then sir said rouslaer since you stand so much on your incognito and with us too who are men of confidence let me ask you roundly wherefore wear you the badge of your company if you would remain unknown in liege  what badge and what order said quentin you look like reverend men and grave citizens yet on my soul you are either mad yourselves or desire to drive me so  sapperment said the other burgher this youth would make saint lambert swear why who wear bonnets with the saint andrews cross and fleur de lys save the scottish archers of king louiss guards  and supposing i am an archer of the scottish guard why should you make a wonder of my wearing the badge of my company said quentin impatiently  he has avowed it he has avowed it said rouslaer and pavillon turning to the assembled burghers in attitudes of congratulation with waving arms extended palms and large round faces radiating with glee he hath avowed himself an archer of louiss guardof louis the guardian of the liberties of liege  a general shout and cry now arose from the multitude in which were mingled the various sounds of long live louis of france long live the scottish guard long live the valiant archer our liberties our privileges or death no imposts long live the valiant boar of ardennes down with charles of burgundy and confusion to bourbon and his bishopric half stunned by the noise which began anew in one quarter so soon as it ceased in another rising and falling like the billows of the sea and augmented by thousands of voices which roared in chorus from distant streets and market places quentin had yet time to form a conjecture concerning the meaning of the tumult and a plan for regulating his own conduct  he had forgotten that after his skirmish with orleans and dunois one of his comrades had at lord crawfords command replaced the morion cloven by the sword of the latter with one of the steel lined bonnets which formed a part of the proper and well known equipment of the scottish guards that an individual of this body which was always kept very close to louiss person should have appeared in the streets of a city whose civil discontents had been aggravated by the agents of that king was naturally enough interpreted by the burghers of liege into a determination on the part of louis openly to assist their cause and the apparition of an individual archer was magnified into a pledge of immediate and active support from louisnay into an assurance that his auxiliary forces were actually entering the town at one or other though no one could distinctly tell which of the city gates  to remove a conviction so generally adopted quentin easily saw was impossiblenay that any attempt to undeceive men so obstinately prepossessed in their belief would be attended with personal risk which in this case he saw little use of incurring he therefore hastily resolved to temporize and to get free the best way he could and this resolution he formed while they were in the act of conducting him to the stadthouse town house where the notables of the town were fast assembling in order to hear the tidings which he was presumed to have brought and to regale him with a splendid banquet  in spite of all his opposition which was set down to modesty he was on every side surrounded by the donors of popularity the unsavoury tide of which now floated around him his two burgomaster friends who were schoppen or syndics of the city had made fast both his arms before him nikkel blok the chief of the butchers incorporation hastily summoned from his office in the shambles brandished his death doing axe yet smeared with blood and brains with a courage and grace which brantwein spirits alone could inspire behind him came the tall lean rawboned very drunk and very patriotic figure of claus hammerlein president of the mystery of the workers in iron and followed by at least a thousand unwashed artificers of his class weavers nailers ropemakers artisans of every degree and calling thronged forward to join the procession from every gloomy and narrow street escape seemed a desperate and impossible adventure  in this dilemma quentin appealed to rouslaer who held one arm and to pavillon who had secured the other and who were conducting him forward at the head of the ovation of which he had so unexpectedly become the principal object he hastily acquainted them with his having thoughtlessly adopted the bonnet of the scottish guard on an accident having occurred to the headpiece in which he had proposed to travel he regretted that owing to this circumstance and the sharp wit with which the liegeois drew the natural inference of his quality and the purpose of his visit these things had been publicly discovered and he intimated that if just now conducted to the stadthouse he might unhappily feel himself under the necessity of communicating to the assembled notables certain matters which he was directed by the king to reserve for the private ears of his excellent gossips meinheers rouslaer and pavillon of liege  this last hint operated like magic on the two citizens who were the most distinguished leaders of the insurgent burghers and were like all demagogues of their kind desirous to keep everything within their own management so far as possible they therefore hastily agreed that quentin should leave the town for the time and return by night to liege and converse with them privately in the house of rouslaer near the gate opposite to schonwaldt quentin hesitated not to tell them that he was at present residing in the bishops palace under pretence of bearing despatches from the french court although his real errand was as they had well conjectured designed to the citizens of liege and this tortuous mode of conducting a communication as well as the character and rank of the person to whom it was supposed to be intrusted was so consonant to the character of louis as neither to excite doubt nor surprise  almost immediately after this eclaircissernent explanation was completed the progress of the multitude brought them opposite to the door of pavillons house in one of the principal streets but which communicated from behind with the maes by means of a garden as well as an extensive manufactory of tan pits and other conveniences for dressing hides for the patriotic burgher was a felt dresser or currier  it was natural that pavillon should desire to do the honours of his dwelling to the supposed envoy of louis and a halt before his house excited no surprise on the part of the multitude who on the contrary greeted meinheer pavillon with a loud vivat long live as he ushered in his distinguished guest quentin speedily laid aside his remarkable bonnet for the cap of a felt maker and flung a cloak over his other apparel pavillon then furnished him with a passport to pass the gates of the city and to return by night or day as should suit his convenience and lastly committed him to the charge of his daughter a fair and smiling flemish lass with instructions how he was to be disposed of while he himself hastened back to his colleague to amuse their friends at the stadthouse with the best excuses which they could invent for the disappearance of king louiss envoy we cannot as the footman says in the play recollect the exact nature of the lie which the bell wethers told the flock but no task is so easy as that of imposing upon a multitude whose eager prejudices have more than half done the business ere the impostor has spoken a word  the worthy burgess was no sooner gone than his plump daughter trudchen with many a blush and many a wreathed smile which suited very prettily with lips like cherries laughing blue eyes and a skin transparently pureescorted the handsome stranger through the pleached alleys of the sieur pavillons garden down to the water side and there saw him fairly embarked in a boat which two stout flemings in their trunk hose fur caps and many buttoned jerkins had got in readiness with as much haste as their low country nature would permit  as the pretty trudchen spoke nothing but german quentinno disparagement to his loyal affection to the countess of croyecould only express his thanks by a kiss on those same cherry lips which was very gallantly bestowed and accepted with all modest gratitude for gallants with a form and face like our scottish archer were not of everyday occurrence among the bourgeoisie of liege the french middle class the term has come to mean the middle class of any country especially those engaged in trade  the adventure of quentin at liege may be thought overstrained yet it is extraordinary what slight circumstances will influence the public mind in a moment of doubt and uncertainty most readers must remember that when the dutch were on the point of rising against the french yoke their zeal for liberation received a strong impulse from the landing of a person in a british volunteer uniform whose presence though that of a private individual was received as a guarantee of succours from england s  while the boat was rowed up the sluggish waters of the maes and passed the defences of the town quentin had time enough to reflect what account he ought to give of his adventure in liege when he returned to the bishops palace of schonwaldt and disdaining alike to betray any person who had reposed confidence in him although by misapprehension or to conceal from the hospitable prelate the mutinous state of his capital he resolved to confine himself to so general an account as might put the bishop upon his guard while it should point out no individual to his vengeance  he was landed from the boat within half a mile of the castle and rewarded his rowers with a guilder to their great satisfaction yet short as was the space which divided him from schonwaldt the castle bell had tolled for dinner and quentin found moreover that he had approached the castle on a different side from that of the principal entrance and that to go round would throw his arrival considerably later he therefore made straight towards the side that was nearest to him as he discerned that it presented an embattled wall probably that of the little garden already noticed with a postern opening upon the moat and a skiff moored by the postern which might serve he thought upon summons to pass him over as he approached in hopes to make his entrance this way the postern opened a man came out and jumping into the boat made his way to the farther side of the moat and then with a long pole pushed the skiff back towards the place where he had embarked as he came near quentin discerned that this person was the bohemian who avoiding him as was not difficult held a different path towards liege and was presently out of his ken  here was a new subject for meditation had this vagabond heathen been all this while with the ladies of croye and for what purpose should they so far have graced him with their presence tormented with this thought durward became doubly determined to seek an explanation with them for the purpose at once of laying bare the treachery of hayraddin and announcing to them the perilous state in which their protector the bishop was placed by the mutinous state of his town of liege  as quentin thus resolved he entered the castle by the principal gate and found that part of the family who assembled for dinner in the great hall including the bishops attendant clergy officers of the household and strangers below the rank of the very first nobility were already placed at their meal a seat at the upper end of the board had however been reserved beside the bishops domestic chaplain who welcomed the stranger with the old college jest of sero venientibus ossa the bones for those who come late while he took care so to load his plate with dainties as to take away all appearance of that tendency to reality which in quentins country is said to render a joke either no joke or at best an unpalatable one a sooth boord true joke is no boord says the scot s  in vindicating himself from the suspicion of ill breeding quentin briefly described the tumult which had been occasioned in the city by his being discovered to belong to the scottish archer guard of louis and endeavoured to give a ludicrous turn to the narrative by saying that he had been with difficulty extricated by a fat burgher of liege and his pretty daughter  but the company were too much interested in the story to taste the jest all operations of the table were suspended while quentin told his tale and when he had ceased there was a solemn pause which was only broken by the majordomos saying in a low and melancholy tone i would to god that we saw those hundred lances of burgundy  why should you think so deeply on it said quentin you have many soldiers here whose trade is arms and your antagonists are only the rabble of a disorderly city who will fly before the first flutter of a banner with men at arms arrayed beneath it  you do not know the men of liege said the chaplain of whom it may be said that not even excepting those of ghent they are at once the fiercest and the most untameable in europe twice has the duke of burgundy chastised them for their repeated revolts against their bishop and twice hath he suppressed them with much severity abridged their privileges taken away their banners and established rights and claims to himself which were not before competent over a free city of the empirenay the last time he defeated them with much slaughter near saint tron where liege lost nearly six thousand men what with the sword what with those drowned in the flight and thereafter to disable them from farther mutiny duke charles refused to enter at any of the gates which they had surrendered but beating to the ground forty cubits breadth of their city wall marched into liege as a conqueror with visor closed and lance in rest at the head of his chivalry by the breach which he had made nay well were the liegeois then assured that but for the intercession of his father duke philip the good this charles then called count of charalois would have given their town up to spoil and yet with all these fresh recollections with their breaches unrepaired and their arsenals scarcely supplied the sight of an archers bonnet is sufficient again to stir them to uproar may god amend all but i fear there will be bloody work between so fierce a population and so fiery a sovereign and i would my excellent and kind master had a see of lesser dignity and more safety for his mitre is lined with thorns instead of ermine this much i say to you seignior stranger to make you aware that if your affairs detain you not at schonwaldt it is a place from which each man of sense should depart as speedily as possible i apprehend that your ladies are of the same opinion for one of the grooms who attended them on the route has been sent back by them to the court of france with letters which doubtless are intended to announce their going in search of a safer asylum    chapter xx the billet       go tothou art made if thou desirest to be so      if not let me see thee still the fellow of servants      and not fit to touch fortunes fingers       twelfth night   when the tables were drawn the chaplain who seemed to have taken a sort of attachment to quentin durwards society or who perhaps desired to extract from him farther information concerning the meeting of the morning led him into a withdrawing apartment the windows of which on one side projected into the garden and as he saw his companions eye gaze rather eagerly upon the spot he proposed to quentin to go down and take a view of the curious foreign shrubs with which the bishop had enriched its parterres  quentin excused himself as unwilling to intrude and therewithal communicated the check which he had received in the morning the chaplain smiled and said that there was indeed some ancient prohibition respecting the bishops private garden  but this he added with a smile was when our reverend father was a princely young prelate of not more than thirty years of age and when many fair ladies frequented the castle for ghostly consolation need there was he said with a downcast look and a smile half simple and half intelligent that these ladies pained in conscience who were ever lodged in the apartments now occupied by the noble canoness should have some space for taking the air secure from the intrusion of the profane but of late years he added this prohibition although not formally removed has fallen entirely out of observance and remains but as the superstition which lingers in the brain of a superannuated gentleman usher if you please he added we will presently descend and try whether the place be haunted or no  nothing could have been more agreeable to quentin than the prospect of a free entrance into the garden through means of which according to a chance which had hitherto attended his passion he hoped to communicate with or at least obtain sight of the object of his affections from some such turret or balcony window or similar coign of vantage as at the hostelry of the fleur de lys near plessis or the dauphins tower within that castle itself isabelle seemed still destined wherever she made her abode to be the lady of the turret  coign of vantage an advantageous position for observation or action cf no jutty frieze buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle macbeth i vi 6  when durward descended with his new friend into the garden the latter seemed a terrestrial philosopher entirely busied with the things of the earth while the eyes of quentin if they did not seek the heavens like those of an astrologer ranged at least all around the windows balconies and especially the turrets which projected on every part from the inner front of the old building in order to discover that which was to be his cynosure  while thus employed the young lover heard with total neglect if indeed he heard at all the enumeration of plants herbs and shrubs which his reverend conductor pointed out to him of which this was choice because of prime use in medicine and that more choice for yielding a rare flavour to pottage and a third choicest of all because possessed of no merit but its extreme scarcity still it was necessary to preserve some semblance at least of attention which the youth found so difficult that he fairly wished at the devil the officious naturalist and the whole vegetable kingdom he was relieved at length by the striking of a clock which summoned the chaplain to some official duty  the reverend man made many unnecessary apologies for leaving his new friend and concluded by giving him the agreeable assurance that he might walk in the garden till supper without much risk of being disturbed  it is said he the place where i always study my own homilies as being most sequestered from the resort of strangers i am now about to deliver one of them in the chapel if you please to favour me with your audience i have been thought to have some giftbut the glory be where it is due  quentin excused himself for this evening under pretence of a severe headache which the open air was likely to prove the best cure for and at length the well meaning priest left him to himself  it may be well imagined that in the curious inspection which he now made at more leisure of every window or aperture which looked into the garden those did not escape which were in the immediate neighbourhood of the small door by which he had seen marthon admit hayraddin as he pretended to the apartment of the countesses but nothing stirred or showed itself which could either confute or confirm the tale which the bohemian had told until it was becoming dusky and quentin began to be sensible he scarce knew why that his sauntering so long in the garden might be subject of displeasure or suspicion just as he had resolved to depart and was taking what he had destined for his last turn under the windows which had such attraction for him he heard above him a slight and cautious sound like that of a cough as intended to call his attention and to avoid the observation of others as he looked up in joyful surprise a casement opened a female hand was seen to drop a billet which fell into a rosemary bush that grew at the foot of the wall the precaution used in dropping this letter prescribed equal prudence and secrecy in reading it the garden surrounded as we have said upon two sides by the buildings of the palace was commanded of course by the windows of many apartments but there was a sort of grotto of rock work which the chaplain had shown durward with much complacency to snatch up the billet thrust it into his bosom and hie to this place of secrecy was the work of a single minute he there opened the precious scroll and blessed at the same time the memory of the monks of aberbrothick whose nurture had rendered him capable of deciphering its contents  the first line contained the injunction read this in secretand the contents were as follows what your eyes have too boldly said mine have perhaps too rashly understood but unjust persecution makes its victims bold and it were better to throw myself on the gratitude of one than to remain the object of pursuit to many fortune has her throne upon a rock but brave men fear not to climb if you dare do aught for one that hazards much you need but pass into this garden at prime tomorrow wearing in your cap a blue and white feather but expect no farther communication your stars have they say destined you for greatness and disposed you to gratitudefarewellbe faithful prompt and resolute and doubt not thy fortune  within this letter was enclosed a ring with a table diamond on which were cut in form of a lozenge the ancient arms of the house of croye  the first feeling of quentin upon this occasion was unmingled ecstasya pride and joy which seemed to raise him to the starsa determination to do or die influenced by which he treated with scorn the thousand obstacles that placed themselves betwixt him and the goal of his wishes  in this mood of rapture and unable to endure any interruption which might withdraw his mind were it but for a moment from so ecstatic a subject of contemplation durward retiring to the interior of the castle hastily assigned his former pretext of a headache for not joining the household of the bishop at the supper meal and lighting his lamp betook himself to the chamber which had been assigned him to read and to read again and again the precious billet and to kiss a thousand times the no less precious ring  but such high wrought feelings could not remain long in the same ecstatic tone a thought pressed upon him though he repelled it as ungratefulas even blasphemousthat the frankness of the confession implied less delicacy on the part of her who made it than was consistent with the high romantic feeling of adoration with which he had hitherto worshipped the lady isabelle no sooner did this ungracious thought intrude itself than he hastened to stifle it as he would have stifled a hissing and hateful adder that had intruded itself into his couch was it for himhim the favouredon whose account she had stooped from her sphere to ascribe blame to her for the very act of condescension without which he dared not have raised his eyes towards her did not her very dignity of birth and of condition reverse in her case the usual rules which impose silence on the lady until her lover shall have first spoken to these arguments which he boldly formed into syllogisms and avowed to himself his vanity might possibly suggest one which he cared not to embody even mentally with the same franknessthat the merit of the party beloved might perhaps warrant on the part of the lady some little departure from common rules and after all as in the case of malvolio olivias steward in twelfth night there was example for it in chronicle the squire of low degree of whom he had just been reading was like himself a gentleman void of land and living and yet the generous princess of hungary bestowed on him without scruple more substantial marks of her affection than the billet he had just received        welcome she said my swete squyre      my hearts roots my souls desire      i will give thee kisses three      and als five hundrid poundis in fee   and again the same faithful history made the king of hongrie himself avouch        i have yknown many a page      come to be prince by marriage   so that upon the whole quentin generously and magnanimously reconciled himself to a line of conduct on the countesss part by which he was likely to be so highly benefited  but this scruple was succeeded by another doubt harder of digestion the traitor hayraddin had been in the apartments of the ladies for aught quentin knew for the space of four hours and considering the hints which he had thrown out of possessing an influence of the most interesting kind over the fortunes of quentin durward what should assure him that this train was not of his laying and if so was it not probable that such a dissembling villain had set it on foot to conceal some new plan of treacheryperhaps to seduce isabelle out of the protection of the worthy bishop this was a matter to be closely looked into for quentin felt a repugnance to this individual proportioned to the unabashed impudence with which he had avowed his profligacy and could not bring himself to hope that anything in which he was concerned could ever come to an honourable or happy conclusion  these various thoughts rolled over quentins mind like misty clouds to dash and obscure the fair landscape which his fancy had at first drawn and his couch was that night a sleepless one at the hour of primeay and an hour before it was he in the castle garden where no one now opposed either his entrance or his abode with a feather of the assigned colour as distinguished as he could by any means procure in such haste no notice was taken of his appearance for nearly two hours at length he heard a few notes of the lute and presently the lattice opened right above the little postern door at which marthon had admitted hayraddin and isabelle in maidenly beauty appeared at the opening greeted him half kindly half shyly coloured extremely at the deep and significant reverence with which he returned her courtesyshut the casement and disappeared  daylight and champaign could discover no more the authenticity of the billet was ascertainedit only remained what was to follow and of this the fair writer had given him no hint but no immediate danger impendedthe countess was in a strong castle under the protection of a prince at once respectable for his secular and venerable for his ecclesiastical authority there was neither immediate room nor occasion for the exulting squire interfering in the adventure and it was sufficient if he kept himself prompt to execute her commands whensoever they should be communicated to him but fate purposed to call him into action sooner than he was aware of  it was the fourth night after his arrival at schonwaldt when quentin had taken measures for sending back on the morrow to the court of louis the remaining groom who had accompanied him on his journey with letters from himself to his uncle and lord crawford renouncing the service of france for which the treachery to which he had been exposed by the private instructions of hayraddin gave him an excuse both in honour and prudence and he betook himself to his bed with all the rosy coloured ideas around him which flutter about the couch of a youth when he loves dearly and thinks his love is as sincerely repaid  but quentins dreams which at first partook of the nature of those happy influences under which he had fallen asleep began by degrees to assume a more terrific character  he walked with the countess isabelle beside a smooth and inland lake such as formed the principal characteristic of his native glen and he spoke to her of his love without any consciousness of the impediments which lay between them she blushed and smiled when she listenedeven as he might have expected from the tenor of the letter which sleeping or waking lay nearest to his heart but the scene suddenly changed from summer to winterfrom calm to tempest the winds and the waves rose with such a contest of surge and whirlwind as if the demons of the water and of the air had been contending for their roaring empires in rival strife the rising waters seemed to cut off their advance and their retreatthe increasing tempest which dashed them against each other seemed to render their remaining on the spot impossible and the tumultuous sensations produced by the apparent danger awoke the dreamer  he awoke but although the circumstances of the vision had disappeared and given place to reality the noise which had probably suggested them still continued to sound in his ears  quentins first impulse was to sit erect in bed and listen with astonishment to sounds which if they had announced a tempest might have shamed the wildest that ever burst down from the grampians and again in a minute he became sensible that the tumult was not excited by the fury of the elements but by the wrath of men he sprang from bed and looked from the window of his apartment but it opened into the garden and on that side all was quiet though the opening of the casement made him still more sensible from the shouts which reached his ears that the outside of the castle was beleaguered and assaulted and that by a numerous and determined enemy hastily collecting his dress and arms and putting them on with such celerity as darkness and surprise permitted his attention was solicited by a knocking at the door of his chamber as quentin did not immediately answer the door which was a slight one was forced open from without and the intruder announced by his peculiar dialect to be the bohemian hayraddin maugrabin entered the apartment a phial which he held in his hand touched by a match produced a dark flash of ruddy fire by means of which he kindled a lamp which he took from his bosom  the horoscope of your destinies he said energetically to durward without any farther greeting now turns upon the determination of a minute  caitiff said quentin in reply there is treachery around us and where there is treachery thou must have a share in it  you are mad answered maugrabin i never betrayed any one but to gain by itand wherefore should i betray you by whose safety i can take more advantage than by your destruction hearken for a moment if it be possible for you to one note of reason ere it is sounded into your ear by the death shut of ruin the liegeois are upwilliam de la marck with his band leads themwere there means of resistance their numbers and his fury would overcome them but there are next to none if you would save the countess and your own hopes follow me in the name of her who sent you a table diamond with three leopards engraved on it  lead the way said quentin hastily in that name i dare every danger  as i shall manage it said the bohemian there is no danger if you can but withhold your hand from strife which does not concern you for after all what is it to you whether the bishop as they call him slaughters his flock or the flock slaughters the shepherdha ha ha follow me but with caution and patience subdue your own courage and confide in my prudence and my debt of thankfulness is paid and you have a countess for your spousefollow me  i follow said quentin drawing his sword but the moment in which i detect the least sign of treachery thy head and body are three yards separate  without more conversation the bohemian seeing that quentin was now fully armed and ready ran down the stairs before him and winded hastily through various side passages until they gained the little garden scarce a light was to be seen on that side scarce any bustle was to be heard but no sooner had quentin entered the open space than the noise on the opposite side of the castle became ten times more stunningly audible and he could hear the various war cries of liege liege sanglier sanglier the wild boar a name given to william de la marck shouted by the assailants while the feebler cry of our lady for the prince bishop was raised in a faint and faltering tone by those of the prelates soldiers who had hastened though surprised and at disadvantage to the defence of the walls  but the interest of the fight notwithstanding the martial character of quentin durward was indifferent to him in comparison with the fate of isabelle of croye which he had reason to fear would be a dreadful one unless rescued from the power of the dissolute and cruel freebooter who was now as it seemed bursting the gates of the castle he reconciled himself to the aid of the bohemian as men in a desperate illness refuse not the remedy prescribed by quacks and mountebanks and followed across the garden with the intention of being guided by him until he should discover symptoms of treachery and then piercing him through the heart or striking his head from his body  hayraddin seemed himself conscious that his safety turned on a feather weight for he forbore from the moment they entered the open air all his wonted gibes and quirks and seemed to have made a vow to act at once with modesty courage and activity  at the opposite door which led to the ladies apartments upon a low signal made by hayraddin appeared two women muffled in the black silk veils which were then as now worn by the women in the netherlands quentin offered his arm to one of them who clung to it with trembling eagerness and indeed hung upon him so much that had her weight been greater she must have much impeded their retreat the bohemian who conducted the other female took the road straight for the postern which opened upon the moat through the garden wall close to which the little skiff was drawn up by means of which quentin had formerly observed hayraddin himself retreating from the castle  as they crossed the shouts of storm and successful violence seemed to announce that the castle was in the act of being taken and so dismal was the sound in quentins ears that he could not help swearing aloud but that my blood is irretrievably devoted to the fulfilment of my present duty i would back to the wall take faithful part with the hospitable bishop and silence some of those knaves whose throats are full of mutiny and robbery  the lady whose arm was still folded in his pressed it lightly as he spoke as if to make him understand that there was a nearer claim on his chivalry than the defence of schonwaldt while the bohemian exclaimed loud enough to be heard now that i call right christian frenzy which would turn back to fight when love and fortune both demand that we should fly  on onwith all the haste you can makehorses wait us in yonder thicket of willows  there are but two horses said quentin who saw them in the moonlight  all that i could procure without exciting suspicionand enough replied the bohemian you two must ride for tongres ere the way becomes unsafemarthon will abide with the women of our horde with whom she is an old acquaintance know she is a daughter of our tribe and only dwelt among you to serve our purpose as occasion should fall  marthon exclaimed the countess looking at the veiled female with a shriek of surprise is not this my kinswoman  only marthon said hayraddin excuse me that little piece of deceit i dared not carry off both the ladies of croye from the wild boar of ardennes  wretch said quentin emphaticallybut it is notshall not be too latei will back to rescue the lady hameline  hameline whispered the lady in a disturbed voice hangs on thy arm to thank thee for her rescue  ha whathow is this said quentin extricating himself from her hold and with less gentleness than he would at any other time have used towards a female of any rank is the lady isabelle then left behindfarewellfarewell  as he turned to hasten back to the castle hayraddin laid hold of himnay hear youhear youyou run upon your death what the foul fiend did you wear the colours of the old one fori will never trust blue and white silk again but she has almost as large a dowerhas jewels and goldhath pretensions too upon the earldom  while he spoke thus panting on in broken sentences the bohemian struggled to detain quentin who at length laid his hand on his dagger in order to extricate himself  nay if that be the case said hayraddin unloosing his hold goand the devil if there be one go along with you  and soon as freed from his hold the scot shot back to the castle with the speed of the wind  hayraddin then turned round to the countess hameline who had sunk down on the ground between shame fear and disappointment  here has been a mistake he said up lady and come with mei will provide you ere morning comes a gallanter husband than this smock faced boy and if one will not serve you shall have twenty  the lady hameline was as violent in her passions as she was vain and weak in her understanding like many other persons she went tolerably well through the ordinary duties of life but in a crisis like the present she was entirely incapable of doing aught save pouring forth unavailing lamentations and accusing hayraddin of being a thief a base slave an impostor a murderer  call me zingaro returned he composedly and you have said all at once  monster you said the stars had decreed our union and caused me to writeoh wretch that i was exclaimed the unhappy lady  and so they had decreed your union said hayraddin had both parties been willingbut think you the blessed constellations can make any one wed against his willi was led into error with your accursed christian gallantries and fopperies of ribbons and favoursand the youth prefers veal to beef i thinkthat s allup and follow me and take notice i endure neither weeping nor swooning  i will not stir a foot said the countess obstinately  by the bright welkin but you shall though exclaimed hayraddin i swear to you by all that ever fools believed in that you have to do with one who would care little to strip you naked bind you to a tree and leave you to your fortune  nay said marthon interfering by your favour she shall not be misused i wear a knife as well as you and can use itshe is a kind woman though a fooland you madam rise up and follow ushere has been a mistake but it is something to have saved life and limb there are many in yonder castle would give all the wealth in the world to stand where we do  as marthon spoke a clamour in which the shouts of victory were mingled with screams of terror and despair was wafted to them from the castle of schonwaldt  hear that lady said hayraddin and be thankful you are not adding your treble pipe to yonder concert believe me i will care for you honestly and the stars shall keep their words and find you a good husband  like some wild animal exhausted and subdued by terror amid fatigue the countess hameline yielded herself up to the conduct of her guides and suffered herself to be passively led whichever way they would nay such was the confusion of her spirits and the exhaustion of her strength that the worthy couple who half bore half led her carried on their discourse in her presence without her even understanding it  i ever thought your plan was folly said marthon could you have brought the young people together indeed we might have had a hold on their gratitude and a footing in their castle but what chance of so handsome a youth wedding this old fool  rizpah said hayraddin you have borne the name of a christian and dwelt in the tents of those besotted people till thou hast become a partaker in their follies how could i dream that he would have made scruples about a few years youth or age when the advantages of the match were so evident and thou knowest there would have been no moving yonder coy wench to be so frank as this coming countess here who hangs on our arms as dead a weight as a wool pack i loved the lad too and would have done him a kindness to wed him to this old woman was to make his fortune to unite him to isabelle were to have brought on him de la marck burgundy franceevery one that challenges an interest in disposing of her hand and this silly womans wealth being chiefly in gold and jewels we should have had our share but the bow string has burst and the arrow failed away with herwe will bring her to william with the beard by the time he has gorged himself with wassail as is his wont he will not know an old countess from a young one away rizpahbear a gallant heart the bright aldebaran still influences the destinies of the children of the desert    chapter xxi the sack       the gates of mercy shall be all shut up      and the fleshd soldier rough and hard of heart      in liberty of bloody hand shall range      with conscience wide as hell       henry v   the surprised and affrighted garrison of the castle of schonwaldt had nevertheless for some time made good the defence of the place against the assailants but the immense crowds which issuing from the city of liege thronged to the assault like bees distracted their attention and abated their courage  there was also disaffection at least if not treachery among the defenders for some called out to surrender and others deserting their posts tried to escape from the castle many threw themselves from the walls into the moat and such as escaped drowning flung aside their distinguishing badges and saved themselves by mingling among the motley crowd of assailants some few indeed from attachment to the bishops person drew around him and continued to defend the great keep to which he had fled and others doubtful of receiving quarter or from an impulse of desperate courage held out other detached bulwarks and towers of the extensive building but the assailants had got possession of the courts and lower parts of the edifice and were busy pursuing the vanquished and searching for spoil while one individual as if he sought for that death from which all others were flying endeavoured to force his way into the scene of tumult and horror under apprehensions still more horrible to his imagination than the realities around were to his sight and senses whoever had seen quentin durward that fatal night not knowing the meaning of his conduct had accounted him a raging madman whoever had appreciated his motives had ranked him nothing beneath a hero of romance  approaching schonwaldt on the same side from which he had left it the youth met several fugitives making for the wood who naturally avoided him as an enemy because he came in an opposite direction from that which they had adopted when he came nearer he could hear and partly see men dropping from the garden wall into the castle fosse and others who seemed precipitated from the battlements by the assailants his courage was not staggered even for an instant there was not time to look for the boat even had it been practicable to use it and it was in vain to approach the postern of the garden which was crowded with fugitives who ever and anon as they were thrust through it by the pressure behind fell into the moat which they had no means of crossing  avoiding that point quentin threw himself into the moat near what was called the little gate of the castle and where there was a drawbridge which was still elevated he avoided with difficulty the fatal grasp of more than one sinking wretch and swimming to the drawbridge caught hold of one of the chains which was hanging down and by a great exertion of strength and activity swayed himself out of the water and attained the platform from which the bridge was suspended as with hands and knees he struggled to make good his footing a lanzknecht with his bloody sword in his hand made towards him and raised his weapon for a blow which must have been fatal  how now fellow said quentin in a tone of authority is that the way in which you assist a comradegive me your hand  the soldier in silence and not without hesitation reached him his arm and helped him upon the platform when without allowing him time for reflection the scot continued in the same tone of command to the western tower if you would be richthe priests treasury is in the western tower  the words were echoed on every hand to the western towerthe treasure is in the western tower and the stragglers who were within hearing of the cry took like a herd of raging wolves the direction opposite to that which quentin come life come death was determined to pursue  bearing himself as if he were one not of the conquered but of the victors he made a way into the garden and pushed across it with less interruption than he could have expected for the cry of to the western tower had carried off one body of the assailants and another was summoned together by war cry and trumpet sound to assist in repelling a desperate sally attempted by the defenders of the keep who had hoped to cut their way out of the castle bearing the bishop along with them quentin therefore crossed the garden with an eager step and throbbing heart commending himself to those heavenly powers which had protected him through the numberless perils of his life and bold in his determination to succeed or leave his life in this desperate undertaking ere he reached the garden three men rushed on him with levelled lances crying liege liege  putting himself in defence but without striking he replied france france friend to liege  vivat france cried the burghers of liege and passed on the same signal proved a talisman to avert the weapons of four or five of la marcks followers whom he found straggling in the garden and who set upon him crying sanglier  in a word quentin began to hope that his character as an emissary of king louis the private instigator of the insurgents of liege and the secret supporter of william de la marck might possibly bear him through the horrors of the night  on reaching the turret he shuddered when he found that the little side door through which marthon and the countess hameline had shortly before joined him was now blockaded with more than one dead body  two of them he dragged hastily aside and was stepping over the third body in order to enter the portal when the supposed dead man laid hand on his cloak and entreated him to stay and assist him to rise quentin was about to use rougher methods than struggling to rid himself of this untimely obstruction when the fallen man continued to exclaim i am stifled here in mine own armouri am the syndic pavillon of liege if you are for us i will enrich youif you are for the other side i will protect you but do notdo not leave me to die the death of a smothered pig  in the midst of this scene of blood and confusion the presence of mind of quentin suggested to him that this dignitary might have the means of protecting their retreat he raised him on his feet and asked him if he was wounded  not wounded at least i think not answered the burgher but much out of wind  sit down then on this stone and recover your breath said quentin i will return instantly  for whom are you said the burgher still detaining him  for francefor france answered quentin studying to get away  what my lively young archer said the worthy syndic nay if it has been my fate to find a friend in this fearful night i will not quit him i promise you go where you will i follow and could i get some of the tight lads of our guildry together i might be able to help you in turn but they are all squandered abroad like so many peaseoh it is a fearful night  during this time he was dragging himself on after quentin who aware of the importance of securing the countenance of a person of such influence slackened his pace to assist him although cursing in his heart the encumbrance that retarded his pace  at the top of the stair was an anteroom with boxes and trunks which bore marks of having been rifled as some of the contents lay on the floor a lamp dying in the chimney shed a feeble beam on a dead or senseless man who lay across the hearth  bounding from pavillon like a greyhound from his keepers leash and with an effort which almost overthrew him quentin sprang through a second and a third room the last of which seemed to be the bedroom of the ladies of croye no living mortal was to be seen in either of them he called upon the lady isabelles name at first gently then more loudly and then with an accent of despairing emphasis but no answer was returned he wrung his hands tore his hair and stamped on the earth with desperation at length a feeble glimmer of light which shone through a crevice in the wainscoting of a dark nook in the bedroom announced some recess or concealment behind the arras quentin hasted to examine it he found there was indeed a concealed room but it resisted his hurried efforts to open it heedless of the personal injury he might sustain he rushed at the door with the whole force and weight of his body and such was the impetus of an effort made betwixt hope and despair that it would have burst much stronger fastenings  he thus forced his way almost headlong into a small oratory where a female figure which had been kneeling in agonizing supplication before the holy image now sank at length on the floor under the new terrors implied in this approaching tumult he hastily raised her from the ground and joy of joys it was she whom he sought to savethe countess isabelle he pressed her to his bosomhe conjured her to awakeentreated her to be of good cheerfor that she was now under time protection of one who had heart and hand enough to defend her against armies  durward she said as she at length collected herself is it indeed youthen there is some hope left i thought all living and mortal friends had left me to my fatedo not again abandon me  nevernever said durward whatever shall happen whatever danger shall approach may i forfeit the benefits purchased by yonder blessed sign if i be not the sharer of your fate until it is again a happy one  very pathetic and touching truly said a rough broken asthmatic voice behind a love affair i see and from my soul i pity the tender creature as if she were my own trudchen  you must do more than pity said quentin turning towards the speaker you must assist in protecting us meinheer pavillon be assured this lady was put under my especial charge by your ally the king of france and if you aid me not to shelter her from every species of offence and violence your city will lose the favour of louis of valois above all she must be guarded from the hands of william de la marck  that will be difficult said pavillon for these schelms of lanzknechts are very devils at rummaging out the wenches but ill do my bestwe will to the other apartment and there i will considerit is but a narrow stair and you can keep the door with a pike while i look from the window and get together some of my brisk boys of the curriers guildry of liege that are as true as the knives they wear in their girdlesbut first undo me these claspsfor i have not worn this corselet since the battle of saint tron fought by the insurgents of liege against the duke of burgundy charles the bold when count of charalois in which the people of liege were defeated with great slaughter s and i am three stone heavier since that time if there be truth in dutch beam and scale  the undoing of the iron enclosure gave great relief to the honest man who in putting it on had more considered his zeal to the cause of liege than his capacity of bearing arms it afterwards turned out that being as it were borne forward involuntarily and hoisted over the walls by his company as they thronged to the assault the magistrate had been carried here and there as the tide of attack and defence flowed or ebbed without the power latterly of even uttering a word until as the sea casts a log of driftwood ashore in the first creek he had been ultimately thrown in the entrance to the ladies of croyes apartments where the encumbrance of his own armour with the superincumbent weight of two men slain in the entrance and who fell above him might have fixed him down long enough had he not been relieved by durward  the same warmth of temper which rendered hermann pavillon a hot headed and intemperate zealot in politics had the more desirable consequence of making him in private a good tempered kind hearted man who if sometimes a little misled by vanity was always well meaning and benevolent he told quentin to have an especial care of the poor pretty yung frau young woman and after this unnecessary exhortation began to halloo from the window liege liege for the gallant skinners guild of curriers  one or two of his immediate followers collected at the summons and at the peculiar whistle with which it was accompanied each of the crafts having such a signal among themselves and more joining them established a guard under the window from which their leader was bawling and before the postern door  matters seemed now settling into some sort of tranquillity all opposition had ceased and the leaders of the different classes of assailants were taking measures to prevent indiscriminate plunder the great bell was tolled a summons to a military counsel and its iron tongue communicating to liege the triumphant possession of schonwaldt by the insurgents was answered by all the bells in that city whose distant and clamorous voices seemed to cry hail to the victors it would have been natural that meinheer pavillon should now have sallied from his fastness but either in reverent care of those whom he had taken under his protection or perhaps for the better assurance of his own safety he contented himself with dispatching messenger on messenger to command his lieutenant peterkin geislaer to attend him directly  peterkin came at length to his great relief as being the person upon whom on all pressing occasions whether of war politics or commerce pavillon was most accustomed to repose confidence he was a stout squat figure with a square face and broad black eyebrows that announced him to be opinionative and disputatiousan advice giving countenance so to speak he was endued with a buff jerkin wore a broad belt and cutlass by his side and carried a halberd in his hand  peterkin my dear lieutenant said the commander this has been a glorious daynight i should sayi trust thou art pleased for once  i am well enough pleased that you are so said the doughty lieutenant though i should not have thought of your celebrating the victory if you call it one up in this garret by yourself when you are wanted in council  but am i wanted there said the syndic  ay marry are you to stand up for the rights of liege that are in more danger than ever answered the lieutenant  pshaw peterkin answered his principal thou art ever such a frampold grumbler  grumbler not i said peterkin what pleases other people will always please me only i wish we have not got king stork instead of king log like the fabliau fable that the clerk of saint lamberts used to read us out of meister aesops book  refers to aesops fable the commonwealth of frogs having conceived an aversion for their amiable king log asked jupiter to send them another sovereign he accordingly bestowed upon them a stork who gradually devoured all his subjects  i cannot guess your meaning said the syndic  why then i tell you master pavillon that this boar or bear is like to make his own den of schonwaldt and is probable to turn out as bad a neighbour to our town as ever was the old bishop and worse here has he taken the whole conquest in his own hand and is only doubting whether he should be called prince or bishopand it is a shame to see how they have mishandled the old man among them  i will not permit it peterkin said pavillon hustling up i disliked the mitre but not the head that wore it we are ten to one in the field peterkin and will not permit these courses  ay ten to one in the field but only man to man in the castle besides that nikkel blok the butcher and all the rabble of the suburbs take part with william de la marck partly for saus and braus means here carousing for he has broached all the ale tubs and wine casks and partly for old envy towards us who are the craftsmen and have privileges  peter said pavillon we will go presently to the city i will stay no longer in schonwaldt  but the bridges of this castle are up master said geislaerthe gates locked and guarded by these lanzknechts and if we were to try to force our way these fellows whose everyday business is war might make wild work of us that only fight of a holyday  but why has he secured the gates said the alarmed burgher or what business hath he to make honest men prisoners  i cannot tellnot i said peter some noise there is about the ladies of croye who have escaped during the storm of the castle that first put the man with the beard beside himself with anger and now he s beside himself with drink also  the burgomaster cast a disconsolate look towards quentin and seemed at a loss what to resolve upon durward who had not lost a word of the conversation which alarmed him very much saw nevertheless that their only safety depended on his preserving his own presence of mind and sustaining the courage of pavillon he struck boldly into the conversation as one who had a right to have a voice in the deliberation  i am ashamed he said meinheer pavillon to observe you hesitate what to do on this occasion go boldly to william de la marck and demand free leave to quit the castle you your lieutenant your squire and your daughter he can have no pretence for keeping you prisoner  for me and my lieutenantthat is myself and petergoodbut who is my squire  i am for the present replied the undaunted scot  you said the embarrassed burgess but are you not the envoy of king louis of france  true but my message is to the magistrates of liegeand only in liege will i deliver itwere i to acknowledge my quality before william de la marck must i not enter into negotiations with him ay and it is like be detained by him you must get me secretly out of the castle in the capacity of your squire  goodmy squirebut you spoke of my daughtermy daughter is i trust safe in my house in liegewhere i wish her father was with all my heart and soul  this lady said durward will call you father while we are in this place  and for my whole life afterwards said the countess throwing herself at the citizens feet and clasping his knees  never shall the day pass in which i will not honour you love you and pray for you as a daughter for a father if you will but aid me in this fearful straitoh be not hard hearted think your own daughter may kneel to a stranger to ask him for life and honourthink of this and give me the protection you would wish her to receive  in troth said the good citizen much moved with her pathetic appeal i think peter that this pretty maiden hath a touch of our trudchens sweet looki thought so from the first and that this brisk youth here who is so ready with his advice is somewhat like trudchens bachelori wager a groat peter that this is a true love matter and it is a sin not to further it  it were shame and sin both said peter a good natured fleming notwithstanding all his self conceit and as he spoke he wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his jerkin  she shall be my daughter then said pavillon well wrapped up in her black silk veil and if there are not enough of true hearted skinners to protect her being the daughter of their syndic it were pity they should ever tug leather morebut hark yequestions must be answeredhow if i am asked what should my daughter make here at such an onslaught  what should half the women in liege make here when they followed us to the castle said peter they had no other reason sure but that it was just the place in the world that they should not have come to our yung frau trudchen has come a little farther than the restthat is all  admirably spoken said quentin only be bold and take this gentlemans good counsel noble meinheer pavillon and at no trouble to yourself you will do the most worthy action since the days of charlemagnehere sweet lady wrap yourself close in this veil for many articles of female apparel lay scattered about the apartmentbe but confident and a few minutes will place you in freedom and safety noble sir he added addressing pavillon set forward  holdholdhold a minute said pavillon my mind misgives methis de la marck is a fury a perfect boar in his nature as in his name what if the young lady be one of those of croyeand what if he discover her and be addicted to wrath  and if i were one of those unfortunate women said isabelle again attempting to throw herself at his feet could you for that reject me in this moment of despair oh that i had been indeed your daughter or the daughter of the poorest burgher  not so poornot so poor neither young ladywe pay as we go said the citizen  forgive me noble sir again began the unfortunate maiden  not noble nor sir neither said the syndic a plain burgher of liege that pays bills of exchange in ready guildersbut that is nothing to the purposewell say you be a countess i will protect you nevertheless  you are bound to protect her were she a duchess said peter having once passed your word  right peter very right said the syndic it is our old low dutch fashion ein wort ein man a man of his word and now let us to this gear we must take leave of this william de la marck and yet i know not my mind misgives me when i think of him and were it a ceremony which could be waived i have no stomach to go through it  were you not better since you have a force together to make for the gate and force the guard said quentin  but with united voice pavillon and his adviser exclaimed against the propriety of such an attack upon their allys soldiers with some hints concerning its rashness which satisfied quentin that it was not a risk to be hazarded with such associates  they resolved therefore to repair boldly to the great hall of the castle where as they understood the wild boar of ardennes held his feast and demand free egress for the syndic of liege and his company a request too reasonable as it seemed to be denied still the good burgomaster groaned when he looked on his companions and exclaimed to his faithful peter see what it is to have too bold and too tender a heart alas peterkin how much have courage and humanity cost me and how much may i yet have to pay for my virtues before heaven makes us free of this damned castle of schonwaldt  as they crossed the courts still strewed with the dying and dead quentin while he supported isabelle through the scene of horrors whispered to her courage and comfort and reminded her that her safety depended entirely on her firmness and presence of mind  not on minenot on mine she said but on yourson yours only oh if i but escape this fearful night never shall i forget him who saved me one favour more only let me implore at your hand and i conjure you to grant it by your mothers fame and your fathers honour  what is it you can ask that i could refuse said quentin in a whisper  plunge your dagger in my heart said she rather than leave me captive in the hands of these monsters  quentins only answer was a pressure of the young countesss hand which seemed as if but for terror it would have returned the caress and leaning on her youthful protector she entered the fearful hall preceded by pavillon and his lieutenant and followed by a dozen of the kurschenschaft or skinners trade who attended as a guard of honour on the syndic  as they approached the hall the yells of acclamation and bursts of wild laughter which proceeded from it seemed rather to announce the revel of festive demons rejoicing after some accomplished triumph over the human race than of mortal beings who had succeeded in a bold design an emphatic tone of mind which despair alone could have inspired supported the assumed courage of the countess isabelle undaunted spirits which rose with the extremity maintained that of durward while pavillon and his lieutenant made a virtue of necessity and faced their fate like bears bound to a stake which must necessarily stand the dangers of the course    chapter xxii the revellers       cadewheres dick the butcher of ashford      dickhere sir      cadethey fell before thee like sheep and oxen and thou      behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own slaughter      house       second part of king henry v   there could hardly exist a more strange and horrible change than had taken place in the castle hall of schonwaldt since quentin had partaken of the noontide meal there and it was indeed one which painted in the extremity of their dreadful features the miseries of warmore especially when waged by those most relentless of all agents the mercenary soldiers of a barbarous agemen who by habit and profession had become familiarized with all that was cruel and bloody in the art of war while they were devoid alike of patriotism and of the romantic spirit of chivalry  instead of the orderly decent and somewhat formal meal at which civil and ecclesiastical officers had a few hours before sat mingled in the same apartment where a light jest could only be uttered in a whisper and where even amid superfluity of feasting and of wine there reigned a decorum which almost amounted to hypocrisy there was now such a scene of wild and roaring debauchery as satan himself had he taken the chair as founder of the feast could scarcely have improved  at the head of the table sat in the bishops throne and state which had been hastily brought thither from his great council chamber the redoubted boar of ardennes himself well deserving that dreaded name in which he affected to delight and which he did as much as he could think of to deserve  his head was unhelmeted but he wore the rest of his ponderous and bright armour which indeed he rarely laid aside over his shoulders hung a strong surcoat made of the dressed skin of a huge wild boar the hoofs being of solid silver and the tusks of the same the skin of the head was so arranged that drawn over the casque when the baron was armed or over his bare head in the fashion of a hood as he often affected when the helmet was laid aside and as he now wore it the effect was that of a grinning ghastly monster and yet the countenance which it overshadowed scarce required such horrors to improve those which were natural to its ordinary expression  the upper part of de la marcks face as nature had formed it almost gave the lie to his character for though his hair when uncovered resembled the rude and wild bristles of the hood he had drawn over it yet an open high and manly forehead broad ruddy cheeks large sparkling light coloured eyes and a nose which looked like the beak of the eagle promised something valiant and generous but the effect of these more favourable traits was entirely overpowered by his habits of violence and insolence which joined to debauchery and intemperance had stamped upon the features a character inconsistent with the rough gallantry which they would otherwise have exhibited the former had from habitual indulgence swollen the muscles of the cheeks and those around the eyes in particular the latter evil practices and habits had dimmed the eyes themselves reddened the part of them that should have been white and given the whole face a hideous likeness of the monster which it was the terrible barons pleasure to resemble but from an odd sort of contradiction de la march while he assumed in other respects the appearance of the wild boar and even seemed pleased with the name yet endeavoured by the length and growth of his beard to conceal the circumstance that had originally procured him that denomination this was an unusual thickness and projection of the mouth and upper jaw which with the huge projecting side teeth gave that resemblance to the bestial creation which joined to the delight that de la marck had in hunting the forest so called originally procured for him the name of the boar of ardennes the beard broad grisly and uncombed neither concealed the natural horrors of the countenance nor dignified its brutal expression  the soldiers and officers sat around the table intermixed with the men of liege some of them of the very lowest description among whom nikkel blok the butcher placed near de la marck himself was distinguished by his tucked up sleeves which displayed arms smeared to the elbows with blood as was the cleaver which lay on the table before him the soldiers wore most of them their beards long and grisly in imitation of their leader had their hair plaited and turned upwards in the manner that ought best improve the natural ferocity of their appearance and intoxicated as many of them seemed to be partly with the sense of triumph and partly with the long libations of wine which they had been quaffing presented a spectacle at once hideous and disgusting the language which they held and the songs which they sang without even pretending to pay each other the compliment of listening were so full of license and blasphemy that quentin blessed god that the extremity of the noise prevented them from being intelligible to his companion  it only remains to say of the better class of burghers who were associated with william de la marcks soldiers in this fearful revel that the wan faces and anxious mien of the greater part showed that they either disliked their entertainment or feared their companions while some of lower education or a nature more brutal saw only in the excesses of the soldier a gallant bearing which they would willingly imitate and the tone of which they endeavoured to catch so far as was possible and stimulated themselves to the task by swallowing immense draughts of wine and schwarzbier black beerindulging a vice which at all times was too common in the low countries  the preparations for the feast had been as disorderly as the quality of the company the whole of the bishops platenay even that belonging to the service of the churchfor the boar of ardennes regarded not the imputation of sacrilegewas mingled with black jacks or huge tankards made of leather and drinking horns of the most ordinary description  one circumstance of horror remains to be added and accounted for and we willingly leave the rest of the scene to the imagination of the reader amidst the wild license assumed by the soldiers of de la marck one who was excluded from the table a lanzknecht remarkable for his courage and for his daring behaviour during the storm of the evening had impudently snatched up a large silver goblet and carried it off declaring it should atone for his loss of the share of the feast the leader laughed till his sides shook at a jest so congenial to the character of the company but when another less renowned it would seem for audacity in battle ventured on using the same freedom de la marck instantly put a check to a jocular practice which would soon have cleared his table of all the more valuable decorations  ho by the spirit of the thunder he exclaimed those who dare not be men when they face the enemy must not pretend to be thieves among their friends what thou frontless dastard thouthou who didst wait for opened gate and lowered bridge when conrade horst forced his way over moat and wall must thou be malapertknit him up to the stanchions of the hall windowhe shall beat time with his feet while we drink a cup to his safe passage to the devil  the doom was scarce sooner pronounced than accomplished and in a moment the wretch wrestled out his last agonies suspended from the iron bars his body still hung there when quentin and the others entered the hall and intercepting the pale moonbeam threw on the castle floor an uncertain shadow which dubiously yet fearfully intimated the nature of the substance that produced it  when the syndic pavillon was announced from mouth to mouth in this tumultuous meeting he endeavoured to assume in right of his authority and influence an air of importance and equality which a glance at the fearful object at the window and at the wild scene around him rendered it very difficult for him to sustain notwithstanding the exhortations of peter who whispered in his ear with some perturbation up heart master or we are but gone men  the syndic maintained his dignity however as well as he could in a short address in which he complimented the company upon the great victory gained by the soldiers of de la marck and the good citizens of liege  ay answered de la marck sarcastically we have brought down the game at last quoth my ladys brach to the wolf hound but ho sir burgomaster you come like mars with beauty by your side who is this fair oneunveil unveilno woman calls her beauty her own tonight  it is my daughter noble leader answered pavillon and i am to pray your forgiveness for her wearing a veil she has a vow for that effect to the three blessed kings  i will absolve her of it presently said de la marck for here with one stroke of a cleaver will i consecrate myself bishop of liege and i trust one living bishop is worth three dead kings  there was a shuddering and murmur among the guests for the community of liege and even some of the rude soldiers reverenced the kings of cologne as they were commonly called though they respected nothing else  nay i mean no treason against their defunct majesties said de la marck only bishop i am determined to be a prince both secular and ecclesiastical having power to bind and loose will best suit a band of reprobates such as you to whom no one else would give absolutionbut come hither noble burgomastersit beside me when you shall see me make a vacancy for my own prefermentbring in our predecessor in the holy seat  a bustle took place in the hall while pavillon excusing himself from the proffered seat of honour placed himself near the bottom of the table his followers keeping close behind him not unlike a flock of sheep which when a stranger dog is in presence may be sometimes seen to assemble in the rear of an old bell wether who is from office and authority judged by them to have rather more courage than themselves near the spot sat a very handsome lad a natural son as was said of the ferocious de la marck and towards whom he sometimes showed affection and even tenderness the mother of the boy a beautiful concubine had perished by a blow dealt her by the ferocious leader in a fit of drunkenness or jealousy and her fate had caused her tyrant as much remorse as he was capable of feeling his attachment to the surviving orphan might be partly owing to these circumstances quentin who had learned this point of the leaders character from the old priest planted himself as close as he could to the youth in question determined to make him in some way or other either a hostage or a protector should other means of safety fail them  while all stood in a kind of suspense waiting the event of the orders which the tyrant had issued one of pavillons followers whispered peter did not our master call that wench his daughterwhy it cannot be our trudchen this strapping lass is taller by two inches and there is a black lock of hair peeps forth yonder from under her veil by saint michael of the marketplace you might as well call a black bullocks hide a white heifers  hush hush said peter with some presence of mind what if our master hath a mind to steal a piece of doe venison out of the bishops parks here without our good dames knowledge and is it for thee or me to be a spy on him  that will not i answered the other though i would not have thought of his turning deer stealer at his years sappermentwhat a shy fairy it is see how she crouches down on yonder seat behind folks backs to escape the gaze of the marckersbut hold hold what are they about to do with the poor old bishop  as he spoke the bishop of liege louis of bourbon was dragged into the hall of his own palace by the brutal soldiery the dishevelled state of his hair beard and attire bore witness to the ill treatment he had already received and some of his sacerdotal robes hastily flung over him appeared to have been put on in scorn and ridicule of his quality and character by good fortune as quentin was compelled to think it the countess isabelle whose feelings at seeing her protector in such an extremity might have betrayed her own secret and compromised her safety was so situated as neither to hear nor see what was about to take place and durward sedulously interposed his own person before her so as to keep her from observing alike and from observation  the scene which followed was short and fearful when the unhappy prelate was brought before the footstool of the savage leader although in former life only remarkable for his easy and good natured temper he showed in this extremity a sense of his dignity and noble blood well becoming the high race from which he was descended his look was composed and undismayed his gesture when the rude hands which dragged him forward were unloosed was noble and at the same time resigned somewhat between the bearing of a feudal noble and of a christian martyr and so much was even de la marck himself staggered by the firm demeanour of his prisoner and recollection of the early benefits he had received from him that he seemed irresolute cast down his eyes and it was not until he had emptied a large goblet of wine that resuming his haughty insolence of look and manner he thus addressed his unfortunate captive  louis of bourbon said the truculent soldier drawing hard his breath clenching his hands setting his teeth and using the other mechanical actions to rouse up and sustain his native ferocity of temper i sought your friendship and you rejected mine what would you now give that it had been otherwisenikkel be ready  the butcher rose seized his weapon and stealing round behind de la marcks chair stood with it uplifted in his bare and sinewy hands  look at that man louis of bourbon said de la marck againwhat terms wilt thou now offer to escape this dangerous hour  the bishop cast a melancholy but unshaken look upon the grisly satellite who seemed prepared to execute the will of the tyrant and then he said with firmness hear me william de la marck and good men all if there be any here who deserve that name hear the only terms i can offer to this ruffian  william de la marck thou hast stirred up to sedition an imperial cityhast assaulted and taken the palace of a prince of the holy german empireslain his peopleplundered his goodsmaltreated his person for this thou art liable to the ban of the empire to put a prince under the ban of the empire was to divest him of his dignities and to interdict all intercourse and all offices of humanity with the offenderhast deserved to be declared outlawed and fugitive landless and rightless thou hast done more than all this more than mere human laws hast thou broken more than mere human vengeance hast thou deserved thou hast broken into the sanctuary of the lordlaid violent hands upon a father of the churchdefiled the house of god with blood and rapine like a sacrilegious robber  hast thou yet done said de la marck fiercely interrupting him and stamping with his foot  no answered the prelate for i have not yet told thee the terms which you demanded to hear from me  go on said de la marck and let the terms please me better than the preface or woe to thy gray head  and flinging himself back in his seat he grinded his teeth till the foam flew from his lips as from the tusks of the savage animal whose name and spoils he wore  such are thy crimes resumed the bishop with calm determination now hear the terms which as a merciful prince and a christian prelate setting aside all personal offence forgiving each peculiar injury i condescend to offer fling down thy heading staffrenounce thy commandunbind thy prisonersrestore thy spoildistribute what else thou hast of goods to relieve those whom thou hast made orphans and widowsarray thyself in sackcloth and ashestake a palmers staff in thy hand and go barefooted on pilgrimage to rome and we will ourselves be intercessors for thee with the imperial chamber at ratisbon for thy life with our holy father the pope for thy miserable soul  while louis of bourbon proposed these terms in a tone as decided as if he still occupied his episcopal throne and as if the usurper kneeled a suppliant at his feet the tyrant slowly raised himself in his chair the amazement with which he was at first filled giving way gradually to rage until as the bishop ceased he looked to nikkel blok and raised his finger without speaking a word the ruffian struck as if he had been doing his office in the common shambles and the murdered bishop sunk without a groan at the foot of his own episcopal throne the liegeois who were not prepared for so horrible a catastrophe and who had expected to hear the conference end in some terms of accommodation started up unanimously with cries of execration mingled with shouts of vengeance  in assigning the present date to the murder of the bishop of liege louis de bourbon history has been violated it is true that the bishop was made prisoner by the insurgents of that city it is also true that the report of the insurrection came to charles with a rumour that the bishop was slain which excited his indignation against louis who was then in his power but these things happened in 1468 and the bishops murder did not take place till 1482 in the months of august and september of that year william de la marck called the wild boar of ardennes entered into a conspiracy with the discontented citizens of liege against their bishop louis of bourbon being aided with considerable sums of money by the king of france by this means and the assistance of many murderers and banditti who thronged to him as to a leader befitting them de la marck assembled a body of troops whom he dressed in scarlet as a uniform with a boars head on the left sleeve with this little army he approached the city of liege upon this the citizens who were engaged in the conspiracy came to their bishop and offering to stand by him to the death exhorted him to march out against these robbers the bishop therefore put himself at the head of a few troops of his own trusting to the assistance of the people of liege but so soon as they came in sight of the enemy the citizens as before agreed fled from the bishops banner and he was left with his own handful of adherents at this moment de la marck charged at the head of his banditti with the expected success the bishop was brought before the profligate knight who first cut him over the face then murdered him with his own hand and caused his body to be exposed naked in the great square of liege before saint lamberts cathedral s  but william de la marck raising his tremendous voice above the tumult and shaking his clenched hand and extended arm shouted aloud how now ye porkers of liege ye wallowers in the mud of the maesdo ye dare to mate yourselves with the wild boar of ardennesup ye boars brood an expression by which he himself and others often designated his soldiers let these flemish hogs see your tusks  every one of his followers started up at the command and mingled as they were among their late allies prepared too for such a surprisal each had in an instant his next neighbour by the collar while his right hand brandished a broad dagger that glimmered against lamplight and moonshine every arm was uplifted but no one struck for the victims were too much surprised for resistance and it was probably the object of de la marck only to impose terror on his civic confederates  but the courage of quentin durward prompt and alert in resolution beyond his years and stimulated at the moment by all that could add energy to his natural shrewdness and resolution gave a new turn to the scene imitating the action of the followers of de la marck he sprang on carl eberson the son of their leader and mastering him with ease held his dirk at the boys throat while he exclaimed is that your game then here i play my part  hold hold exclaimed de la marck it is a jesta jestthink you i would injure my good friends and allies of the city of liegesoldiers unloose your holds sit down take away the carrion giving the bishops corpse a thrust with his foot which hath caused this strife among friends and let us drown unkindness in a fresh carouse  all unloosened their holds and the citizens and the soldiers stood gazing on each other as if they scarce knew whether they were friends or foes quentin durward took advantage of the moment  hear me he said william de la marck and you burghers and citizens of liegeand do you young sir stand still for the boy carl was attempting to escape from his gripno harm shall befall you unless another of these sharp jests shall pass around  who art thou in the fiends name said the astonished de la marck who art come to hold terms and take hostages from us in our own lairfrom us who exact pledges from others but yield them to no one  i am a servant of king louis of france said quentin boldly an archer of his scottish guard as my language and dress may partly tell you i am here to behold and to report your proceedings and i see with wonder that they are those of heathens rather than christiansof madmen rather than men possessed of reason the hosts of charles of burgundy will be instantly in motion against you all and if you wish assistance from france you must conduct yourself in a different manner  for you men of liege i advise your instant return to your own city and if there is any obstruction offered to your departure i denounce those by whom it is so offered foes to my master his most gracious majesty of france  france and liege france and liege cried the followers of pavillon and several other citizens whose courage began to rise at the bold language held by quentin  france and liege and long live the gallant archer we will live and die with him  william de la marcks eyes sparkled and he grasped his dagger as if about to launch it at the heart of the audacious speaker but glancing his eye around he read something in the looks of his soldiers which even he was obliged to respect many of them were frenchmen and all of them knew the private support which william had received both in men and in money from that kingdom nay some of them were rather startled at the violent and sacrilegious action which had been just committed the name of charles of burgundy a person likely to resent to the utmost the deeds of that night had an alarming sound and the extreme impolicy of at once quarrelling with the liegeois and provoking the monarch of france made an appalling impression on their minds confused as their intellects were de la marck in short saw he would not be supported even by his own band in any farther act of immediate violence and relaxing the terrors of his brow and eye declared that he had not the least design against his good friends of liege all of whom were at liberty to depart from schonwaldt at their pleasure although he had hoped they would revel one night with him at least in honour of their victory he added with more calmness than he commonly used that he would be ready to enter into negotiation concerning the partition of spoil and the arrangement of measures for their mutual defence either the next day or as soon after as they would meantime he trusted that the scottish gentleman would honour his feast by remaining all night at schonwaldt  the young scot returned his thanks but said his motions must be determined by those of pavillon to whom he was directed particularly to attach himself but that unquestionably he would attend him on his next return to the quarters of the valiant william de la marck  if you depend on my motions said pavillon hastily and aloud you are likely to quit schonwaldt without an instants delayand if you do not come back to schonwaldt save in my company you are not likely to see it again in a hurry  this last part of the sentence the honest citizen muttered to himself afraid of the consequences of giving audible vent to feelings which nevertheless he was unable altogether to suppress  keep close about me my brisk kurschner a worker in fur lads he said to his bodyguard and we will get as fast as we can out of this den of thieves  most of the better classes of the liegeois seemed to entertain similar opinions with the syndic and there had been scarce so much joy amongst them at the obtaining possession of schonwaldt as now seemed to arise from the prospect of getting safe out of it they were suffered to leave the castle without opposition of any kind and glad was quentin when he turned his back on those formidable walls  for the first time since they had entered that dreadful hall quentin ventured to ask the young countess how she did  well well she answered in feverish haste excellently welldo not stop to ask a question let us not lose an instant in wordslet us flylet us fly  she endeavoured to mend her pace as she spoke but with so little success that she must have fallen from exhaustion had not durward supported her with the tenderness of a mother when she conveys her infant out of danger the young scot raised his precious charge in his arms and while she encircled his neck with one arm lost to every other thought save the desire of escaping he would not have wished one of the risks of the night unencountered since such had been the conclusion  the honest burgomaster was in his turn supported and dragged forward by his faithful counsellor peter and another of his clerks and thus in breathless haste they reached the banks of the river encountering many strolling bands of citizens who were eager to know the event of the siege and the truth of certain rumours already afloat that the conquerors had quarrelled among themselves  evading their curiosity as they best could the exertions of peter and some of his companions at length procured a boat for the use of the company and with it an opportunity of enjoying some repose equally welcome to isabelle who continued to lie almost motionless in the arms of her deliverer and to the worthy burgomaster who after delivering a broken string of thanks to durward whose mind was at the time too much occupied to answer him began a long harangue which he addressed to peter upon his own courage and benevolence and the dangers to which these virtues had exposed him on this and other occasions  peter peter he said resuming the complaint of the preceding evening if i had not had a bold heart i would never have stood out against paying the burghers twentieths when every other living soul was willing to pay the sameay and then a less stout heart had not seduced me into that other battle of saint tron where a hainault man at arms thrust me into a muddy ditch with his lance which neither heart nor hand that i had could help me out of till the battle was overay and then peter this very night my courage seduced me moreover into too strait a corselet which would have been the death of me but for the aid of this gallant young gentleman whose trade is fighting whereof i wish him heartily joy and then for my tenderness of heart peter it has made a poor man of me that is it would have made a poor man of me if i had not been tolerably well to pass in this wicked worldand heaven knows what trouble it is likely to bring on me yet with ladies countesses and keeping of secrets which for aught i know may cost me half my fortune and my neck into the bargain  quentin could remain no longer silent but assured him that whatever danger or damage he should incur on the part of the young lady now under his protection should be thankfully acknowledged and as far as was possible repaid  i thank you young master squire archer i thank you answered the citizen of liege but who was it told you that i desired any repayment at your hand for doing the duty of an honest man i only regretted that it might cost me so and so and i hope i may have leave to say so much to my lieutenant without either grudging my loss or my peril  quentin accordingly concluded that his present friend was one of the numerous class of benefactors to others who take out their reward in grumbling without meaning more than by showing their grievances to exalt a little the idea of the valuable service by which they have incurred them and therefore prudently remained silent and suffered the syndic to maunder on to his lieutenant concerning the risk and the loss he had encountered by his zeal for the public good and his disinterested services to individuals until they reached his own habitation  the truth was that the honest citizen felt that he had lost a little consequence by suffering the young stranger to take the lead at the crisis which had occurred at the castle hall of schonwaldt and however delighted with the effect of durwards interference at the moment it seemed to him on reflection that he had sustained a diminution of importance for which he endeavoured to obtain compensation by exaggerating the claims which he had upon the gratitude of his country in general his friends in particular and more especially still on the countess of croye and her youthful protector  but when the boat stopped at the bottom of his garden and he had got himself assisted on shore by peter it seemed as if the touch of his own threshold had at once dissipated those feelings of wounded self opinion and jealousy and converted the discontented and obscured demagogue into the honest kind hospitable and friendly host he called loudly for trudchen who presently appeared for fear and anxiety would permit few within the walls of liege to sleep during that eventful night she was charged to pay the utmost attention to the care of the beautiful and half fainting stranger and admiring her personal charms while she pitied her distress gertrude discharged the hospitable duty with the zeal and affection of a sister  late as it now was and fatigued as the syndic appeared quentin on his side had difficulty to escape a flask of choice and costly wine as old as the battle of azincour and must have submitted to take his share however unwilling but for the appearance of the mother of the family whom pavillons loud summons for the keys of the cellar brought forth from her bedroom she was a jolly little roundabout woman who had been pretty in her time but whose principal characteristics for several years had been a red and sharp nose a shrill voice and a determination that the syndic in consideration of the authority which he exercised when abroad should remain under the rule of due discipline at home  so soon as she understood the nature of the debate between her husband and his guest she declared roundly that the former instead of having occasion for more wine had got too much already and far from using in furtherance of his request any of the huge bunch of keys which hung by a silver chain at her waist she turned her back on him without ceremony and ushered quentin to the neat and pleasant apartment in which he was to spend the night amid such appliances to rest and comfort as probably he had till that moment been entirely a stranger to so much did the wealthy flemings excel not merely the poor and rude scots but the french themselves in all the conveniences of domestic life    chapter xxiii the flight       now bid me run      and i will strive with things impossible      yea get the better of them       set on your foot      and with a heart new fired i follow you      to do i know not what       julius caesar   in spite of a mixture of joy and fear doubt anxiety and other agitating passions the exhausting fatigues of the preceding day were powerful enough to throw the young scot into a deep and profound repose which lasted until late on the day following when his worthy host entered the apartment with looks of care on his brow  he seated himself by his guests bedside and began a long and complicated discourse upon the domestic duties of a married life and especially upon the awful power and right supremacy which it became married men to sustain in all differences of opinion with their wives quentin listened with some anxiety he knew that husbands like other belligerent powers were sometimes disposed to sing te deum te deum laudamus we praise thee o god the first words of an ancient hymn sung in the morning service of the anglican and roman catholic churches rather to conceal a defeat than to celebrate a victory and he hastened to probe the matter more closely by hoping their arrival had been attended with no inconvenience to the good lady of the household  inconvenienceno answered the burgomasterno woman can be less taken unawares than mother mabelalways happy to see her friendsalways a clean lodging and a handsome meal ready for them with gods blessing on bed and boardno woman on earth so hospitableonly tis pity her temper is something particular  our residence here is disagreeable to her in short said the scot starting out of bed and beginning to dress himself hastily were i but sure the lady isabelle were fit for travel after the horrors of the last night we would not increase the offence by remaining here an instant longer  nay said pavillon that is just what the young lady herself said to mother mabel and truly i wish you saw the colour that came to her face as she said ita milkmaid that has skated five miles to market against the frost wind is a lily compared to iti do not wonder mother mabel may be a little jealous poor dear soul  has the lady isabelle then left her apartment said the youth continuing his toilette operations with more dispatch than before  yes replied pavillon and she expects your approach with much impatience to determine which way you shall go since you are both determined on going but i trust you will tarry breakfast  why did you not tell me this sooner said durward impatiently  softlysoftly said the syndic i have told it you too soon i think if it puts you into such a hasty fluster now i have some more matter for your ear if i saw you had some patience to listen to me  speak it worthy sir as soon and as fast as you cani listen devoutly  well resumed the burgomaster i have but one word to say and that is that trudchen who is as sorry to part with yonder pretty lady as if she had been some sister of hers wants you to take some other disguise for there is word in the town that the ladies of croye travel the country in pilgrims dresses attended by a french life guardsman of the scottish archers and it is said one of them was brought into schonwaldt last night by a bohemian after we had left it and it was said still farther that this same bohemian had assured william de la marck that you were charged with no message either to him or to the good people of liege and that you had stolen away the young countess and travelled with her as her paramour and all this news hath come from schonwaldt this morning and it has been told to us and the other councillors who know not well what to advise for though our own opinion is that william de la marck has been a thought too rough both with the bishop and with ourselves yet there is a great belief that he is a good natured soul at bottomthat is when he is soberand that he is the only leader in the world to command us against the duke of burgundy and in truth as matters stand it is partly my own mind that we must keep fair with him for we have gone too far to draw back  your daughter advises well said quentin durward abstaining from reproaches or exhortations which he saw would be alike unavailing to sway a resolution which had been adopted by the worthy magistrate in compliance at once with the prejudices of his party and the inclination of his wife  your daughter counsels wellwe must part in disguise and that instantly we may i trust rely upon you for the necessary secrecy and for the means of escape  with all my heartwith all my heart said the honest citizen who not much satisfied with the dignity of his own conduct was eager to find some mode of atonement i cannot but remember that i owed you my life last night both for unclasping that accursed steel doublet and helping me through the other scrape which was worse for yonder boar and his brood look more like devils than men so i will be true to you as blade to haft as our cutlers say who are the best in the whole world nay now you are ready come this wayyou shall see how far i can trust you  the syndic led him from the chamber in which he had slept to his own counting room in which he transacted his affairs of business and after bolting the door and casting a piercing and careful eye around him he opened a concealed and vaulted closet behind the tapestry in which stood more than one iron chest he proceeded to open one which was full of guilders and placed it at quentins discretion to take whatever sum he might think necessary for his companions expenses and his own  as the money with which quentin was furnished on leaving plessis was now nearly expended he hesitated not to accept the sum of two hundred guilders and by doing so took a great weight from the mind of pavillon who considered the desperate transaction in which he thus voluntarily became the creditor as an atonement for the breach of hospitality which various considerations in a great measure compelled him to commit  having carefully locked his treasure chamber the wealthy fleming next conveyed his guest to the parlour where in full possession of her activity of mind and body though pale from the scenes of the preceding night he found the countess attired in the fashion of a flemish maiden of the middling class no other was present excepting trudchen who was sedulously employed in completing the countesss dress and instructing her how to bear herself she extended her hand to him which when he had reverently kissed she said to him seignior quentin we must leave our friends here unless i would bring on them a part of the misery which has pursued me ever since my fathers death you must change your dress and go with me unless you also are tired of befriending a being so unfortunate  ii tired of being your attendantto the end of the earth will i guard you but youyou yourselfare you equal to the task you undertakecan you after the terrors of last night  do not recall them to my memory answered the countess i remember but the confusion of a horrid dreamhas the excellent bishop escaped  i trust he is in freedom said quentin making a sign to pavillon who seemed about to enter on the dreadful narrative to be silent  is it possible for us to rejoin himhath he gathered any power said the lady  his only hopes are in heaven said the scot but wherever you wish to go i stand by your side a determined guide and guard  we will consider said isabelle and after a moments pause she added a convent would be my choice but that i fear it would prove a weak defence against those who pursue me  hem hem said the syndic i could not well recommend a convent within the district of liege because the boar of ardennes though in the main a brave leader a trusty confederate and a well wisher to our city has nevertheless rough humours and payeth on the whole little regard to cloisters convents nunneries and the like men say that there are a score of nunsthat is such as were nunswho march always with his company  get yourself in readiness hastily seignior durward said isabelle interrupting this detail since to your faith i must needs commit myself  no sooner had the syndic and quentin left the room than isabelle began to ask of gertrude various questions concerning the roads and so forth with such clearness of spirit and pertinence that the latter could not help exclaiming lady i wonder at youi have heard of masculine firmness but yours appears to me more than belongs to humanity  necessity answered the countessnecessity my friend is the mother of courage as of invention no long time since i might have fainted when i saw a drop of blood shed from a trifling cuti have since seen life blood flow around me i may say in waves yet i have retained my senses and my self possessiondo not think it was an easy task she added laying on gertrudes arm a trembling hand although she still spoke with a firm voice the little world within me is like a garrison besieged by a thousand foes whom nothing but the most determined resolution can keep from storming it on every hand and at every moment were my situation one whit less perilous than it iswere i not sensible that my only chance to escape a fate more horrible than death is to retain my recollection and self possessiongertrude i would at this moment throw myself into your arms and relieve my bursting bosom by such a transport of tears and agony of terror as never rushed from a breaking heart  do not do so lady said the sympathizing fleming take courage tell your beads throw yourself on the care of heaven and surely if ever heaven sent a deliverer to one ready to perish that bold and adventurous young gentleman must be designed for yours there is one too she added blushing deeply in whom i have some interest say nothing to my father but i have ordered my bachelor hans glover to wait for you at the eastern gate and never to see my face more unless he brings word that he has guided you safe from the territory  to kiss her tenderly was the only way in which the young countess could express her thanks to the frank and kind hearted city maiden who returned the embrace affectionately and added with a smile nay if two maidens and their devoted bachelors cannot succeed in a disguise and an escape the world is changed from what i am told it wont to be  a part of this speech again called the colour into the countesss pale cheeks which was not lessened by quentins sudden appearance he entered completely attired as a flemish boor of the better class in the holyday suit of peter who expressed his interest in the young scot by the readiness with which he parted with it for his use and swore at the same time that were he to be curried and tugged worse than ever was bullocks hide they should make nothing out of him to the betraying of the young folks two stout horses had been provided by the activity of mother mabel who really desired the countess and her attendant no harm so that she could make her own house and family clear of the dangers which might attend upon harbouring them she beheld them mount and go off with great satisfaction after telling them that they would find their way to the east gate by keeping their eye on peter who was to walk in that direction as their guide but without holding any visible communication with them the instant her guests had departed mother mabel took the opportunity to read a long practical lecture to trudchen upon the folly of reading romances whereby the flaunting ladies of the court were grown so bold and venturous that instead of applying to learn some honest housewifery they must ride forsooth adamsel erranting through the country with no better attendant than some idle squire debauched page or rake belly archer from foreign parts to the great danger of their health the impoverishing of their substance and the irreparable prejudice of their reputation all this gertrude heard in silence and without reply but considering her character it might be doubted whether she derived from it the practical inference which it was her mothers purpose to enforce meantime the travellers had gained the eastern gate of the city traversing crowds of people who were fortunately too much busied in the political events and rumours of the hour to give any attention to a couple who had so little to render their appearance remarkable they passed the guards in virtue of a permission obtained for them by pavillon but in the name of his colleague rouslaer and they took leave of peter geislaer with a friendly though brief exchange of good wishes on either side  immediately afterwards they were joined by a stout young man riding a good gray horse who presently made himself known as hans glover the bachelor of trudchen pavillon he was a young fellow with a good flemish countenancenot indeed of the most intellectual cast but arguing more hilarity and good humour than wit and as the countess could not help thinking scarce worthy to be bachelor to the generous trudchen he seemed however fully desirous to second the views which she had formed in their favour for saluting them respectfully he asked of the countess in flemish on which road she desired to be conducted  guide me said she towards the nearest town on the frontiers of brabant  you have then settled the end and object of your journey said quentin approaching his horse to that of isabelle and speaking french which their guide did not understand  surely replied the young lady for situated as i now am it must be of no small detriment to me if i were to prolong a journey in my present circumstances even though the termination should be a rigorous prison  a prison said quentin  yes my friend a prison but i will take care that you shall not share it  do not talkdo not think of me said quentin saw i you but safe my own concerns are little worth minding  do not speak so loud said the lady isabelle you will surprise our guideyou see he has already rode on before usfor in truth the good natured fleming doing as he desired to be done by had removed from them the constraint of a third person upon quentins first motion towards the lady  yes she continued when she noticed they were free from observation to you my friend my protectorwhy should i be ashamed to call you what heaven has made you to meto you it is my duty to say that my resolution is taken to return to my native country and to throw myself on the mercy of the duke of burgundy it was mistaken though well meant advice which induced me ever to withdraw from his protection and place myself under that of the crafty and false louis of france  and you resolve to become the bride then of the count of campobasso the unworthy favourite of charles  thus spoke quentin with a voice in which internal agony struggled with his desire to assume an indifferent tone like that of the poor condemned criminal when affecting a firmness which he is far from feeling he asks if the death warrant be arrived  no durward no said the lady isabelle sitting up erect in her saddle to that hated condition all burgundys power shall not sink a daughter of the house of croye burgundy may seize on my lands and fiefs he may imprison my person in a convent but that is the worst i have to expect and worse than that i will endure ere i give my hand to campobasso  the worst said quentin and what worse can there be than plunder and imprisonmentoh think while you have gods free air around you and one by your side who will hazard life to conduct you to england to germany even to scotland in all of which you shall find generous protectorsoh while this is the case do not resolve so rashly to abandon the means of liberty the best gift that heaven givesoh well sang a poet of my own land        ah freedom is a noble thing      freedom makes men to have liking      freedom the zest to pleasure gives      he lives at ease who freely lives      grief sickness poortith poverty want are all      summd up within the name of thrall       from barbours bruce   she listened with a melancholy smile to her guides tirade in praise of liberty and then answered after a moments pause freedom is for man alonewoman must ever seek a protector since nature made her incapable to defend herself and where am i to find onein that voluptuary edward of englandin the inebriated wenceslaus of germanyin scotlandah durward were i your sister and could you promise me shelter in some of those mountain glens which you love to describe where for charity or for the few jewels i have preserved i might lead an unharrassed life and forget the lot i was born tocould you promise me the protection of some honoured matron of the landof some baron whose heart was as true as his swordthat were indeed a prospect for which it were worth the risk of farther censure to wander farther and wider  there was a faltering tenderness of voice with which the countess isabelle made this admission that at once filled quentin with a sensation of joy and cut him to the very heart he hesitated a moment ere he made an answer hastily reviewing in his mind the possibility there might be that he could procure her shelter in scotland but the melancholy truth rushed on him that it would be alike base and cruel to point out to her a course which he had not the most distant power or means to render safe  lady he said at last i should act foully against my honour and oath of chivalry did i suffer you to ground any plan upon the thoughts that i have the power in scotland to afford you other protection than that of the poor arm which is now by your side i scarce know that my blood flows in the veins of an individual who now lives in my native land the knight of innerquharity stormed our castle at midnight and cut off all that belonged to my name were i again in scotland our feudal enemies are numerous and powerful i single and weak and even had the king a desire to do me justice he dared not for the sake of redressing the wrongs of a poor individual provoke a chief who rides with five hundred horse  alas said the countess there is then no corner of the world safe from oppression since it rages as unrestrained amongst those wild hills which afford so few objects to covet as in our rich and abundant lowlands  it is a sad truth and i dare not deny it said the scot that for little more than the pleasure of revenge and the lust of bloodshed our hostile clans do the work of executioners on each other and ogilvies and the like act the same scenes in scotland as de la marck and his robbers do in this country  no more of scotland then said isabelle with a tone of indifference either real or affectedno more of scotlandwhich indeed i mentioned but in jest to see if you really dared to recommend to me as a place of rest the most distracted kingdom in europe it was but a trial of your sincerity which i rejoice to see may be relied on even when your partialities are most strongly excited so once more i will think of no other protection than can be afforded by the first honourable baron holding of duke charles to whom i am determined to render myself  and why not rather betake yourself to your own estates and to your own strong castle as you designed when at tours said quentin why not call around you the vassals of your father and make treaty with burgundy rather than surrender yourself to him surely there must be many a bold heart that would fight in your cause and i know at least of one who would willingly lay down his life to give example  alas said the countess that scheme the suggestion of the crafty louis and like all which he ever suggested designed more for his advantage than for mine has become practicable since it was betrayed to burgundy by the double traitor zamet hayraddin my kinsman was then imprisoned and my houses garrisoned any attempt of mine would but expose my dependents to the vengeance of duke charles and why should i occasion more bloodshed than has already taken place on so worthless an account no i will submit myself to my sovereign as a dutiful vassal in all which shall leave my personal freedom of choice uninfringed the rather that i trust my kinswoman the countess hameline who first counselled and indeed urged my flight has already taken this wise and honourable step  your kinswoman repeated quentin awakened to recollections to which the young countess was a stranger and which the rapid succession of perilous and stirring events had as matters of nearer concern in fact banished from his memory  aymy auntthe countess hameline of croyeknow you aught of her said the countess isabelle i trust she is now under the protection of the burgundian banner you are silent know you aught of her  the last question urged in a tone of the most anxious inquiry obliged quentin to give some account of what he knew of the countesss fate he mentioned that he had been summoned to attend her in a flight from liege which he had no doubt the lady isabelle would be partaker inhe mentioned the discovery that had been made after they had gained the forestand finally he told his own return to the castle and the circumstances in which he found it but he said nothing of the views with which it was plain the lady hameline had left the castle of schonwaldt and as little about the floating report of her having fallen into the hands of william de la marck delicacy prevented his even hinting at the one and regard for the feelings of his companion at a moment when strength and exertion were most demanded of her prevented him from alluding to the latter which had besides only reached him as a mere rumour  this tale though abridged of those important particulars made a strong impression on the countess isabelle who after riding some time in silence said at last with a tone of cold displeasure and so you abandoned my unfortunate relative in a wild forest at the mercy of a vile bohemian and a traitorous waiting womanpoor kinswoman thou wert wont to praise this youths good faith  had i not done so madam said quentin not unreasonably offended at the turn thus given to his gallantry what had been the fate of one to whose service i was far more devotedly bound had i not left the countess hameline of croye to the charge of those whom she had herself selected as counsellors and advisers the countess isabelle had been ere now the bride of william de la marck the wild boar of ardennes  you are right said the countess isabelle in her usual manner and i who have the advantage of your unhesitating devotion have done you foul and ungrateful wrong but oh my unhappy kinswoman and the wretch marthon who enjoyed so much of her confidence and deserved it so littleit was she that introduced to my kinswoman the wretched zamet and hayraddin maugrabin who by their pretended knowledge of soothsaying and astrology obtained a great ascendancy over her mind it was she who strengthening their predictions encouraged her ini know not what to call themdelusions concerning matches and lovers which my kinswomans age rendered ungraceful and improbable i doubt not that from the beginning we had been surrounded by these snares by louis of france in order to determine us to take refuge at his court or rather to put ourselves into his power after which rash act on our part how unkingly unknightly ignobly ungentlemanlike he hath conducted himself towards us you quentin durward can bear witness but alas my kinswomanwhat think you will be her fate  endeavouring to inspire hopes which he scarce felt durward answered that the avarice of these people was stronger than any other passion that marthon even when he left them seemed to act rather as the lady hamelines protectress and in fine that it was difficult to conceive any object these wretches could accomplish by the ill usage or murder of the countess whereas they might be gainers by treating her well and putting her to ransom  to lead the countess isabelles thoughts from this melancholy subject quentin frankly told her the treachery of the maugrabin which he had discovered in the night quarter near namur and which appeared the result of an agreement betwixt the king and william de la marck isabelle shuddered with horror and then recovering herself said i am ashamed and i have sinned in permitting myself so far to doubt of the saints protection as for an instant to have deemed possible the accomplishment of a scheme so utterly cruel base and dishonourable while there are pitying eyes in heaven to look down on human miseries it is not a thing to be thought of with fear or abhorrence but to be rejected as such a piece of incredible treachery and villainy as it were atheism to believe could ever be successful but i now see plainly why that hypocritical marthon often seemed to foster every seed of petty jealousy or discontent betwixt my poor kinswoman and myself whilst she always mixed with flattery addressed to the individual who was present whatever could prejudice her against her absent kinswoman yet never did i dream she could have proceeded so far as to have caused my once affectionate kinswoman to have left me behind in the perils of schonwaldt while she made her own escape  did the lady hameline not mention to you then said quentin her intended flight  no replied the countess but she alluded to some communication which marthon was to make to me to say truth my poor kinswomans head was so turned by the mysterious jargon of the miserable hayraddin whom that day she had admitted to a long and secret conference and she threw out so many strange hints thatthatin short i cared not to press on her when in that humour for any explanation yet it was cruel to leave me behind her  i will excuse the lady hameline from intending such unkindness said quentin for such was the agitation of the moment and the darkness of the hour that i believe the lady hameline as certainly conceived herself accompanied by her niece as i at the same time deceived by marthons dress and demeanour supposed i was in the company of both the ladies of croye and of her especially he added with a low but determined voice without whom the wealth of worlds would not have tempted me to leave  isabelle stooped her head forward and seemed scarce to hear the emphasis with which quentin had spoken but she turned her face to him again when he began to speak of the policy of louis and it was not difficult for them by mutual communication to ascertain that the bohemian brothers with their accomplice marthon had been the agents of that crafty monarch although zamet the elder of them with a perfidy peculiar to his race had attempted to play a double game and had been punished accordingly in the same humour of mutual confidence and forgetting the singularity of their own situation as well as the perils of the road the travellers pursued their journey for several hours only stopping to refresh their horses at a retired dorff or hamlet to which they were conducted by hans glover who in all other respects as well as in leaving them much to their own freedom in conversation conducted himself like a person of reflection and discretion  meantime the artificial distinction which divided the two lovers for such we may now term them seemed dissolved or removed by the circumstances in which they were placed for if the countess boasted the higher rank and was by birth entitled to a fortune incalculably larger than that of the youth whose revenue lay in his sword it was to be considered that for the present she was as poor as he and for her safety honour and life exclusively indebted to his presence of mind valour and devotion they spoke not indeed of love for though the young lady her heart full of gratitude and confidence might have pardoned such a declaration yet quentin on whose tongue there was laid a check both by natural timidity and by the sentiments of chivalry would have held it an unworthy abuse of her situation had he said anything which could have the appearance of taking undue advantage of the opportunities which it afforded them they spoke not then of love but the thoughts of it were on both sides unavoidable and thus they were placed in that relation to each other in which sentiments of mutual regard are rather understood than announced and which with the freedoms which it permits and the uncertainties that attend it often forms the most delightful hours of human existence and as frequently leads to those which are darkened by disappointment fickleness and all the pains of blighted hope and unrequited attachment  it was two hours after noon when the travellers were alarmed by the report of the guide who with paleness and horror in his countenance said that they were pursued by a party of de la marcks schwarzreiters these soldiers or rather banditti were bands levied in the lower circles of germany and resembled the lanzknechts in every particular except that the former acted as light cavalry to maintain the name of black troopers and to strike additional terror into their enemies they usually rode on black chargers and smeared with black ointment their arms and accoutrements in which operation their hands and faces often had their share in morals and in ferocity these schwarzreiters emulated their pedestrian brethren the lanzknechts  to make their horses and boots shine they make themselves as black as colliers these horsemen wear black clothes and poor though they be spend no small time in brushing them the most of them have black horses and delight to have their boots and shoes shine with blacking stuff their hands and faces become black and thereof they have their foresaid name fynes morrisons itinerarys  on looking back and discovering along the long level road which they had traversed a cloud of dust advancing with one or two of the headmost troopers riding furiously in front of it quentin addressed his companion dearest isabelle i have no weapon left save my sword but since i cannot fight for you i will fly with you could we gain yonder wood that is before us ere they come up we may easily find means to escape  so be it my only friend said isabelle pressing her horse to the gallop and thou good fellow she added addressing hans glover get thee off to another road and do not stay to partake our misfortune and danger  the honest fleming shook his head and answered her generous exhortation with nein nein das geht nicht no no that must not be and continued to attend them all three riding toward the shelter of the wood as fast as their jaded horses could go pursued at the same time by the schwarzreiters who increased their pace when they saw them fly but notwithstanding the fatigue of the horses still the fugitives being unarmed and riding lighter in consequence had considerably the advantage of the pursuers and were within about a quarter of a mile of the wood when a body of men at arms under a knights pennon was discovered advancing from the cover so as to intercept their flight  they have bright armour said isabelle they must be burgundians be they who they will we must yield to them rather than to the lawless miscreants who pursue us  a moment after she exclaimed looking on the pennon i know the cloven heart which it displays it is the banner of the count of crevecoeur a noble burgundianto him i will surrender myself  quentin durward sighed but what other alternative remained and how happy would he have been but an instant before to have been certain of the escape of isabelle even under worse terms they soon joined the band of crevecoeur and the countess demanded to speak to the leader who had halted his party till he should reconnoitre the black troopers and as he gazed on her with doubt and uncertainty she said noble countisabelle of croye the daughter of your old companion in arms count reinold of croye renders herself and asks protection from your valour for her and hers  thou shalt have it fair kinswoman were it against a hostalways excepting my liege lord of burgundy but there is little time to talk of it these filthy looking fiends have made a halt as if they intended to dispute the matterby saint george of burgundy they have the insolence to advance against the banner of crevecoeur what will not the knaves be ruled damian my lanceadvance bannerlay your spears in the restcrevecoeur to the rescue  crying his war cry and followed by his men at arms he galloped rapidly forward to charge the schwarzreiters    chapter xxiv the surrender       rescue or none sir knight i am your captive      deal with me what your nobleness suggests      thinking the chance of war may one day place you      where i must now be reckondi the roll      of melancholy prisoners       anonymous   the skirmish betwixt the schwarzreiters and the burgundian men at arms lasted scarcely five minutes so soon were the former put to the rout by the superiority of the latter in armour weight of horse and military spirit in less than the space we have mentioned the count of crevecoeur wiping his bloody sword upon his horses mane ere he sheathed it came back to the verge of the forest where isabelle had remained a spectator of the combat one part of his people followed him while the other continued to pursue the flying enemy for a little space along the causeway  it is shame said the count that the weapons of knights and gentlemen should be soiled by the blood of those brutal swine  so saying he returned his weapon to the sheath and added this is a rough welcome to your home my pretty cousin but wandering princesses must expect such adventures and well i came up in time for let me assure you the black troopers respect a countesss coronet as little as a country wenchs coif and i think your retinue is not qualified for much resistance  my lord count said the lady isabelle without farther preface let me know if i am a prisoner and where you are to conduct me  you know you silly child answered the count how i would answer that question did it rest on my own will but you and your foolish match making marriage hunting aunt have made such wild use of your wings of late that i fear you must be contented to fold them up in a cage for a little while for my part my duty and it is a sad one will be ended when i have conducted you to the court of the duke at peronne for which purpose i hold it necessary to deliver the command of this reconnoitring party to my nephew count stephen while i return with you thither as i think you may need an intercessorand i hope the young giddy pate will discharge his duty wisely  so please you fair uncle said count stephen if you doubt my capacity to conduct the men at arms even remain with them yourself and i will be the servant and guard of the countess isabelle of croye  no doubt fair nephew answered his uncle this were a goodly improvement on my scheme but methinks i like it as well in the way i planned it please you therefore to take notice that your business here is not to hunt after and stick these black hogs for which you seemed but now to have felt an especial vocation but to collect and bring to me true tidings of what is going forward in the country of liege concerning which we hear such wild rumours let some half score of lances follow me and the rest remain with my banner under your guidance  yet one moment cousin of crevecoeur said the countess isabelle and let me in yielding myself prisoner stipulate at least for the safety of those who have befriended me in my misfortunes permit this good fellow my trusty guide to go back unharmed to his native town of liege  my nephew said crevecoeur after looking sharply at glovers honest breadth of countenance shall guard this good fellow who seems indeed to have little harm in him as far into the territory as he himself advances and then leave him at liberty  fail not to remember me to the kind gertrude said the countess to her guide and added taking a string of pearls from under her veil pray her to wear this in remembrance of her unhappy friend  honest glover took the string of pearls and kissed with clownish gesture but with sincere kindness the fair hand which had found such a delicate mode of remunerating his own labours and peril  umph signs and tokens said the count any farther bequests to make my fair cousinit is time we were on our way  only said the countess making an effort to speak that you will be pleased to be favourable to thisthis young gentleman  umph said crevecoeur casting the same penetrating glance on quentin which he had bestowed on glover but apparently with a much less satisfactory result and mimicking though not offensively the embarrassment of the countess  umphaythis is a blade of another temperand pray my cousin what has thisthis very young gentleman done to deserve such intercession at your hands  he has saved my life and honour said the countess reddening with shame and resentment  quentin also blushed with indignation but wisely concluded that to give vent to it might only make matters worse  life and honourumph said again the count crevecoeur methinks it would have been as well my cousin if you had not put yourself in the way of lying under such obligations to this very young gentlemanbut let it pass the young gentleman may wait on us if his quality permit and i will see he has no injuryonly i will myself take in future the office of protecting your life and honour and may perhaps find for him some fitter duty than that of being a squire of the body to damosels errant  my lord count said durward unable to keep silence any longer lest you should talk of a stranger in slighter terms than you might afterwards think becoming i take leave to tell you that i am quentin durward an archer of the scottish bodyguard in which as you well know none but gentlemen and men of honour are enrolled  i thank you for your information and i kiss your hands seignior archer said crevecoeur in the same tone of raillery have the goodness to ride with me to the front of the party  as quentin moved onward at the command of the count who had now the power if not the right to dictate his motions he observed that the lady isabelle followed his motions with a look of anxious and timid interest which amounted almost to tenderness and the sight of which brought water into his eyes but he remembered that he had a mans part to sustain before crevecoeur who perhaps of all the chivalry in france or burgundy was the least likely to be moved to anything but laughter by a tale of true love sorrow he determined therefore not to wait his addressing him but to open the conversation in a tone which should assert his claim to fair treatment and to more respect than the count offended perhaps at finding a person of such inferior note placed so near the confidence of his high born and wealthy cousin seemed disposed to entertain for him  my lord count of crevecoeur he said in a temperate but firm tone of voice may i request of you before our interview goes farther to tell me if i am at liberty or am to account myself your prisoner  a shrewd question replied the count which at present i can only answer by anotherare france and burgundy think you at peace or war with each other  that replied the scot you my lord should certainly know better than i i have been absent from the court of france and have heard no news for some time  look you there said the count you see how easy it is to ask questions but how difficult to answer them why i myself who have been at peronne with the duke for this week and better cannot resolve this riddle any more than you and yet sir squire upon the solution of that question depends the said point whether you are prisoner or free man and for the present i must hold you as the formeronly if you have really and honestly been of service to my kinswoman and for you are candid in your answers to the questions i shall ask affairs shall stand the better with you  the countess of croye said quentin is best judge if i have rendered any service and to her i refer you on that matter my answers you will yourself judge of when you ask me your questions  umphhaughty enough muttered the count of crevecoeur and very like one that wears a ladys favour in his hat and thinks he must carry things with a high tone to honour the precious remnant of silk and tinsel well sir i trust it will be no abatement of your dignity if you answer me how long you have been about the person of the lady isabelle of croye  count of crevecoeur said quentin durward if i answer questions which are asked in a tone approaching towards insult it is only lest injurious inferences should be drawn from my silence respecting one to whom we are both obliged to render justice i have acted as escort to the lady isabelle since she left france to retire into flanders  ho ho said the count and that is to say since she fled from plessis les toursyou an archer of the scottish guard accompanied her of course by the express orders of king louis  however little quentin thought himself indebted to the king of france who in contriving the surprisal of the countess isabelle by william de la marck had probably calculated on the young scotchmans being slain in her defence he did not yet conceive himself at liberty to betray any trust which louis had reposed or had seemed to repose in him and therefore replied to count crevecoeurs inference that it was sufficient for him to have the authority of his superior officer for what he had done and he inquired no farther  it is quite sufficient said the count we know the king does not permit his officers to send the archers of his guard to prance like paladins by the bridle rein of wandering ladies unless he hath some politic purpose to serve it will be difficult for king louis to continue to aver so boldly that he knew not of the ladies of croyes having escaped from france since they were escorted by one of his own life guardand whither sir archer was your retreat directed  to liege my lord answered the scot where the ladies desired to be placed under the protection of the late bishop  the late bishop exclaimed the count of crevecoeur is louis of bourbon deadnot a word of his illness had reached the dukeof what did he die  he sleeps in a bloody grave my lordthat is if his murderers have conferred one on his remains  murdered exclaimed crevecoeur againholy mother of heavenyoung man it is impossible  i saw the deed done with my own eyes and many an act of horror besides  saw it and made not in to help the good prelate exclaimed the count or to raise the castle against his murderersknowst thou not that even to look on such a deed without resisting it is profane sacrilege  to be brief my lord said durward ere this act was done the castle was stormed by the bloodthirsty william de la marck with help of the insurgent liegeois  i am struck with thunder said crevecoeur liege in insurrectionschonwaldt takenthe bishop murderedmessenger of sorrow never did one man unfold such a packet of woesspeakknew you of this assaultof this insurrectionof this murderspeakthou art one of louiss trusted archers and it is he that has aimed this painful arrowspeak or i will have thee torn with wild horses  and if i am so torn my lord there can be nothing rent out of me that may not become a true scottish gentleman i know no more of these villainies than youwas so far from being partaker in them that i would have withstood them to the uttermost had my means in a twentieth degree equalled my inclination but what could i dothey were hundreds and i but one my only care was to rescue the countess isabelle and in that i was happily successful yet had i been near enough when the ruffian deed was so cruelly done on the old man i had saved his gray hairs or i had avenged them and as it was my abhorrence was spoken loud enough to prevent other horrors  i believe thee youth said the count thou art neither of an age nor nature to be trusted with such bloody work however well fitted to be the squire of dames but alas for the kind and generous prelate to be murdered on the hearth where he so often entertained the stranger with christian charity and princely bountyand that by a wretch a monster a portentous growth of blood and crueltybred up in the very hall where he has imbrued his hands in his benefactors blood but i know not charles of burgundynay i should doubt of the justice of heaven if vengeance be not as sharp and sudden and severe as this villainy has been unexampled in atrocity and if no other shall pursue the murdererhere he paused grasped his sword then quitting his bridle struck both gauntleted hands upon his breast until his corselet clattered and finally held them up to heaven as he solemnly continuedii philip crevecoeur of cordes make a vow to god saint lambert and the three kings of cologne that small shall be my thought of other earthly concerns till i take full revenge on the murderers of the good louis of bourbon whether i find them in forest or field in city or in country in hill or in plain in kings court or in gods church and thereto i pledge hands and living friends and followers life and honour so help me god and saint lambert of liege and the three kings of cologne  when the count of crevecoeur had made his vow his mind seemed in some sort relieved from the overwhelming grief and astonishment with which he had heard the fatal tragedy that had been acted at schonwaldt and he proceeded to question durward more minutely concerning the particulars of that disastrous affair which the scot nowise desirous to abate the spirit of revenge which the count entertained against william de la marck gave him at full length  but those blind unsteady faithless fickle beasts the liegeois said the count that they should have combined themselves with this inexorable robber and murderer to put to death their lawful prince  durward here informed the enraged burgundian that the liegeois or at least the better class of them however rashly they had run into the rebellion against their bishop had no design so far as appeared to him to aid in the execrable deed of de la marck but on the contrary would have prevented it if they had had the means and were struck with horror when they beheld it  speak not of the faithless inconstant plebeian rabble said crevecoeur when they took arms against a prince who had no fault save that he was too kind and too good a master for such a set of ungrateful slaveswhen they armed against him and broke into his peaceful house what could there be in their intention but murderwhen they banded themselves with the wild boar of ardennes the greatest homicide in the marches of flanders what else could there be in their purpose but murder which is the very trade he lives by and again was it not one of their own vile rabble who did the very deed by thine own account i hope to see their canals running blood by the flight of their burning houses oh the kind noble generous lord whom they have slaughteredother vassals have rebelled under the pressure of imposts and penury but the men of liege in the fullness of insolence and plenty  he again abandoned the reins of his war horse and wrung bitterly the hands which his mail gloves rendered untractable quentin easily saw that the grief which he manifested was augmented by the bitter recollection of past intercourse and friendship with the sufferer and was silent accordingly respecting feelings which he was unwilling to aggravate and at the same time felt it impossible to soothe but the count of crevecoeur returned again and again to the subjectquestioned him on every particular of the surprise of schonwaldt and the death of the bishop and then suddenly as if he had recollected something which had escaped his memory demanded what had become of the lady hameline and why she was not with her kinswoman  not he added contemptuously that i consider her absence as at all a loss to the countess isabelle for although she was her kinswoman and upon the whole a well meaning woman yet the court of cocagne never produced such a fantastic fool and i hold it for certain that her niece whom i have always observed to be a modest and orderly young lady was led into the absurd frolic of flying from burgundy to france by that blundering romantic old match making and match seeking idiot  court of cocagne a fabled land intended to ridicule the stories of avalon the apple green island the home of king arthur its houses were built of good things to eat roast geese went slowly down the street turning themselves and inviting the passersby to eat them buttered larks fell in profusion the shingles of the houses were of cake cent dict cocagne has also been called lubberland  what a speech for a romantic lover to hear and to hear too when it would have been ridiculous in him to attempt what it was impossible for him to achievenamely to convince the count by force of arms that he did foul wrong to the countessthe peerless in sense as in beautyin terming her a modest and orderly young woman qualities which might have been predicated with propriety of the daughter of a sunburnt peasant who lived by goading the oxen while her father held the plough and then to suppose her under the domination and supreme guidance of a silly and romantic auntthe slander should have been repelled down the slanderers throat but the open though severe physiognomy of the count of crevecoeur the total contempt which he seemed to entertain for those feelings which were uppermost in quentins bosom overawed him not for fear of the counts fame in arms that was a risk which would have increased his desire of making out a challengebut in dread of ridicule the weapon of all others most feared by enthusiasts of every description and which from its predominance over such minds often checks what is absurd and fully as often smothers that which is noble  under the influence of this fear of becoming an object of scorn rather than resentment durward though with some pain confined his reply to a confused account of the lady hamelines having made her escape from schonwaldt before the attack took place he could not indeed have made his story very distinct without throwing ridicule on the near relation of isabelle and perhaps incurring some himself as having been the object of her preposterous expectations he added to his embarrassed detail that he had heard a report though a vague one of the lady hamelines having again fallen into the hands of william de la marck  i trust in saint lambert that he will marry her said crevecoeur as indeed he is likely enough to do for the sake of her moneybags and equally likely to knock her on the head so soon as these are either secured in his own grasp or at farthest emptied  the count then proceeded to ask so many questions concerning the mode in which both ladies had conducted themselves on the journey the degree of intimacy to which they admitted quentin himself and other trying particulars that vexed and ashamed and angry the youth was scarce able to conceal his embarrassment from the keen sighted soldier and courtier who seemed suddenly disposed to take leave of him saying at the same time umphi see it is as i conjectured on one side at least i trust the other party has kept her senses bettercome sir squire spur on and keep the van while i fall back to discourse with the lady isabelle i think i have learned now so much from you that i can talk to her of these sad passages without hurting her nicety though i have fretted yours a littleyet stay young gallantone word ere you go you have had i imagine a happy journey through fairylandall full of heroic adventure and high hope and wild minstrellike delusion like the gardens of morgaine la fee halfsister of arthur her gardens abounded in all good things music filled the air and the inhabitants enjoyed perpetual youth forget it all young soldier he added tapping him on the shoulder remember yonder lady only as the honoured countess of croyeforget her as a wandering and adventurous damsel and her friendsone of them i can answer forwill remember on their part only the services you have done her and forget the unreasonable reward which you have had the boldness to propose to yourself  enraged that he had been unable to conceal from the sharp sighted crevecoeur feelings which the count seemed to consider as the object of ridicule quentin replied indignantly my lord count when i require advice of you i will ask it when i demand assistance of you it will be time enough to grant or refuse it when i set peculiar value on your opinion of me it will not be too late to express it  heyday said the count i have come between amadis and oriana and must expect a challenge to the lists  amadis is the hero of a famous mediaeval romance originally written in portuguese but translated into french and much enlarged by subsequent romancers amadis is represented as a model of chivalry his lady was oriana  you speak as if that were an impossibility said quentin when i broke a lance with the duke of orleans it was against a head in which flowed better blood than that of crevecoeurwhen i measured swords with dunois i engaged a better warrior  now heaven nourish thy judgment gentle youth said crevecoeur still laughing at the chivalrous inamorato if thou speakst truth thou hast had singular luck in this world and truly if it be the pleasure of providence exposes thee to such trials without a beard on thy lip thou wilt be mad with vanity ere thou writest thyself man thou canst not move me to anger though thou mayst to mirth believe me though thou mayst have fought with princes and played the champion for countesses by some of those freaks which fortune will sometimes exhibit thou art by no means the equal of those of whom thou hast been either the casual opponent or more casual companion i can allow thee like a youth who hath listened to romances till he fancied himself a paladin to form pretty dreams for some time but thou must not be angry at a well meaning friend though he shake thee something roughly by the shoulders to awake thee  my lord of crevecoeur said quentin my family  nay it was not utterly of family that i spoke said the count but of rank fortune high station and so forth which place a distance between various degrees and classes of persons as for birth all men are descended from adam and eve  my lord count repeated quentin my ancestors the durwards of glen houlakin  nay said the count if you claim a farther descent for them than from adam i have done good even to you  he reined back his horse and paused to join the countess to whom if possible his insinuations and advices however well meant were still more disagreeable than to quentin who as he rode on muttered to himself cold blooded insolent overweening coxcombwould that the next scottish archer who has his harquebuss pointed at thee may not let thee off so easily as i did  in the evening they reached the town of charleroi on the sambre where the count of crevecoeur had determined to leave the countess isabelle whom the terror and fatigue of yesterday joined to a flight of fifty miles since morning and the various distressing sensations by which it was accompanied had made incapable of travelling farther with safety to her health the count consigned her in a state of great exhaustion to the care of the abbess of the cistercian convent in charleroi a noble lady to whom both the families of crevecoeur and croye were related and in whose prudence and kindness he could repose confidence  crevecoeur himself only stopped to recommend the utmost caution to the governor of a small burgundian garrison who occupied the place and required him also to mount a guard of honour upon the convent during the residence of the countess isabelle of croyeostensibly to secure her safety but perhaps secretly to prevent her attempting to escape the count only assigned as a cause for the garrisons being vigilant some vague rumours which he had heard of disturbances in the bishopric of liege but he was determined himself to be the first who should carry the formidable news of the insurrection and the murder of the bishop in all their horrible reality to duke charles and for that purpose having procured fresh horses for himself and suite he mounted with the resolution of continuing his journey to peronne without stopping for repose and informing quentin durward that he must attend him he made at the same time a mock apology for parting fair company but hoped that to so devoted a squire of dames a nights journey by moonshine would be more agreeable than supinely to yield himself to slumber like an ordinary mortal  quentin already sufficiently afflicted by finding that he was to be parted from isabelle longed to answer this taunt with an indignant defiance but aware that the count would only laugh at his anger and despise his challenge he resolved to wait some future time when he might have an opportunity of obtaining some amends from this proud lord who though for very different reasons had become nearly as odious to him as the wild boar of ardennes himself he therefore assented to crevecoeurs proposal as to what he had no choice of declining and they pursued in company and with all the despatch they could exert the road between charleroi and peronne    chapter xxv the unbidden guest       no human quality is so well wove      in warp and woof but there s some flaw in it      ive known a brave man fly a shepherds cur      a wise man so demean him drivelling idiocy      had wellnigh been ashamed ont for your crafty      your worldly wise man he above the rest      weaves his own snares so fine he s often caught in them       old play   quentin during the earlier part of the night journey had to combat with that bitter heartache which is felt when youth parts and probably forever with her he loves as pressed by the urgency of the moment and the impatience of crevecoeur they hasted on through the rich lowlands of hainault under the benign guidance of a rich and lustrous harvest moon she shed her yellow influence over rich and deep pastures woodland and cornfields from which the husbandmen were using her light to withdraw the grain such was the industry of the flemings even at that period she shone on broad level and fructifying rivers where glided the white sail in the service of commerce uninterrupted by rock and torrent beside lively quiet villages whose external decency and cleanliness expressed the ease and comfort of the inhabitantsshe gleamed upon the feudal castle of many a baron and knight with its deep moat battlemented court and high belfryfor the chivalry of hainault was renowned among the nobles of europeand her light displayed at a distance in its broad beam the gigantic towers of more than one lofty minster  yet all this fair variety however differing from the waste and wilderness of his own land interrupted not the course of quentins regrets and sorrows he had left his heart behind him when he departed from charleroi and the only reflection which the farther journey inspired was that every step was carrying him farther from isabelle his imagination was taxed to recall every word she had spoken every look she had directed towards him and as happens frequently in such cases the impression made upon his imagination by the recollection of these particulars was even stronger than the realities themselves had excited  at length after the cold hour of midnight was past in spite alike of love and of sorrow the extreme fatigue which quentin had undergone the two preceding days began to have an effect on him which his habits of exercise of every kind and his singular alertness and activity of character as well as the painful nature of the reflections which occupied his thoughts had hitherto prevented his experiencing the ideas of his mind began to be so little corrected by the exertions of his senses worn out and deadened as the latter now were by extremity of fatigue that the visions which the former drew superseded or perverted the information conveyed by the blunted organs of seeing and hearing and durward was only sensible that he was awake by the exertions which sensible of the peril of his situation he occasionally made to resist falling into a deep and dead sleep every now and then strong consciousness of the risk of falling from or with his horse roused him to exertion and animation but ere long his eyes again were dimmed by confused shades of all sorts of mingled colours the moonlight landscape swam before them and he was so much overcome with fatigue that the count of crevecoeur observing his condition was at length compelled to order two of his attendants one to each rein of durwards bridle in order to prevent the risk of his falling from his horse  when at length they reached the town of landrecy the count in compassion to the youth who had now been in a great measure without sleep for three nights allowed himself and his retinue a halt of four hours for rest and refreshment deep and sound were quentins slumbers until they were broken by the sound of the counts trumpet and the cry of his fouriers subordinate officers who secure quarters for the army while manoeuvring and harbingers debout debout ha messires en route en route arise let us set out  yet unwelcomely early as the tones came they awaked him a different being in strength and spirits from what he had fallen asleep confidence in himself and his fortunes returned with his reviving spirits and with the rising sun he thought of his love no longer as a desperate and fantastic dream but as a high and invigorating principle to be cherished in his bosom although he might never purpose to himself under all the difficulties by which he was beset to bring it to any prosperous issue  the pilot he reflected steers his bark by the polar star although he never expects to become possessor of it and the thoughts of isabelle of croye shall make me a worthy man at arms though i may never see her more when she hears that a scottish soldier named quentin durward distinguished himself in a well fought field or left his body on the breach of a disputed fortress she will remember the companion of her journey as one who did all in his power to avert the snares and misfortunes which beset it and perhaps will honour his memory with a tear his coffin with a garland  in this manly mood of bearing his misfortune quentin felt himself more able to receive and reply to the jests of the count of crevecoeur who passed several on his alleged effeminacy and incapacity of undergoing fatigue the young scot accommodated himself so good humouredly to the counts raillery and replied at once so happily and so respectfully that the change of his tone and manner made obviously a more favourable impression on the count than he had entertained from his prisoners conduct during the preceding evening when rendered irritable by the feelings of his situation he was alternately moodily silent or fiercely argumentative the veteran soldier began at length to take notice of his young companion as a pretty fellow of whom something might be made and more than hinted to him that would he but resign his situation in the archer guard of france he would undertake to have him enrolled in the household of the duke of burgundy in an honourable condition and would himself take care of his advancement and although quentin with suitable expressions of gratitude declined this favour at present until he should find out how far he had to complain of his original patron king louis he nevertheless continued to remain on good terms with the count of crevecoeur and while his enthusiastic mode of thinking and his foreign and idiomatical manner of expressing himself often excited a smile on the grave cheek of the count that smile had lost all that it had of sarcastic and bitter and did not exceed the limits of good humour and good manners  thus travelling on with much more harmony than on the preceding day the little party came at last within two miles of the famous and strong town of peronne near which the duke of burgundys army lay encamped ready as was supposed to invade france and in opposition to which louis xi had himself assembled a strong force near saint maxence for the purpose of bringing to reason his over powerful vassal  perrone situated upon a deep river in a flat country and surrounded by strong bulwarks and profound moats was accounted in ancient as in modern times one of the strongest fortresses in france indeed though lying on an exposed and warlike frontier it was never taken by an enemy but preserved the proud name of peronne la pucelle until the duke of wellington a great destroyer of that sort of reputation took the place in the memorable advance upon paris in 1815 s the count of crevecoeur his retinue and his prisoner were approaching the fortress about the third hour after noon when riding through the pleasant glades of a large forest which then covered the approach to the town on the east side they were met by two men of rank as appeared from the number of their attendants dressed in the habits worn in time of peace and who to judge from the falcons which they carried on their wrists and the number of spaniels and greyhounds led by their followers were engaged in the amusement of hawking but on perceiving crevecoeur with whose appearance and liveries they were sufficiently intimate they quitted the search which they were making for a heron along the banks of a long canal and came galloping towards him  news news count of crevecoeur they cried both together will you give news or take news or will you barter fairly  i would barter fairly messires said crevecoeur after saluting them courteously did i conceive you had any news of importance sufficient to make an equivalent for mine  the two sportsmen smiled on each other and the elder of the two a fine baronial figure with a dark countenance marked with that sort of sadness which some physiognomists ascribe to a melancholy temperament and some as the italian statuary augured of the visage of charles i consider as predicting an unhappy death turning to his companion said crevecoeur has been in brabant the country of commerce and he has learned all its artificeshe will be too hard for us if we drive a bargain  messires said crevecoeur the duke ought in justice to have the first of my wares as the seigneur takes his toll before open market begins but tell me are your news of a sad or a pleasant complexion  the person whom he particularly addressed was a lively looking man with an eye of great vivacity which was corrected by an expression of reflection and gravity about the mouth and upper lipthe whole physiognomy marking a man who saw and judged rapidly but was sage and slow in forming resolutions or in expressing opinions this was the famous knight of hainault son of collara or nicolas de lelite known in history and amongst historians by the venerable name of philip de comines at this time close to the person of duke charles the bold and one of his most esteemed counsellors he answered crevecoeurs question concerning the complexion of the news of which he and his companion the baron dhymbercourt were the depositaries  philip de comines was described in the former editions of this work as a little man fitted rather for counsel than action this was a description made at a venture to vary the military portraits with which the age and work abound sleidan the historian upon the authority of matthieu darves who knew philip de comines and had served in his household says he was a man of tall stature and a noble presence the learned monsieur petitot intimates that philip de comines made a figure at the games of chivalry and pageants exhibited on the wedding of charles of burgundy with margaret of england in 1468 he is the first named however of a gallant band of assailants knights and noblemen to the number of twenty who with the prince of orange as their leader encountered in a general tourney with a party of the same number under the profligate adolf of cleves who acted as challenger by the romantic title of arbre dor the encounter though with arms of courtesy was very fierce and separated by main force not without difficulty philip de comines has therefore a title to be accounted tam martre quam mercurio s  dhymbercourt or imbercourt was put to death by the inhabitants of ghent with the chancellor of burgundy in the year 1477 mary of burgundy daughter of charles the bold appeared in mourning in the marketplace and with tears besought the life of her servants from her insurgent subjects but in vain s  they were he said like the colours of the rainbow various in hue as they might be viewed from different points and placed against the black cloud or the fair skysuch a rainbow was never seen in france or flanders since that of noahs ark  my tidings replied crevecoeur are altogether like the comet gloomy wild and terrible in themselves yet to be accounted the forerunners of still greater and more dreadful evils which are to ensue  we must open our bales said comines to his companion or our market will be forestalled by some newcomers for ours are public newsin one word crevecoeurlisten and wonderking louis is at peronne  what said the count in astonishment has the duke retreated without a battle and do you remain here in your dress of peace after the town is besieged by the frenchfor i cannot suppose it taken  no surely said dhymbercourt the banners of burgundy have not gone back a foot and still king louis is here  then edward of england must have come over the seas with his bowmen said crevecoeur and like his ancestors gained a second field of poictiers  not so said comines not a french banner has been borne down not a sail spread from englandwhere edward is too much amused among the wives of the citizens of london to think of playing the black prince hear the extraordinary truth you know when you left us that the conference between the commissioners on the parts of france and burgundy was broken up without apparent chance of reconciliation  true and we dreamt of nothing but war  what has followed has been indeed so like a dream said comines that i almost expect to awake and find it so only one day since the duke had in council protested so furiously against farther delay that it was resolved to send a defiance to the king and march forward instantly into france toison dor commissioned for the purpose had put on his official dress and had his foot in the stirrup to mount his horse when lo the french herald montjoie rode into our camp  we thought of nothing else than that louis had been beforehand with our defiance and began to consider how much the duke would resent the advice which had prevented him from being the first to declare war but a council being speedily assembled what was our wonder when the herald informed us that louis king of france was scarce an hours riding behind intending to visit charles duke of burgundy with a small retinue in order that their differences might be settled at a personal interview  you surprise me messires said crevecoeur yet you surprise me less than you might have expected for when i was last at plessis les tours the all trusted cardinal balue offended with his master and burgundian at heart did hint to me that he could so work upon louiss peculiar foibles as to lead him to place himself in such a position with regard to burgundy that the duke might have the terms of peace of his own making but i never suspected that so old a fox as louis could have been induced to come into the trap of his own accord what said the burgundian counsellors  as you may guess answered dhymbercourt talked much of faith to be observed and little of advantage to be obtained by such a visit while it was manifest they thought almost entirely of the last and were only anxious to find some way to reconcile it with the necessary preservation of appearances  and what said the duke continued the count of crevecoeur  spoke brief and bold as usual replied comines which of you was it he asked who witnessed the meeting of my cousin louis and me after the battle of montlhery when i was so thoughtless as to accompany him back within the intrenchments of paris with half a score of attendants and so put my person at the kings mercy i replied that most of us had been present and none could ever forget the alarm which it had been his pleasure to give us well said the duke you blamed me for my folly and i confessed to you that i had acted like a giddy pated boy and i am aware too that my father of happy memory being then alive my kinsman louis would have had less advantage by seizing on my person than i might now have by securing his but nevertheless if my royal kinsman comes hither on the present occasion in the same singleness of heart under which i then acted he shall be royally welcomeif it is meant by this appearance of confidence to circumvent and to blind me till he execute some of his politic schemes by saint george of burgundy let him to look to it and so having turned up his mustaches and stamped on the ground he ordered us all to get on our horses and receive so extraordinary a guest  after the battle of montlhery in 1465 charles had an interview with louis under the walls of paris each at the head of a small party the two princes dismounted and walked together so deeply engaged in discussing the business of their meeting that charles forgot the peculiarity of his situation and when louis turned back towards the town of paris from which he came the count of charalois kept him company so far as to pass the line of outworks with which paris was surrounded and enter a field work which communicated with the town by a trench his escort and his principal followers rode forward from where he had left them  to their great joy the count returned uninjured accompanied with a guard belonging to louis the burgundians taxed him with rashness in no measured terms say no more of it said charles i acknowledge the extent of my folly but i was not aware what i was doing till i entered the redoubt memoires de philippe de cominess  and you met the king accordingly replied the count of crevecoeur miracles have not ceasedhow was he accompanied  as slightly as might be answered dhymbercourt only a score or two of the scottish guard and a few knights and gentlemen of his household among whom his astrologer galeotti made the gayest figure  that fellow said crevecoeur holds some dependence on the cardinal baluei should not be surprised that he has had his share in determining the king to this step of doubtful policy any nobility of higher rank  there are monsieur of orleans and dunois replied comines  i will have a rouse with dunois said crevecoeur wag the world as it will but we heard that both he and the duke had fallen into disgrace and were in prison  they were both under arrest in the castle of loches that delightful place of retirement for the french nobility said dhymbercourt but louis has released them in order to bring them with himperhaps because he cared not to leave orleans behind for his other attendants faith i think his gossip the hangman marshal with two or three of his retinue and oliver his barber may be the most considerableand the whole bevy so poorly arrayed that by my honour the king resembles most an old usurer going to collect desperate debts attended by a body of catchpolls  and where is he lodged said crevecoeur  nay that replied the comines is the most marvellous of all our duke offered to let the kings archer guard have a gate of the town and a bridge of boats over the somme and to have assigned to louis himself the adjoining house belonging to a wealthy burgess giles orthen but in going thither the king espied the banners of de lau and pencil de riviere whom he had banished from france and scared as it would seem with the thought of lodging so near refugees and malcontents of his own making he craved to be quartered in the castle of peronne and there he hath his abode accordingly  why god ha mercy exclaimed crevecoeur this is not only not being content with venturing into the lions den but thrusting his head into his very jawsnothing less than the very bottom of the rat trap would serve the crafty old politician  nay said comines dhymbercourt hath not told you the speech of le glorieux the jester of charles of burgundy of whom more hereafter swhich in my mind was the shrewdest opinion that was given  and what said his most illustrious wisdom asked the count  as the duke replied comines was hastily ordering some vessels and ornaments of plate and the like to be prepared as presents for the king and his retinue by way of welcome on his arrival  trouble not thy small brain about it my friend charles said le glorieux i will give thy cousin louis a nobler and a fitter gift than thou canst and that is my cap and bells and my bauble to boot for by the mass he is a greater fool than i am for putting himself in thy power  but if i give him no reason to repent it sirrah how thou said the duke  then truly charles thou shalt have cap and bauble thyself as the greatest fool of the three of us  i promise you this knavish quip touched the duke closelyi saw him change colour and bite his lip and now our news are told noble crevecoeur and what think you they resemble  a mine full charged with gunpowder answered crevecoeur to which i fear it is my fate to bring the kindled linstock your news and mine are like flax and fire which cannot meet without bursting into flame or like certain chemical substances which cannot be mingled without an explosion friendsgentlemenride close by my rein and when i tell you what has chanced in the bishopric of liege i think you will be of opinion that king louis might as safely have undertaken a pilgrimage to the infernal regions as this ill timed visit to peronne  the two nobles drew up close on either hand of the count and listened with half suppressed exclamations and gestures of the deepest wonder and interest to his account of the transactions at liege and schonwaldt quentin was then called forward and examined and reexamined on the particulars of the bishops death until at length he refused to answer any farther interrogatories not knowing wherefore they were asked or what use might be made of his replies  they now reached the rich and level banks of the somme and the ancient walls of the little town of peronne la pucelle and the deep green meadows adjoining now whitened with the numerous tents of the duke of burgundys army amounting to about fifteen thousand men    chapter xxvi the interview       when princes meet astrologers may mark it      an ominous conjunction full of boding      like that of mars with saturn       old play   one hardly knows whether to term it a privilege or a penalty annexed to the quality of princes that in their intercourse with each other they are required by the respect which is due to their own rank and dignity to regulate their feelings and expressions by a severe etiquette which precludes all violent and avowed display of passion and which but that the whole world are aware that this assumed complaisance is a matter of ceremony might justly pass for profound dissimulation it is no less certain however that the overstepping of these bounds of ceremonial for the purpose of giving more direct vent to their angry passions has the effect of compromising their dignity with the world in general as was particularly noted when those distinguished rivals francis the first and the emperor charles gave each other the lie direct and were desirous of deciding their differences hand to hand in single combat  charles of burgundy the most hasty and impatient nay the most imprudent prince of his time found himself nevertheless fettered within the magic circle which prescribed the most profound deference to louis as his suzerain and liege lord who had deigned to confer upon him a vassal of the crown the distinguished honour of a personal visit dressed in his ducal mantle and attended by his great officers and principal knights and nobles he went in gallant cavalcade to receive louis xi his retinue absolutely blazed with gold and silver for the wealth of the court of england being exhausted by the wars of york and lancaster and the expenditure of france limited by the economy of the sovereign that of burgundy was for the time the most magnificent in europe the cortege of louis on the contrary was few in number and comparatively mean in appearance and the exterior of the king himself in a threadbare cloak with his wonted old high crowned hat stuck full of images rendered the contrast yet more striking and as the duke richly attired with the coronet and mantle of state threw himself from his noble charger and kneeling on one knee offered to hold the stirrup while louis dismounted from his little ambling palfrey the effect was almost grotesque  the greeting between the two potentates was of course as full of affected kindness and compliment as it was totally devoid of sincerity but the temper of the duke rendered it much more difficult for him to preserve the necessary appearances in voice speech and demeanour while in the king every species of simulation and dissimulation seemed so much a part of his nature that those best acquainted with him could not have distinguished what was feigned from what was real  perhaps the most accurate illustration were it not unworthy two such high potentates would be to suppose the king in the situation of a stranger perfectly acquainted with the habits and dispositions of the canine race who for some purpose of his own is desirous to make friends with a large and surly mastiff that holds him in suspicion and is disposed to worry him on the first symptoms either of diffidence or of umbrage the mastiff growls internally erects his bristles shows his teeth yet is ashamed to fly upon the intruder who seems at the same time so kind and so confiding and therefore the animal endures advances which are far from pacifying him watching at the same time the slightest opportunity which may justify him in his own eyes for seizing his friend by the throat  the king was no doubt sensible from the altered voice constrained manner and abrupt gestures of the duke that the game he had to play was delicate and perhaps he more than once repented having ever taken it in hand but repentance was too late and all that remained for him was that inimitable dexterity of management which the king understood equally at least with any man that ever lived  the demeanour which louis used towards the duke was such as to resemble the kind overflowing of the heart in a moment of sincere reconciliation with an honoured and tried friend from whom he had been estranged by temporary circumstances now passed away and forgotten as soon as removed the king blamed himself for not having sooner taken the decisive step of convincing his kind and good kinsman by such a mark of confidence as he was now bestowing that the angry passages which had occurred betwixt them were nothing in his remembrance when weighed against the kindness which received him when an exile from france and under the displeasure of the king his father he spoke of the good duke of burgundy as philip the father of duke charles was currently called and remembered a thousand instances of his paternal kindness  i think cousin he said your father made little difference in his affection betwixt you and me for i remember when by an accident i had bewildered myself in a hunting party i found the good duke upbraiding you with leaving me in the forest as if you had been careless of the safety of an elder brother  the duke of burgundys features were naturally harsh and severe and when he attempted to smile in polite acquiescence to the truth of what the king told him the grimace which he made was truly diabolical  prince of dissemblers he said in his secret soul would that it stood with my honour to remind you how you have requited all the benefits of our house  and then continued the king if the ties of consanguinity and gratitude are not sufficient to bind us together my fair cousin we have those of spiritual relationship for i am godfather to your fair daughter mary who is as dear to me as one of my own maidens and when the saints their holy name be blessed sent me a little blossom which withered in the course of three months it was your princely father who held it at the font and celebrated the ceremony of baptism with richer and prouder magnificence than paris itself could have afforded never shall i forget the deep the indelible impression which the generosity of duke philip and yours my dearest cousin made upon the half broken heart of the poor exile  your majesty said the duke compelling himself to make some reply acknowledged that slight obligation in terms which overpaid all the display which burgundy could make to show a due sense of the honour you had done its sovereign  i remember the words you mean fair cousin said the king smiling i think they were that in guerdon of the benefit of that day i poor wanderer had nothing to offer save the persons of myself of my wife and of my childwell and i think i have indifferently well redeemed my pledge  i mean not to dispute what your majesty is pleased to aver said the duke but  but you ask said the king interrupting him how my actions have accorded with my wordsmarry thus the body of my infant child joachim rests in burgundian earthmy own person i have this morning placed unreservedly in your powerand for that of my wifetruly cousin i think considering the period of time which has passed you will scarce insist on my keeping my word in that particular she was born on the day of the blessed annunciation he crossed himself and muttered an ora pro nobis intercede for us some fifty years since but she is no farther distant than rheims and if you insist on my promise being fulfilled to the letter she shall presently wait your pleasure  angry as the duke of burgundy was at the barefaced attempt of the king to assume towards him a tone of friendship and intimacy he could not help laughing at the whimsical reply of that singular monarch and his laugh was as discordant as the abrupt tones of passion in which he often spoke having laughed longer and louder than was at that period or would now be thought fitting the time and occasion he answered in the same tone bluntly declining the honour of the queens company but stating his willingness to accept that of the kings eldest daughter whose beauty was celebrated  i am happy fair cousin said the king with one of those dubious smiles of which he frequently made use that your gracious pleasure has not fixed on my younger daughter joan i should otherwise have had spear breaking between you and my cousin of orleans and had harm come of it i must on either side have lost a kind friend and affectionate cousin  nay nay my royal sovereign said duke charles the duke of orleans shall have no interruption from me in the path which he has chosen par amours the cause in which i couch my lance against orleans must be fair and straight  louis was far from taking amiss this brutal allusion to the personal deformity of the princess joan on the contrary he was rather pleased to find that the duke was content to be amused with broad jests in which he was himself a proficient and which according to the modern phrase spared much sentimental hypocrisy accordingly he speedily placed their intercourse on such a footing that charles though he felt it impossible to play the part of an affectionate and reconciled friend to a monarch whose ill offices he had so often encountered and whose sincerity on the present occasion he so strongly doubted yet had no difficulty in acting the hearty landlord towards a facetious guest and so the want of reciprocity in kinder feelings between them was supplied by the tone of good fellowship which exists between two boon companionsa tone natural to the duke from the frankness and it might be added the grossness of his character and to louis because though capable of assuming any mood of social intercourse that which really suited him best was mingled with grossness of ideas and of caustic humour and expression  both princes were happily able to preserve during the period of a banquet at the town house of peronne the same kind of conversation on which they met as on a neutral ground and which as louis easily perceived was more available than any other to keep the duke of burgundy in that state of composure which seemed necessary to his own safety  yet he was alarmed to observe that the duke had around him several of those french nobles and those of the highest rank and in situations of great trust and power whom his own severity or injustice had driven into exile and it was to secure himself from the possible effects of their resentment and revenge that as already mentioned he requested to be lodged in the castle or citadel of peronne rather than in the town itself this was readily granted by duke charles with one of those grim smiles of which it was impossible to say whether it meant good or harm to the party whom it concerned  scott quotes from the memoires of de comines as follows these nobles inspired louis with so much suspicion that he demanded to be lodged in the old castle of peronne and thus rendered himself an absolute captive  but when the king expressing himself with as much delicacy as he could and in the manner he thought best qualified to lull suspicion asleep asked whether the scottish archers of his guard might not maintain the custody of the castle of peronne during his residence there in lieu of the gate of the town which the duke had offered to their care charles replied with his wonted sternness of voice and abruptness of manner rendered more alarming by his habit when he spoke of either turning up his mustaches or handling his sword or dagger the last of which he used frequently to draw a little way and then return to the sheath this gesture very indicative of a fierce character is also by stage tradition a distinction of shakespeares richard iii s  saint martin no my liege you are in your vassals camp and cityso men call me in respect to your majestymy castle and town are yours and my men are yours so it is indifferent whether my men at arms or the scottish archers guard either the outer gate or defences of the castleno by saint george peronne is a virgin fortressshe shall not lose her reputation by any neglect of mine maidens must be carefully watched my royal cousin if we would have them continue to live in good fame  surely fair cousin and i altogether agree with you said the king i being in fact more interested in the reputation of the good little town than you areperonne being as you know fair cousin one of those upon the same river somme which pledged to your father of happy memory for redemption of money are liable to be redeemed upon repayment and to speak truth coming like an honest debtor disposed to clear off my obligations of every kind i have brought here a few sumpter mules loaded with silver for the redemptionenough to maintain even your princely and royal establishment fair cousin for the space of three years  i will not receive a penny of it said the duke twirling his mustachesthe day of redemption is past my royal cousin nor were there ever serious purpose that the right should be exercised the cession of these towns being the sole recompense my father ever received from france when in a happy hour for your family he consented to forget the murder of my grandfather and to exchange the alliance of england for that of your father saint george if he had not so acted your royal self far from having towns in the somme could scarce have kept those beyond the loire noi will not render a stone of them were i to receive for every stone so rendered its weight in gold i thank god and the wisdom and valour of my ancestors that the revenues of burgundy though it be a duchy will maintain my state even when a king is my guest without obliging me to barter my heritage  well fair cousin answered the king with the same mild and placid manner as before and unperturbed by the loud tone and violent gestures of the duke i see that you are so good a friend to france that you are unwilling to part with aught that belongs to her but we shall need some moderator in those affairs when we come to treat of them in councilwhat say you to saint paul  neither saint paul nor saint peter nor eer a saint in the calendar said the duke of burgundy shall preach me out of the possession of peronne  nay but you mistake me said king louis smiling i mean louis de luxembourg our trusty constable the count of saint paulah saint mary of embrun we lack but his head at our conference the best head in france and the most useful to the restoration of perfect harmony betwixt us  by saint george of burgundy said the duke i marvel to hear your majesty talk thus of a man false and perjured both to france and burgundyone who hath ever endeavoured to fan into a flame our frequent differences and that with the purpose of giving himself the airs of a mediator i swear by the order i wear that his marshes shall not be long a resource for him  be not so warm cousin said the king smiling and speaking under his breath when i wished for the head constable as a means of ending the settlement of our trifling differences i had no desire for his body which might remain at saint quentins with much convenience  ho ho i take your meaning my royal cousin said charles with the same dissonant laugh which some other of the kings coarse pleasantries had extorted and added stamping his heel on the ground i allow in that sense the head of the constable might be useful at peronne  these and other discourses by which the king mixed hints at serious affairs amid matters of mirth and amusement did not follow each other consecutively but were adroitly introduced during the time of the banquet at the hotel de ville during a subsequent interview in the dukes own apartments and in short as occasion seemed to render the introduction of such delicate subjects easy and natural  indeed however rashly louis had placed himself in a risk which the dukes fiery temper and the mutual subjects of exasperated enmity which subsisted betwixt them rendered of doubtful and perilous issue never pilot on an unknown coast conducted himself with more firmness and prudence he seemed to sound with the utmost address and precision the depths and shallows of his rivals mind and temper and manifested neither doubt nor fear when the result of his experiments discovered much more of sunken rocks and of dangerous shoals than of safe anchorage  at length a day closed which must have been a wearisome one to louis from the constant exertion vigilance precaution and attention which his situation required as it was a day of constraint to the duke from the necessity of suppressing the violent feelings to which he was in the general habit of giving uncontrolled vent  no sooner had the latter retired into his own apartment after he had taken a formal leave of the king for the night than he gave way to the explosion of passion which he had so long suppressed and many an oath and abusive epithet as his jester le glorieux said fell that night upon heads which they were never coined for his domestics reaping the benefit of that hoard of injurious language which he could not in decency bestow on his royal guest even in his absence and which was yet become too great to be altogether suppressed the jests of the clown had some effect in tranquillizing the dukes angry moodhe laughed loudly threw the jester a piece of gold caused himself to be disrobed in tranquillity swallowed a deep cup of wine and spices went to bed and slept soundly  the couchee of king louis is more worthy of notice than that of charles for the violent expression of exasperated and headlong passion as indeed it belongs more to the brutal than the intelligent part of our nature has little to interest us in comparison to the deep workings of a vigorous and powerful mind  louis was escorted to the lodgings he had chosen in the castle or citadel of peronne by the chamberlains and harbingers of the duke of burgundy and received at the entrance by a strong guard of archers and men at arms  as he descended from his horse to cross the drawbridge over a moat of unusual width and depth he looked on the sentinels and observed to comines who accompanied him with other burgundian nobles they wear saint andrews crossesbut not those of my scottish archers  you will find them as ready to die in your defence sire said the burgundian whose sagacious ear had detected in the kings tone of speech a feeling which doubtless louis would have concealed if he could they wear the saint andrews cross as the appendage of the collar of the golden fleece my master the duke of burgundys order  do i not know it said louis showing the collar which he himself wore in compliment to his host it is one of the dear bonds of fraternity which exist between my kind brother and myself we are brothers in chivalry as in spiritual relationship cousins by birth and friends by every tie of kind feeling and good neighbourhoodno farther than the base court my noble lords and gentlemen i can permit your attendance no fartheryou have done me enough of grace  we were charged by the duke said dhymbercourt to bring your majesty to your lodgingwe trust your majesty will permit us to obey our masters command  in this small matter said the king i trust you will allow my command to outweigh his even with you his liege subjectsi am something indisposed my lordssomething fatigued great pleasure hath its toils as well as great pain i trust to enjoy your society better tomorrowand yours too seignior philip of cominesi am told you are the annalist of the timewe that desire to have a name in history must speak you fair for men say your pen hath a sharp point when you willgoodnight my lords and gentles to all and each of you  the lords of burgundy retired much pleased with the grace of louiss manner and the artful distribution of his attentions and the king was left with only one or two of his own personal followers under the archway of the base court of the castle of peronne looking on the huge tower which occupied one of the angles being in fact the donjon or principal keep of the palace this tall dark massive building was seen clearly by the same moon which was lighting quentin durward betwixt charleroi and peronne which as the reader is aware shone with peculiar lustre the great keep was in form nearly resembling the white tower in the citadel of london but still more ancient in its architecture deriving its date as was affirmed from the days of charlemagne the walls were of a tremendous thickness the windows very small and grated with bars of iron and the huge clumsy bulk of the building cast a dark and portentous shadow over the whole of the courtyard  i am not to be lodged there the king said with a shudder that had something in it ominous  no replied the gray headed seneschal who attended upon him unbonneted god forbidyour majestys apartments are prepared in these lower buildings which are hard by and in which king john slept two nights before the battle of poitiers  humthat is no lucky omen neither muttered the king but what of the tower my old friend and why should you desire of heaven that i may not be there lodged  nay my gracious liege said the seneschal i know no evil of the tower at all only that the sentinels say lights are seen and strange noises heard in it at night and there are reasons why that may be the case for anciently it was used as a state prison and there are many tales of deeds which have been done in it  louis asked no further questions for no man was more bound than he to respect the secrets of a prison house at the door of the apartments destined for his use which though of later date than the tower were still both ancient and gloomy stood a small party of the scottish guard which the duke although he declined to concede the point to louis had ordered to be introduced so as to be near the person of their master the faithful lord crawford was at their head  crawfordmy honest and faithful crawford said the king where hast thou been todayare the lords of burgundy so inhospitable as to neglect one of the bravest and most noble gentlemen that ever trode a courti saw you not at the banquet  i declined it my liege said crawford times are changed with me the day has been that i could have ventured a carouse with the best man in burgundy and that in the juice of his own grape but a matter of four pints now flusters me and i think it concerns your majestys service to set in this an example to my gallants  thou art ever prudent said the king but surely your toil is the less when you have so few men to commandand a time of festivity requires not so severe self denial on your part as a time of danger  if i have few men to command said crawford i have the more need to keep the knaves in fitting condition and whether this business be like to end in feasting or fighting god and your majesty know better than old john of crawford  you surely do not apprehend any danger said the king hastily yet in a whisper  not i answered crawford i wish i did for as old earl tineman an earl of douglas so called s used to say apprehended dangers may be always defended dangersthe word for the night if your majesty pleases  let it be burgundy in honour of our host and of a liquor that you love crawford  i will quarrel with neither duke nor drink so called said crawford provided always that both be sound a good night to your majesty  a good night my trusty scot said the king and passed on to his apartments  at the door of his bedroom le balafre was placed sentinel follow me hither said the king as he passed him and the archer accordingly like a piece of machinery put into motion by an artist strode after him into the apartment and remained there fixed silent and motionless attending the royal command  have you heard from that wandering paladin your nephew said the king for he hath been lost to us since like a young knight who had set out upon his first adventures he sent us home two prisoners as the first fruits of his chivalry  my lord i heard something of that said balafre and i hope your majesty will believe that if he acted wrongfully it was in no shape by any precept or example since i never was so bold as to unhorse any of your majestys most illustrious house better knowing my own condition and  be silent on that point said the king your nephew did his duty in the matter  there indeed continued balafre he had the cue from mequentin said i to him whatever comes of it remember you belong to the scottish archer guard and do your duty whatever comes ont  i guess he had some such exquisite instructor said louis but it concerns me that you answer me my first questionhave you heard of your nephew of latestand aback my masters he added addressing the gentlemen of his chamber for this concerneth no ears but mine  surely please your majesty said balafre i have seen this very evening the groom charlot whom my kinsman dispatched from liege or some castle of the bishops which is near it and where he hath lodged the ladies of croye in safety  now our lady of heaven be praised for it said the king art thou sure of itsure of the good news  as sure as i can be of aught said le balafre the fellow i think hath letters for your majesty from the ladies of croye  haste to get them said the king give the harquebuss to one of these knavesto oliverto any one now our lady of embrun be praised and silver shall be the screen that surrounds her high altar  louis in this fit of gratitude and devotion doffed as usual his hat selected from the figures with which it was garnished that which represented his favourite image of the virgin placed it on a table and kneeling down repeated reverently the vow he had made  the groom being the first messenger whom durward had despatched from schonwaldt was now introduced with his letters they were addressed to the king by the ladies of croye and barely thanked him in very cold terms for his courtesy while at his court and something more warmly for having permitted them to retire and sent them in safety from his dominions expressions at which louis laughed very heartily instead of resenting them he then demanded of charlot with obvious interest whether they had not sustained some alarm or attack upon the road charlot a stupid fellow and selected for that quality gave a very confused account of the affray in which his companion the gascon had been killed but knew of no other again louis demanded of him minutely and particularly the route which the party had taken to liege and seemed much interested when he was informed in reply that they had upon approaching namur kept the more direct road to liege upon the right bank of the maes instead of the left bank as recommended in their route the king then ordered the man a small present and dismissed him disguising the anxiety he had expressed as if it only concerned the safety of the ladies of croye  yet the news though they implied the failure of one of his own favourite plans seemed to imply more internal satisfaction on the kings part than he would have probably indicated in a case of brilliant success he sighed like one whose breast has been relieved from a heavy burden muttered his devotional acknowledgments with an air of deep sanctity raised up his eyes and hastened to adjust newer and surer schemes of ambition  with such purpose louis ordered the attendance of his astrologer martius galeotti who appeared with his usual air of assumed dignity yet not without a shade of uncertainty on his brow as if he had doubted the kings kind reception it was however favourable even beyond the warmest which he had ever met with at any former interview louis termed him his friend his father in the sciencesthe glass by which a king should look into distant futurityand concluded by thrusting on his finger a ring of very considerable value galeotti not aware of the circumstances which had thus suddenly raised his character in the estimation of louis yet understood his own profession too well to let that ignorance be seen he received with grave modesty the praises of louis which he contended were only due to the nobleness of the science which he practised a science the rather the more deserving of admiration on account of its working miracles through means of so feeble an agent as himself and he and the king took leave for once much satisfied with each other  on the astrologers departure louis threw himself into a chair and appearing much exhausted dismissed the rest of his attendants excepting oliver alone who creeping around with gentle assiduity and noiseless step assisted him in the task of preparing for repose  while he received this assistance the king unlike to his wont was so silent and passive that his attendant was struck by the unusual change in his deportment the worst minds have often something of good principle in thembanditti show fidelity to their captain and sometimes a protected and promoted favourite has felt a gleam of sincere interest in the monarch to whom he owed his greatness oliver le diable le mauvais or by whatever other name he was called expressive of his evil propensities was nevertheless scarcely so completely identified with satan as not to feel some touch of grateful feeling for his master in this singular condition when as it seemed his fate was deeply interested and his strength seemed to be exhausted after for a short time rendering to the king in silence the usual services paid by a servant to his master at the toilette the attendant was at length tempted to say with the freedom which his sovereigns indulgence had permitted him in such circumstances tete dieu sire you seem as if you had lost a battle and yet i who was near your majesty during this whole day never knew you fight a field so gallantly  a field said king louis looking up and assuming his wonted causticity of tone and manner pasques dieu my friend oliver say i have kept the arena in a bullfight for a blinder and more stubborn untameable uncontrollable brute than our cousin of burgundy never existed save in the shape of a murcian bull trained for the bull feastswell let it passi dodged him bravely but oliver rejoice with me that my plans in flanders have not taken effect whether as concerning those two rambling princesses of croye or in liegeyou understand me  in faith i do not sire replied oliver it is impossible for me to congratulate your majesty on the failure of your favourite schemes unless you tell me some reason for the change in your own wishes and views  nay answered the king there is no change in either in a general view but pasques dieu my friend i have this day learned more of duke charles than i before knew when he was count de charalois in the time of the old duke philip and the banished dauphin of france we drank and hunted and rambled togetherand many a wild adventure we have had and in those days i had a decided advantage over himlike that which a strong spirit naturally assumes over a weak one but he has since changedhas become a dogged daring assuming disputatious dogmatist who nourishes an obvious wish to drive matters to extremities while he thinks he has the game in his own hands i was compelled to glide as gently away from each offensive topic as if i touched red hot iron i did but hint at the possibility of those erratic countesses of croye ere they attained liege for thither i frankly confessed that to the best of my belief they were gone falling into the hands of some wild snapper upon the frontiers and pasques dieu you would have thought i had spoken of sacrilege it is needless to tell you what he said and quite enough to say that i would have held my heads safety very insecure if in that moment accounts had been brought of the success of thy friend william with the beard in his and thy honest scheme of bettering himself by marriage  no friend of mine if it please your majesty said oliver neither friend nor plan of mine  true oliver answered the king thy plan had not been to wed but to shave such a bridegroom well thou didst wish her as bad a one when thou didst modestly hint at thyself however oliver lucky the man who has her not for hang draw and quarter were the most gentle words which my gentle cousin spoke of him who should wed the young countess his vassal without his most ducal permission  and he is doubtless as jealous of any disturbances in the good town of liege asked the favourite  as much or much more replied the king as your understanding may easily anticipate but ever since i resolved on coming hither my messengers have been in liege to repress for the present every movement to insurrection and my very busy and bustling friends rousalaer and pavillon have orders to be quiet as a mouse until this happy meeting between my cousin and me is over  judging then from your majestys account said oliver dryly the utmost to be hoped from this meeting is that it should not make your condition worsesurely this is like the crane that thrust her head into the foxs mouth and was glad to thank her good fortune that it was not bitten off yet your majesty seemed deeply obliged even now to the sage philosopher who encouraged you to play so hopeful a game  no game said the king sharply is to be despaired of until it is lost and that i have no reason to expect it will be in my own case on the contrary if nothing occurs to stir the rage of this vindictive madman i am sure of victory and surely i am not a little obliged to the skill which selected for my agent as the conductor of the ladies of croye a youth whose horoscope so far corresponded with mine that he hath saved me from danger even by the disobedience of my own commands and taking the route which avoided de la marcks ambuscade  your majesty said oliver may find many agents who will serve you on the terms of acting rather after their own pleasure than your instructions  nay nay oliver said louis impatiently the heathen poet speaks of vota diis exaudita maligniswishes that is which the saints grant to us in their wrath and such in the circumstances would have been the success of william de la marcks exploit had it taken place about this time and while i am in the power of this duke of burgundyand this my own art foresawfortified by that of galeottithat is i foresaw not the miscarriage of de la marcks undertaking but i foresaw that the expedition of yonder scottish archer should end happily for meand such has been the issue though in a manner different from what i expected for the stars though they foretell general results are yet silent on the means by which such are accomplished being often the very reverse of what we expect or even desirebut why talk i of these mysteries to thee oliver who art in so far worse than the very devil who is thy namesake since he believes and trembles whereas thou art an infidel both to religion and to science and wilt remain so till thine own destiny is accomplished which as thy horoscope and physiognomy alike assure me will be by the intervention of the gallows  and if it indeed shall be so said oliver in a resigned tone of voice it will be so ordered because i was too grateful a servant to hesitate at executing the commands of my royal master  louis burst into his usual sardonic laughthou hast broke thy lance on me fairly oliver and by our lady thou art right for i defied thee to it but prithee tell me in sadness dost thou discover anything in these measures towards us which may argue any suspicion of ill usage  my liege replied oliver your majesty and yonder learned philosopher look for augury to the stars and heavenly hosti am an earthly reptile and consider but the things connected with my vocation but methinks there is a lack of that earnest and precise attention on your majesty which men show to a welcome guest of a degree so far above them the duke tonight pleaded weariness and saw your majesty not farther than to the street leaving to the officers of his household the task of conveying you to your lodgings the rooms here are hastily and carelessly fitted upthe tapestry is hung up awryand in one of the pieces as you may observe the figures are reversed and stand on their heads while the trees grow with their roots uppermost  pshaw accident and the effect of hurry said the king when did you ever know me concerned about such trifles as these  not on their own account are they worth notice said oliver but as intimating the degree of esteem in which the officers of the dukes household observe your grace to be held by him believe me that had his desire seemed sincere that your reception should be in all points marked by scrupulous attention the zeal of his people would have made minutes do the work of daysand when he added pointing to the basin and ewer was the furniture of your majestys toilette of other substance than silver  nay said the king with a constrained smile that last remark upon the shaving utensils oliver is too much in the style of thine own peculiar occupation to be combated by any onetrue it is that when i was only a refugee and an exile i was served upon gold plate by order of the same charles who accounted silver too mean for the dauphin though he seems to hold that metal too rich for the king of france well oliver we will to bedour resolution has been made and executed there is nothing to be done but to play manfully the game on which we have entered i know that my cousin of burgundy like other wild bulls shuts his eyes when he begins his career i have but to watch that moment like one of the tauridors spanish bull fighters whom we saw at burgos and his impetuosity places him at my mercy    chapter xxvii the explosion       t is listening fear and dumb amazement all      when to the startled eye the sudden glance      appears far south eruptive through the cloud       thomsons summer   the preceding chapter agreeably to its title was designed as a retrospect which might enable the render fully to understand the terms upon which the king of france and the duke of burgundy stood together when the former moved partly perhaps by his belief in astrology which was represented as favourable to the issue of such a measure and in a great measure doubtless by the conscious superiority of his own powers of mind over those of charles had adopted the extraordinary and upon any other ground altogether inexplicable resolution of committing his person to the faith of a fierce and exasperated enemya resolution also the more rash and unaccountable as there were various examples in that stormy time to show that safe conducts however solemnly plighted had proved no assurance for those in whose favour they were conceived and indeed the murder of the dukes grandfather at the bridge of montereau in presence of the father of louis and at an interview solemnly agreed upon for the establishment of peace and amnesty was a horrible precedent should the duke be disposed to resort to it  but the temper of charles though rough fierce headlong and unyielding was not unless in the full tide of passion faithless or ungenerous faults which usually belong to colder dispositions he was at no pains to show the king more courtesy than the laws of hospitality positively demanded but on the other hand he evinced no purpose of overleaping their sacred barriers  on the following morning after the kings arrival there was a general muster of the troops of the duke of burgundy which were so numerous and so excellently appointed that perhaps he was not sorry to have an opportunity of displaying them before his great rival indeed while he paid the necessary compliment of a vassal to his suzerain in declaring that these troops were the kings and not his own the curl of his upper lip and the proud glance of his eye intimated his consciousness that the words he used were but empty compliment and that his fine army at his own unlimited disposal was as ready to march against paris as in any other direction it must have added to louiss mortification that he recognised as forming part of this host many banners of french nobility not only of normandy and bretagne but of provinces more immediately subjected to his own authority who from various causes of discontent had joined and made common cause with the duke of burgundy  true to his character however louis seemed to take little notice of these malcontents while in fact he was revolving in his mind the various means by which it might be possible to detach them from the banners of burgundy and bring them back to his own and resolved for that purpose that he would cause those to whom he attached the greatest importance to be secretly sounded by oliver and other agents  he himself laboured diligently but at the same time cautiously to make interest with the dukes chief officers and advisers employing for that purpose the usual means of familiar and frequent notice adroit flattery and liberal presents not as he represented to alienate their faithful services from their noble master but that they might lend their aid in preserving peace betwixt france and burgundyan end so excellent in itself and so obviously tending to the welfare of both countries and of the reigning princes of either  the notice of so great and so wise a king was in itself a mighty bribe promises did much and direct gifts which the customs of the time permitted the burgundian courtiers to accept without scruple did still more during a boar hunt in the forest while the duke eager always upon the immediate object whether business or pleasure gave himself entirely up to the ardour of the chase louis unrestrained by his presence sought and found the means of speaking secretly and separately to many of those who were reported to have most interest with charles among whom dhymbercourt and comines were not forgotten nor did he fail to mix up the advances which he made towards those two distinguished persons with praises of the valour and military skill of the first and of the profound sagacity and literary talents of the future historian of the period  such an opportunity of personally conciliating or if the reader pleases corrupting the ministers of charles was perhaps what the king had proposed to himself as a principal object of his visit even if his art should fail to cajole the duke himself the connection betwixt france and burgundy was so close that most of the nobles belonging to the latter country had hopes or actual interests connected with the former which the favour of louis could advance or his personal displeasure destroy formed for this and every other species of intrigue liberal to profusion when it was necessary to advance his plans and skilful in putting the most plausible colour upon his proposals and presents the king contrived to reconcile the spirit of the proud to their profit and to hold out to the real or pretended patriot the good of both france and burgundy as the ostensible motive whilst the partys own private interest like the concealed wheel of some machine worked not the less powerfully that its operations were kept out of sight for each man he had a suitable bait and a proper mode of presenting it he poured the guerdon into the sleeve of those who were too proud to extend their hand and trusted that his bounty thought it descended like the dew without noise and imperceptibly would not fail to produce in due season a plentiful crop of goodwill at least perhaps of good offices to the donor in fine although he had been long paving the way by his ministers for an establishment of such an interest in the court of burgundy as should be advantageous to the interests of france louiss own personal exertions directed doubtless by the information of which he was previously possessed did more to accomplish that object in a few hours than his agents had effected in years of negotiation  one man alone the king missed whom he had been particularly desirous of conciliating and that was the count de crevecoeur whose firmness during his conduct as envoy at plessis far from exciting louiss resentment had been viewed as a reason for making him his own if possible he was not particularly gratified when he learnt that the count at the head of an hundred lances was gone towards the frontiers of brabant to assist the bishop in case of necessity against william de la marck and his discontented subjects but he consoled himself that the appearance of this force joined with the directions which he had sent by faithful messengers would serve to prevent any premature disturbances in that country the breaking out of which might he foresaw render his present situation very precarious  the court upon this occasion dined in the forest when the hour of noon arrived as was common in those great hunting parties an arrangement at this time particularly agreeable to the duke desirous as he was to abridge that ceremonious and deferential solemnity with which he was otherwise under the necessity of receiving king louis in fact the kings knowledge of human nature had in one particular misled him on this remarkable occasion he thought that the duke would have been inexpressibly flattered to have received such a mark of condescension and confidence from his liege lord but he forgot that the dependence of this dukedom upon the crown of france was privately the subject of galling mortification to a prince so powerful so wealthy and so proud as charles whose aim it certainly was to establish an independent kingdom the presence of the king at the court of the duke of burgundy imposed on that prince the necessity of exhibiting himself in the subordinate character of a vassal and of discharging many rites of feudal observance and deference which to one of his haughty disposition resembled derogation from the character of a sovereign prince which on all occasions he affected as far as possible to sustain  but although it was possible to avoid much ceremony by having the dinner upon the green turf with sound of bugles broaching of barrels and all the freedom of a sylvan meal it was necessary that the evening repast should even for that very reason be held with more than usual solemnity  previous orders for this purpose had been given and upon returning to peronne king louis found a banquet prepared with such a profusion of splendour and magnificence as became the wealth of his formidable vassal possessed as he was of almost all the low countries then the richest portion of europe at the head of the long board which groaned under plate of gold and silver filled to profusion with the most exquisite dainties sat the duke and on his right hand upon a seat more elevated than his own was placed his royal guest behind him stood on one side the son of the duke of gueldres who officiated as his grand carveron the other le glorieux his jester without whom he seldom stirred for like most men of his hasty and coarse character charles carried to extremity the general taste of that age for court fools and jestersexperiencing that pleasure in their display of eccentricity and mental infirmity which his more acute but not more benevolent rival loved better to extract from marking the imperfections of humanity in its nobler specimens and finding subject for mirth in the fears of the brave and follies of the wise and indeed if the anecdote related by brantome be true that a court fool having overheard louis in one of his agonies of repentant devotion confess his accession to the poisoning of his brother henry count of guyenne divulged it next day at dinner before the assembled court that monarch might be supposed rather more than satisfied with the pleasantries of professed jesters for the rest of his life  but on the present occasion louis neglected not to take notice of the favourite buffoon of the duke and to applaud his repartees which he did the rather that he thought he saw that the folly of le glorieux however grossly it was sometimes displayed covered more than the usual quantity of shrewd and caustic observation proper to his class  in fact tiel wetzweiler called le glorieux was by no means a jester of the common stamp he was a tall fine looking man excellent at many exercises which seemed scarce reconcilable with mental imbecility because it must have required patience and attention to attain them he usually followed the duke to the chase and to the fight and at montlhery when charles was in considerable personal danger wounded in the throat and likely to be made prisoner by a french knight who had hold of his horses rein tiel wetzweiler charged the assailant so forcibly as to overthrow him and disengage his master perhaps he was afraid of this being thought too serious a service for a person of his condition and that it might excite him enemies among those knights and nobles who had left the care of their masters person to the court fool at any rate he chose rather to be laughed at than praised for his achievement and made such gasconading boasts of his exploits in the battle that most men thought the rescue of charles was as ideal as the rest of his tale and it was on this occasion he acquired the title of le glorieux or the boastful by which he was ever afterwards distinguished  le glorieux was dressed very richly but with little of the usual distinction of his profession and that little rather of a symbolical than a very literal character his head was not shorn on the contrary he wore a profusion of long curled hair which descended from under his cap and joining with a well arranged and handsomely trimmed beard set off features which but for a wild lightness of eye might have been termed handsome a ridge of scarlet velvet carried across the top of his cap indicated rather than positively represented the professional cocks comb which distinguished the head gear of a fool in right of office his bauble made of ebony was crested as usual with a fools head with asss ears formed of silver but so small and so minutely carved that till very closely examined it might have passed for an official baton of a more solemn character these were the only badges of his office which his dress exhibited in other respects it was such as to match with that of the most courtly nobles his bonnet displayed a medal of gold he wore a chain of the same metal around his neck and the fashion of his rich garments was not much more fantastic than those of young gallants who have their clothes made in the extremity of the existing fashion  to this personage charles and louis in imitation of his host often addressed themselves during the entertainment and both seemed to manifest by hearty laughter their amusement at the answers of le glorieux  whose seats be those that are vacant said charles to the jester  one of those at least should be mine by right of succession charles replied le glorieux  why so knave said charles  because they belong to the sieur dhymbercourt and de comines who are gone so far to fly their falcons that they have forgot their supper they who would rather look at a kite on the wing than a pheasant on the board are of kin to the fool and he should succeed to the stools as a part of their movable estate  that is but a stale jest my friend tiel said the duke but fools or wise men here come the defaulters  as he spoke comines and dhymbercourt entered the room and after having made their reverence to the two princes assumed in silence the seats which were left vacant for them  what ho sirs exclaimed the duke addressing them your sport has been either very good or very bad to lead you so far and so late sir philip de comines you are dejectedhath dhymbercourt won so heavy a wager on youyou are a philosopher and should not grieve at bad fortuneby saint george dhymbercourt looks as sad as thou dosthow now sirs have you found no game or have you lost your falcons or has a witch crossed your way or has the wild huntsman the famous apparition sometimes called le grand veneur sully gives some account of this hunting spectre s met you in the forest by my honour you seem as if you were come to a funeral not a festival  while the duke spoke the eyes of the company were all directed towards dhymbercourt and de comines and the embarrassment and dejection of their countenances neither being of that class of persons to whom such expression of anxious melancholy was natural became so remarkable that the mirth and laughter of the company which the rapid circulation of goblets of excellent wine had raised to a considerable height was gradually hushed and without being able to assign any reason for such a change in their spirits men spoke in whispers to each other as on the eve of expecting some strange and important tidings  what means this silence messires said the duke elevating his voice which was naturally harsh if you bring these strange looks and this stranger silence into festivity we shall wish you had abode in the marshes seeking for herons or rather for woodcocks and howlets  my gracious lord said de comines as we were about to return hither from the forest we met the count of crevecoeur  how said the duke already returned from brabantbut he found all well there doubtless  the count himself will presently give your grace an account of his news said dhymbercourt which we have heard but imperfectly  body of me where is the count said the duke  he changes his dress to wait upon your highness answered dhymbercourt  his dress saint bleu exclaimed the impatient prince what care i for his dress i think you have conspired with him to drive me mad  or rather to be plain said de comines he wishes to communicate these news at a private audience  teste dieu my lord king said charles this is ever the way our counsellors serve usif they have got hold of aught which they consider as important for our ear they look as grave upon the matter and are as proud of their burden as an ass of a new pack saddlesome one bid crevecoeur come to us directlyhe comes from the frontiers of liege and we at least he laid some emphasis on the pronoun have no secrets in that quarter which we would shun to have proclaimed before the assembled world  all perceived that the duke had drunk so much wine as to increase the native obstinacy of his disposition and though many would willingly have suggested that the present was neither a time for hearing news nor for taking counsel yet all knew the impetuosity of his temper too well to venture on farther interference and sat in anxious expectation of the tidings which the count might have to communicate  a brief interval intervened during which the duke remained looking eagerly to the door as if in a transport of impatience whilst the guests sat with their eyes bent on the table as if to conceal their curiosity and anxiety louis alone maintaining perfect composure continued his conversation alternately with the grand carver and with the jester  at length crevecoeur entered and was presently saluted by the hurried question of his master what news from liege and brabant sir countthe report of your arrival has chased mirth from our tablewe hope your actual presence will bring it back to us  my liege and master answered the count in a firm but melancholy tone the news which i bring you are fitter for the council board than the feasting table  out with them man if they were tidings from antichrist said the duke but i can guess themthe liegeois are again in mutiny  they are my lord said crevecoeur very gravely  look there said the duke i have hit at once on what you had been so much afraid to mention to me the hare brained burghers are again in arms it could not be in better time for we may at present have the advice of our own suzerain bowing to king louis with eyes which spoke the most bitter though suppressed resentment to teach us how such mutineers should be dealt withhast thou more news in thy packet out with them and then answer for yourself why you went not forward to assist the bishop  my lord the farther tidings are heavy for me to tell and will be afflicting to you to hearno aid of mine or of living chivalry could have availed the excellent prelate william de la marck united with the insurgent liegeois has taken his castle of schonwaldt and murdered him in his own hall  murdered him repeated the duke in a deep and low tone which nevertheless was heard from the one end of the hall in which they were assembled to the other thou hast been imposed upon crevecoeur by some wild reportit is impossible  alas my lord said the count i have it from an eyewitness an archer of the king of frances scottish guard who was in the hall when the murder was committed by william de la marcks order  and who was doubtless aiding and abetting in the horrible sacrilege said the duke starting up and stamping with his foot with such fury that he dashed in pieces the footstool which was placed before him bar the doors of this hall gentlemensecure the windowslet no stranger stir from his seat upon pain of instant deathgentlemen of my chamber draw your swords  and turning upon louis he advanced his own hand slowly and deliberately to the hilt of his weapon while the king without either showing fear or assuming a defensive posture only saidthese news fair cousin have staggered your reason  no replied the duke in a terrible tone but they have awakened a just resentment which i have too long suffered to be stifled by trivial considerations of circumstance and place murderer of thy brotherrebel against thy parenttyrant over thy subjectstreacherous allyperjured kingdishonoured gentlemanthou art in my power and i thank god for it  rather thank my folly said the king for when we met on equal terms at montlhery methinks you wished yourself farther from me than we are now  the duke still held his hand on the hilt of his sword but refrained to draw his weapon or to strike a foe who offered no sort of resistance which could in any wise provoke violence  meanwhile wild and general confusion spread itself through the hall the doors were now fastened and guarded by order of the duke but several of the french nobles few as they were in number started from their seats and prepared for the defence of their sovereign louis had spoken not a word either to orleans or dunois since they were liberated from restraint at the castle of loches if it could be termed liberation to be dragged in king louiss train objects of suspicion evidently rather than of respect and regard but nevertheless the voice of dunois was first heard above the tumult addressing himself to the duke of burgundy  sir duke you have forgotten that you are a vassal of france and that we your guests are frenchmen if you lift a hand against our monarch prepare to sustain the utmost effects of our despair for credit me we shall feast as high with the blood of burgundy as we have done with its winecourage my lord of orleansand you gentlemen of france form yourselves round dunois and do as he does  it was in that moment when a king might see upon what tempers he could certainly rely the few independent nobles and knights who attended louis most of whom had only received from him frowns or discountenance unappalled by the display of infinitely superior force and the certainty of destruction in case they came to blows hastened to array themselves around dunois and led by him to press towards the head of the table where the contending princes were seated  on the contrary the tools and agents whom louis had dragged forward out of their fitting and natural places into importance which was not due to them showed cowardice and cold heart and remaining still in their seats seemed resolved not to provoke their fate by intermeddling whatever might become of their benefactor  the first of the more generous party was the venerable lord crawford who with an agility which no one would have expected at his years forced his way through all opposition which was the less violent as many of the burgundians either from a point of honour or a secret inclination to prevent louiss impending fate gave way to him and threw himself boldly between the king and the duke he then placed his bonnet from which his white hair escaped in dishevelled tresses upon one side of his headhis pale cheek and withered brow coloured and his aged eye lightened with all the fire of a gallant who is about to dare some desperate action his cloak was flung over one shoulder and his action intimated his readiness to wrap it about his left arm while he unsheathed his sword with his right  i have fought for his father and his grandsire that was all he said and by saint andrew end the matter as it will i will not fail him at this pinch  what has taken some time to narrate happened in fact with the speed of light for so soon as the duke assumed his threatening posture crawford had thrown himself betwixt him and the object of his vengeance and the french gentlemen drawing together as fast as they could were crowding to the same point  the duke of burgundy still remained with his hand on his sword and seemed in the act of giving the signal for a general onset which must necessarily have ended in the massacre of the weaker party when crevecoeur rushed forward and exclaimed in a voice like a trumpet my liege lord of burgundy beware what you do this is your hallyou are the kings vassaldo not spill the blood of your guest on your hearth the blood of your sovereign on the throne you have erected for him and to which he came under your safeguard for the sake of your houses honour do not attempt to revenge one horrid murder by another yet worse  out of my road crevecoeur answered the duke and let my vengeance passout of my path the wrath of kings is to be dreaded like that of heaven  only when like that of heaven it is just answered crevecoeur firmly let me pray of you my lord to rein the violence of your temper however justly offendedand for you my lords of france where resistance is unavailing let me recommend you to forbear whatever may lead towards bloodshed  he is right said louis whose coolness forsook him not in that dreadful moment and who easily foresaw that if a brawl should commence more violence would be dared and done in the heat of blood than was likely to be attempted if peace were preserved  my cousin orleanskind dunoisand you my trusty crawfordbring not on ruin and bloodshed by taking offence too hastily our cousin the duke is chafed at the tidings of the death of a near and loving friend the venerable bishop of liege whose slaughter we lament as he does ancient and unhappily recent subjects of jealousy lead him to suspect us of having abetted a crime which our bosom abhors should our host murder us on this spotus his king and his kinsman under a false impression of our being accessory to this unhappy accident our fate will be little lightened but on the contrary greatly aggravated by your stirringtherefore stand back crawfordwere it my last word i speak as a king to his officer and demand obediencestand back and if it is required yield up your sword i command you to do so and your oath obliges you to obey  true true my lord said crawford stepping back and returning to the sheath the blade he had half drawnit may be all very true but by my honour if i were at the head of threescore and ten of my brave fellows instead of being loaded with more than the like number of years i would try whether i could have some reason out of these fine gallants with their golden chains and looped up bonnets with braw warld dyes gaudy colors and devices on them  the duke stood with his eyes fixed on the ground for a considerable space and then said with bitter irony crevecoeur you say well and it concerns our honour that our obligations to this great king our honoured and loving guest be not so hastily adjusted as in our hasty anger we had at first proposed we will so act that all europe shall acknowledge the justice of our proceedingsgentlemen of france you must render up your arms to my officers your master has broken the truce and has no title to take farther benefit of it in compassion however to your sentiments of honour and in respect to the rank which he hath disgraced and the race from which he hath degenerated we ask not our cousin louiss sword  not one of us said dunois will resign our weapon or quit this hall unless we are assured of at least our kings safety in life and limb  nor will a man of the scottish guard exclaimed crawford lay down his arms save at the command of the king of france or his high constable  brave dunois said louis and you my trusty crawford your zeal will do me injury instead of benefiti trust he added with dignity in my rightful cause more than in a vain resistance which would but cost the lives of my best and bravest give up your swordsthe noble burgundians who accept such honourable pledges will be more able than you are to protect both you and megive up your swordsit is i who command you  it was thus that in this dreadful emergency louis showed the promptitude of decision and clearness of judgment which alone could have saved his life he was aware that until actual blows were exchanged he should have the assistance of most of the nobles present to moderate the fury of their prince but that were a melee once commenced he himself and his few adherents must be instantly murdered at the same time his worst enemies confessed that his demeanour had in it nothing either of meanness or cowardice he shunned to aggravate into frenzy the wrath of the duke but he neither deprecated nor seemed to fear it and continued to look on him with the calm and fixed attention with which a brave man eyes the menacing gestures of a lunatic whilst conscious that his own steadiness and composure operate as an insensible and powerful check on the rage even of insanity  crawford at the kings command threw his sword to crevecoeur saying take it and the devil give you joy of itit is no dishonour to the rightful owner who yields it for we have had no fair play  hold gentlemen said the duke in a broken voice as one whom passion had almost deprived of utterance retain your swords it is sufficient you promise not to use them and you louis of valois must regard yourself as my prisoner until you are cleared of having abetted sacrilege and murder have him to the castlehave him to earl herberts tower let him have six gentlemen of his train to attend him such as he shall choosemy lord of crawford your guard must leave the castle and shall be honourably quartered elsewhere up with every drawbridge and down with every portcullislet the gates of the town be trebly guardeddraw the floating bridge to the right hand side of the riverbring round the castle my band of black walloons regiments of dutch troops wearing black armour and treble the sentinels on every postyou dhymbercourt look that patrols of horse and foot make the round of the town every half hour during the night and every hour during the next dayif indeed such ward shall be necessary after daybreak for it is like we may be sudden in this matterlook to the person of louis as you love your life  he started from the table in fierce and moody haste darted a glance of mortal enmity at the king and rushed out of the apartment  sirs said the king looking with dignity around him grief for the death of his ally hath made your prince frantic i trust you know better your duty as knights and noblemen than to abet him in his treasonable violence against the person of his liege lord  at this moment was heard in the streets the sound of drums beating and horns blowing to call out the soldiery in every direction  we are said crevecoeur who acted as the marshal of the dukes household subjects of burgundy and must do our duty as such our hopes and prayers and our efforts will not be wanting to bring about peace and union between your majesty and our liege lord meantime we must obey his commands these other lords and knights will be proud to contribute to the convenience of the illustrious duke of orleans of the brave dunois and the stout lord crawford i myself must be your majestys chamberlain and bring you to your apartments in other guise than would be my desire remembering the hospitality of plessis you have only to choose your attendants whom the dukes commands limit to six  then said the king looking around him and thinking for a momenti desire the attendance of oliver le dain of a private of my life guard called balafre who may be unarmed if you willof tristan lhermite with two of his peopleand my right royal and trusty philosopher martius galeotti  your majestys will shall be complied with in all points said the count de crevecoeur galeotti he added after a moments inquiry is i understand at present supping in some buxom company but he shall instantly be sent for the others will obey your majestys command upon the instant  forward then to the new abode which the hospitality of our cousin provides for us said the king we know it is strong and have only to hope it may be in a corresponding degree safe  heard you the choice which king louis has made of his attendants said le glorieux to count crevecoeur apart as they followed louis from the hall  surely my merry gossip replied the count what hast thou to object to them  nothing nothingonly they are a rare electiona panderly barbera scottish hired cutthroata chief hangman and his two assistants and a thieving charlatani will along with you crevecoeur and take a lesson in the degrees of roguery from observing your skill in marshalling them the devil himself could scarce have summoned such a synod or have been a better president amongst them  accordingly the all licensed jester seizing the counts arm familiarly began to march along with him while under a strong guard yet forgetting no semblance of respect he conducted the king towards his new apartment  the historical facts attending this celebrated interview are expounded and enlarged upon in this chapter agents sent by louis had tempted the people of liege to rebel against their superior duke charles and persecute and murder their bishop but louis was not prepared for their acting with such promptitude they flew to arms with the temerity of a fickle rabble took the bishop prisoner menaced and insulted him and tore to pieces one or two of his canons this news was sent to the duke of burgundy at the moment when louis had so unguardedly placed himself in his power and the consequence was that charles placed guards on the castle of peronne and deeply resenting the treachery of the king of france in exciting sedition in his dominions while he pretended the most intimate friendship he deliberated whether he should not put louis to death three days louis was detained in this very precarious situation and it was only his profuse liberality amongst charless favourites and courtiers which finally ensured him from death or deposition comines who was the duke of burgundys chamberlain at the time and slept in his apartment says charles neither undressed nor slept but flung himself from time to time on the bed and at other times wildly traversed the apartment it was long before his violent temper became in any degree tractable at length he only agreed to give louis his liberty on condition of his accompanying him in person against and employing his troops in subduing the mutineers whom his intrigues had instigated to arms this was a bitter and degrading alternative but louis seeing no other mode of compounding for the effects of his rashness not only submitted to this discreditable condition but swore to it upon a crucifix said to have belonged to charlemagne these particulars are from comines there is a succinct epitome of them in sir nathaniel wraxalls history of france vol is    chapter xxviii uncertainty       then happy low lie down      uneasy lies the head that wears a crown       second part of king henry iv   forty men at arms carrying alternately naked swords and blazing torches served as the escort or rather the guard of king louis from the town hall of peronne to the castle and as he entered within its darksome and gloomy strength it seemed as if a voice screamed in his ear that warning which the florentine has inscribed over the portal of the infernal regions leave all hope behind  the florentine 12651321 dante alighieri the greatest of italian poets the divine comedy his chief work describes his passage through hell purgatory and heaven the inscription here referred to dante places at the entrance of hell  at that moment perhaps some feeling of remorse might have crossed the kings mind had he thought on the hundreds nay thousands whom without cause or on light suspicion he had committed to the abysses of his dungeons deprived of all hope of liberty and loathing even the life to which they clung by animal instinct  the broad glare of the torches outfacing the pale moon which was more obscured on this than on the former night and the red smoky light which they dispersed around the ancient buildings gave a darker shade to that huge donjon called the earl herberts tower it was the same that louis had viewed with misgiving presentiment on the preceding evening and of which he was now doomed to become an inhabitant under the terror of what violence soever the wrathful temper of his overgrown vassal might tempt him to exercise in those secret recesses of despotism  to aggravate the kings painful feelings he saw as he crossed the courtyard one or two bodies over each of which had been hastily flung a military cloak he was not long in discerning that they were corpses of slain archers of the scottish guard who having disputed as the count crevecoeur informed him the command given them to quit the post near the kings apartments a brawl had ensued between them and the dukes walloon bodyguards and before it could be composed by the officers on either side several lives had been lost  my trusty scots said the king as he looked upon this melancholy spectacle had they brought only man to man all flanders ay and burgundy to boot had not furnished champions to mate you  yes an it please your majesty said balafre who attended close behind the king maistery mows the meadow maist a scotch form of most that is there is strength in numbersfew men can fight more than two at oncei myself never care to meet three unless it be in the way of special duty when one must not stand to count heads  art thou there old acquaintance said the king looking behind him then i have one true subject with me yet  and a faithful minister whether in your councils or in his offices about your royal person whispered oliver le dain  we are all faithful said tristan lhermite gruffly for should they put to death your majesty there is not one of us whom they would suffer to survive you even if we would  now that is what i call good corporal bail for fidelity said le glorieux who as already mentioned with the restlessness proper to an infirm brain had thrust himself into their company  meanwhile the seneschal hastily summoned was turning with laborious effort the ponderous key which opened the reluctant gate of the huge gothic keep and was at last fain to call for the assistance of one of crevecoeurs attendants when they had succeeded six men entered with torches and showed the way through a narrow and winding passage commanded at different points by shot holes from vaults and casements constructed behind and in the thickness of the massive walls at the end of this passage arose a stair of corresponding rudeness consisting of huge blocks of stone roughly dressed with the hammer and of unequal height having mounted this ascent a strong iron clenched door admitted them to what had been the great hall of the donjon lighted but very faintly even during the daytime for the apertures diminished in appearance by the excessive thickness of the walls resembled slits rather than windows and now but for the blaze of the torches almost perfectly dark two or three bats and other birds of evil presage roused by the unusual glare flew against the lights and threatened to extinguish them while the seneschal formally apologized to the king that the state hall had not been put in order such was the hurry of the notice sent to him adding that in truth the apartment had not been in use for twenty years and rarely before that time so far as ever he had heard since the time of king charles the simple  king charles the simple echoed louis i know the history of the tower nowhe was here murdered by his treacherous vassal herbert earl of vermandoisso say our annals i knew there was something concerning the castle of peronne which dwelt on my mind though i could not recall the circumstancehere then my predecessor was slain  not here not exactly here and please your majesty said the old seneschal stepping with the eager haste of a cicerone who shows the curiosities of such a place  not here but in the side chamber a little onward which opens from your majestys bedchamber  he hastily opened a wicket at the upper end of the hall which led into a bedchamber small as is usual in those old buildings but even for that reason rather more comfortable than the waste hall through which they had passed some hasty preparations had been here made for the kings accommodation arras had been tacked up a fire lighted in the rusty grate which had been long unused and a pallet laid down for those gentlemen who were to pass the night in his chamber as was then usual  we will get beds in the hall for the rest of your attendants said the garrulous old man but we have had such brief notice if it please your majestyand if it please your majesty to look upon this little wicket behind the arras it opens into the little old cabinet in the thickness of the wall where charles was slain and there is a secret passage from below which admitted the men who were to deal with him and your majesty whose eyesight i hope is better than mine may see the blood still on the oak floor though the thing was done five hundred years ago  while he thus spoke he kept fumbling to open the postern of which he spoke until the king said forbear old manforbear but a little while when thou mayst have a newer tale to tell and fresher blood to showmy lord of crevecoeur what say you  i can but answer sire that these two interior apartments are as much at your majestys disposal as those in your own castle at plessis and that crevecoeur a name never blackened by treachery or assassination has the guard of the exterior defences of it  but the private passage into that closet of which the old man speaks this king louis said in a low and anxious tone holding crevecoeurs arm fast with one hand and pointing to the wicket door with the other  it must be some dream of mornays said crevecoeur or some old and absurd tradition of the place but we will examine  he was about to open the closet door when louis answered no crevecoeur noyour honour is sufficient warrantbut what will your duke do with me crevecoeur he cannot hope to keep me long a prisoner andin short give me your opinion crevecoeur  my lord and sire said the count how the duke of burgundy must resent this horrible cruelty on the person of his near relative and ally is for your majesty to judge and what right he may have to consider it as instigated by your majestys emissaries you only can know but my master is noble in his disposition and made incapable even by the very strength of his passions of any underhand practices whatever he does will be done in the face of day and of the two nations and i can but add that it will be the wish of every counsellor around himexcepting perhaps onethat he should behave in this matter with mildness and generosity as well as justice  ah crevecoeur said louis taking his hand as if affected by some painful recollections how happy is the prince who has counsellors near him who can guard him against the effects of his own angry passions their names will be read in golden letters when the history of his reign is perusednoble crevecoeur had it been my lot to have such as thou art about my person  it had in that case been your majestys study to have got rid of them as fast as you could said le glorieux  aha sir wisdom art thou there said louis turning round and instantly changing the pathetic tone in which he had addressed crevecoeur and adopting with facility one which had a turn of gaiety in ithast thou followed us hither  ay sir answered le glorieux wisdom must follow in motley where folly leads the way in purple  how shall i construe that sir solomon answered louis wouldst thou change conditions with me  not i by my halidome quoth le glorieux if you would give me fifty crowns to boot  why wherefore somethinks i could be well enough contented as princes go to have thee for my king  ay sire replied le glorieux but the question is whether judging of your majestys wit from its having lodged you here i should not have cause to be ashamed of having so dull a fool  peace sirrah said the count of crevecoeur your tongue runs too fast  let it take its course said the king i know of no such fair subject of raillery as the follies of those who should know betterhere my sagacious friend take this purse of gold and with it the advice never to be so great a fool as to deem yourself wiser than other people prithee do me so much favour as to inquire after my astrologer martius galeotti and send him hither to me presently  i will without fail my liege answered the jester and i wot well i shall find him at jan dopplethurs for philosophers as well as fools know where the best wine is sold  let me pray for free entrance for this learned person through your guards seignior de crevecoeur said louis  for his entrance unquestionably answered the count but it grieves me to add that my instructions do not authorize me to permit any one to quit your majestys apartmentsi wish your majesty a goodnight he subjoined and will presently make such arrangements in the outer hall as may put the gentlemen who are to inhabit it more at their ease  give yourself no trouble for them sir count replied the king they are men accustomed to set hardships at defiance and to speak truth excepting that i wish to see galeotti i would desire as little farther communication from without this night as may be consistent with your instructions  these are to leave your majesty replied crevecoeur undisputed possession of your own apartments such are my masters orders  your master count answered louis whom i may also term mine is a right gracious mastermy dominions he added are somewhat shrunk in compass now that they have dwindled to an old hall and a bedchamber but they are still wide enough for all the subjects which i can at present boast of  the count of crevecoeur took his leave and shortly after they could hear the noise of the sentinels moving to their posts accompanied with the word of command from the officers and the hasty tread of the guards who were relieved at length all became still and the only sound which filled the air was the sluggish murmur of the river somme as it glided deep and muddy under the walls of the castle  go into the hall my mates said louis to his train but do not lie down to sleep hold yourselves in readiness for there is still something to be done tonight and that of moment  oliver and tristan retired to the hall accordingly in which le balafre and the two officers had remained when the others entered the bedchamber they found that those without had thrown fagots enough upon the fire to serve the purpose of light and heat at the same time and wrapping themselves in their cloaks had sat down on the floor in postures which variously expressed the discomposure and dejection of their minds oliver and tristan saw nothing better to be done than to follow their example and never very good friends in the days of their court prosperity they were both equally reluctant to repose confidence in each other upon this strange and sudden reverse of fortune so the whole party sat in silent dejection  meanwhile their master underwent in the retirement of his secret chamber agonies that might have atoned for some of those which had been imposed by his command he paced the room with short and unequal steps often stood still and clasped his hands together and gave loose in short to agitation which in public he had found himself able to suppress so successfully at length pausing and wringing his hands he planted himself opposite to the wicket door which had been pointed out by old mornay as leading to the scene of the murder of one of his predecessors and gradually gave voice to his feelings in a broken soliloquy  charles the simplecharles the simplewhat will posterity call the eleventh louis whose blood will probably soon refresh the stains of thine louis the foollouis the drivellerlouis the infatuatedare all terms too slight to mark the extremity of my idiocy to think these hot headed liegeois to whom rebellion is as natural as their food would remain quietto dream that the wild beast of ardennes would for a moment be interrupted in his career of force and bloodthirsty brutalityto suppose that i could use reason and arguments to any good purpose with charles of burgundy until i had tried the force of such exhortations with success upon a wild bull fool and double idiot that i was but the villain martius shall not escapehe has been at the bottom of this he and the vile priest the detestable balue if i ever get out of this danger i will tear from his head the cardinals cap though i pull the scalp along with it but the other traitor is in my handsi am yet king enoughhave yet an empire roomy enoughfor the punishment of the quack salving word mongering star gazing lie coining impostor who has at once made a prisoner and a dupe of methe conjunction of the constellationsay the conjunctionhe must talk nonsense which would scarce gull a thrice sodden sheeps head and i must be idiot enough to think i understand him but we shall see presently what the conjunction hath really boded but first let me to my devotions  louis kept his promise of vengeance against cardinal la balue whom he always blamed as having betrayed him to burgundy after he had returned to his own kingdom he caused his late favourite to be immured in one of the iron cages at loches these were constructed with horrible ingenuity so that a person of ordinary size could neither stand up at his full height nor lie lengthwise in them some ascribe this horrid device to balue himself at any rate he was confined in one of these dens for eleven years nor did louis permit him to be liberated till his last illness s  above the little door in memory perhaps of the deed which had been done within was a rude niche containing a crucifix cut in stone upon this emblem the king fixed his eyes as if about to kneel but stopped short as if he applied to the blessed image the principles of worldly policy and deemed it rash to approach its presence without having secured the private intercession of some supposed favourite he therefore turned from the crucifix as unworthy to look upon it and selecting from the images with which as often mentioned his hat was completely garnished a representation of the lady of clery knelt down before it and made the following extraordinary prayer in which it is to be observed the grossness of his superstition induced him in some degree to consider the virgin of clery as a different person from the madonna of embrun a favourite idol to whom he often paid his vows  sweet lady of clery he exclaimed clasping his hands and beating his breast while he spoke blessed mother of mercy thou who art omnipotent with omnipotence have compassion with me a sinner it is true that i have something neglected thee for thy blessed sister of embrun but i am a king my power is great my wealth boundless and were it otherwise i would double the gabelle on my subjects rather than not pay my debts to you both undo these iron doorsfill up these tremendous moatslead me as a mother leads a child out of this present and pressing danger if i have given thy sister the county of boulogne to be held of her for ever have i no means of showing devotion to thee also thou shalt have the broad and rich province of champagne and its vineyards shall pour their abundance into thy convent i had promised the province to my brother charles but he thou knowest is deadpoisoned by that wicked abbe of saint john dangely whom if i live i will punishi promised this once before but this time i will keep my wordif i had any knowledge of the crime believe dearest patroness it was because i knew no better method of quieting the discontents of my kingdom oh do not reckon that old debt to my account today but be as thou hast ever been kind benignant and easy to be entreated sweetest lady work with thy child that he will pardon all past sins and oneone little deed which i must do this nightnay it is no sin dearest lady of cleryno sin but an act of justice privately administered for the villain is the greatest impostor that ever poured falsehood into a princes ear and leans besides to the filthy heresy of the greeks he is not deserving of thy protection leave him to my care and hold it as good service that i rid the world of him for the man is a necromancer and wizard that is not worth thy thought and carea dog the extinction of whose life ought to be of as little consequence in thine eyes as the treading out a spark that drops from a lamp or springs from a fire think not of this little matter gentlest kindest lady but only consider how thou canst best aid me in my troubles and i here bind my royal signet to thy effigy in token that i will keep word concerning the county of champagne and that this shall be the last time i will trouble thee in affairs of blood knowing thou art so kind so gentle and so tender hearted  as overheard and reported by the court jester this historic prayer reads as follows ah my good lady my gentle mistress my only friend in whom alone i have resource i pray you to supplicate god in my behalf and to be my advocate with him that he may pardon me the death of my brother whom i caused to be poisoned by that wicked abbot of saint john i confess my guilt to thee as to my good patroness and mistress but then what could i do he was perpetually causing disorder in my kingdom cause me then to be pardoned my good lady and i know what a reward i will give thee  after this extraordinary contract with the object of his adoration louis recited apparently with deep devotion the seven penitential psalms the 6th 32d 38th 51st 102d 130th and 143d so called from their penitential character in latin and several aves and prayers especially belonging to the service of the virgin he then arose satisfied that he had secured the intercession of the saint to whom he had prayed the rather as he craftily reflected that most of the sins for which he had requested her mediation on former occasions had been of a different character and that therefore the lady of clery was less likely to consider him as a hardened and habitual shedder of blood than the other saints whom he had more frequently made confidants of his crimes in that respect  when he had thus cleared his conscience or rather whited it over like a sepulchre the king thrust his head out at the door of the hall and summoned le balafre into his apartment my good soldier he said thou hast served me long and hast had little promotion we are here in a case where i may either live or die but i would not willingly die an ungrateful man or leave so far as the saints may place it in my power either a friend or an enemy unrecompensed now i have a friend to be rewarded that is thyselfan enemy to be punished according to his deserts and that is the base treacherous villain martius galeotti who by his impostures and specious falsehoods has trained me hither into the power of my mortal enemy with as firm a purpose of my destruction as ever butcher had of slaying the beast which he drove to the shambles  i will challenge him on that quarrel since they say he is a fighting blade though he looks somewhat unwieldy said le balafre i doubt not but the duke of burgundy is so much a friend to men of the sword that he will allow us a fair field within some reasonable space and if your majesty live so long and enjoy so much freedom you shall behold me do battle in your right and take as proper a vengeance on this philosopher as your heart could desire  i commend your bravery and your devotion to my service said the king but this treacherous villain is a stout man at arms and i would not willingly risk thy life my brave soldier  i were no brave soldier if it please your majesty said balafre if i dared not face a better man than he a fine thing it would be for me who can neither read nor write to be afraid of a fat lurdane who has done little else all his life  nevertheless said the king it is not our pleasure so to put thee in venture balafre this traitor comes hither summoned by our command we would have thee so soon as thou canst find occasion close up with him and smite him under the fifth ribdost thou understand me  truly i do answered le balafre but if it please your majesty this is a matter entirely out of my course of practice i could not kill you a dog unless it were in hot assault or pursuit or upon defiance given or such like  why sure thou dost not pretend to tenderness of heart said the king thou who hast been first in storm and siege and most eager as men tell me on the pleasures and advantages which are gained on such occasions by the rough heart and the bloody hand  my lord answered le balafre i have neither feared nor spared your enemies sword in hand and an assault is a desperate matter under risks which raise a mans blood so that by saint andrew it will not settle for an hour or twowhich i call a fair license for plundering after a storm and god pity us poor soldiers who are first driven mad with danger and then madder with victory i have heard of a legion consisting entirely of saints and methinks it would take them all to pray and intercede for the rest of the army and for all who wear plumes and corselets buff coats and broadswords but what your majesty purposes is out of my course of practice though i will never deny that it has been wide enough as for the astrologer if he be a traitor let him een die a traitors deathi will neither meddle nor make with it your majesty has your provost and two of his marshals men without who are more fit for dealing with him than a scottish gentleman of my family and standing in the service  you say well said the king but at least it belongs to thy duty to prevent interruption and to guard the execution of my most just sentence  i will do so against all peronne said le balafre your majesty need not doubt my fealty in that which i can reconcile to my conscience which for mine own convenience and the service of your royal majesty i can vouch to be a pretty large oneat least i know i have done some deeds for your majesty which i would rather have eaten a handful of my own dagger than i would have done for any one else  let that rest said the king and hear youwhen galeotti is admitted and the door shut on him do you stand to your weapon and guard the entrance on the inside of the apartment let no one intrudethat is all i require of you go hence and send the provost marshal to me  balafre left the apartment accordingly and in a minute afterwards tristan lhermite entered from the hall  welcome gossip said the king what thinkest thou of our situation  as of men sentenced to death said the provost marshal unless there come a reprieve from the duke  reprieved or not he that decoyed us into this snare shalt go our fourrier to the next world to take up lodgings for us said the king with a grisly and ferocious smile tristan thou hast done many an act of brave justicefinisi should have said funis coronat opus the endi should have said the ropecrowns the workthou must stand by me to the end  i will my liege said tristan i am but a plain fellow but i am grateful i will do my duty within these walls or elsewhere and while i live your majestys breath shall pour as potential a note of condemnation and your sentence be as literally executed as when you sat on your own throne they may deal with me the next hour for it if they willi care not  it is even what i expected of thee my loving gossip said louis but hast thou good assistancethe traitor is strong and able bodied and will doubtless be clamorous for aid the scot will do naught but keep the door and well that he can be brought to that by flattery and humouring then oliver is good for nothing but lying flattering and suggesting dangerous counsels and ventre saint dieu i think is more like one day to deserve the halter himself than to use it to another have you men think you and means to make sharp and sure work  i have trois eschelles and petit andre with me said he men so expert in their office that out of three men they would hang up one ere his two companions were aware and we have all resolved to live or die with your majesty knowing we shall have as short breath to draw when you are gone as ever fell to the lot of any of our patientsbut what is to be our present subject an it please your majesty i love to be sure of my man for as your majesty is pleased sometimes to remind me i have now and then mistaken the criminal and strung up in his place an honest labourer who had given your majesty no offence  most true said the other know then tristan that the condemned person is martius galeottiyou start but it is even as i say the villain hath trained us all hither by false and treacherous representations that he might put us into the hands of the duke of burgundy without defence  but not without vengeance said tristan were it the last act of my life i would sting him home like an expiring wasp should i be crushed to pieces on the next instant  i know thy trusty spirit said the king and the pleasure which like other good men thou dost find in the discharge of thy duty since virtue as the schoolmen say is its own reward but away and prepare the priests for the victim approaches  would you have it done in your own presence my gracious liege said tristan  louis declined this offer but charged the provost marshal to have everything ready for the punctual execution of his commands the moment the astrologer left his apartment  for said the king i will see the villain once more just to observe how he bears himself towards the master whom he has led into the toils i shall love to see the sense of approaching death strike the colour from that ruddy cheek and dim that eye which laughed as it liedoh that there were but another with him whose counsels aided his prognostications but if i survive thislook to your scarlet my lord cardinal for rome shall scarce protect yoube it spoken under favour of saint peter and the blessed lady of clery who is all over mercywhy do you tarry go get your rooms ready i expect the villain instantly i pray to heaven he take not fear and come notthat were indeed a balkbegone tristanthou wert not wont to be so slow when business was to be done  on the contrary an it like your majesty you were ever wont to say that i was too fast and mistook your purpose and did the job on the wrong subject now please your majesty to give me a sign just when you part with galeotti for the night whether the business goes on or no i have known your majesty once or twice change your mind and blame me for over dispatch  the provost marshal was often so precipitate in execution as to slay another person instead of him whom the king had indicated this always occasioned a double execution for the wrath or revenge of louis was never satisfied with a vicarious punishment s  thou suspicious creature answered king louis i tell thee i will not change my mindbut to silence thy remonstrances observe if i say to the knave at parting there is a heaven above us then let the business go on but if i say go in peace you will understand that my purpose is altered  my head is somewhat of the dullest out of my own department said tristan lhermite stay let me rehearseif you bid him depart in peace i am to have him dealt upon  no noidiot no said the king in that case you let him pass free but if i say there is a heaven above us up with him a yard or two nearer the planets he is so conversant with  i wish we may have the means here said the provost  then up with him or down with him it matters not which answered the king grimly smiling  and the body said the provost how shall we dispose of it  let me see an instant said the kingthe windows of the hall are too narrow but that projecting oriel is wide enough we will over with him into the somme and put a paper on his breast with the legend let the justice of the king pass toll free the dukes officers may seize it for duties if they dare  the provost marshal left the apartment of louis and summoned his two assistants to council in an embrasure in the great hall where trois eschelles stuck a torch against the wall to give them light they discoursed in whispers little noticed by oliver le dain who seemed sunk in dejection and le balafre who was fast asleep  comrades said the provost to his executioners perhaps you have thought that our vocation was over or that at least we were more likely to be the subjects of the duty of others than to have any more to discharge on our own parts but courage my mates our gracious master has reserved for us one noble cast of our office and it must be gallantly executed as by men who would live in history  ay i guess how it is said trois eschelles our patron is like the old kaisers of rome who when things came to an extremity or as we would say to the ladder foot with them were wont to select from their own ministers of justice some experienced person who might spare their sacred persons from the awkward attempts of a novice or blunderer in our mystery it was a pretty custom for ethnics but as a good catholic i should make some scruple at laying hands on the most christian king  nay but brother you are ever too scrupulous said petit andre if he issues word and warrant for his own execution i see not how we can in duty dispute it he that dwells at rome must obey the popethe marshalsmen must do their masters bidding and he the kings  hush you knaves said the provost marshal there is here no purpose concerning the kings person but only that of the greek heretic pagan and mahomedan wizard martius galeotti  galeotti answered petitandre that comes quite natural i never knew one of these legerdemain fellows who pass their lives as one may say in dancing upon a tight rope but what they came at length to caper at the end of onetchick  my only concern is said trois eschelles looking upwards that the poor creature must die without confession  tush tush said the provost marshal in reply he is a rank heretic and necromancera whole college of priests could not absolve him from the doom he has deserved besides if he hath a fancy that way thou hast a gift trois eschelles to serve him for ghostly father thyself but what is more material i fear you most use your poniards my mates for you have not here the fitting conveniences for the exercise of your profession  now our lady of the isle of paris forbid said trois eschelles that the kings command should find me destitute of my tools i always wear around my body saint franciss cord doubled four times with a handsome loop at the farther end of it for i am of the company of saint francis and may wear his cowl when i am in extremis at the point of deathi thank god and the good fathers of saumur  and for me said petit andre i have always in my budget a handy block and sheaf or a pulley as they call it with a strong screw for securing it where i list in case we should travel where trees are scarce or high branched from the ground i have found it a great convenience  that will suit us well said the provost marshal you have but to screw your pulley into yonder beam above the door and pass the rope over it i will keep the fellow in some conversation near the spot until you adjust the noose under his chin and then  and then we run up the rope said petit andre and tchick our astrologer is so far in heaven that he hath not a foot on earth  but these gentlemen said trois eschelles looking towards the chimney do not these help and so take a handsel of our vocation  hem no answered the provost the barber only contrives mischief which he leaves other men to execute and for the scot he keeps the door when the deed is adoing which he hath not spirit or quickness sufficient to partake in more activelyevery one to his trade  the author has endeavoured to give to the odious tristan lhermite a species of dogged and brutal fidelity to louis similar to the attachment of a bulldog to his master with all the atrocity of his execrable character he was certainly a man of courage and was in his youth made knight in the breach of fronsac with a great number of other young nobles by the honour giving hand of the elder dunois the celebrated hero of charles the fifths reign s  with infinite dexterity and even a sort of professional delight which sweetened the sense of their own precarious situation the worthy executioners of the provosts mandates adapted their rope and pulley for putting in force the sentence which had been uttered against galeotti by the captive monarchseeming to rejoice that that last action was to be one so consistent with their past lives tristan lhermite sat eyeing their proceedings with a species of satisfaction while oliver paid no attention to them whatever and ludovic lesly if awaked by the bustle he looked upon them at all considered them as engaged in matters entirely unconnected with his own duty and for which he was not to be regarded as responsible in one way or other    chapter xxix recrimination       thy time is not yet outthe devil thou servest      has not as yet deserted thee he aids      the friends who drudge for him as the blind man      was aided by the guide who lent his shoulder      oer rough and smooth until he reached the brink      of the fell precipicethen hurld him downward       old play   when obeying the command or rather the request of louisfor he was in circumstances in which though a monarch he could only request le glorieux to go in search of martius galeottithe jester had no trouble in executing his commission betaking himself at once to the best tavern in peronne of which he himself was rather more than an occasional frequenter being a great admirer of that species of liquor which reduced all other mens brains to a level with his own  he found or rather observed the astrologer in the corner of the public drinking roomstove as it is called in german and flemish from its principal furnituresitting in close colloquy with a female in a singular and something like a moorish or asiatic garb who as le glorieux approached martius rose as in the act to depart  these said the stranger are news upon which you may rely with absolute certainty and with that disappeared among the crowd of guests who sat grouped at different tables in the apartment  cousin philosopher said the jester presenting himself heaven no sooner relieves one sentinel than it sends another to supply the place one fool being gone here i come another to guide you to the apartments of louis of france  and art thou the messenger said martius gazing on him with prompt apprehension and discovering at once the jesters quality though less intimated as we have before noticed than was usual by his external appearance  ay sir and like your learning answered le glorieux when power sends folly to entreat the approach of wisdom t is a sure sign what foot the patient halts upon  how if i refuse to come when summoned at so late an hour by such a messenger said galeotti  in that case we will consult your ease and carry you said le glorieux here are half a score of stout burgundian yeomen at the door with whom he of crevecoeur has furnished me to that effect for know that my friend charles of burgundy and i have not taken away our kinsman louiss crown which he was ass enough to put into our power but have only filed and clipt it a little and though reduced to the size of a spangle it is still pure gold in plain terms he is still paramount over his own people yourself included and most christian king of the old dining hall in the castle of peronne to which you as his liege subject are presently obliged to repair  i attend you sir said martius galeotti and accompanied le glorieux accordinglyseeing perhaps that no evasion was possible  ay sir said the fool as they went towards the castle you do well for we treat our kinsman as men use an old famished lion in his cage and thrust him now and then a calf to mumble to keep his old jaws in exercise  do you mean said martius that the king intends me bodily injury  nay that you can guess better than i said the jester for though the night be cloudy i warrant you can see the stars through the mist i know nothing of the matter not ionly my mother always told me to go warily near an old rat in a trap for he was never so much disposed to bite  the astrologer asked no more questions and le glorieux according to the custom of those of his class continued to run on in a wild and disordered strain of sarcasm and folly mingled together until he delivered the philosopher to the guard at the castle gate of peronne where he was passed from warder to warder and at length admitted within herberts tower  the hints of the jester had not been lost on martius galeotti and he saw something which seemed to confirm them in the look and manner of tristan whose mode of addressing him as he marshalled him to the kings bedchamber was lowering sullen and ominous a close observer of what passed on earth as well as among the heavenly bodies the pulley and the rope also caught the astrologers eye and as the latter was in a state of vibration he concluded that some one who had been busy adjusting it had been interrupted in the work by his sudden arrival all this he saw and summoned together his subtilty to evade the impending danger resolved should he find that impossible to defend himself to the last against whomsoever should assail him  thus resolved and with a step and look corresponding to the determination he had taken martius presented himself before louis alike unabashed at the miscarriage of his predictions and undismayed at the monarchs anger and its probable consequences  every good planet be gracious to your majesty said galeotti with an inclination almost oriental in manner every evil constellation withhold its influence from my royal master  methinks replied the king that when you look around this apartment when you think where it is situated and how guarded your wisdom might consider that my propitious stars had proved faithless and that each evil conjunction had already done its worst art thou not ashamed martius galeotti to see me here and a prisoner when you recollect by what assurances i was lured hither  and art thou not ashamed my royal sire replied the philosopher thou whose step in science was so forward thy apprehension so quick thy perseverance so unceasingart thou not ashamed to turn from the first frown of fortune like a craven from the first clash of arms didst thou propose to become participant of those mysteries which raise men above the passions the mischances the pains the sorrows of life a state only to be attained by rivalling the firmness of the ancient stoic and dost thou shrink from the first pressure of adversity and forfeit the glorious prize for which thou didst start as a competitor frightened out of the course like a scared racer by shadowy and unreal evils  shadowy and unreal frontless as thou art exclaimed the king is this dungeon unrealthe weapons of the guards of my detested enemy burgundy which you may hear clash at the gate are those shadows what traitor are real evils if imprisonment dethronement and danger of life are not so  ignoranceignorance my brother and prejudice answered the sage with great firmness are the only real evils believe me that kings in the plenitude of power if immersed in ignorance and prejudice are less free than sages in a dungeon and loaded with material chains towards this true happiness it is mine to guide yoube it yours to attend to my instructions  and it is to such philosophical freedom that your lessons would have guided me said the king very bitterly i would you had told me at plessis that the dominion promised me so liberally was an empire over my own passions that the success of which i was assured related to my progress in philosophy and that i might become as wise and as learned as a strolling mountebank of italy i might surely have attained this mental ascendency at a more moderate price than that of forfeiting the fairest crown in christendom and becoming tenant of a dungeon in peronne go sir and think not to escape condign punishmentthere is a heaven above us  i leave you not to your fate replied martius until i have vindicated even in your eyes darkened as they are that reputation a brighter gem than the brightest in thy crown and at which the world shall wonder ages after all the race of capet the surname of the kings of france beginning with hugh capet 987 are mouldered into oblivion in the charnels of saint denis  speak on said louis thine impudence cannot make me change my purposes or my opinionyet as i may never again pass judgment as a king i will not censure thee unheard speak thenthough the best thou canst say will be to speak the truth confess that i am a dupe thou an impostor thy pretended science a dream and the planets which shine above us as little influential of our destiny as their shadows when reflected in the river are capable of altering its course  and how knowst thou answered the astrologer boldly the secret influence of yonder blessed lights speakst thou of their inability to influence waters when yet thou knowst that ever the weakest the moon herselfweakest because nearest to this wretched earth of oursholds under her domination not such poor streams as the somme but the tides of the mighty ocean itself which ebb and increase as her disc waxes and wanes and watch her influence as a slave waits the nod of a sultana and now louis of valois answer my parable in turnconfess art thou not like the foolish passenger who becomes wroth with his pilot because he cannot bring the vessel into harbour without experiencing occasionally the adverse force of winds and currents i could indeed point to thee the probable issue of thine enterprise as prosperous but it was in the power of heaven alone to conduct thee thither and if the path be rough and dangerous was it in my power to smooth or render it more safe where is thy wisdom of yesterday which taught thee so truly to discern that the ways of destiny are often ruled to our advantage though in opposition to our wishes  you remind meyou remind me said the king hastily of one specific falsehood you foretold yonder scot should accomplish his enterprise fortunately for my interest and honour and thou knowest it has so terminated that no more mortal injury could i have received than from the impression which the issue of that affair is like to make on the excited brain of the mad bull of burgundy this is a direct falsehoodthou canst plead no evasion herecanst refer to no remote favourable turn of the tide for which like an idiot sitting on the bank until the river shall pass away thou wouldst have me wait contentedlyhere thy craft deceived theethou wert weak enough to make a specific prediction which has proved directly false  which will prove most firm and true answered the astrologer boldly i would desire no greater triumph of art over ignorance than that prediction and its accomplishment will affordi told thee he would be faithful in any honourable commissionhath he not been soi told thee he would be scrupulous in aiding any evil enterprisehath he not proved soif you doubt it go ask the bohemian hayraddin maugrabin  the king here coloured deeply with shame and anger  i told thee continued the astrologer that the conjunction of planets under which he set forth augured danger to the personand hath not his path been beset by dangeri told thee that it augured an advantage to the senderand of that thou wilt soon have the benefit  soon have the benefit exclaimed the king have i not the result already in disgrace and imprisonment  no answered the astrologer the end is not as yetthine own tongue shall ere long confess the benefit which thou hast received from the manner in which the messenger bore himself in discharging thy commission  this is tootoo insolent said the king at once to deceive and to insultbut hencethink not my wrongs shall be unavengedthere is a heaven above us  galeotti turned to depart  yet stop said louis thou bearest thine imposture bravely outlet me hear your answer to one question and think ere you speakcan thy pretended skill ascertain the hour of thine own death  only by referring to the fate of another said galeotti  i understand not thine answer said louis  know then o king said martius that this only i can tell with certainty concerning mine own death that it shall take place exactly twentyfour hours before that of your majesty  this story appropriated by scott was told of tiberius whose soothsayer made the prediction that his own death would take place three days before that of the emperor louis received a similar reply from a soothsayer who had foretold the death of one of his favourites greatly incensed he arranged for the death of the soothsayer when he should leave the royal presence after an interview when louis questioned him as to the day of his death the astrologer answere that it would be exactly three days before that of his majesty there was of course care taken that he should escape his destined fate and he was ever after much protected by the king as a man of real science and intimately connected with the royal destinies s louis was the slave of his physicians also cottier one of these was paid a retaining fee of ten thousand crowns besides great sums in lands and money he maintained over louis unbounded influence by using to him the most disrespectful harshness and insolence i know he said to the suffering king that one morning you will turn me adrift like so many others but by heaven you had better beware for you will not live eight days after you have done so s  ha sayest thou said louis his countenance again altering holdholdgo notwait one momentsaidst thou my death should follow thine so closely  within the space of twentyfour hours repeated galeotti firmly if there be one sparkle of true divination in those bright and mysterious intelligences which speak each on their courses though without a tongue i wish your majesty good rest  holdholdgo not said the king taking him by the arm and leading him from the door martius galeotti i have been a kind master to theeenriched theemade thee my friendmy companionthe instructor of my studiesbe open with me i entreat youis there aught in this art of yours in very deedshall this scots mission be in fact propitious to meand is the measure of our lives so veryvery nearly matched confess my good martius you speak after the trick of your tradeconfess i pray you and you shall have no displeasure at my hand i am in yearsa prisonerlikely to be deprived of a kingdomto one in my condition truth is worth kingdoms and it is from thee dearest martius that i must look for this inestimable jewel  and i have laid it before your majesty said galeotti at the risk that in brutal passion you might turn upon me and rend me  who i galeotti replied louis mildly alas thou mistakest meam i not captiveand should not i be patient especially since my anger can only show my impotencetell me then in sincerityhave you fooled meor is your science true and do you truly report it  your majesty will forgive me if i reply to you said martius galeotti that time onlytime and the event will convince incredulity it suits ill the place of confidence which i have held at the council table of the renowned conqueror matthias corvinus of hungarynay in the cabinet of the emperor himselfto reiterate assurances of that which i have advanced as true if you will not believe me i can but refer to the course of events a day or two days patience will prove or disprove what i have averred concerning the young scot and i will be contented to die on the wheel and have my limbs broken joint by joint if your majesty have not advantage and that in a most important degree from the dauntless conduct of that quentin durward but if i were to die under such tortures it would be well your majesty should seek a ghostly father for from the moment my last groan is drawn only twentyfour hours will remain to you for confession and penitence  louis continued to keep hold of galeottis robe as he led him towards the door and pronounced as he opened it in a loud voice tomorrow we ll talk more of this go in peace my learned fathergo in peacego in peace  he repeated these words three times and still afraid that the provost marshal might mistake his purpose he led the astrologer into the hall holding fast his robe as if afraid that he should be torn from him and put to death before his eyes he did not unloose his grasp until he had not only repeated again and again the gracious phrase go in peace but even made a private signal to the provost marshal to enjoin a suspension of all proceedings against the person of the astrologer  thus did the possession of some secret information joined to audacious courage and readiness of wit save galeotti from the most imminent danger and thus was louis the most sagacious as well as the most vindictive amongst the monarchs of the period cheated of his revenge by the influence of superstition upon a selfish temper and a mind to which from the consciousness of many crimes the fear of death was peculiarly terrible  he felt however considerable mortification at being obliged to relinquish his purposed vengeance and the disappointment seemed to be shared by his satellites to whom the execution was to have been committed le balafre alone perfectly indifferent on the subject so soon as the countermanding signal was given left the door at which he had posted himself and in a few minutes was fast asleep the provost marshal as the group reclined themselves to repose in the hall after the king retired to his bedchamber continued to eye the goodly form of the astrologer with the look of a mastiff watching a joint of meat which the cook had retrieved from his jaws while his attendants communicated to each other in brief sentences their characteristic sentiments  the poor blinded necromancer whispered trois eschelles with an air of spiritual unction and commiseration to his comrade petit andre hath lost the fairest chance of expiating some of his vile sorceries by dying through means of the cord of the blessed saint francis and i had purpose indeed to leave the comfortable noose around his neck to scare the foul fiend from his unhappy carcass  and i said petit andre have missed the rarest opportunity of knowing how far a weight of seventeen stone will stretch a three plied cordit would have been a glorious experiment in our lineand the jolly old boy would have died so easily  while this whispered dialogue was going forward martius who had taken the opposite side of the huge stone fireplace round which the whole group was assembled regarded them askance and with a look of suspicion he first put his hand into his vest and satisfied himself that the handle of a very sharp double edged poniard which he always carried about him was disposed conveniently for his grasp for as we have already noticed he was though now somewhat unwieldy a powerful athletic man and prompt and active at the use of his weapon satisfied that this trusty instrument was in readiness he next took from his bosom a scroll of parchment inscribed with greek characters and marked with cabalistic signs drew together the wood in the fireplace and made a blaze by which he could distinguish the features and attitude of all who sat or lay aroundthe heavy and deep slumbers of the scottish soldier who lay motionless with rough countenance as immovable as if it were cast in bronzethe pale and anxious face of oliver who at one time assumed the appearance of slumber and again opened his eyes and raised his head hastily as if stung by some internal throe or awakened by some distant soundthe discontented savage bulldog aspect of the provost who looked        frustrate of his will      not half sufficed and greedy yet to kill  while the background was filled up by the ghastly hypocritical countenance of trois eschelleswhose eyes were cast up towards heaven as if he was internally saying his devotionsand the grim drollery of petit andre who amused himself with mimicking the gestures and wry faces of his comrade before he betook himself to sleep  amidst these vulgar and ignoble countenances nothing could show to greater advantage than the stately form handsome mien and commanding features of the astrologer who might have passed for one of the ancient magi imprisoned in a den of robbers and about to invoke a spirit to accomplish his liberation and indeed had he been distinguished by nothing else than the beauty of the graceful and flowing beard which descended over the mysterious roll which he held in his hand one might have been pardoned for regretting that so noble an appendage had been bestowed on one who put both talents learning and the advantages of eloquence and a majestic person to the mean purposes of a cheat and an imposter  thus passed the night in count herberts tower in the castle of peronne when the first light of dawn penetrated the ancient gothic chamber the king summoned oliver to his presence who found the monarch sitting in his nightgown and was astonished at the alteration which one night of mortal anxiety had made in his looks he would have expressed some anxiety on the subject but the king silenced him by entering into a statement of the various modes by which he had previously endeavoured to form friends at the court of burgundy and which oliver was charged to prosecute so soon as he should be permitted to stir abroad  and never was that wily minister more struck with the clearness of the kings intellect and his intimate knowledge of all the springs which influence human actions than he was during that memorable consultation  about two hours afterwards oliver accordingly obtained permission from the count of crevecoeur to go out and execute the commissions which his master had intrusted him with and louis sending for the astrologer in whom he seemed to have renewed his faith held with him in like manner a long consultation the issue of which appeared to give him more spirits and confidence than he had at first exhibited so that he dressed himself and received the morning compliments of crevecoeur with a calmness at which the burgundian lord could not help wondering the rather that he had already heard that the duke had passed several hours in a state of mind which seemed to render the kings safety very precarious    chapter xxx uncertainty       our counsels waver like the unsteady bark      that reels amid the strife of meeting currents       old play   if the night passed by louis was carefully anxious and agitated that spent by the duke of burgundy who had at no time the same mastery over his passions and indeed who permitted them almost a free and uncontrolled dominion over his actions was still more disturbed  according to the custom of the period two of his principal and most favoured counsellors dhymbercourt and de comines shared his bedchamber couches being prepared for them near the bed of the prince their attendance was never more necessary than upon this night when distracted by sorrow by passion by the desire of revenge and by the sense of honour which forbade him to exercise it upon louis in his present condition the dukes mind resembled a volcano in eruption which throws forth all the different contents of the mountain mingled and molten into one burning mass  he refused to throw off his clothes or to make any preparation for sleep but spent the night in a succession of the most violent bursts of passion in some paroxysms he talked incessantly to his attendants so thick and so rapidly that they were really afraid his senses would give way choosing for his theme the merits and the kindness of heart of the murdered bishop of liege and recalling all the instances of mutual kindness affection and confidence which had passed between them until he had worked himself into such a transport of grief that he threw himself upon his face in the bed and seemed ready to choke with the sobs and tears which he endeavoured to stifle then starting from the couch he gave vent at once to another and more furious mood and traversed the room hastily uttering incoherent threats and still more incoherent oaths of vengeance while stamping with his foot according to his customary action he invoked saint george saint andrew and whomsoever else he held most holy to bear witness that he would take bloody vengeance on de la marck on the people of liege and on him who was the author of the wholethese last threats uttered more obscurely than the others obviously concerned the person of the king and at one time the duke expressed his determination to send for the duke of normandy the brother of the king and with whom louis was on the worst terms in order to compel the captive monarch to surrender either the crown itself or some of its most valuable rights and appanages  another day and night passed in the same stormy and fitful deliberations or rather rapid transitions of passion for the duke scarcely ate or drank never changed his dress and altogether demeaned himself like one in whom rage might terminate in utter insanity by degrees he became more composed and began to hold from time to time consultations with his ministers in which much was proposed but nothing resolved on comines assures us that at one time a courier was mounted in readiness to depart for the purpose of summoning the duke of normandy and in that event the prison of the french monarch would probably have been found as in similar cases a brief road to his grave  at other times when charles had exhausted his fury he sat with his features fixed in stern and rigid immobility like one who broods over some desperate deed to which he is as yet unable to work up his resolution and unquestionably it would have needed little more than an insidious hint from any of the counsellors who attended his person to have pushed the duke to some very desperate action but the nobles of burgundy from the sacred character attached to the person of a king and a lord paramount and from a regard to the public faith as well as that of their duke which had been pledged when louis threw himself into their power were almost unanimously inclined to recommend moderate measures and the arguments which dhymbercourt and de comines had now and then ventured to insinuate during the night were in the cooler hours of the next morning advanced and urged by crevecoeur and others possibly their zeal in behalf of the king might not be entirely disinterested  many as we have mentioned had already experienced the bounty of the king others had either estates or pretensions in france which placed them a little under his influence and it is certain that the treasure which had loaded four mules when the king entered peronne became much lighter in the course of these negotiations  in the course of the third day the count of campobasso brought his italian wit to assist the counsels of charles and well was it for louis that he had not arrived when the duke was in his first fury immediately on his arrival a regular meeting of the dukes counsellors was convened for considering the measures to be adopted in this singular crisis  on this occasion campobasso gave his opinion couched in the apologue of the traveller the adder and the fox and reminded the duke of the advice which reynard gave to the man that he should crush his mortal enemy now that chance had placed his fate at his disposal the fox advised the man who had found a snake by the roadside to kill it he however placed it in his bosom and was afterwards bitten de comines who saw the dukes eyes sparkle at a proposal which his own violence of temper had already repeatedly suggested hastened to state the possibility that louis might not be in fact so directly accessory to the sanguinary action which had been committed at schonwaldt that he might be able to clear himself of the imputation laid to his charge and perhaps to make other atonement for the distractions which his intrigues had occasioned in the dukes dominions and those of his allies and that an act of violence perpetrated on the king was sure to bring both on france and burgundy a train of the most unhappy consequences among which not the least to be feared was that the english might avail themselves of the commotions and civil discord which must needs ensue to repossess themselves of normandy and guyenne and renew those dreadful wars which had only and with difficulty been terminated by the union of both france and burgundy against the common enemy finally he confessed that he did not mean to urge the absolute and free dismissal of louis but only that the duke should avail himself no farther of his present condition than merely to establish a fair and equitable treaty between the countries with such security on the kings part as should make it difficult for him to break his faith or disturb the internal peace of burgundy in the future dhymbercourt crevecoeur and others signified their reprobation of the violent measures proposed by campobasso and their opinion that in the way of treaty more permanent advantages could be obtained and in a manner more honourable for burgundy than by an action which would stain her with a breach of faith and hospitality  the duke listened to these arguments with his looks fixed on the ground and his brow so knitted together as to bring his bushy eyebrows into one mass but when crevecoeur proceeded to say that he did not believe louis either knew of or was accessory to the atrocious act of violence committed at schonwaldt charles raised his head and darting a fierce look at his counsellor exclaimed have you too crevecoeur heard the gold of france clinkmethinks it rings in my council as merrily as ever the bells of saint denisdare any one say that louis is not the fomenter of these feuds in flanders  my gracious lord said crevecoeur my hand has ever been more conversant with steel than with gold and so far am i from holding that louis is free from the charge of having caused the disturbances in flanders that it is not long since in the face of his whole court i charged him with that breach of faith and offered him defiance in your name but although his intrigues have been doubtless the original cause of these commotions i am so far from believing that he authorized the death of the archbishop that i believe one of his emissaries publicly protested against it and i could produce the man were it your graces pleasure to see him  it is our pleasure said the duke saint george can you doubt that we desire to act justly even in the highest flight of our passion we are known for an upright and a just judge we will see france ourselfwe will ourself charge him with our wrongs and ourself state to him the reparation which we expect and demand if he shall be found guiltless of this murder the atonement for other crimes may be more easyif he hath been guilty who shall say that a life of penitence in some retired monastery were not a most deserved and a most merciful doomwho he added kindling as he spoke who shall dare to blame a revenge yet more direct and more speedylet your witness attendwe will to the castle at the hour before noon some articles we will minute down with which he shall comply or woe on his head others shall depend upon the proof break up the council and dismiss yourselves i will but change my dress as this is scarce a fitting trim in which to wait on my most gracious sovereign  with a deep and bitter emphasis on the last expression the duke arose and strode out of the room  louiss safety and what is worse the honour of burgundy depend on a cast of the dice said dhymbercourt to crevecoeur and to de comines haste thee to the castle de comines thou hast a better filed tongue than either crevecoeur or i explain to louis what storm is approachinghe will best know how to pilot himself i trust this life guardsman will say nothing which can aggravate for who knows what may have been the secret commission with which he was charged  the young man said crevecoeur seems bold yet prudent and wary far beyond his years in all which he said to me he was tender of the kings character as of that of the prince whom he serves i trust he will be equally so in the dukes presence i must go seek him and also the young countess of croye  the countessyou told us you had left her at saint bridgets  ay but i was obliged said the count to send for her express by the dukes orders and she has been brought hither on a litter as being unable to travel otherwise she was in a state of the deepest distress both on account of the uncertainty of the fate of her kinswoman the lady hameline and the gloom which overhangs her own guilty as she has been of a feudal delinquency in withdrawing herself from the protection of her liege lord duke charles who is not the person in the world most likely to view with indifference what trenches on his seignorial rights  the information that the young countess was in the hands of charles added fresh and more pointed thorns to louiss reflections he was conscious that by explaining the intrigues by which he had induced the lady hameline and her to resort to peronne she might supply that evidence which he had removed by the execution of zamet maugrabin and he knew well how much such proof of his having interfered with the rights of the duke of burgundy would furnish both motive and pretext for charless availing himself to the uttermost of his present predicament  louis discoursed on these matters with great anxiety to the sieur de comines whose acute and political talents better suited the kings temper than the blunt martial character of crevecoeur or the feudal haughtiness of dhymbercourt  these iron handed soldiers my good friend comines he said to his future historian should never enter a kings cabinet but be left with the halberds and partisans in the antechamber their hands are indeed made for our use but the monarch who puts their heads to any better occupation than that of anvils for his enemies swords and maces ranks with the fool who presented his mistress with a dog leash for a carcanet it is with such as thou philip whose eyes are gifted with the quick and keen sense that sees beyond the exterior surface of affairs that princes should share their council table their cabinetwhat do i saythe most secret recesses of their soul  de comines himself so keen a spirit was naturally gratified with the approbation of the most sagacious prince in europe and he could not so far disguise his internal satisfaction but that louis was aware he had made some impression on him  i would continued he that i had such a servant or rather that i were worthy to have such a one i had not then been in this unfortunate situation which nevertheless i should hardly regret could i but discover any means of securing the services of so experienced a statist  de comines said that all his faculties such as they were were at the service of his most christian majesty saving always his allegiance to his rightful lord duke charles of burgundy  and am i one who would seduce you from that allegiance said louis pathetically alas am i not now endangered by having reposed too much confidence in my vassal and can the cause of feudal good faith be more sacred with any than with me whose safety depends on an appeal to itno philip de cominescontinue to serve charles of burgundy and you will best serve him by bringing round a fair accommodation with louis of france in doing thus you will serve us both and one at least will be grateful i am told your appointments in this court hardly match those of the grand falconer and thus the services of the wisest counsellor in europe are put on a level or rather ranked below those of a fellow who feeds and physics kites france has wide landsher king has much gold allow me my friend to rectify this scandalous inequality the means are not distantpermit me to use them  the king produced a weighty bag of money but de comines more delicate in his sentiments than most courtiers of that time declined the proffer declaring himself perfectly satisfied with the liberality of his native prince and assuring louis that his desire to serve him could not be increased by the acceptance of any such gratuity as he had proposed  singular man exclaimed the king let me embrace the only courtier of his time at once capable and incorruptible wisdom is to be desired more than fine gold and believe me i trust in thy kindness philip at this pinch more than i do in the purchased assistance of many who have received my gifts i know you will not counsel your master to abuse such an opportunity as fortune and to speak plain de comines as my own folly has afforded him  to abuse it by no means answered the historian but most certainly to use it  how and in what degree said louis i am not ass enough to expect that i shall escape without some ransombut let it be a reasonable onereason i am ever willing to listen to at paris or at plessis equally as at peronne  ah but if it like your majesty replied de comines reason at paris or plessis was used to speak in so low and soft a tone of voice that she could not always gain an audience of your majestyat peronne she borrows the speaking trumpet of necessity and her voice becomes lordly and imperative  you are figurative said louis unable to restrain an emotion of peevishness i am a dull blunt man sir of comines i pray you leave your tropes and come to plain ground what does your duke expect of me  i am the bearer of no propositions my lord said de comines the duke will soon explain his own pleasure but some things occur to me as proposals for which your majesty ought to hold yourself prepared as for example the final cession of these towns here upon the somme  i expected so much said louis  that you should disown the liegeois and william de la marck  as willingly as i disclaim hell and satan said louis  ample security will be required by hostages or occupation of fortresses or otherwise that france shall in future abstain from stirring up rebellion among the flemings  it is something new answered the king that a vassal should demand pledges from his sovereign but let that pass too  a suitable and independent appanage for your illustrious brother the ally and friend of my masternormandy or champagne the duke loves your fathers house my liege  so well answered louis that mort dieu hes about to make them all kingsis your budget of hints yet emptied  not entirely answered the counsellor it will certainly be required that your majesty will forbear molesting as you have done of late the duke de bretagne and that you will no longer contest the right which he and other grand feudatories have to strike money to term themselves dukes and princes by the grace of god  in a word to make so many kings of my vassals sir philip would you make a fratricide of meyou remember well my brother charleshe was no sooner duke of guyenne than he diedand what will be left to the descendant and representative of charlemagne after giving away these rich provinces save to be smeared with oil a king priest or prophet was consecrated by means of oil at rheims and to eat their dinner under a high canopy  we will diminish your majestys concern on that score by giving you a companion in that solitary exaltation said philip de comines the duke of burgundy though he claims not at present the title of an independent king desires nevertheless to be freed in future from the abject marks of subjection required of him to the crown of franceit is his purpose to close his ducal coronet with an imperial arch and surmount it with a globe in emblem that his dominions are independent  and how dares the duke of burgundy the sworn vassal of france exclaimed louis starting up and showing an unwonted degree of emotion how dares he propose such terms to his sovereign as by every law of europe should infer a forfeiture of his fief  the doom of forfeiture it would in this case be difficult to enforce answered de comines calmly your majesty is aware that the strict interpretation of the feudal law is becoming obsolete even in the empire and that superior and vassal endeavour to mend their situation in regard to each other as they have power and opportunity  your majestys interferences with the dukes vassals in flanders will prove an exculpation of my masters conduct supposing him to insist that by enlarging his independence france should in future be debarred from any pretext of doing so  comines comines said louis arising again and pacing the room in a pensive manner this is a dreadful lesson on the text vae victis woe to the vanquishedyou cannot mean that the duke will insist on all these hard conditions  at least i would have your majesty be in a condition to discuss them all  yet moderation de comines moderation in success isno one knows better than younecessary to its ultimate advantage  so please your majesty the merit of moderation is i have observed most apt to be extolled by the losing party the winner holds in more esteem the prudence which calls on him not to leave an opportunity unimproved  well we will consider replied the king but at least thou hast reached the extremity of your dukes unreasonable exaction there can remain nothingor if there does for so thy brow intimateswhat is itwhat indeed can it beunless it be my crown which these previous demands if granted will deprive of all its lustre  my lord said de comines what remains to be mentioned is a thing partlyindeed in a great measure within the dukes own power though he means to invite your majestys accession to it for in truth it touches you nearly  pasques dieu exclaimed the king impatiently what is itspeak out sir philipam i to send him my daughter for a concubine or what other dishonour is he to put on me  no dishonour my liege but your majestys cousin the illustrious duke of orleans  ha exclaimed the king but de comines proceeded without heeding the interruption  having conferred his affections on the young countess isabelle de croye the duke expects your majesty will on your part as he on his yield your assent to the marriage and unite with him in endowing the right noble couple with such an appanage as joined to the countesss estates may form a fit establishment for a child of france  never never said the king bursting out into that emotion which he had of late suppressed with much difficulty and striding about in a disordered haste which formed the strongest contrast to the self command which he usually exhibited  never neverlet them bring scissors and shear my hair like that of the parish fool whom i have so richly resembledlet them bid the monastery or the grave yawn for me let them bring red hot basins to sear my eyesaxe or aconitewhatever they will but orleans shall not break his plighted faith to my daughter or marry another while she lives  your majesty said de comines ere you set your mind so keenly against what is proposed will consider your own want of power to prevent it every wise man when he sees a rock giving way withdraws from the bootless attempt of preventing the fall  but a brave man said louis will at least find his grave beneath it de comines consider the great loss the utter destruction such a marriage will bring upon my kingdom recollect i have but one feeble boy and this orleans is the next heirconsider that the church hath consented to his union with joan which unites so happily the interests of both branches of my family think on all this and think too that this union has been the favourite scheme of my whole lifethat i have schemed for it fought for it watched for it prayed for itand sinned for it philip de comines i will not forego it think man thinkpity me in this extremity thy quick brain can speedily find some substitute for this sacrificesome ram to be offered up instead of that project which is dear to me as the patriarchs only son was to him isaac whose father abraham in obedience to the command of god was about to sacrifice him upon the altar when a ram appeared which abraham offered in his stead philip pity meyou at least should know that to men of judgment and foresight the destruction of the scheme on which they have long dwelt and for which they have long toiled is more inexpressibly bitter than the transient grief of ordinary men whose pursuits are but the gratification of some temporary passionyou who know how to sympathize with the deeper the more genuine distress of baffled prudence and disappointed sagacitywill you not feel for me  my lord and king replied de comines i do sympathize with your distress in so far as duty to my master  do not mention him said louis acting or at least appearing to act under an irresistible and headlong impulse which withdrew the usual guard which he maintained over his language charles of burgundy is unworthy of your attachment he who can insult and strike his councillorshe who can distinguish the wisest and most faithful among them by the opprobrious name of booted head  the wisdom of philip de comines did not prevent his having a high sense of personal consequence and he was so much struck with the words which the king uttered as it were in the career of a passion which overleaped ceremony that he could only reply by repetition of the words booted head it is impossible that my master the duke could have so termed the servant who has been at his side since he could mount a palfreyand that too before a foreign monarchit is impossible  louis instantly saw the impression he had made and avoiding alike a tone of condolence which might have seemed insulting and one of sympathy which might have savoured of affectation he said with simplicity and at the same time with dignity my misfortunes make me forget my courtesy else i had not spoken to you of what it must be unpleasant for you to hear but you have in reply taxed me with having uttered impossibilitiesthis touches my honour yet i must submit to the charge if i tell you not the circumstances which the duke laughing until his eyes ran over assigned for the origin of that opprobrious name which i will not offend your ears by repeating thus then it chanced you sir philip de comines were at a hunting match with the duke of burgundy your master and when he alighted after the chase he required your services in drawing off his boots reading in your looks perhaps some natural resentment of this disparaging treatment he ordered you to sit down in turn and rendered you the same office he had just received from you but offended at your understanding him literally he no sooner plucked one of your boots off than he brutally beat it about your head till the blood flowed exclaiming against the insolence of a subject who had the presumption to accept of such a service at the hand of his sovereign and hence he or his privileged fool le glorieux is in the current habit of distinguishing you by the absurd and ridiculous name of tete botte which makes one of the dukes most ordinary subjects of pleasantry  the story is told more bluntly and less probably in the french memoirs of the period which affirm that comines out of a presumption inconsistent with his excellent good sense had asked of charles of burgundy to draw off his boots without having been treated with any previous familiarity to lead to such a freedom i have endeavoured to give the anecdote a turn more consistent with the sense and prudence of the great author concerned s  while louis thus spoke he had the double pleasure of galling to the quick the person whom he addressedan exercise which it was in his nature to enjoy even where he had not as in the present case the apology that he did so in pure retaliationand that of observing that he had at length been able to find a point in de cominess character which might lead him gradually from the interests of burgundy to those of france but although the deep resentment which the offended courtier entertained against his master induced him at a future period to exchange the service of charles for that of louis yet at the present moment he was contented to throw out only some general hints of his friendly inclination towards france which he well knew the king would understand how to interpret and indeed it would be unjust to stigmatize the memory of the excellent historian with the desertion of his master on this occasion although he was certainly now possessed with sentiments much more favourable to louis than when he entered the apartment  he constrained himself to laugh at the anecdote which louis had detailed and then added i did not think so trifling a frolic would have dwelt on the mind of the duke so long as to make it worth telling again some such passage there was of drawing off boots and the like as your majesty knows that the duke is fond of rude play but it has been much exaggerated in his recollection let it pass on  ay let it pass on said the king it is indeed shame it should have detained us a minuteand now sir philip i hope you are french so far as to afford me your best counsel in these difficult affairs you have i am well aware the clew to the labyrinth if you would but impart it  your majesty may command my best advice and service replied de comines under reservation always of my duty to my own master  this was nearly what the courtier had before stated but he now repeated it in a tone so different that whereas louis understood from the former declaration that the reserved duty to burgundy was the prime thing to be considered so he now saw clearly that the emphasis was reversed and that more weight was now given by the speaker to his promise of counsel than to a restriction which seemed interposed for the sake of form and consistency the king resumed his own seat and compelled de comines to sit by him listening at the same time to that statesman as if the words of an oracle sounded in his ears de comines spoke in that low and impressive tone which implies at once great sincerity and some caution and at the same time so slowly as if he was desirous that the king should weigh and consider each individual word as having its own peculiar and determined meaning  the things he said which i have suggested for your majestys consideration harsh as they sound in your ear are but substitutes for still more violent proposals brought forward in the dukes counsels by such as are more hostile to your majesty and i need scarce remind your majesty that the more direct and more violent suggestions find readiest acceptance with our master who loves brief and dangerous measures better than those that are safe but at the same time circuitous  i remember said the king i have seen him swim a river at the risk of drowning though there was a bridge to be found for riding two hundred yards  true sire and he that weighs not his life against the gratification of a moment of impetuous passion will on the same impulse prefer the gratification of his will to the increase of his substantial power  most true replied the king a fool will ever grasp rather at the appearance than the reality of authority and this i know to be true of charles of burgundy but my dear friend de comines what do you infer from these premises  simply this my lord answered the burgundian that as your majesty has seen a skilful angler control a large and heavy fish and finally draw him to land by a single hair which fish had broke through a tackle tenfold stronger had the fisher presumed to strain the line on him instead of giving him head enough for all his wild flourishes even so your majesty by gratifying the duke in these particulars on which he has pitched his ideas of honour and the gratification of his revenge may evade many of the other unpalatable propositions at which i have hinted and whichincluding i must state openly to your majesty some of those through which france would be most especially weakenedwill slide out of his remembrance and attention and being referred to subsequent conferences and future discussion may be altogether eluded  i understand you my good sir philip but to the matter said the king to which of those happy propositions is your duke so much wedded that contradiction will make him unreasonable and untractable  to any or to all of them if it please your majesty on which you may happen to contradict him this is precisely what your majesty must avoid and to take up my former parable you must needs remain on the watch ready to give the duke line enough whenever he shoots away under the impulse of his rage his fury already considerably abated will waste itself if he be unopposed and you will presently find him become more friendly and more tractable  still said the king musing there must be some particular demands which lie deeper at my cousins heart than the other proposals were i but aware of these sir philip  your majesty may make the lightest of his demands the most important simply by opposing it said de comines nevertheless my lord thus far i can say that every shadow of treaty will be broken off if your majesty renounce not william de la marck and the liegeois  i have already said that i will disown them said the king and well they deserve it at my hand the villains have commenced their uproar at a moment that might have cost me my life  he that fires a train of powder replied the historian must expect a speedy explosion of the minebut more than mere disavowal of their cause will be expected of your majesty by duke charles for know that he will demand your majesty assistance to put the insurrection down and your royal presence to witness the punishment which he destines for the rebels  that may scarce consist with our honour de comines said the king  to refuse it will scarcely consist with your majestys safety replied de comines charles is determined to show the people of flanders that no hope nay no promise of assistance from france will save them in their mutinies from the wrath and vengeance of burgundy  but sir philip i will speak plainly answered the king could we but procrastinate the matter might not these rogues of liege make their own part good against duke charles the knaves are numerous and steadycan they not hold out their town against him  with the help of the thousand archers of france whom your majesty promised them they might have done something but  whom i promised them said the king alas good sir philip you much wrong me in saying so  but without whom continued de comines not heeding the interruption as your majesty will not now likely find it convenient to supply them what chance will the burghers have of making good their town in whose walls the large breaches made by charles after the battle of st tron are still unrepaired so that the lances of hainault brabant and burgundy may advance to the attack twenty men in front  the improvident idiots said the king if they have thus neglected their own safety they deserve not my protection pass oni will make no quarrel for their sake  the next point i fear will sit closer to your majestys heart said de comines  ah replied the king you mean that infernal marriage i will not consent to the breach of the contract betwixt my daughter joan and my cousin of orleansit would be wresting the sceptre of france from me and my posterity for that feeble boy the dauphin is a blighted blossom which will wither without fruit this match between joan and orleans has been my thought by day my dream by nighti tell thee sir philip i cannot give it upbesides it is inhuman to require me with my own hand to destroy at once my own scheme of policy and the happiness of a pair brought up for each other  are they then so much attached said de comines  one of them at least said the king and the one for whom i am bound to be most anxious but you smile sir philipyou are no believer in the force of love  nay said de comines if it please you sire i am so little an infidel in that particular that i was about to ask whether it would reconcile you in any degree to your acquiescing in the proposed marriage betwixt the duke of orleans and isabelle de croye were i to satisfy you that the countesss inclinations are so much fixed on another that it is likely it will never be a match  king louis sighed alas he said my good and dear friend from what sepulchre have you drawn such dead comfort her inclinations indeedwhy to speak truth supposing that orleans detested my daughter joan yet but for this ill ravelled web of mischance he must needs have married her so you may conjecture how little chance there is of this damsels being able to refuse him under a similar compulsion and he a child of france besidesah no philip little fear of her standing obstinate against the suit of such a lovervarium et mutabile semper femina woman is always inconstant and capricious philip  your majesty may in the present instance undervalue the obstinate courage of this young lady she comes of a race determinately wilful and i have picked out of crevecoeur that she has formed a romantic attachment to a young squire who to say truth rendered her many services on the road  ha said the kingan archer of my guards by name quentin durward  the same as i think said de comines he was made prisoner along with the countess travelling almost alone together  now our lord and our lady and monseigneur saint martin and monseigneur saint julian be praised every one of them said the king and all laud and honour to the learned galeotti who read in the stars that this youths destiny was connected with mine if the maiden be so attached to him as to make her refractory to the will of burgundy this quentin hath indeed been rarely useful to me  i believe my lord answered the burgundian according to crevecoeurs report that there is some chance of her being sufficiently obstinate besides doubtless the noble duke himself notwithstanding what your majesty was pleased to hint in way of supposition will not willingly renounce his fair cousin to whom he has been long engaged  umph answered the kingbut you have never seen my daughter joana howlet manan absolute owl whom i am ashamed of but let him be only a wise man and marry her i will give him leave to be mad par amours for the fairest lady in franceand now philip have you given me the full map of your masters mind  i have possessed you sire of those particulars on which he is at present most disposed to insist but your majesty well knows that the dukes disposition is like a sweeping torrent which only passes smoothly forward when its waves encounter no opposition and what may be presented to chafe him info fury it is impossible even to guess were more distinct evidence of your majestys practices pardon the phrase when there is so little time for selection with the liegeois and william de la marck to occur unexpectedly the issue might be terriblethere are strange news from that countrythey say la marck hath married hameline the elder countess of croye  that old fool was so mad on marriage that she would have accepted the hand of satan said the king but that la marck beast as he is should have married her rather more surprises me  there is a report also continued de comines that an envoy or herald on la marcks part is approaching peronne this is like to drive the duke frantic with ragei trust that he has no letters or the like to show on your majestys part  letters to a wild boar answered the kingno no sir philip i was no such fool as to cast pearls before swinewhat little intercourse i had with the brute animal was by message in which i always employed such low bred slaves and vagabonds that their evidence would not be received in a trial for robbing a hen roost  i can then only further recommend said de comines taking his leave that your majesty should remain on your guard be guided by events and above all avoid using any language or argument with the duke which may better become your dignity than your present condition  if my dignity said the king grow troublesome to mewhich it seldom doth while there are deeper interests to think ofi have a special remedy for that swelling of the heartit is but looking into a certain ruinous closet sir philip and thinking of the death of charles the simple and it cures me as effectually as the cold bath would cool a feverand now my friend and monitor must thou be gone well sir philip the time must come when thou wilt tire reading lessons of state policy to the bull of burgundy who is incapable of comprehending your most simple argumentif louis of valois then lives thou hast a friend in the court of france i tell thee my philip it would be a blessing to my kingdom should i ever acquire thee who with a profound view of subjects of state hast also a conscience capable of feeling and discerning between right and wrong so help me our lord and lady and monseigneur saint martin oliver and balue have hearts as hardened as the nether millstone and my life is embittered by remorse and penances for the crimes they make me commit thou sir philip possessed of the wisdom of present and past times canst teach how to become great without ceasing to be virtuous  a hard task and which few have attained said the historian but which is yet within the reach of princes who will strive for it meantime sire be prepared for the duke will presently confer with you  louis looked long after philip when he left the apartment and at length burst into a bitter laugh he spoke of fishingi have sent him home a trout properly tickledand he thinks himself virtuous because he took no bribe but contented himself with flattery and promises and the pleasure of avenging an affront to his vanitywhy he is but so much the poorer for the refusal of the moneynot a jot the more honest he must be mine though for he hath the shrewdest head among them well now for nobler game i am to face this leviathan charles who will presently swim hitherward cleaving the deep before him i must like a trembling sailor throw a tub overboard to amuse him but i may one day find the chance of driving a harpoon into his entrails  if a ship is threatened by a school of whales a tub is thrown into the sea to divert their attention hence to mislead an enemy or to create a diversion in order to avoid a danger  scott says that during this interesting scene comines first realized the great powers of louis and entertained from this time a partiality to france which allured him to louiss court in 1472 after the death of louis he fell under the suspicion of that sovereigns daughter and was imprisoned in one of the cages he has so feelingly described he was subjected to trial and exiled from court but was afterwards employed by charles viii in one or two important missions he died at his castle of argenton in 1509 and was regretted as one of the most profound statesmen and the best historian of his age    chapter xxxi the interview       hold fast thy truth young soldiergentle maiden      keep you your promise plightleave age its subtleties      and gray haird policy its maze of falsehood      but be you candid as the morning sky      ere the high sun sucks vapours up to stain it       the trial   on the perilous and important morning which preceded the meeting of the two princes in the castle of peronne oliver le dain did his master the service of an active and skilful agent making interest for louis in every quarter both with presents and promises so that when the dukes anger should blaze forth all around should be interested to smother and not to increase the conflagration he glided like night from tent to tent from house to house making himself friends but not in the apostles sense with the mammon of unrighteousness as was said of another active political agent his finger was in every mans palm his mouth was in every mans ear and for various reasons some of which we have formerly hinted at he secured the favour of many burgundian nobles who either had something to hope or fear from france or who thought that were the power of louis too much reduced their own duke would be likely to pursue the road to despotic authority to which his heart naturally inclined him with a daring and unopposed pace  where oliver suspected his own presence or arguments might be less acceptable he employed that of other servants of the king and it was in this manner that he obtained by the favour of the count de crevecoeur an interview betwixt lord crawford accompanied by le balafre and quentin durward who since he had arrived at peronne had been detained in a sort of honourable confinement private affairs were assigned as the cause of requesting this meeting but it is probable that crevecoeur who was afraid that his master might be stirred up in passion to do something dishonourably violent towards louis was not sorry to afford an opportunity to crawford to give some hints to the young archer which might prove useful to his master  the meeting between the countrymen was cordial and even affecting  thou art a singular youth said crawford stroking the head of young durward as a grandsire might do that of his descendant certes you have had as meikle good fortune as if you had been born with a lucky hood on your head  all comes of his gaining an archers place at such early years said le balafre i never was so much talked of fair nephew because i was five and twenty years old before i was hors de page passed out of the rank of the page  and an ill looking mountainous monster of a page thou wert ludovic said the old commander with a beard like a bakers shool and a back like old wallace wight so called because of his vigour and activity  i fear said quentin with downcast eyes i shall enjoy that title to distinction but a short timesince it is my purpose to resign the service of the archer guard  le balafre was struck almost mute with astonishment and crawfords ancient features gleamed with displeasure the former at length mustered words enough to say resignleave your place in the scottish archerssuch a thing was never dreamed of i would not give up my situation to be made constable of france  hush ludovic said crawford this youngster knows better how to shape his course with the wind than we of the old world do his journey hath given him some pretty tales to tell about king louis and he is turning burgundian that he may make his own little profit by telling them to duke charles  if i thought so said le balafre i would cut his throat with my own hand were he fifty times my sisters son  but you would first inquire whether i deserved to be so treated fair kinsman answered quentin and you my lord know that i am no tale bearer nor shall either question or torture draw out of me a word to king louiss prejudice which may have come to my knowledge while i was in his serviceso far my oath of duty keeps me silent but i will not remain in that services in which besides the perils of fair battle with mine enemies i am to be exposed to the dangers of ambuscade on the part of my friends  nay if he objects to lying in ambuscade said the slow witted le balafre looking sorrowfully at the lord crawford i am afraid my lord that all is over with him i myself have had thirty bushments break upon me and truly i think i have laid in ambuscade twice as often myself it being a favourite practice in our kings mode of making war  it is so indeed ludovic answered lord crawford nevertheless hold your peace for i believe i understand this gear better than you do  i wish to our lady you may my lord answered ludovic but it wounds me to the very midriff to think my sisters son should fear an ambushment  young man said crawford i partly guess your meaning you have met foul play on the road where you travelled by the kings command and you think you have reason to charge him with being the author of it  i have been threatened with foul play in the execution of the kings commission answered quentin but i have had the good fortune to elude itwhether his majesty be innocent or guilty in the matter i leave to god and his own conscience he fed me when i was ahungeredreceived me when i was a wandering stranger i will never load him in his adversity with accusations which may indeed be unjust since i heard them only from the vilest mouths  my dear boymy own lad said crawford taking him in his armsye think like a scot every joint of you like one that will forget a cause of quarrel with a friend whose back is already at the wall and remember nothing of him but his kindness  since my lord crawford has embraced my nephew said ludovic lesly i will embrace him alsothough i would have you to know that to understand the service of an ambushment is as necessary to a soldier as it is to a priest to be able to read his breviary  be hushed ludovic said crawford ye are an ass my friend and ken not the blessing heaven has sent you in this braw callantand now tell me quentin my man hath the king any advice of this brave christian and manly resolution of yours for poor man he had need in his strait to ken what he has to reckon upon had he but brought the whole brigade of guards with himbut gods will be donekens he of your purpose think you  i really can hardly tell answered quentin but i assured his learned astrologer martius galeotti of my resolution to be silent on all that could injure the king with the duke of burgundy the particulars which i suspect i will not under your favour communicate even to your lordship and to the philosopher i was of course far less willing to unfold myself  haay answered lord crawfordoliver did indeed tell me that galeotti prophesied most stoutly concerning the line of conduct you were to hold and i am truly glad to find he did so on better authority than the stars  he prophesy said le balafre laughing the stars never told him that honest ludovic lesly used to help yonder wench of his to spend the fair ducats he flings into her lap  hush ludovic said his captain hush thou beast manif thou dost not respect my gray hairs because i have been een too much of a routier myself respect the boys youth and innocence and let us have no more of such unbecoming daffing  your honour may say your pleasure answered ludovic lesly but by my faith second sighted saunders souplesaw the town souter of glen houlakin was worth galeotti or gallipotty or whatever ye call him twice told for a prophet he foretold that all my sisters children would die some day and he foretold it in the very hour that the youngest was born and that is this lad quentinwho no doubt will one day die to make up the prophecythe mores the pitythe whole curney of them is gone but himself and saunders foretold to myself one day that i should be made by marriage which doubtless will also happen in due time though it hath not yet come to passthough how or when i can hardly guess as i care not myself for the wedded state and quentin is but a lad also saunders predicted  nay said lord crawford unless the prediction be singularly to the purpose i must cut you short my good ludovic for both you and i must now leave your nephew with prayers to our lady to strengthen him in the good mind he is in for this is a case in which a light word might do more mischief than all the parliament of paris could mend my blessing with you my lad and be in no hurry to think of leaving our body for there will be good blows going presently in the eye of day and no ambuscade  and my blessing too nephew said ludovic lesly for since you have satisfied our most noble captain i also am satisfied as in duty bound  stay my lord said quentin and led lord crawford a little apart from his uncle i must not forget to mention that there is a person besides in the world who having learned from me these circumstances which it is essential to king louiss safety should at present remain concealed may not think that the same obligation of secrecy which attaches to me as the kings soldier and as having been relieved by his bounty is at all binding on her  on her replied crawford nay if there be a woman in the secret the lord have mercy for we are all on the rocks again  do not suppose so my lord replied durward but use your interest with the count of crevecoeur to permit me an interview with the countess isabelle of croye who is the party possessed of my secret and i doubt not that i can persuade her to be as silent as i shall unquestionably myself remain concerning whatever may incense the duke against king louis  the old soldier mused for a long timelooked up to the ceiling then down again upon the floorthen shook his headand at length said there is something in all this which by my honour i do not understand the countess isabelle of croyean interview with a lady of her birth blood and possessionsand thou a raw scottish lad so certain of carrying thy point with her thou art either strangely confident my young friend or else you have used your time well upon the journey but by the cross of saint andrew i will move crevecoeur in thy behalf and as he truly fears that duke charles may be provoked against the king to the extremity of falling foul i think it likely he may grant thy request though by my honour it is a comical one  so saying and shrugging up his shoulders the old lord left the apartment followed by ludovic lesly who forming his looks on those of his principal endeavoured though knowing nothing of the cause of his wonder to look as mysterious and important as crawford himself  in a few minutes crawford returned but without his attendant le balafre the old man seemed in singular humour laughing and chuckling to himself in a manner which strangely distorted his stern and rigid features and at the same time shaking his head as at something which he could not help condemning while he found it irresistibly ludicrous my certes countryman said he but you are not blateyou will never lose fair lady for faint heart crevecoeur swallowed your proposal as he would have done a cup of vinegar and swore to me roundly by all the saints in burgundy that were less than the honour of princes and the peace of kingdoms at stake you should never see even so much as the print of the countess isabelles foot on the clay were it not that he had a dame and a fair one i would have thought that he meant to break a lance for the prize himself perhaps he thinks of his nephew the county stephen a countesswould no less serve you to be minting atbut come alongyour interview with her must be briefbut i fancy you know how to make the most of little timeho ho hoby my faith i can hardly chide thee for the presumption i have such a good will to laugh at it  with a brow like scarlet at once offended and disconcerted by the blunt inferences of the old soldier and vexed at beholding in what an absurd light his passion was viewed by every person of experience durward followed lord crawford in silence to the ursuline convent in which the countess was lodged and in the parlour of which he found the count de crevecoeur  so young gallant said the latter sternly you must see the fair companion of your romantic expedition once more it seems  yes my lord count answered quentin firmly and what is more i must see her alone  that shall never be said the count de crevecoeurlord crawford i make you judge this young lady the daughter of my old friend and companion in arms the richest heiress in burgundy has confessed a sort of awhat was i going to sayin short she is a fool and your man at arms here a presumptuous coxcombin a word they shall not meet alone  then will i not speak a single word to the countess in your presence said quentin much delighted you have told me much that i did not dare presumptuous as i may be even to hope  ay truly said my friend said crawford you have been imprudent in your communications and since you refer to me and there is a good stout grating across the parlour i would advise you to trust to it and let them do the worst with their tongues what man the life of a king and many thousands besides is not to be weighed with the chance of two young things whilly whawing in ilk others ears for a minute  so saying he dragged off crevecoeur who followed very reluctantly and cast many angry glances at the young archer as he left the room  in a moment after the countess isabelle entered on the other side of the grate and no sooner saw quentin alone in the parlour than she stopped short and cast her eyes on the ground for the space of half a minute yet why should i be ungrateful she said because others are unjustly suspiciousmy friendmy preserver i may almost say so much have i been beset by treachery my only faithful and constant friend  as she spoke thus she extended her hand to him through the grate nay suffered him to retain it until he had covered it with kisses not unmingled with tears she only said durward were we ever to meet again i would not permit this folly  if it be considered that quentin had guided her through so many perilsthat he had been in truth her only faithful and zealous protector perhaps my fair readers even if countesses and heiresses should be of the number will pardon the derogation  but the countess extricated her hand at length and stepping a pace back from the grate asked durward in a very embarrassed tone what boon he had to ask of herfor that you have a request to make i have learned from the old scottish lord who came here but now with my cousin of crevecoeur let it be but reasonable she said but such as poor isabelle can grant with duty and honour uninfringed and you cannot tax my slender powers too highly but oh do not speak hastilydo not say she added looking around with timidity aught that might if overheard do prejudice to us both  fear not noble lady said quentin sorrowfully it is not here that i can forget the distance which fate has placed between us or expose you to the censures of your proud kindred as the object of the most devoted love to one poorer and less powerfulnot perhaps less noblethan themselves let that pass like a dream of the night to all but one bosom where dream as it is it will fill up the room of all existing realities  hush hush said isabelle for your own sakefor minebe silent on such a theme tell me rather what it is you have to ask of me  forgiveness to one replied quentin who for his own selfish views hath conducted himself as your enemy  i trust i forgive all my enemies answered isabelle but oh durward through what scenes have your courage and presence of mind protected meyonder bloody hallthe good bishopi knew not till yesterday half the horrors i had unconsciously witnessed  do not think on them said quentin who saw the transient colour which had come to her cheek during their conference fast fading into the most deadly palenessdo not look back but look steadily forward as they needs must who walk in a perilous road hearken to me king louis deserves nothing better at your hand of all others than to be proclaimed the wily and insidious politician which he really is but to tax him as the encourager of your flightstill more as the author of a plan to throw you into the hands of de la marckwill at this moment produce perhaps the kings death or dethronement and at all events the most bloody war between france and burgundy which the two countries have ever been engaged in  these evils shall not arrive for my sake if they can be prevented said the countess isabelle and indeed your slightest request were enough to make me forego my revenge were that at any time a passion which i deeply cherish is it possible i would rather remember king louiss injuries than your invaluable servicesyet how is this to bewhen i am called before my sovereign the duke of burgundy i must either stand silent or speak the truth the former would be contumacy and to a false tale you will not desire me to train my tongue  surely not said durward but let your evidence concerning louis be confined to what you yourself positively know to be truth and when you mention what others have reported no matter how credibly let it be as reports only and beware of pledging your own personal evidence to that which though you may fully believe you cannot personally know to be true the assembled council of burgundy cannot refuse to a monarch the justice which in my country is rendered to the meanest person under accusation they must esteem him innocent until direct and sufficient proof shall demonstrate his guilt now what does not consist with your own certain knowledge should be proved by other evidence than your report from hearsay  i think i understand you said the countess isabelle  i will make my meaning plainer said quentin and was illustrating it accordingly by more than one instance when the convent bell tolled  that said the countess is a signal that we must partpart for everbut do not forget me durward i will never forget youyour faithful services  she could not speak more but again extended her hand which was again pressed to his lips and i know not how it was that in endeavouring to withdraw her hand the countess came so close to the grating that quentin was encouraged to press the adieu on her lips the young lady did not chide himperhaps there was no time for crevecoeur and crawford who had been from some loophole eye witnesses if not ear witnesses also of what was passing rushed into the apartment the first in a towering passion the latter laughing and holding the count back  to your chamber young mistressto your chamber exclaimed the count to isabelle who flinging down her veil retired in all hastewhich should be exchanged for a cell and bread and waterand you gentle sir who are so malapert the time will come when the interests of kings and kingdoms may not be connected with such as you are and you shall then learn the penalty of your audacity in raising your beggarly eyes  hush hushenough saidrein uprein up said the old lord and you quentin i command you to be silent and begone to your quartersthere is no such room for so much scorn neither sir count of crevecoeur that i must say now he is out of hearingquentin durward is as much a gentleman as the king only as the spaniard says not so rich he is as noble as myself and i am chief of my name tush tush man you must not speak to us of penalties  my lord my lord said crevecoeur impatiently the insolence of these foreign mercenaries is proverbial and should receive rather rebuke than encouragement from you who are their leader  my lord count answered crawford i have ordered my command for these fifty years without advice either from frenchman or burgundian and i intend to do so under your favour so long as i shall continue to hold it  well well my lord said crevecoeur i meant you no disrespect your nobleness as well as your age entitle you to be privileged in your impatience and for these young people i am satisfied to overlook the past since i will take care that they never meet again  do not take that upon your salvation crevecoeur said the old lord laughing mountains it is said may meet and why not mortal creatures that have legs and life and love to put those legs in motion yon kiss crevecoeur came tenderly offmethinks it was ominous  you are striving again to disturb my patience said crevecoeur but i will not give you that advantage over mehark they toll the summons to the castlean awful meeting of which god only can foretell the issue  this issue i can foretell said the old scottish lord that if violence is to be offered to the person of the king few as his friends are and surrounded by his shall neither fall alone nor unavenged and grieved i am that his own positive orders have prevented my taking measures to prepare for such an issue  my lord of crawford said the burgundian to anticipate such evil is the sure way to give occasion to it obey the orders of your royal master and give no pretext for violence by taking hasty offence and you will find that the day will pass over more smoothly than you now conjecture    chapter xxxii the investigation       me rather had my heart might feel your love      than my displeased eye see your courtesy      up cousin upyour heart is up i know      thus high at leastalthough your knee       king richard ii   at the first toll of the bell which was to summon the great nobles of burgundy together in council with the very few french peers who could be present on the occasion duke charles followed by a part of his train armed with partisans and battle axes entered the hall of herberts tower in the castle of peronne king louis who had expected the visit arose and made two steps towards the duke and then remained standing with an air of dignity which in spite of the meanness of his dress and the familiarity of his ordinary manners he knew very well how to assume when he judged it necessary upon the present important crisis the composure of his demeanour had an evident effect upon his rival who changed the abrupt and hasty step with which he entered the apartment into one more becoming a great vassal entering the presence of his lord paramount apparently the duke had formed the internal resolution to treat louis in the outset at least with the formalities due to his high station but at the same time it was evident that in doing so he put no small constraint upon the fiery impatience of his own disposition and was scarce able to control the feelings of resentment and the thirst of revenge which boiled in his bosom hence though he compelled himself to use the outward acts and in some degree the language of courtesy and reverence his colour came and went rapidlyhis voice was abrupt hoarse and brokenhis limbs shook as if impatient of the curb imposed on his motionshe frowned and bit his lip until the blood cameand every look and movement showed that the most passionate prince who ever lived was under the dominion of one of his most violent paroxysms of fury  the king marked this war of passion with a calm and untroubled eye for though he gathered from the dukes looks a foretaste of the bitterness of death which he dreaded alike as a mortal and a sinful man yet he was resolved like a wary and skilful pilot neither to suffer himself to be disconcerted by his own fears nor to abandon the helm while there was a chance of saving the vessel by adroit pilotage therefore when the duke in a hoarse and broken tone said something of the scarcity of his accommodations he answered with a smile that he could not complain since he had as yet found herberts tower a better residence than it had proved to one of his ancestors  they told you the tradition then said charles  yeshere he was slainbut it was because he refused to take the cowl and finish his days in a monastery  the more fool he said louis affecting unconcern since he gained the torment of being a martyr without the merit of being a saint  i come said the duke to pray your majesty to attend a high council at which tidings of weight are to be deliberated upon concerning the welfare of france and burgundy you will presently meet themthat is if such be your pleasure  nay my fair cousin said the king never strain courtesy so far as to entreat what you may so boldly commandto council since such is your graces pleasure we are somewhat shorn of our train he added looking upon the small suite that arranged themselves to attend him but you cousin must shine out for us both  marshalled by toison dor chief of the heralds of burgundy the princes left the earl herberts tower and entered the castle yard which louis observed was filled with the dukes bodyguard and men at arms splendidly accoutred and drawn up in martial array crossing the court they entered the council hall which was in a much more modern part of the building than that of which louis had been the tenant and though in disrepair had been hastily arranged for the solemnity of a public council two chairs of state were erected under the same canopy that for the king being raised two steps higher than the one which the duke was to occupy about twenty of the chief nobility sat arranged in due order on either hand of the chair of state and thus when both the princes were seated the person for whose trial as it might be called the council was summoned held the highest place and appeared to preside in it  it was perhaps to get rid of this inconsistency and the scruples which might have been inspired by it that duke charles having bowed slightly to the royal chair bluntly opened the sitting with the following words  my good vassals and councillors it is not unknown to you what disturbances have arisen in our territories both in our fathers time and in our own from the rebellion of vassals against superiors and subjects against their princes and lately we have had the most dreadful proof of the height to which these evils have arrived in our case by the scandalous flight of the countess isabelle of croye and her aunt the lady hameline to take refuge with a foreign power thereby renouncing their fealty to us and inferring the forfeiture of their fiefs and in another more dreadful and deplorable instance by the sacrilegious and bloody murder of our beloved brother and ally the bishop of liege and the rebellion of that treacherous city which was but too mildly punished for the last insurrection we have been informed that these sad events may be traced not merely to the inconstancy and folly of women and the presumption of pampered citizens but to the agency of foreign power and the interference of a mighty neighbour from whom if good deeds could merit any return in kind burgundy could have expected nothing but the most sincere and devoted friendship if this should prove truth said the duke setting his teeth and pressing his heel against the ground what consideration shall withhold usthe means being in our powerfrom taking such measures as shall effectually and at the very source close up the main spring from which these evils have yearly flowed on us  the duke had begun his speech with some calmness but he elevated his voice at the conclusion and the last sentence was spoken in a tone which made all the councillors tremble and brought a transient fit of paleness across the kings cheek he instantly recalled his courage however and addressed the council in his turn in a tone evincing so much ease and composure that the duke though he seemed desirous to interrupt or stop him found no decent opportunity to do so  nobles of france and of burgundy he said knights of the holy spirit and of the golden fleece since a king must plead his cause as an accused person he cannot desire more distinguished judges than the flower of nobleness and muster and pride of chivalry our fair cousin of burgundy hath but darkened the dispute between us in so far as his courtesy has declined to state it in precise terms i who have no cause for observing such delicacy nay whose condition permits me not to do so crave leave to speak more precisely it is to us my lordsto us his liege lord his kinsman his ally that unhappy circumstances perverting our cousinss clear judgment and better nature have induced him to apply the hateful charges of seducing his vassals from their allegiance stirring up the people of liege to revolt and stimulating the outlawed william de la marck to commit a most cruel and sacrilegious murder nobles of france and burgundy i might truly appeal to the circumstances in which i now stand as being in themselves a complete contradiction of such an accusation for is it to be supposed that having the sense of a rational being left me i should have thrown myself unreservedly into the power of the duke of burgundy while i was practising treachery against him such as could not fail to be discovered and which being discovered must place me as i now stand in the power of a justly exasperated prince the folly of one who should seat himself quietly down to repose on a mine after he had lighted the match which was to cause instant explosion would have been wisdom compared to mine i have no doubt that amongst the perpetrators of those horrible treasons at schonwaldt villains have been busy with my namebut am i to be answerable who have given them no right to use itif two silly women disgusted on account of some romantic cause of displeasure sought refuge at my court does it follow that they did so by my directionit will be found when inquired into that since honour and chivalry forbade my sending them back prisoners to the court of burgundywhich i think gentlemen no one who wears the collar of these orders would suggestthat i came as nearly as possible to the same point by placing them in the hands of the venerable father in god who is now a saint in heaven  here louis seemed much affected and pressed his kerchief to his eyes in the hands i say of a member of my own family and still more closely united with that of burgundy whose situation exalted condition in the church and alas whose numerous virtues qualified him to be the protector of these unhappy wanderers for a little while and the mediator betwixt them and their liege lord i say therefore the only circumstances which seem in my brother of burgundys hasty view of this subject to argue unworthy suspicions against me are such as can be explained on the fairest and most honourable motives and i say moreover that no one particle of credible evidence can be brought to support the injurious charges which have induced my brother to alter his friendly looks towards one who came to him in full confidence of friendshiphave caused him to turn his festive hall into a court of justice and his hospitable apartments into a prison  my lord my lord said charles breaking in as soon as the king paused for your being here at a time so unluckily coinciding with the execution of your projects i can only account by supposing that those who make it their trade to impose on others do sometimes egregiously delude themselves the engineer is sometimes killed by the springing of his own petardfor what is to follow let it depend on the event of this solemn inquirybring hither the countess isabelle of croye  as the young lady was introduced supported on the one side by the countess of crevecoeur who had her husbands commands to that effect and on the other by the abbess of the ursuline convent charles exclaimed with his usual harshness of voice and manner so sweet princessyou who could scarce find breath to answer us when we last laid our just and reasonable commands on you yet have had wind enough to run as long a course as ever did hunted doewhat think you of the fair work you have made between two great princes and two mighty countries that have been like to go to war for your baby face  the publicity of the scene and the violence of charless manner totally overcame the resolution which isabelle had formed of throwing herself at the dukes feet and imploring him to take possession of her estates and permit her to retire into a cloister she stood motionless like a terrified female in a storm who hears the thunder roll on every side of her and apprehends in every fresh peal the bolt which is to strike her dead the countess of crevecoeur a woman of spirit equal to her birth and to the beauty which she preserved even in her matronly years judged it necessary to interfere  my lord duke she said my fair cousin is under my protection i know better than your grace how women should be treated and we will leave this presence instantly unless you use a tone and language more suitable to our rank and sex  the duke burst out into a laugh crevecoeur he said thy tameness hath made a lordly dame of thy countess but that is no affair of mine give a seat to yonder simple girl to whom so far from feeling enmity i design the highest grace and honoursit down mistress and tell us at your leisure what fiend possessed you to fly from your native country and embrace the trade of a damsel adventurous  with much pain and not without several interruptions isabelle confessed that being absolutely determined against a match proposed to her by the duke of burgundy she had indulged the hope of obtaining protection of the court of france  and under protection of the french monarch said charles of that doubtless you were well assured  i did indeed so think myself assured said the countess isabelle otherwise i had not taken a step so decided  here charles looked upon louis with a smile of inexpressible bitterness which the king supported with the utmost firmness except that his lip grew something whiter than it was wont to be  but my information concerning king louiss intentions towards us continued the countess after a short pause was almost entirely derived from my unhappy aunt the lady hameline and her opinions were formed upon the assertions and insinuations of persons whom i have since discovered to be the vilest traitors and most faithless wretches in the world  she then stated in brief terms what she had since come to learn of the treachery of marthon and of hayraddin maugrabin and added that she entertained no doubt that the elder maugrabin called zamet the original adviser of their flight was capable of every species of treachery as well as of assuming the character of an agent of louis without authority  there was a pause while the countess had continued her story which she prosecuted though very briefly from the time she left the territories of burgundy in company with her aunt until the storming of schonwaldt and her final surrender to the count of crevecoeur all remained mute after she had finished her brief and broken narrative and the duke of burgundy bent his fierce dark eyes on the ground like one who seeks for a pretext to indulge his passion but finds none sufficiently plausible to justify himself in his own eyes  the mole he said at length looking upwards winds not his dark subterranean path beneath our feet the less certainly that we though conscious of his motions cannot absolutely trace them yet i would know of king louis wherefore he maintained these ladies at his court had they not gone thither by his own invitation  i did not so entertain them fair cousin answered the king out of compassion indeed i received them in privacy but took an early opportunity of placing them under the protection of the late excellent bishop your own ally and who was may god assoil him a better judge than i or any secular prince how to reconcile the protection due to fugitives with the duty which a king owes to his ally from whose dominions they have fled i boldly ask this young lady whether my reception of them was cordial or whether it was not on the contrary such as made them express regret that they had made my court their place of refuge  so much was it otherwise than cordial answered the countess that it induced me at least to doubt how far it was possible that your majesty should have actually given the invitation of which we had been assured by those who called themselves your agents since supposing them to have proceeded only as they were duly authorized it would have been hard to reconcile your majestys conduct with that to be expected from a king a knight and a gentleman  the countess turned her eyes to the king as she spoke with a look which was probably intended as a reproach but the breast of louis was armed against all such artillery on the contrary waving slowly his expanded hands and looking around the circle he seemed to make a triumphant appeal to all present upon the testimony borne to his innocence in the countesss reply  burgundy meanwhile cast on him a look which seemed to say that if in some degree silenced he was as far as ever from being satisfied and then said abruptly to the countess methinks fair mistress in this account of your wanderings you have forgot all mention of certain love passagesso ho blushing alreadycertain knights of the forest by whom your quiet was for a time interrupted wellthat incident hath come to our ear and something we may presently form out of ittell me king louis were it not well before this vagrant helen of troy the wife of menelaus she was carried to troy by paris and thus was the cause of the trojan war or of croye set more kings by the ears were it not well to carve out a fitting match for her  king louis though conscious what ungrateful proposal was likely to be made next gave a calm and silent assent to what charles said but the countess herself was restored to courage by the very extremity of her situation she quitted the arm of the countess of crevecoeur on which she had hitherto leaned came forward timidly yet with an air of dignity and kneeling before the dukes throne thus addressed him noble duke of burgundy and my liege lord i acknowledge my fault in having withdrawn myself from your dominions without your gracious permission and will most humbly acquiesce in any penalty you are pleased to impose i place my lands and castles at your rightful disposal and pray you only of your own bounty and for the sake of my memory to allow the last of the line of croye out of her large estate such a moderate maintenance as may find her admission into a convent for the remainder of her life  what think you sire of the young persons petition to us said the duke addressing louis  as of a holy and humble motion said the king which doubtless comes from that grace which ought not to be resisted or withstood  the humble and lowly shall be exalted said charles arise countess isabellewe mean better for you than you have devised for yourself we mean neither to sequestrate your estates nor to abase your honours but on the contrary will add largely to both  alas my lord said the countess continuing on her knees it is even that well meant goodness which i fear still more than your graces displeasure since it compels me  saint george of burgundy said duke charles is our will to be thwarted and our commands disputed at every turn up i say minion and withdraw for the presentwhen we have time to think of thee we will so order matters that teste saint gris you shall either obey us or do worse  notwithstanding this stern answer the countess isabelle remained at his feet and would probably by her pertinacity have driven him to say upon the spot something yet more severe had not the countess of crevecoeur who better knew that princes humour interfered to raise her young friend and to conduct her from the hall  quentin durward was now summoned to appear and presented himself before the king and duke with that freedom distant alike from bashful reserve and intrusive boldness which becomes a youth at once well born and well nurtured who gives honour where it is due but without permitting himself to be dazzled or confused by the presence of those to whom it is to be rendered his uncle had furnished him with the means of again equipping himself in the arms and dress of an archer of the scottish guard and his complexion mien and air suited in an uncommon degree his splendid appearance his extreme youth too prepossessed the councillors in his favour the rather that no one could easily believe that the sagacious louis would have chosen so very young a person to become the confidant of political intrigues and thus the king enjoyed in this as in other cases considerable advantage from his singular choice of agents both as to age and rank where such election seemed least likely to be made at the command of the duke sanctioned by that of louis quentin commenced an account of his journey with the ladies of croye to the neighbourhood of liege premising a statement of king louiss instructions which were that he should escort them safely to the castle of the bishop  and you obeyed my orders accordingly said the king  i did sire replied the scot  you omit a circumstance said the duke you were set upon in the forest by two wandering knights  it does not become me to remember or to proclaim such an incident said the youth blushing ingenuously  but it doth not become me to forget it said the duke of orleans this youth discharged his commission manfully and maintained his trust in a manner that i shall long remembercome to my apartment archer when this matter is over and thou shalt find i have not forgot thy brave bearing while i am glad to see it is equalled by thy modesty  and come to mine said dunois i have a helmet for thee since i think i owe thee one  quentin bowed low to both and the examination was resumed at the command of duke charles he produced the written instructions which he had received for the direction of his journey  did you follow these instructions literally soldier said the duke  no if it please your grace replied quentin they directed me as you may be pleased to observe to cross the maes near namur whereas i kept the left bank as being both the nigher and the safer road to liege  and wherefore that alteration said the duke  because i began to suspect the fidelity of my guide answered quentin  now mark the questions i have next to ask thee said the duke reply truly to them and fear nothing from the resentment of any one but if you palter or double in your answers i will have thee hung alive in an iron chain from the steeple of the market house where thou shalt wish for death for many an hour ere he come to relieve you  there was a deep silence ensued at length having given the youth time as he thought to consider the circumstances in which he was placed the duke demanded to know of durward who his guide was by whom supplied and wherefore he had been led to entertain suspicion of him to the first of these questions quentin durward answered by naming hayraddin maugrabin the bohemian to the second that the guide had been recommended by tristan lhermite and in reply to the third point he mentioned what had happened in the franciscan convent near namur how the bohemian had been expelled from the holy house and how jealous of his behaviour he had dogged him to a rendezvous with one of william de la marcks lanzknechts where he overheard them arrange a plan for surprising the ladies who were under his protection  now hark said the duke and once more remember thy life depends on thy veracity did these villains mention their having this kingsi mean this very king louis of frances authority for their scheme of surprising the escort and carrying away the ladies  if such infamous fellows had said replied quentin i know not how i should have believed them having the word of the king himself to place in opposition to theirs  louis who had listened hitherto with most earnest attention could not help drawing his breath deeply when he heard durwards answer in the manner of one from whose bosom a heavy weight has been at once removed the duke again looked disconcerted and moody and returning to the charge questioned quentin still more closely whether he did not understand from these mens private conversation that the plots which they meditated had king louiss sanction  i repeat that i heard nothing which could authorize me to say so answered the young man who though internally convinced of the kings accession to the treachery of hayraddin yet held it contrary to his allegiance to bring forward his own suspicions on the subject and if i had heard such men make such an assertion i again say that i would not have given their testimony weight against the instructions of the king himself  thou art a faithful messenger said the duke with a sneer and i venture to say that in obeying the kings instructions thou hast disappointed his expectations in a manner that thou mightst have smarted for but that subsequent events have made thy bull headed fidelity seem like good service  i understand you not my lord said quentin durward all i know is that my master king louis sent me to protect these ladies and that i did so accordingly to the extent of my ability both in the journey to schonwaldt and through the subsequent scenes which took place i understood the instructions of the king to be honourable and i executed them honourably had they been of a different tenor they would not have suited one of my name or nation  fier comme an ecossois said charles who however disappointed at the tenor of durwards reply was not unjust enough to blame him for his boldness but hark thee archer what instructions were those which made thee as some sad fugitives from schonwaldt have informed us parade the streets of liege at the head of those mutineers who afterwards cruelly murdered their temporal prince and spiritual father and what harangue was it which thou didst make after that murder was committed in which you took upon you as agent for louis to assume authority among the villains who had just perpetrated so great a crime  my lord said quentin there are many who could testify that i assumed not the character of an envoy of france in the town of liege but had it fixed upon me by the obstinate clamours of the people themselves who refused to give credit to any disclamation which i could make this i told to those in the service of the bishop when i had made my escape from the city and recommended their attention to the security of the castle which might have prevented the calamity and horror of the succeeding night it is no doubt true that i did in the extremity of danger avail myself of the influence which my imputed character gave me to save the countess isabelle to protect my own life and so far as i could to rein in the humour for slaughter which had already broke out in so dreadful an instance i repeat and will maintain it with my body that i had no commission of any kind from the king of france respecting the people of liege far less instructions to instigate them to mutiny and that finally when i did avail myself of that imputed character it was as if i had snatched up a shield to protect myself in a moment of emergency and used it as i should surely have done for the defence of myself and others without inquiring whether i had a right to the heraldic emblazonments which it displayed  and therein my young companion and prisoner said crevecoeur unable any longer to remain silent acted with equal spirit and good sense and his doing so cannot justly be imputed as blame to king louis  there was a murmur of assent among the surrounding nobility which sounded joyfully in the ears of king louis whilst it gave no little offence to charles he rolled his eyes angrily around and the sentiments so generally expressed by so many of his highest vassals and wisest councillors would not perhaps have prevented his giving way to his violent and despotic temper had not de comines who foresaw the danger prevented it by suddenly announcing a herald from the city of liege  a herald from weavers and nailers exclaimed the duke but admit him instantly by our lady i will learn from this same herald something farther of his employers hopes and projects than this young french scottish man at arms seems desirous to tell me    chapter xxxiii the herald       arielhark they roar      prospero let them be hunted soundly       the tempest   there was room made in the assembly and no small curiosity evinced by those present to see the herald whom the insurgent liegeois had ventured to send to so haughty a prince as the duke of burgundy while in such high indignation against them for it must be remembered that at this period heralds were only dispatched from sovereign princes to each other upon solemn occasions and that the inferior nobility employed pursuivants a lower rank of officers at arms it may be also noticed in passing that louis xi an habitual derider of whatever did not promise real power or substantial advantage was in especial a professed contemner of heralds and heraldry red blue and green with all their trumpery to which the pride of his rival charles which was of a very different kind attached no small degree of ceremonious importance  the herald who was now introduced into the presence of the monarchs was dressed in a tabard or coat embroidered with the arms of his master in which the boars head made a distinguished appearance in blazonry which in the opinion of the skilful was more showy than accurate the rest of his dressa dress always sufficiently tawdrywas overcharged with lace embroidery and ornament of every kind and the plume of feathers which he wore was so high as if intended to sweep the roof of the hall in short the usual gaudy splendour of the heraldic attire was caricatured and overdone the boars head was not only repeated on every part of his dress but even his bonnet was formed into that shape and it was represented with gory tongue and bloody tusks or in proper language langed and dentated gules and there was something in the mans appearance which seemed to imply a mixture of boldness and apprehension like one who has undertaken a dangerous commission and is sensible that audacity alone can carry him through it with safety something of the same mixture of fear and effrontery was visible in the manner in which he paid his respects and he showed also a grotesque awkwardness not usual amongst those who were accustomed to be received in the presence of princes  who art thou in the devils name was the greeting with which charles the bold received this singular envoy  i am rouge sanglier answered the herald the officer at arms of william de la marck by the grace of god and the election of the chapter prince bishop of liege  ha exclaimed charles but as if subduing his own passion he made a sign to him to proceed  and in right of his wife the honourable countess hameline of croye count of croye and lord of bracquemont  the utter astonishment of duke charles at the extremity of boldness with which these titles were announced in his presence seemed to strike him dumb and the herald conceiving doubtless that he had made a suitable impression by the annunciation of his character proceeded to state his errand  annuncio vobis gaudium magnum i announce to you a great joy he said i let you charles of burgundy and earl of flanders to know in my masters name that under favour of a dispensation of our holy father of rome presently expected and appointing a fitting substitute ad sacra to the sacred office he proposes to exercise at once the office of prince bishop and maintain the rights of count of croye  the duke of burgundy at this and other pauses in the heralds speech only ejaculated ha or some similar interjection without making any answer and the tone of exclamation was that of one who though surprised and moved is willing to hear all that is to be said ere he commits himself by making an answer to the further astonishment of all who were present he forbore from his usual abrupt and violent gesticulations remaining with the nail of his thumb pressed against his teeth which was his favourite attitude when giving attention and keeping his eyes bent on the ground as if unwilling to betray the passion which might gleam in them  the envoy therefore proceeded boldly and unabashed in the delivery of his message in the name therefore of the prince bishop of liege and count of croye i am to require of you duke charles to desist from those pretensions and encroachments which you have made on the free and imperial city of liege by connivance with the late louis of bourbon unworthy bishop thereof  ha again exclaimed the duke  also to restore the banners of the community which you took violently from the town to the number of six and thirtyto rebuild the breaches in their walls and restore the fortifications which you tyrannically dismantledand to acknowledge my master william de la marck as prince bishop lawfully elected in a free chapter of canons of which behold the proces verbal  have you finished said the duke  not yet replied the envoy i am farther to require your grace on the part of the said right noble and venerable prince bishop and count that you do presently withdraw the garrison from the castle of bracquemont and other places of strength belonging to the earldom of croye which have been placed there whether in your own most gracious name or in that of isabelle calling herself countess of croye or any other until it shall be decided by the imperial diet whether the fiefs in question shall not pertain to the sister of the late count my most gracious lady hameline rather than to his daughter in respect of the jus emphyteusis a permanent tenure of land upon condition of cultivating it properly and paying a stipulated rent a sort of fee farm or copyhold  your master is most learned replied the duke  yet continued the herald the noble and venerable prince and count will be disposed all other disputes betwixt burgundy and liege being settled to fix upon the lady isabelle such an appanage as may become her quality  he is generous and considerate said the duke in the same tone  now by a poor fools conscience said le glorieux apart to the count of crevecoeur i would rather be in the worst cows hide that ever died of the murrain than in that fellows painted coat the poor man goes on like drunkards who only look to the ether pot and not to the score which mine host chalks up behind the lattice  have you yet done said the duke to the herald  one word more answered rouge sanglier from my noble and venerable lord aforesaid respecting his worthy and trusty ally the most christian king  ha exclaimed the duke starting and in a fiercer tone than he had yet used but checking himself he instantly composed himself again to attention  which most christian kings royal person it is rumoured that you charles of burgundy have placed under restraint contrary to your duty as a vassal of the crown of france and to the faith observed among christian sovereigns for which reason my said noble and venerable master by my mouth charges you to put his royal and most christian ally forthwith at freedom or to receive the defiance which i am authorized to pronounce to you  have you yet done said the duke  i have answered the herald and await your graces answer trusting it may be such as will save the effusion of christian blood  now by saint george of burgundy said the duke but ere he could proceed farther louis arose and struck in with a tone of so much dignity and authority that charles could not interrupt him  under your favour fair cousin of burgundy said the king we ourselves crave priority of voice in replying to this insolent fellowsirrah herald or whatever thou art carry back notice to the perjured outlaw and murderer william de la marck that the king of france will be presently before liege for the purpose of punishing the sacrilegious murderer of his late beloved kinsman louis of bourbon and that he proposes to gibbet de la marck alive for the insolence of terming himself his ally and putting his royal name into the mouth of one of his own base messengers  add whatever else on my part said charles which it may not misbecome a prince to send to a common thief and murdererand begoneyet staynever herald went from the court of burgundy without having cause to cry largesselet him be scourged till the bones are laid bare  nay but if it please your grace said crevecoeur and dhymbercourt together he is a herald and so far privileged  it is you messires replied the duke who are such owls as to think that the tabard makes the herald i see by that fellows blazoning he is a mere impostor let toison dor step forward and question him in your presence  in spite of his natural effrontery the envoy of the wild boar of ardennes now became pale and that notwithstanding some touches of paint with which he had adorned his countenance toison dor the chief herald as we have elsewhere said of the duke and king at arms within his dominions stepped forward with the solemnity of one who knew what was due to his office and asked his supposed brother in what college he had studied the science which he professed  i was bred a pursuivant at the heraldic college of ratisbon answered rouge sanglier and received the diploma of ehrenhold a herald from that same learned fraternity  you could not derive it from a source more worthy answered toison dor bowing still lower than he had done before and if i presume to confer with you on the mysteries of our sublime science in obedience to the orders of the most gracious duke it is not in hopes of giving but of receiving knowledge  go to said the duke impatiently leave off ceremony and ask him some question that may try his skill  it were injustice to ask a disciple of the worthy college of arms at ratisbon if he comprehendeth the common terms of blazonry said toison dor but i may without offence crave of rouge sanglier to say if he is instructed in the more mysterious and secret terms of the science by which the more learned do emblematically and as it were parabolically express to each other what is conveyed to others in the ordinary language taught in the very accidence as it were of heraldry  i understand one sort of blazonry as well as another answered rouge sanglier boldly but it may be we have not the same terms in germany which you have here in flanders  alas that you will say so replied toison dor our noble science which is indeed the very banner of nobleness and glory of generosity being the same in all christian countries nay known and acknowledged even by the saracens and moors i would therefore pray of you to describe what coat you will after the celestial fashion that is by the planets  blazon it yourself as you will said rouge sanglier i will do no such apish tricks upon commandment as an ape is made to come aloft  show him a coat and let him blazon it his own way said the duke and if he fails i promise him that his back shall be gules azure and sable  here said the herald of burgundy taking from his pouch a piece of parchment is a scroll in which certain considerations led me to prick down after my own poor fashion an ancient coat i will pray my brother if indeed he belong to the honourable college of arms at ratisbon to decipher it in fitting language  le glorieux who seemed to take great pleasure in this discussion had by this time bustled himself close up to the two heralds i will help thee good fellow said he to rouge sanglier as he looked hopelessly upon the scroll this my lords and masters represents the cat looking out at the dairy window  this sally occasioned a laugh which was something to the advantage of rouge sanglier as it led toison dor indignant at the misconstruction of his drawing to explain it as the coat of arms assumed by childebert king of france after he had taken prisoner gandemar king of burgundy representing an ounce or tiger cat the emblem of the captive prince behind a grating or as toison dor technically defined it sable a musion a tiger cat a term of heraldry passant or oppressed with a trellis gules cloue of the second  by my bauble said le glorieux if the cat resemble burgundy she has the right side of the grating nowadays  true good fellow said louis laughing while the rest of the presence and even charles himself seemed disconcerted at so broad a jest  i owe thee a piece of gold for turning some thing that looked like sad earnest into the merry game which i trust it will end in  silence le glorieux said the duke and you toison dor who are too learned to be intelligible stand backand bring that rascal forward some of youhark ye villain he said in his harshest tone do you know the difference between argent and or except in the shape of coined money  for pitys sake your grace be good unto menoble king louis speak for me  speak for thyself said the duke in a word art thou herald or not  only for this occasion acknowledged the detected official  now by saint george said the duke eyeing louis askance we know no kingno gentlemansave one who would have so prostituted the noble science on which royalty and gentry rest save that king who sent to edward of england a serving man disguised as a herald  the heralds of the middle ages were regarded almost as sacred characters it was treasonable to strike a herald or to counterfeit the character of one yet louis did not hesitate to practise such an imposition when he wished to enter into communication with edward iv of england he selected as an agentfit for his purpose a simple valet this man he disguised as a herald with all the insignia of his office and sent him in that capacity to open a communication with the english army the stratagem though of so fraudulent a nature does not seem to have been necessarily called for since all that king louis could gain by it would be that he did not commit himself by sending a more responsible messenger  ferne imputes this intrusion on their rights in some degree to necessity i have heard some he says  allow of the action of louis xi who had so unknightly a regard both of his own honour and also of armes that he seldom had about his court any officer at armes and therefore at such time as edward iv king of england lay before the town of saint quentin the same french king for want of a herald to carry his mind to the english king was constrained to suborn a vadelict or common serving man with a trumpet banner having a hole made through the middest for this preposterous herauld to put his head through and to cast it over his shoulders instead of a better coat armour of france and thus came this hastily arrayed courier as a counterfeit officer at armes with instructions from his sovereigns mouth to offer peace to our king fernes blazen of gentry 1586 p 161s  such a stratagem said louis laughing or affecting to laugh could only be justified at a court where no herald were at the time and when the emergency was urgent but though it might have passed on the blunt and thick witted islander no one with brains a whit better than those of a wild boar would have thought of passing such a trick upon the accomplished court of burgundy  send him who will said the duke fiercely he shall return on their hands in poor caseheredrag him to the market placeslash him with bridle reins and dog whips until the tabard hang about him in tattersupon the rouge sanglierca cahaloo haloo  four or five large hounds such as are painted in the hunting pieces upon which rubens and schneiders laboured in conjunction caught the well known notes with which the duke concluded and began to yell and bay as if the boar were just roused from his lair  rubens 15771640 a great flemish artist whose works were sought by kings and princes he painted the history of marie de medicis in the series of colossal pictures now in the louvre he was knighted by philip iv of spain and charles i of england  schneiders or snyders a flemish painter of the seventeenth century  by the rood said king louis observant to catch the vein of his dangerous cousin since the ass has put on the boars hide i would set the dogs on him to bait him out of it  right right exclaimed duke charles the fancy exactly chiming in with his humour at the momentit shall be doneuncouple the houndshyke a talbot a hunters cry to his dog see dame berners boke of hawking and hunting hyke a beaumontwe will course him from the door of the castle to the east gate  i trust your grace will treat me as a beast of chase said the fellow putting the best face he could upon the matter and allow me fair law  thou art but vermin said the duke and entitled to no law by the letter of the book of hunting nevertheless thou shalt have sixty yards in advance were it but for the sake of thy unparalleled impudenceaway away sirswe will see this sport  and the council breaking up tumultuously all hurried none faster than the two princes to enjoy the humane pastime which king louis had suggested  the rouge sanglier showed excellent sport for winged with terror and having half a score of fierce boar hounds hard at his haunches encouraged by the blowing of horns and the woodland cheer of the hunters he flew like the very wind and had he not been encumbered with his heralds coat the worst possible habit for a runner he might fairly have escaped dog free he also doubled once or twice in a manner much approved of by the spectators none of these nay not even charles himself was so delighted with the sport as king louis who partly from political considerations and partly as being naturally pleased with the sight of human suffering when ludicrously exhibited laughed till the tears ran from his eyes and in his ecstasies of rapture caught hold of the dukes ermine cloak as if to support himself whilst the duke no less delighted flung his arm around the kings shoulder making thus an exhibition of confidential sympathy and familiarity very much at variance with the terms on which they had so lately stood together at length the speed of the pseudo herald could save him no longer from the fangs of his pursuers they seized him pulled him down and would probably soon have throttled him had not the duke called out stave and tailstave and tail to strike the bear with a staff and pull off the dogs by the tail to separate themtake them off himhe hath shown so good a course that though he has made no sport at bay we will not have him dispatched  several officers accordingly busied themselves in taking off the dogs and they were soon seen coupling some up and pursuing others which ran through the streets shaking in sport and triumph the tattered fragments of painted cloth and embroidery rent from the tabard which the unfortunate wearer had put on in an unlucky hour  at this moment and while the duke was too much engaged with what passed before him to mind what was said behind him oliver le dain gliding behind king louis whispered into his ear it is the bohemian hayraddin maugrabinit were not well he should come to speech of the duke  he must die answered louis in the same tone dead men tell no tales  one instant afterwards tristan lhermite to whom oliver had given the hint stepped forward before the king and the duke and said in his blunt manner so please your majesty and your grace this piece of game is mine and i claim himhe is marked with my stampthe fleur de lis is branded on his shoulder as all men may seehe is a known villain and hath slain the kings subjects robbed churches deflowered virgins slain deer in the royal parks  enough enough said duke charles he is my royal cousins property by many a good title what will your majesty do with him  if he is left to my disposal said the king i will at least give him one lesson in the science of heraldry in which he is so ignorantonly explain to him practically the meaning of a cross potence with a noose dangling proper  not as to be by him borne but as to bear himlet him take the degrees under your gossip tristanhe is a deep professor in such mysteries  thus answered the duke with a burst of discordant laughter at his own wit which was so cordially chorused by louis that his rival could not help looking kindly at him while he said ah louis louis would to god thou wert as faithful a monarch as thou art a merry companioni cannot but think often on the jovial time we used to spend together  you may bring it back when you will said louis i will grant you as fair terms as for very shames sake you ought to ask in my present condition without making yourself the fable of christendom and i will swear to observe them upon the holy relique which i have ever the grace to bear about my person being a fragment of the true cross  here he took a small golden reliquary which was suspended from his neck next to his shirt by a chain of the same metal and having kissed it devoutly continuednever was false oath sworn on this most sacred relique but it was avenged within the year  yet said the duke it was the same on which you swore amity to me when you left burgundy and shortly after sent the bastard of rubempre to murder or kidnap me  nay gracious cousin now you are ripping up ancient grievances said the king i promise you that you were deceived in that mattermoreover it was not upon this relique which i then swore but upon another fragment of the true cross which i got from the grand seignior weakened in virtue doubtless by sojourning with infidels besides did not the war of the public good break out within the year and was not a burgundian army encamped at saint denis backed by all the great feudatories of france and was i not obliged to yield up normandy to my brothero god shield us from perjury on such a warrant as this  well cousin answered the duke i do believe thou hadst a lesson to keep faith another timeand now for once without finesse and doubling will you make good your promise and go with me to punish this murdering la marck and the liegeois  i will march against them said louis with the ban and arriere ban of france the military force called out by the sovereign in early feudal times together with their vassals equipment and three months provision and the oriflamme displayed  nay nay said the duke that is more than is needful or may be advisable the presence of your scottish guard and two hundred choice lances will serve to show that you are a free agent a large army might  make me so in effect you would say my fair cousin said the king well you shall dictate the number of my attendants  and to put this fair cause of mischief out of the way you will agree to the countess isabelle of croyes wedding with the duke of orleans  fair cousin said the king you drive my courtesy to extremity the duke is the betrothed bridegroom of my daughter joan be generousyield up this matter and let us speak rather of the towns on the somme  my council will talk to your majesty of these said charles i myself have less at heart the acquisition of territory than the redress of injuries you have tampered with my vassals and your royal pleasure must needs dispose of the hand of a ward of burgundy your majesty must bestow it within the pale of your own royal family since you have meddled with itotherwise our conference breaks off  were i to say i did this willingly said the king no one would believe me therefore do you my fair cousin judge of the extent of my wish to oblige you when i say most reluctantly that the parties consenting and a dispensation from the pope being obtained my own objections shall be no bar to this match which you purpose  all besides can be easily settled by our ministers said the duke and we are once more cousins and friends  may heaven be praised said louis who holding in his hand the hearts of princes doth mercifully incline them to peace and clemency and prevent the effusion of human blood  oliver he added apart to that favourite who ever waited around him like the familiar beside a sorcerer hark theetell tristan to be speedy in dealing with yonder runagate bohemian     chapter xxxiv the execution       ill take thee to the good green wood      and make thine own hand choose the tree       old ballad   now god be praised that gave us the power of laughing and making others laugh and shame to the dull cur who scorns the office of a jester here is a joke and that none of the brightest though it might pass since it has amused two princes which hath gone farther than a thousand reasons of state to prevent a war between france and burgundy  such was the inference of le glorieux when in consequence of the reconciliation of which we gave the particulars in the last chapter the burgundian guards were withdrawn from the castle of peronne the abode of the king removed from the ominous tower of count herbert and to the great joy both of french and burgundians an outward show at least of confidence and friendship seemed so established between duke charles and his liege lord yet still the latter though treated with ceremonial observance was sufficiently aware that he continued to be the object of suspicion though he prudently affected to overlook it and appeared to consider himself as entirely at his ease  meanwhile as frequently happens in such cases whilst the principal parties concerned had so far made up their differences one of the subaltern agents concerned in their intrigues was bitterly experiencing the truth of the political maxim that if the great have frequent need of base tools they make amends to society by abandoning them to their fate so soon as they find them no longer useful  thus was hayraddin maugrabin who surrendered by the dukes officers to the kings provost marshal was by him placed in the hands of his two trusty aides de camp trois eschelles and petit andre to be dispatched without loss of time one on either side of him and followed by a few guards and a multitude of rabblethis playing the allegro that the penseroso the mirthful and the serious cf miltons poems by these nameshe was marched off to use a modern comparison like garrick between tragedy and comedy to the neighbouring forest where to save all farther trouble and ceremonial of a gibbet and so forth the disposers of his fate proposed to knit him up to the first sufficient tree  they were not long in finding an oak as petit andre facetiously expressed it fit to bear such an acorn and placing the wretched criminal on a bank under a sufficient guard they began their extemporaneous preparations for the final catastrophe at that moment hayraddin gazing on the crowd encountered the eyes of quentin durward who thinking he recognized the countenance of his faithless guide in that of the detected impostor had followed with the crowd to witness the execution and assure himself of the identity  when the executioners informed him that all was ready hayraddin with much calmness asked a single boon at their hands  anything my son consistent with our office said trois eschelles  that is said hayraddin anything but my life  even so said trois eschelles and something more for you seem resolved to do credit to our mystery and die like a man without making wry mouthswhy though our orders are to be prompt i care not if i indulge you ten minutes longer  you are even too generous said hayraddin  truly we may be blamed for it said petit andre but what of thati could consent almost to give my life for such a jerry come tumble such a smart tight firm lad who proposes to come from aloft with a grace as an honest fellow should  so that if you want a confessor said trois eschelles  or a lire of wine said his facetious companion  or a psalm said tragedy  or a song said comedy  neither my good kind and most expeditious friends said the bohemian i only pray to speak a few minutes with yonder archer of the scottish guard  the executioners hesitated a moment but trois eschelles recollecting that quentin durward was believed from various circumstances to stand high in the favour of their master king louis they resolved to permit the interview  when quentin at their summons approached the condemned criminal he could not but be shocked at his appearance however justly his doom might have been deserved the remnants of his heraldic finery rent to tatters by the fangs of the dogs and the clutches of the bipeds who had rescued him from their fury to lead him to the gallows gave him at once a ludicrous and a wretched appearance his face was discoloured with paint and with some remnants of a fictitious beard assumed for the purpose of disguise and there was the paleness of death upon his cheek and upon his lip yet strong in passive courage like most of his tribe his eye while it glistened and wandered as well as the contorted smile of his mouth seemed to bid defiance to the death he was about to die  quentin was struck partly with horror partly with compassion as he approached the miserable man and these feelings probably betrayed themselves in his manner for petit andre called out trip it more smartly jolly archerthis gentlemans leisure cannot wait for you if you walk as if the pebbles were eggs and you afraid of breaking them  i must speak with him in privacy said the criminal despair seeming to croak in his accent as he uttered the words  that may hardly consist with our office my merry leap the ladder said petit andre we know you for a slippery eel of old  i am tied with your horse girths hand and foot said the criminal you may keep guard around me though out of earshotthe archer is your own kings servant and if i give you ten guilders  laid out in masses the sum may profit his poor soul said trois eschelles  laid out in wine or brantwein it will comfort my poor body responded petit andre so let them be forthcoming my little crack rope  pay the bloodhounds their fee said hayraddin to durward i was plundered of every stiver when they took meit shall avail thee much  quentin paid the executioners their guerdon and like men of promise they retreated out of hearingkeeping however a careful eye on the criminals motions after waiting an instant till the unhappy man should speak as he still remained silent quentin at length addressed him and to this conclusion thou hast at length arrived  ay answered hayraddin it required neither astrologer or physiognomist nor chiromantist to foretell that i should follow the destiny of my family  brought to this early end by thy long course of crime and treachery said the scot  no by the bright aldebaran and all his brother twinklers answered the bohemian i am brought hither by my folly in believing that the bloodthirsty cruelty of a frank could be restrained even by what they themselves profess to hold most sacred a priests vestment would have been no safer garb for me than a heralds tabard however sanctimonious are your professions of devotion and chivalry  a detected impostor has no right to claim the immunities of the disguise he had usurped said durward  detected said the bohemian my jargon was as good as yonder old fool of a heralds but let it pass as well now as hereafter  you abuse time said quentin if you have aught to tell me say it quickly and then take some care of your soul  of my soul said the bohemian with a hideous laugh think ye a leprosy of twenty years can be cured in an instantif i have a soul it hath been in such a course since i was ten years old and more that it would take me one month to recall all my crimes and another to tell them to the priestand were such space granted me it is five to one i would employ it otherwise  hardened wretch blaspheme not tell me what thou hast to say and i leave thee to thy fate said durward with mingled pity and horror  i have a boon to ask said hayraddin but first i will buy it of you for your tribe with all their professions of charity give naught for naught  i could well nigh say thy gifts perish with thee answered quentin but that thou art on the very verge of eternityask thy boonreserve thy bountyit can do me no goodi remember enough of your good offices of old  why i loved you said hayraddin for the matter that chanced on the banks of the cher and i would have helped you to a wealthy dame you wore her scarf which partly misled me and indeed i thought that hameline with her portable wealth was more for your market penny than the other hen sparrow with her old roost at bracquemont which charles has clutched and is likely to keep his claws upon  talk not so idly unhappy man said quentin yonder officers become impatient  give them ten guilders for ten minutes more said the culprit who like most in his situation mixed with his hardihood a desire of procrastinating his fate i tell thee it shall avail thee much  use then well the minutes so purchased said durward and easily made a new bargain with the marshals men  this done hayraddin continuedyes i assure you i meant you well and hameline would have proved an easy and convenient spouse why she has reconciled herself even with the boar of ardennes though his mode of wooing was somewhat of the roughest and lords it yonder in his sty as if she had fed on mast husks and acorns all her life  cease this brutal and untimely jesting said quentin or once more i tell you i will leave you to your fate  you are right said hayraddin after a moments pause what cannot be postponed must be facedwell know then i came hither in this accursed disguise moved by a great reward from de la marck and hoping a yet mightier one from king louis not merely to bear the message of defiance which yon may have heard of but to tell the king an important secret  it was a fearful risk said durward  it was paid for as such and such it hath proved answered the bohemian de la marck attempted before to communicate with louis by means of marthon but she could not it seems approach nearer to him than the astrologer to whom she told all the passages of the journey and of schonwaldt but it is a chance if her tidings ever reach louis except in the shape of a prophecy but hear my secret which is more important than aught she could tell william de la marck has assembled a numerous and strong force within the city of liege and augments it daily by means of the old priests treasures but he proposes not to hazard a battle with the chivalry of burgundy and still less to stand a siege in the dismantled town this he will dohe will suffer the hot brained charles to sit down before the place without opposition and in the night make an outfall or sally upon the leaguer with his whole force many he will have in french armour who will cry france saint louis and denis montjoye as if there were a strong body of french auxiliaries in the city this cannot choose but strike utter confusion among the burgundians and if king louis with his guards attendants and such soldiers as he may have with him shall second his efforts the boar of ardennes nothing doubts the discomfiture of the whole burgundian armythere is my secret and i bequeath it to you forward or prevent the enterprisesell the intelligence to king louis or to duke charles i care notsave or destroy whom thou wilt for my part i only grieve that i cannot spring it like a mine to the destruction of them all  it is indeed an important secret said quentin instantly comprehending how easily the national jealousy might be awakened in a camp consisting partly of french partly of burgundians  ay so it is answered hayraddin and now you have it you would fain begone and leave me without granting the boon for which i have paid beforehand  tell me thy request said quentin i will grant it if it be in my power  nay it is no mighty demandit is only in behalf of poor klepper my palfrey the only living thing that may miss mea due mile south you will find him feeding by a deserted colliers hut whistle to him thus he whistled a peculiar note and call him by his name klepper he will come to you here is his bridle under my gaberdineit is lucky the hounds got it not for he obeys no other take him and make much of himi do not say for his masters sakebut because i have placed at your disposal the event of a mighty war he will never fail you at neednight and day rough and smooth fair and foul warm stables and the winter sky are the same to klepper had i cleared the gates of peronne and got so far as where i left him i had not been in this casewill you be kind to klepper  i swear to you that i will answered quentin affected by what seemed a trait of tenderness in a character so hardened  then fare thee well said the criminal yet staystayi would not willingly die in discourtesy forgetting a ladys commissionthis billet is from the very gracious and extremely silly lady of the wild boar of ardennes to her black eyed niecei see by your look i have chosen a willing messengerand one word morei forgot to say that in the stuffing of my saddle you will find a rich purse of gold pieces for the sake of which i put my life on the venture which has cost me so dear take them and replace a hundred fold the guilders you have bestowed on these bloody slavesi make you mine heir  i will bestow them in good works and masses for the benefit of thy soul said quentin  name not that word again said hayraddin his countenance assuming a dreadful expression there isthere can be there shall beno such thingit is a dream of priestcraft  unhappy most unhappy being think better let me speed for a priestthese men will delay yet a little longer i will bribe them to it said quentin what canst thou expect dying in such opinions and impenitent  to be resolved into the elements said the hardened atheist pressing his fettered arms against his bosom my hope trust and expectation is that the mysterious frame of humanity shall melt into the general mass of nature to be recompounded in the other forms with which she daily supplies those which daily disappear and return under different formsthe watery particles to streams and showers the earthy parts to enrich their mother earth the airy portions to wanton in the breeze and those of fire to supply the blaze of aldebaran and his brethrenin this faith have i lived and i will die in ithence begonedisturb me no fartheri have spoken the last word that mortal ears shall listen to  deeply impressed with the horrors of his condition quentin durward yet saw that it was vain to hope to awaken him to a sense of his fearful state he bade him therefore farewell to which the criminal only replied by a short and sullen nod as one who plunged in reverie bids adieu to company which distracts his thoughts he bent his course towards the forest and easily found where klepper was feeding the creature came at his call but was for some time unwilling to be caught snuffing and starting when the stranger approached him at length however quentins general acquaintance with the habits of the animal and perhaps some particular knowledge of those of klepper which he had often admired while hayraddin and he travelled together enabled him to take possession of the bohemians dying bequest long ere he returned to peronne the bohemian had gone where the vanity of his dreadful creed was to be put to the final issuea fearful experience for one who had neither expressed remorse for the past nor apprehension for the future    chapter xxxv a prize for honour       t is brave for beauty when the best blade wins her       the count palatine   when quentin durward reached peronne a council was sitting in the issue of which he was interested more deeply than he could have apprehended and which though held by persons of a rank with whom one of his could scarce be supposed to have community of interest had nevertheless the most extraordinary influence on his fortunes  king louis who after the interlude of de la marcks envoy had omitted no opportunity to cultivate the returning interest which that circumstance had given him in the dukes opinion had been engaged in consulting him or it might be almost said receiving his opinion upon the number and quality of the troops by whom as auxiliary to the duke of burgundy he was to be attended in their joint expedition against liege he plainly saw the wish of charles was to call into his camp such frenchmen as from their small number and high quality might be considered rather as hostages than as auxiliaries but observant of crevecoeurs advice he assented as readily to whatever the duke proposed as if it had arisen from the free impulse of his own mind  the king failed not however to indemnify himself for his complaisance by the indulgence of his vindictive temper against balue whose counsels had led him to repose such exuberant trust in the duke of burgundy tristan who bore the summons for moving up his auxiliary forces had the farther commission to carry the cardinal to the castle of loches and there shut him up in one of those iron cages which he himself is said to have invented  let him make proof of his own devices said the king he is a man of holy churchwe may not shed his blood but pasques dieu his bishopric for ten years to come shall have an impregnable frontier to make up for its small extentand see the troops are brought up instantly  perhaps by this prompt acquiescence louis hoped to evade the more unpleasing condition with which the duke had clogged their reconciliation but if he so hoped he greatly mistook the temper of his cousin for never man lived more tenacious of his purpose than charles of burgundy and least of all was he willing to relax any stipulation which he made in resentment or revenge of a supposed injury  no sooner were the necessary expresses dispatched to summon up the forces who were selected to act as auxiliaries than louis was called upon by his host to give public consent to the espousals of the duke of orleans and isabelle of croye the king complied with a heavy sigh and presently after urged a slight expostulation founded upon the necessity of observing the wishes of the duke himself  these have not been neglected said the duke of burgundy crevecoeur hath communicated with monsieur dorleans and finds him strange to say so dead to the honour of wedding a royal bride that he acceded to the proposal of marrying the countess of croye as the kindest proposal which father could have made to him  he is the more ungracious and thankless said louis but the whole shall be as you my cousin will if you can bring it about with consent of the parties themselves  fear not that said the duke and accordingly not many minutes after the affair had been proposed the duke of orleans and the countess of croye the latter attended as on the preceding occasion by the countess of crevecoeur and the abbess of the ursulines were summoned to the presence of the princes and heard from the mouth of charles of burgundy unobjected to by that of louis who sat in silent and moody consciousness of diminished consequence that the union of their hands was designed by the wisdom of both princes to confirm the perpetual alliance which in future should take place betwixt france and burgundy  the duke of orleans had much difficulty in suppressing the joy which he felt upon the proposal and which delicacy rendered improper in the presence of louis and it required his habitual awe of that monarch to enable him to rein in his delight so much as merely to reply that his duty compelled him to place his choice at the disposal of his sovereign  fair cousin of orleans said louis with sullen gravity since i must speak on so unpleasant an occasion it is needless for me to remind you that my sense of your merits had led me to propose for you a match into my own family but since my cousin of burgundy thinks that the disposing of your hand otherwise is the surest pledge of amity between his dominions and mine i love both too well not to sacrifice to them my own hopes and wishes  the duke of orleans threw himself on his knees and kissedand for once with sincerity of attachmentthe hand which the king with averted countenance extended to him in fact he as well as most present saw in the unwilling acquiescence of this accomplished dissembler who even with that very purpose had suffered his reluctance to be visible a king relinquishing his favourite project and subjugating his paternal feelings to the necessities of state and interest of his country even burgundy was moved and orleanss heart smote him for the joy which he involuntarily felt on being freed from his engagement with the princess joan if he had known how deeply the king was cursing him in his soul and what thoughts of future revenge he was agitating it is probable his own delicacy on the occasion would not have been so much hurt  charles next turned to the young countess and bluntly announced the proposed match to her as a matter which neither admitted delay nor hesitation adding at the same time that it was but a too favourable consequence of her intractability on a former occasion  my lord duke and sovereign said isabelle summoning up all her courage i observe your graces commands and submit to them  enough enough said the duke interrupting her we will arrange the restyour majesty he continued addressing king louis hath had a boars hunt in the morning what say you to rousing a wolf in the afternoon  the young countess saw the necessity of decision  your grace mistakes my meaning she said speaking though timidly yet loudly and decidedly enough to compel the dukes attention which from some consciousness he would otherwise have willingly denied to her  my submission she said only respected those lands and estates which your graces ancestors gave to mine and which i resign to the house of burgundy if my sovereign thinks my disobedience in this matter renders me unworthy to hold them  ha saint george said the duke stamping furiously on the ground does the fool know in what presence she isand to whom she speaks  my lord she replied still undismayed i am before my suzerain and i trust a just one if you deprive me of my lands you take away all that your ancestors generosity gave and you break the only bonds which attach us together you gave not this poor and persecuted form still less the spirit which animates meand these it is my purpose to dedicate to heaven in the convent of the ursulines under the guidance of this holy mother abbess  the rage and astonishment of the duke can hardly be conceived unless we could estimate the surprise of a falcon against whom a dove should ruffle its pinions in defiance  will the holy mother receive you without an appanage he said in a voice of scorn  if she doth her convent in the first instance so much wrong said the lady isabelle i trust there is charity enough among the noble friends of my house to make up some support for the orphan of croye  it is false said the duke it is a base pretext to cover some secret and unworthy passionmy lord of orleans she shall be yours if i drag her to the altar with my own hands  the countess of crevecoeur a high spirited woman and confident in her husbands merits and his favour with the duke could keep silent no longer  my lord she said your passions transport you into language utterly unworthythe hand of no gentlewoman can be disposed of by force  and it is no part of the duty of a christian prince added the abbess to thwart the wishes of a pious soul who broken with the cares and persecutions of the world is desirous to become the bride of heaven  neither can my cousin of orleans said dunois with honour accept a proposal to which the lady has thus publicly stated her objections  if i were permitted said orleans on whose facile mind isabelles beauty had made a deep impression some time to endeavour to place my pretensions before the countess in a more favourable light  my lord said isabelle whose firmness was now fully supported by the encouragement which she received from all around it were to no purposemy mind is made up to decline this alliance though far above my deserts  nor have i time said the duke to wait till these whimsies are changed with the next change of the moonmonseigneur dorleans she shall learn within this hour that obedience becomes matter of necessity  not in my behalf sire answered the prince who felt that he could not with any show of honour avail himself of the dukes obstinate disposition to have been once openly and positively refused is enough for a son of france he cannot prosecute his addresses farther  the duke darted one furious glance at orleans another at louis and reading in the countenance of the latter in spite of his utmost efforts to suppress his feelings a look of secret triumph he became outrageous  write he said to the secretary our doom of forfeiture and imprisonment against this disobedient and insolent minion she shall to the zuchthaus to the penitentiary to herd with those whose lives have rendered them her rivals in effrontery  there was a general murmur  my lord duke said the count of crevecoeur taking the word for the rest this must be better thought on we your faithful vassals cannot suffer such a dishonour to the nobility and chivalry of burgundy if the countess hath done amiss let her be punishedbut in the manner that becomes her rank and ours who stand connected with her house by blood and alliance  the duke paused a moment and looked full at his councillor with the stare of a bull which when compelled by the neat herd from the road which he wishes to go deliberates with himself whether to obey or to rush on his driver and toss him into the air  prudence however prevailed over furyhe saw the sentiment was general in his councilwas afraid of the advantages which louis might derive from seeing dissension among his vassals and probablyfor he was rather of a coarse and violent than of a malignant temperfelt ashamed of his own dishonourable proposal  you are right he said crevecoeur and i spoke hastily her fate shall be determined according to the rules of chivalry her flight to liege hath given the signal for the bishops murder he that best avenges that deed and brings us the head of the wild boar of ardennes shall claim her hand of us and if she denies his right we can at least grant him her fiefs leaving it to his generosity to allow her what means he will to retire into a convent  nay said the countess think i am the daughter of count reinoldof your fathers old valiant and faithful servant would you hold me out as a prize to the best sword player  your ancestress said the duke was won at a tourneyyou shall be fought for in real melee only thus far for count reinolds sake the successful prizer shall be a gentleman of unimpeached birth and unstained bearings but be he such and the poorest who ever drew the strap of a sword belt through the tongue of a buckle he shall have at least the proffer of your hand i swear it by st george by my ducal crown and by the order that i wearha messires he added turning to the nobles present this at least is i think in conformity with the rules of chivalry  isabelles remonstrances were drowned in a general and jubilant assent above which was heard the voice of old lord crawford regretting the weight of years that prevented his striking for so fair a prize the duke was gratified by the general applause and his temper began to flow more smoothly like that of a swollen river when it hath subsided within its natural boundaries  are we to whom fate has given dames already said crevecoeur to be bystanders at this fair game it does not consist with my honour to be so for i have myself a vow to be paid at the expense of that tusked and bristled brute de la marck  strike boldly in crevecoeur said the duke to win her and since thou canst not wear her thyself bestow her where thou wilton count stephen your nephew if you list  gramercy my lord said crevecoeur i will do my best in the battle and should i be fortunate enough to be foremost stephen shall try his eloquence against that of the lady abbess  i trust said dunois that the chivalry of france are not excluded from this fair contest  heaven forbid brave dunois answered the duke were it but for the sake of seeing you do your uttermost but he added though there be no fault in the lady isabelle wedding a frenchman it will be necessary that the count of croye must become a subject of burgundy  enough said dunois my bar sinister may never be surmounted by the coronet of croyei will live and die french but yet though i should lose the lands i will strike a blow for the lady  le balafre dared not speak aloud in such a presence but he muttered to himself  now saunders souplejaw hold thine ownthou always saidst the fortune of our house was to be won by marriage and never had you such a chance to keep your word with us  no one thinks of me said le glorieux who am sure to carry off the prize from all of you  right my sapient friend said louis laughing when a woman is in the case the greatest fool is ever the first in favour  while the princes and their nobles thus jested over her fate the abbess and the countess of crevecoeur endeavoured in vain to console isabelle who had withdrawn with them from the councilpresence the former assured her that the holy virgin would frown on every attempt to withdraw a true votaress from the shrine of saint ursula while the countess of crevecoeur whispered more temporal consolation that no true knight who might succeed in the enterprise proposed would avail himself against her inclinations of the dukes award and that perhaps the successful competitor might prove one who should find such favour in her eyes as to reconcile her to obedience love like despair catches at straws and faint and vague as was the hope which this insinuation conveyed the tears of the countess isabelle flowed more placidly while she dwelt upon it  saint ursula the patron saint of young girls tradition says she was martyred by the huns together with her eleven thousand companions her history has been painted by carpacelo and by hans memling    chapter xxxvi the sally       the wretch condemnd with life to part      still still on hope relies      and every pang that rends the heart      bids expectation rise       hope like the glimmering tapers light      adorns and cheers the way      and still the darker grows the night      emits a brighter ray       goldsmith   few days had passed ere louis had received with a smile of gratified vengeance the intelligence that his favourite and his councillor the cardinal balue was groaning within a cage of iron so disposed as scarce to permit him to enjoy repose in any posture except when recumbent and of which be it said in passing he remained the unpitied tenant for nearly twelve years the auxiliary forces which the duke had required louis to bring up had also appeared and he comforted himself that their numbers were sufficient to protect his person against violence although too limited to cope had such been his purpose with the large army of burgundy he saw himself also at liberty when time should suit to resume his project of marriage between his daughter and the duke of orleans and although he was sensible to the indignity of serving with his noblest peers under the banners of his own vassal and against the people whose cause he had abetted he did not allow these circumstances to embarrass him in the meantime trusting that a future day would bring him amends  for chance said he to his trusty oliver may indeed gain one hit but it is patience and wisdom which win the game at last  with such sentiments upon a beautiful day in the latter end of harvest the king mounted his horse and indifferent that he was looked upon rather as a part of the pageant of a victor than in the light of an independent sovereign surrounded by his guards and his chivalry king louis sallied from under the gothic gateway of peronne to join the burgundian army which commenced at the same time its march against liege  most of the ladies of distinction who were in the place attended dressed in their best array upon the battlements and defences of the gate to see the gallant show of the warriors setting forth on the expedition thither had the countess crevecoeur brought the countess isabelle the latter attended very reluctantly but the peremptory order of charles had been that she who was to bestow the palm in the tourney should be visible to the knights who were about to enter the lists  as they thronged out from under the arch many a pennon and shield was to be seen graced with fresh devices expressive of the bearers devoted resolution to become a competitor for a prize so fair here a charger was painted starting for the goalthere an arrow aimed at a markone knight bore a bleeding heart indicative of his passionanother a skull and a coronet of laurels showing his determination to win or die many others there were and some so cunningly intricate and obscure that they might have defied the most ingenious interpreter each knight too it may be presumed put his courser to his mettle and assumed his most gallant seat in the saddle as he passed for a moment under the view of the fair bevy of dames and damsels who encouraged their valour by their smiles and the waving of kerchiefs and of veils the archer guard selected almost at will from the flower of the scottish nation drew general applause from the gallantry and splendour of their appearance  and there was one among these strangers who ventured on a demonstration of acquaintance with the lady isabelle which had not been attempted even by the most noble of the french nobility it was quentin durward who as he passed the ladies in his rank presented to the countess of croye on the point of his lance the letter of her aunt  now by my honour said the count of crevecoeur that is over insolent in an unworthy adventurer  do not call him so crevecoeur said dunois i have good reason to bear testimony to his gallantryand in behalf of that lady too  you make words of nothing said isabelle blushing with shame and partly with resentment it is a letter from my unfortunate auntshe writes cheerfully though her situation must be dreadful  let us hear let us hear what says the boars bride said crevecoeur  the countess isabelle read the letter in which her aunt seemed determined to make the best of a bad bargain and to console herself for the haste and indecorum of her nuptials by the happiness of being wedded to one of the bravest men of the age who had just acquired a princedom by his valour she implored her niece not to judge of her william as she called him by the report of others but to wait till she knew him personally he had his faults perhaps but they were such as belonged to characters whom she had ever venerated william was rather addicted to wine but so was the gallant sir godfrey her grandsirehe was something hasty and sanguinary in his temper such had been her brother reinold of blessed memory he was blunt in speech few germans were otherwise and a little wilful and peremptory but she believed all men loved to rule more there was to the same purpose and the whole concluded with the hope and request that isabelle would by means of the bearer endeavour her escape from the tyrant of burgundy and come to her loving kinswomans court of liege where any little differences concerning their mutual rights of succession to the earldom might be adjusted by isabelles marrying earl ebersona bridegroom younger indeed than his bride but that as she the lady hameline might perhaps say from experience was an inequality more easy to be endured than isabelle could be aware of  the marriage of william de la marck with the lady hameline is as apocryphal as the lady herselfs  here the countess isabelle stopped the abbess observing with a prim aspect that she had read quite enough concerning such worldly vanities and the count of crevecoeur breaking out aroint thee deceitful witchwhy this device smells rank as the toasted cheese in a rat trapnow fie and double fie upon the old decoy duck  the countess of crevecoeur gravely rebuked her husband for his violence  the lady she said must have been deceived by de la marck with a show of courtesy  he show courtesy said the count i acquit him of all such dissimulation you may as well expect courtesy from a literal wild boar you may as well try to lay leaf gold on old rusty gibbet irons noidiot as she is she is not quite goose enough to fall in love with the fox who has snapped her and that in his very den but you women are all alikefair words carry itand i dare say here is my pretty cousin impatient to join her aunt in this fools paradise and marry the bear pig  so far from being capable of such folly said isabelle i am doubly desirous of vengeance on the murderers of the excellent bishop because it will at the same time free my aunt from the villains power  ah there indeed spoke the voice of croye exclaimed the count and no more was said concerning the letter  but while isabelle read her aunts epistle to her friends it must be observed that she did not think it necessary to recite a certain postscript in which the countess hameline ladylike gave an account of her occupations and informed her niece that she had laid aside for the present a surcoat which she was working for her husband bearing the arms of croye and la marck in conjugal fashion parted per pale because her william had determined for purposes of policy in the first action to have others dressed in his coat armour and himself to assume the arms of orleans with a bar sinisterin other words those of dunois there was also a slip of paper in another hand the contents of which the countess did not think it necessary to mention being simply these words if you hear not of me soon and that by the trumpet of fame conclude me dead but not unworthy  a thought hitherto repelled as wildly incredible now glanced with double keenness through isabelles soul as female wit seldom fails in the contrivance of means she so ordered it that ere the troops were fully on march quentin durward received from an unknown hand the billet of lady hameline marked with three crosses opposite to the postscript and having these words subjoined he who feared not the arms of orleans when on the breast of their gallant owner cannot dread them when displayed on that of a tyrant and murderer  a thousand thousand times was this intimation kissed and pressed to the bosom of the young scot for it marshalled him on the path where both honour and love held out the reward and possessed him with a secret unknown to others by which to distinguish him whose death could alone give life to his hopes and which he prudently resolved to lock up in his own bosom  but durward saw the necessity of acting otherwise respecting the information communicated by hayraddin since the proposed sally of de la marck unless heedfully guarded against might prove the destruction of the besieging army so difficult was it in the tumultuous warfare of those days to recover from a nocturnal surprise after pondering on the matter he formed the additional resolution that he would not communicate the intelligence save personally and to both the princes while together perhaps because he felt that to mention so well contrived and hopeful a scheme to louis whilst in private might be too strong a temptation to the wavering probity of that monarch and lead him to assist rather than repel the intended sally he determined therefore to watch for an opportunity of revealing the secret whilst louis and charles were met which as they were not particularly fond of the constraint imposed by each others society was not likely soon to occur  meanwhile the march continued and the confederates soon entered the territories of liege here the burgundian soldiers at least a part of them composed of those bands who had acquired the title of ecorcheurs or flayers showed by the usage which they gave the inhabitants under pretext of avenging the bishops death that they well deserved that honourable title while their conduct greatly prejudiced the cause of charles the aggrieved inhabitants who might otherwise have been passive in the quarrel assuming arms in self defence harassing his march by cutting off small parties and falling back before the main body upon the city itself thus augmenting the numbers and desperation of those who had resolved to defend it the french few in number and those the choice soldiers of the country kept according to the kings orders close by their respective standards and observed the strictest discipline a contrast which increased the suspicions of charles who could not help remarking that the troops of louis demeaned themselves as if they were rather friends to the liegeois than allies of burgundy  at length without experiencing any serious opposition the army arrived in the rich valley of the maes and before the large and populous city of liege the castle of schonwaldt they found had been totally destroyed and learned that william de la marck whose only talents were of a military cast had withdrawn his whole forces into the city and was determined to avoid the encounter of the chivalry of france and burgundy in the open field but the invaders were not long of experiencing the danger which must always exist in attacking a large town however open if the inhabitants are disposed to defend it desperately  a part of the burgundian vanguard conceiving that from the dismantled and breached state of the walls they had nothing to do but to march into liege at their ease entered one of the suburbs with the shouts of burgundy burgundy kill killall is oursremember louis of bourbon  but as they marched in disorder through the narrow streets and were partly dispersed for the purpose of pillage a large body of the inhabitants issued suddenly from the town fell furiously upon them and made considerable slaughter de la marck even availed himself of the breaches in the walls which permitted the defenders to issue out at different points and by taking separate routes into the contested suburb to attack in the front flank and rear at once the assailants who stunned by the furious unexpected and multiplied nature of the resistance offered could hardly stand to their arms the evening which began to close added to their confusion  when this news was brought to duke charles he was furious with rage which was not much appeased by the offer of king louis to send the french men at arms into the suburbs to rescue and bring off the burgundian vanguard rejecting this offer briefly he would have put himself at the head of his own guards to extricate those engaged in the incautious advance but dhymbercourt and crevecoeur entreated him to leave the service to them and marching into the scene of action at two points with more order and proper arrangement for mutual support these two celebrated captains succeeded in repulsing the liegeois and in extricating the vanguard who lost besides prisoners no fewer than eight hundred men of whom about a hundred were men at arms the prisoners however were not numerous most of them having been rescued by dhymbercourt who now proceeded to occupy the contested suburb and to place guards opposite to the town from which it was divided by an open space or esplanade of five or six hundred yards left free of buildings for the purposes of defence there was no moat betwixt the suburb and town the ground being rocky in that place a gate fronted the suburb from which sallies might be easily made and the wall was pierced by two or three of those breaches which duke charles had caused to be made after the battle of saint tron and which had been hastily repaired with mere barricades of timber  dhymbercourt turned two culverins on the gate and placed two others opposite to the principal breach to repel any sally from the city and then returned to the burgundian army which he found in great disorder in fact the main body and rear of the numerous army of the duke had continued to advance while the broken and repulsed vanguard was in the act of retreating and they had come into collision with each other to the great confusion of both the necessary absence of dhymbercourt who discharged all the duties of marechal du camp or as we should now say of quartermaster general augmented the disorder and to complete the whole the night sank down dark as a wolfs mouth there fell a thick and heavy rain and the ground on which the beleaguering army must needs take up their position was muddy and intersected with many canals it is scarce possible to form an idea of the confusion which prevailed in the burgundian army where leaders were separated from their soldiers and soldiers from their standards and officers every one from the highest to the lowest was seeking shelter and accommodation where he could individually find it while the wearied and wounded who had been engaged in the battle were calling in vain for shelter and refreshment and while those who knew nothing of the disaster were pressing on to have their share in the sack of the place which they had no doubt was proceeding merrily  when dhymbercourt returned he had a task to perform of incredible difficulty and imbittered by the reproaches of his master who made no allowance for the still more necessary duty in which he had been engaged until the temper of the gallant soldier began to give way under the dukes unreasonable reproaches  i went hence to restore some order in the van he said and left the main body under your graces own guidance and now on my return i can neither find that we have front flank nor rear so utter is the confusion  we are the more like a barrel of herrings answered le glorieux which is the most natural resemblance for a flemish army  the jesters speech made the duke laugh and perhaps prevented a farther prosecution of the altercation betwixt him and his general  by dint of great exertion a small lusthaus or country villa of some wealthy citizen of liege was secured and cleared of other occupants for the accommodation of the duke and his immediate attendants and the authority of dhymbercourt and crevecoeur at length established a guard in the vicinity of about forty men at arms who lighted a very large fire made with the timber of the outhouses which they pulled down for the purpose  a little to the left of this villa and betwixt it and the suburb which as we have said was opposite to the city gate and occupied by the burgundian vanguard lay another pleasure house surrounded by a garden and courtyard and having two or three small enclosures or fields in the rear of it in this the king of france established his own headquarters he did not himself pretend to be a soldier further than a natural indifference to danger and much sagacity qualified him to be called such but he was always careful to employ the most skilful in that profession and reposed in them the confidence they merited louis and his immediate attendants occupied this second villa a part of his scottish guard were placed in the court where there were outhouses and sheds to shelter them from the weather the rest were stationed in the garden the remainder of the french men at arms were quartered closely together and in good order with alarm posts stationed in case of their having to sustain an attack  dunois and crawford assisted by several old officers and soldiers amongst whom le balafre was conspicuous for his diligence contrived by breaking down walls making openings through hedges filling up ditches and the like to facilitate the communication of the troops with each other and the orderly combination of the whole in case of necessity  meanwhile the king judged it proper to go without farther ceremony to the quarters of the duke of burgundy to ascertain what was to be the order of proceeding and what cooperation was expected from him his presence occasioned a sort of council of war to be held of which charles might not otherwise have dreamed  it was then that quentin durward prayed earnestly to be admitted as having something of importance to deliver to the two princes this was obtained without much difficulty and great was the astonishment of louis when he heard him calmly and distinctly relate the purpose of william de la marck to make a sally upon the camp of the besiegers under the dress and banners of the french louis would probably have been much better pleased to have had such important news communicated in private but as the whole story had been publicly told in presence of the duke of burgundy he only observed that whether true or false such a report concerned them most materially  not a whitnot a whit said the duke carelessly had there been such a purpose as this young man announces it had not been communicated to me by an archer of the scottish guard  however that may be answered louis i pray you fair cousin you and your captains to attend that to prevent the unpleasing consequences of such an attack should it be made unexpectedly i will cause my soldiers to wear white scarfs over their armourdunois see it given out on the instantthat is he added if our brother and general approves of it  i see no objection replied the duke if the chivalry of france are willing to run the risk of having the name of the knights of the smock sleeve bestowed on them in future  it would be a right well adapted title friend charles said le glorieux considering that a woman is the reward of the most valiant  well spoken sagacity said louis cousin good night i will go arm meby the way what if i win the countess with mine own hand  your majesty said the duke in an altered tone of voice must then become a true fleming  i cannot answered louis in a tone of the most sincere confidence be more so than i am already could i but bring you my dear cousin to believe it  the duke only replied by wishing the king good night in a tone resembling the snort of a shy horse starting from the caress of the rider when he is about to mount and is soothing him to stand still  i could pardon all his duplicity said the duke to crevecoeur but cannot forgive his supposing me capable of the gross folly of being duped by his professions  louis too had his confidences with oliver le dain when he returned to his own quarters this he said is such a mixture of shrewdness and simplicity that i know not what to make of him pasques dieu think of his unpardonable folly in bringing out honest de la marcks plan of a sally before the face of burgundy crevecoeur and all of them instead of rounding it in my ear and giving me at least the choice of abetting or defeating it  it is better as it is sire said oliver there are many in your present train who would scruple to assail burgundy undefied or to ally themselves with de la marck  thou art right oliver such fools there are in the world and we have no time to reconcile their scruples by a little dose of self interest we must be true men oliver and good allies of burgundy for this night at leasttime may give us a chance of a better game go tell no man to unarm himself and let them shoot in case of necessity as sharply on those who cry france and st denis as if they cried hell and satan i will myself sleep in my armour let crawford place quentin durward on the extreme point of our line of sentinels next to the city let him een have the first benefit of the sally which he has announced to usif his luck bear him out it is the better for him but take an especial care of martius galeotti and see he remain in the rear in a place of the most absolute safetyhe is even but too venturous and like a fool would be both swordsman and philosopher see to these things oliver and good nightour lady of clery and monseigneur st martin of tours be gracious to my slumbers  the duke of burgundy full of resentment for the usage which the bishop had received from the people of liege whose death as already noticed did not take place for some years after and knowing that the walls of the town had not been repaired since they were breached by himself after the battle of saint tron advanced recklessly to their chastisement his commanders shared his presumptuous confidence for the advanced guard of his army under the marechal of burgundy and seigneur dhymbercourt rushed upon one of the suburbs without waiting for the rest of their army which commanded by the duke in person remained about seven or eight leagues in the rear the night was closing and as the burgundian troops observed no discipline they were exposed to a sudden attack from a party of the citizens commanded by jean de vilde who assaulting them in the front and rear threw them into great disorder and killed more than eight hundred men of whom one hundred were men at arms when charles and the king of france came up they took up their quarters in two villas situated near to the wall of the city in the two or three days which followed louis was distinguished for the quiet and regulated composure with which he pressed the siege and provided for defence in case of sallies while the duke of burgundy no way deficient in courage and who showed the rashness and want of order which was his principal characteristic seemed also extremely suspicious that the king would desert him and join with the liegeois they lay before the town for five or six days and at length fixed the 30th of october 1468 for a general storm the citizens who had probably information of their intent resolved to prevent their purpose and determined on anticipating it by a desperate sally through the breaches in their walls they placed at their head six hundred of the men of the little territory of fraudemont belonging to the bishopric of liege and reckoned the most valiant of their troops they burst out of the town on a sudden surprised the duke of burgundys quarters ere his guards could put on their armour which they had laid off to enjoy some repose before the assault the king of frances lodgings were also attacked and endangered a great confusion ensued augmented incalculably by the mutual jealousy and suspicions of the french and burgundians the people of liege were however unable to maintain their hardy enterprise when the men at arms of the king and duke began to recover from their confusion and were finally forced to retire within their walls after narrowly missing the chance of surprising both king louis and the duke of burgundy the most powerful princes of their time at daybreak the storm took place as had been originally intended and the citizens disheartened and fatigued by the nocturnal sally did not make so much resistance as was expected liege was taken and miserably pillaged without regard to sex or age things sacred or things profane these particulars are fully related by comines in his memoires liv ii chap 11 12 13 and do not differ much from the account of the same events given in the text s    chapter xxxvii the sally       he lookd and saw what numbers numberless      the city gates outpourd       paradise regained   a dead silence soon reigned over that great host which lay in leaguer before liege for a long time the cries of the soldiers repeating their signals and seeking to join their several banners sounded like the howling of bewildered dogs seeking their masters but at length overcome with weariness by the fatigues of the day the dispersed soldiers crowded under such shelter as they could meet with and those who could find none sunk down through very fatigue under walls hedges and such temporary protection there to await for morninga morning which some of them were never to behold a dead sleep fell on almost all excepting those who kept a faint and wary watch by the lodgings of the king and the duke the dangers and hopes of the morroweven the schemes of glory which many of the young nobility had founded upon the splendid prize held out to him who should avenge the murdered bishop of liegeglided from their recollection as they lay stupefied with fatigue and sleep but not so with quentin durward the knowledge that he alone was possessed of the means of distinguishing la marck in the contestthe recollection by whom that information had been communicated and the fair augury which might be drawn from her conveying it to himthe thought that his fortune had brought him to a most perilous and doubtful crisis indeed but one where there was still at least a chance of his coming off triumphantbanished every desire to sleep and strung his nerves with vigour which defied fatigue  posted by the kings express order on the extreme point between the french quarters and the town a good way to the right of the suburb which we have mentioned he sharpened his eye to penetrate the mass which lay before him and excited his ears to catch the slightest sound which might announce any commotion in the beleaguered city but its huge clocks had successively knelled three hours after midnight and all continued still and silent as the grave  at length and just when quentin began to think the attack would be deferred till daybreak and joyfully recollected that there would be then light enough to descry the bar sinister across the fleur de lis of orleans he thought he heard in the city a humming murmur like that of disturbed bees mustering for the defence of their hives he listenedthe noise continued but it was of a character so undistinguished by any peculiar or precise sound that it might be the murmur of a wind arising among the boughs of a distant grove or perhaps some stream swollen by the late rain which was discharging itself into the sluggish maes with more than usual clamour quentin was prevented by these considerations from instantly giving the alarm which if done carelessly would have been a heavy offence but when the noise rose louder and seemed pouring at the same time towards his own post and towards the suburb he deemed it his duty to fall back as silently as possible and call his uncle who commanded the small body of archers destined to his support all were on their feet in a moment and with as little noise as possible in less than a second lord crawford was at their head and dispatching an archer to alarm the king and his household drew back his little party to some distance behind their watchfire that they might not be seen by its light the rushing sound which had approached them more nearly seemed suddenly to have ceased but they still heard distinctly the more distant heavy tread of a large body of men approaching the suburb  the lazy burgundians are asleep on their post whispered crawford make for the suburb cunningham and awaken the stupid oxen  keep well to the rear as you go said durward if ever i heard the tread of mortal men there is a strong body interposed between us and the suburb  well said quentin my dainty callant said crawford thou art a soldier beyond thy years they only made halt till the others come forwardi would i had some knowledge where they are  i will creep forward my lord said quentin and endeavour to bring you information  do so my bonny chield thou hast sharp ears and eyes and good willbut take heedi would not lose thee for two and a plack an homely scottish expression for something you value  quentin with his harquebuss ready prepared stole forward through ground which he had reconnoitred carefully in the twilight of the preceding evening until he was not only certain that he was in the neighbourhood of a very large body of men who were standing fast betwixt the kings quarters and the suburbs but also that there was a detached party of smaller number in advance and very close to him they seemed to whisper together as if uncertain what to do next at last the steps of two or three enfans perdus literally lost children detached from that smaller party approached him so near as twice a pikes length seeing it impossible to retreat undiscovered quentin called out aloud qui vive who goes there and was answered by vive liliegecest a dire that is to say added he who spoke correcting himself vivela france  quentin instantly fired his harquebussa man groaned and fell and he himself under the instant but vague discharge of a number of pieces the fire of which ran in a disorderly manner along the column and showed it to be very numerous hastened back to the main guard  admirably done my brave boy said crawford now callants draw in within the courtyardthey are too many to mell with in the open field  they drew within the courtyard and garden accordingly where they found all in great order and the king prepared to mount his horse  whither away sire said crawford you are safest here with your own people  not so said louis i must instantly to the duke he must be convinced of our good faith at this critical moment or we shall have both liegeois and burgundians upon us at once  and springing on his horse he bade dunois command the french troops without the house and crawford the archer guard and other household troops to defend the lusthaus and its enclosures he commanded them to bring up two sakers and as many falconets pieces of cannon for the field which had been left about half a mile in the rear and in the meantime to make good their posts but by no means to advance whatever success they might obtain and having given these orders he rode off with a small escort to the dukes quarters the delay which permitted these arrangements to be carried fully into effect was owing to quentins having fortunately shot the proprietor of the house who acted as guide to the column which was designed to attack it and whose attack had it been made instantly might have had a chance of being successful  durward who by the kings order attended him to the dukes found the latter in a state of choleric distemperature which almost prevented his discharging the duties of a general which were never more necessary for besides the noise of a close and furious combat which had now taken place in the suburb upon the left of their whole armybesides the attack upon the kings quarters which was fiercely maintained in the centrea third column of liegeois of even superior numbers had filed out from a more distant breach and marching by lanes vineyards and passes known to themselves had fallen upon the right flank of the burgundian army who alarmed at their war cries of vive la france and denis montjoie which mingled with those of liege and rouge sanglier and at the idea thus inspired of treachery on the part of the french confederates made a very desultory and imperfect resistance while the duke foaming and swearing and cursing his liege lord and all that belonged to him called out to shoot with bow and gun on all that was french whether black or whitealluding to the sleeves with which louiss soldiers had designated themselves  the arrival of the king attended only by le balafre and quentin and half a score of archers restored confidence between france and burgundy dhymbercourt crevecoeur and others of the burgundian leaders whose names were then the praise and dread of war rushed devotedly into the conflict and while some commanders hastened to bring up more distant troops to whom the panic had not extended others threw themselves into the tumult reanimated the instinct of discipline and while the duke toiled in the front shouting hacking and hewing like an ordinary man at arms brought their men by degrees into array and dismayed the assailants by the use of their artillery the conduct of louis on the other hand was that of a calm collected sagacious leader who neither sought nor avoided danger but showed so much self possession and sagacity that the burgundian leaders readily obeyed the orders which he issued  the scene was now become in the utmost degree animated and horrible on the left the suburb after a fierce contest had been set on fire and a wide and dreadful conflagration did not prevent the burning ruins from being still disputed on the centre the french troops though pressed by immense odds kept up so close and constant a fire that the little pleasure house shone bright with the glancing flashes as if surrounded with a martyrs crown of flames on the left the battle swayed backwards and forwards with varied success as fresh reinforcements poured out of the town or were brought forward from the rear of the burgundian host and the strife continued with unremitting fury for three mortal hours which at length brought the dawn so much desired by the besiegers the enemy at this period seemed to be slackening their efforts upon the right and in the centre and several discharges of cannon were heard from the lusthaus  go said the king to le balafre and quentin the instant his ear had caught the sound they have got up the sakers and falconetsthe pleasure house is safe blessed be the holy virgintell dunois to move this way but rather nearer the walls of liege with all our men at arms excepting what he may leave for the defence of the house and cut in between those thick headed liegeois on the right and the city from which they are supplied with recruits  the uncle and nephew galloped off to dunois and crawford who tired of their defensive war joyfully obeyed the summons and filing out at the head of a gallant body of about two hundred french gentlemen besides squires and the greater part of the archers and their followers marched across the field trampling down the wounded till they gained the flank of the large body of liegeois by whom the right of the burgundians had been so fiercely assailed the increasing daylight discovered that the enemy were continuing to pour out from the city either for the purpose of continuing the battle on that point or of bringing safely off the forces who were already engaged  by heaven said old crawford to dunois were i not certain it is thou that art riding by my side i would say i saw thee among yonder banditti and burghers marshalling and arraying them with thy maceonly if yon be thou thou art bigger than thou art wont to be art thou sure yonder armed leader is not thy wraith thy double man as these flemings call it  my wraith said dunois i know not what you mean but yonder is a caitiff with my bearings displayed on crest and shield whom i will presently punish for his insolence  in the name of all that is noble my lord leave the vengeance to me said quentin  to thee indeed young man said dunois that is a modest request  nothese things brook no substitution then turning on his saddle he called out to those around him gentlemen of france form your line level your lances let the rising sunbeams shine through the battalions of yonder swine of liege and hogs of ardennes that masquerade in our ancient coats  the men at arms answered with a loud shout of a dunois a dunois long live the bold bastardorleans to the rescue  and with their leader in the centre they charged at full gallop they encountered no timid enemy the large body which they charged consisted excepting some mounted officers entirely of infantry who setting the butt of their lances against their feet the front rank kneeling the second stooping and those behind presenting their spears over their heads offered such resistance to the rapid charge of the men at arms as the hedgehog presents to his enemy few were able to make way through that iron wall but of those few was dunois who giving spur to his horse and making the noble animal leap wore than twelve feet at a bound fairly broke his way into the middle of the phalanx and made toward the object of his animosity what was his surprise to find quentin still by his side and fighting in the same front with himselfyouth desperate courage and the determination to do or die having still kept the youth abreast with the best knight in europe for such was dunois reported and truly reported at the period  their spears were soon broken but the lanzknechts were unable to withstand the blows of their long heavy swords while the horses and riders armed in complete steel sustained little injury from their lances still dunois and durward were contending with rival efforts to burst forward to the spot where he who had usurped the armorial bearings of dunois was doing the duty of a good and valiant leader when dunois observing the boars head and tusksthe usual bearing of william de la marckin another part of the conflict called out to quentin thou art worthy to avenge the arms of orleans i leave thee the taskbalafre support your nephew but let none dare to interfere with dunoiss boar hunt  that quentin durward joyfully acquiesced in this division of labour cannot be doubted and each pressed forward upon his separate object followed and defended from behind by such men at arms as were able to keep up with them  but at this moment the column which de la marck had proposed to support when his own course was arrested by the charge of dunois had lost all the advantages they had gained during the night while the burgundians with returning day had begun to show the qualities which belong to superior discipline the great mass of liegeois were compelled to retreat and at length to fly and falling back on those who were engaged with the french men at arms the whole became a confused tide of fighters fliers and pursuers which rolled itself towards the city walls and at last was poured into the ample and undefended breach through which the liegeois had sallied  quentin made more than human exertions to overtake the special object of his pursuit who was still in his sight striving by voice and example to renew the battle and bravely supported by a chosen party of lanzknechts le balafre and several of his comrades attached themselves to quentin much marvelling at the extraordinary gallantry displayed by so young a soldier on the very brink of the breach de la marckfor it was himselfsucceeded in effecting a momentary stand and repelling some of the most forward of the pursuers he had a mace of iron in his hand before which everything seemed to go down and was so much covered with blood that it was almost impossible to discern those bearings on his shield which had so much incensed dunois  quentin now found little difficulty in singling him out for the commanding situation of which he had possessed himself and the use he made of his terrible mace caused many of the assailants to seek safer points of attack than that where so desperate a defender presented himself but quentin to whom the importance attached to victory over this formidable antagonist was better known sprung from his horse at the bottom of the breach and letting the noble animal the gift of the duke of orleans run loose through the tumult ascended the ruins to measure swords with the boar of ardennes the latter as if he had seen his intention turned towards durward with mace uplifted and they were on the point of encounter when a dreadful shout of triumph of tumult and of despair announced that the besiegers were entering the city at another point and in the rear of those who defended the breach assembling around him by voice and bugle the desperate partners of his desperate fortune de la marck at those appalling sounds abandoned the breach and endeavoured to effect his retreat towards a part of the city from which he might escape to the other side of the maes his immediate followers formed a deep body of well disciplined men who never having given quarter were resolved now not to ask it and who in that hour of despair threw themselves into such firm order that their front occupied the whole breadth of the street through which they slowly retired making head from time to time and checking the pursuers many of whom began to seek a safer occupation by breaking into the houses for plunder it is therefore probable that de la marck might have effected his escape his disguise concealing him from those who promised themselves to win honour and grandeur upon his head but for the stanch pursuit of quentin his uncle le balafre and some of his comrades at every pause which was made by the lanzknechts a furious combat took place betwixt them and the archers and in every melee quentin sought de la marck but the latter whose present object was to retreat seemed to evade the young scots purpose of bringing him to single combat the confusion was general in every direction the shrieks and cries of women the yelling of the terrified inhabitants now subjected to the extremity of military license sounded horribly shrill amid the shouts of battlelike the voice of misery and despair contending with that of fury and violence which should be heard farthest and loudest  it was just when de la marck retiring through this infernal scene had passed the door of a small chapel of peculiar sanctity that the shouts of france franceburgundy burgundy apprised him that a part of the besiegers were entering the farther end of the street which was a narrow one and that his retreat was cut off  comrade he said take all the men with youcharge yonder fellows roundly and break through if you canwith me it is over i am man enough now that i am brought to bay to send some of these vagabond scots to hell before me  his lieutenant obeyed and with most of the few lanzknechts who remained alive hurried to the farther end of the street for the purpose of charging those burgundians who were advancing and so forcing their way so as to escape about six of de la marcks best men remained to perish with their master and fronted the archers who were not many more in number  sanglier sanglier hola gentlemen of scotland said the ruffian but undaunted chief waving his mace who longs to gain a coronetwho strikes at the boar of ardennesyou young man have methinks a hankering but you must win ere you wear it  quentin heard but imperfectly the words which were partly lost in the hollow helmet but the action could not be mistaken and he had but time to bid his uncle and comrades as they were gentlemen to stand back when de la marck sprang upon him with a bound like a tiger aiming at the same time a blow with his mace so as to make his hand and foot keep time together and giving his stroke full advantage of the descent of his leap but light of foot and quick of eye quentin leaped aside and disappointed an aim which would have been fatal had it taken effect  they then closed like the wolf and the wolf dog their comrades on either side remaining inactive spectators for le balafre roared out for fair play adding that he would venture his nephew on him were he as wight as wallace  neither was the experienced soldiers confidence unjustified for although the blows of the despairing robber fell like those of the hammer on the anvil yet the quick motions and dexterous swordsmanship of the young archer enabled him to escape and to requite them with the point of his less noisy though more fatal weapon and that so often and so effectually that the huge strength of his antagonist began to give way to fatigue while the ground on which he stood became a puddle of blood yet still unabated in courage and ire the wild boar of ardennes fought on with as much mental energy as at first and quentins victory seemed dubious and distant when a female voice behind him called him by his name ejaculating  help help for the sake of the blessed virgin  he turned his head and with a single glance beheld gertrude pavillon her mantle stripped from her shoulders dragged forcibly along by a french soldier one of several who breaking into the chapel close by had seized as their prey on the terrified females who had taken refuge there  wait for me but one moment exclaimed quentin to de la marck and sprang to extricate his benefactress from a situation of which he conjectured all the dangers  i wait no mans pleasure said de la marck flourishing his mace and beginning to retreatglad no doubt at being free of so formidable an assailant  you shall wait mine though by your leave said balafre i will not have my nephew baulked  so saying he instantly assaulted de la marck with his two handed sword  quentin found in the meanwhile that the rescue of gertrude was a task more difficult than could be finished in one moment her captor supported by his comrades refused to relinquish his prize and whilst durward aided by one or two of his countrymen endeavoured to compel him to do so the former beheld the chance which fortune had so kindly afforded him for fortune and happiness glide out of his reach so that when he stood at length in the street with the liberated gertrude there was no one near them totally forgetting the defenceless situation of his companion he was about to spring away in pursuit of the boar of ardennes as the greyhound tracks the deer when clinging to him in her despair she exclaimed for the sake of your mothers honour leave me not hereas you are a gentleman protect me to my fathers house which once sheltered you and the lady isabellefor her sake leave me not  her call was agonizing but it was irresistible and bidding a mental adieu with unutterable bitterness of feeling to all the gay hopes which had stimulated his exertion carried him through that bloody day and which at one moment seemed to approach consummation quentin like an unwilling spirit who obeys a talisman which he cannot resist protected gertrude to pavillons house and arrived in time to defend that and the syndic himself against the fury of the licentious soldiery  meantime the king and the duke of burgundy entered the city on horseback and through one of the breaches they were both in complete armour but the latter covered with blood from the plume to the spur drove his steed furiously up the breach which louis surmounted with the stately pace of one who leads a procession they dispatched orders to stop the sack of the city which had already commenced and to assemble their scattered troops the princes themselves proceeded towards the great church both for the protection of many of the distinguished inhabitants who had taken refuge there and in order to hold a sort of military council after they had heard high mass  busied like other officers of his rank in collecting those under his command lord crawford at the turning of one of the streets which leads to the maes met le balafre sauntering composedly towards the river holding in his hand by the gory locks a human head with as much indifference as a fowler carries a game pouch  how now ludovic said his commander what are ye doing with that carrion  it is all that is left of a bit of work which my nephew shaped out and nearly finished and i put the last hand to said le balafre a good fellow that i dispatched yonder and who prayed me to throw his head into the maesmen have queer fancies when old small back a cant expression in scotland for death usually delineated as a skeleton s is gripping them but small back must lead down the dance with us all in our time  and you are going to throw that head into the maes said crawford looking more attentively on the ghastly memorial of mortality  ay truly am i said ludovic testily if you refuse a dying man his boon you are likely to be haunted by his ghost and i love to sleep sound at nights  you must take your chance of the ghaist man said crawford for by my soul there is more lies on that dead pow than you think for come along with menot a word morecome along with me  nay for that matter said le balafre i made him no promise for in truth i had off his head before the tongue had well done wagging and as i feared him not living by st martin of tours i fear him as little when he is dead besides my little gossip the merry friar of st martins will lend me a pot of holy water  when high mass had been said in the cathedral church of liege and the terrified town was restored to some moderate degree of order louis and charles with their peers around proceeded to hear the claims of those who had any to make for services performed during the battle those which respected the county of croye and its fair mistress were first received and to the disappointment of sundry claimants who had thought themselves sure of the rich prize there seemed doubt and mystery to involve their several pretensions crevecoeur showed a boars hide such as de la marck usually wore dunois produced a cloven shield with his armorial bearings and there were others who claimed the merit of having dispatched the murderer of the bishop producing similar tokensthe rich reward fixed on de la marcks head having brought death to all who were armed in his resemblance  there was much noise and contest among the competitors and charles internally regretting the rash promise which had placed the hand and wealth of his fair vassal on such a hazard was in hopes he might find means of evading all these conflicting claims when crawford pressed forward into the circle dragging le balafre after him who awkward and bashful followed like an unwilling mastiff towed on in a leash as his leader exclaimed away with your hoofs and hides and painted ironno one save he who slew the boar can show the tusks  so saying he flung on the floor the bloody head easily known as that of de la marck by the singular conformation of the jaws which in reality had a certain resemblance to those of the animal whose name he bore and which was instantly recognized by all who had seen him  we have already noticed the anachronism respecting the crimes of this atrocious baron and it is scarce necessary to repeat that if he in reality murdered the bishop of liege in 1482 the count of la marck could not be slain in the defence of liege four years earlier in fact the wild boar of ardennes as he was usually termed was of high birth being the third son of john i count of la marck and aremberg and ancestor of the branch called barons of lumain he did not escape the punishment due to his atrocity though it did not take place at the time or in the manner narrated in the text maximilian emperor of austria caused him to be arrested at utrecht where he was beheaded in the year 1485 three years after the bishop of lieges death s  crawford said louis while charles sat silent in gloomy and displeased surprise i trust it is one of my faithful scots who has won this prize  it is ludovic lesly sire whom we call le balafre replied the old soldier  but is he noble said the duke is he of gentle bloodotherwise our promise is void  he is a cross ungainly piece of wood enough said crawford looking at the tall awkward embarrassed figure of the archer but i will warrant him a branch of the tree of rothes for all thatand they have been as noble as any house in france or burgundy ever since it is told of their founder that        between the lesslee and the mair      he slew the knight and left him there  an old rhyme by which the leslies vindicate their descent from an ancient knight who is said to have slain a gigantic hungarian champion and to have formed a proper name for himself by a play of words upon the place where he fought his adversary s   there is then no help for it said the duke and the fairest and richest heiress in burgundy must be the wife of a rude mercenary soldier like this or die secluded in a conventand she the only child of our faithful reginald de croyei have been too rash  and a cloud settled on his brow to the surprise of his peers who seldom saw him evince the slightest token of regret for the necessary consequences of an adopted resolution  hold but an instant said the lord crawford it may be better than your grace conjectures hear but what this cavalier has to sayspeak out man and a murrain to thee he added apart to le balafre  but that blunt soldier though he could make a shift to express himself intelligibly enough to king louis to whose familiarity he was habituated yet found himself incapable of enunciating his resolution before so splendid an assembly as that before which he then stood and after having turned his shoulder to the princes and preluded with a hoarse chuckling laugh and two or three tremendous contortions of countenance he was only able to pronounce the words saunders souplejawand then stuck fast  may it please your majesty and your grace said crawford i must speak for my countryman and old comrade you shall understand that he has had it prophesied to him by a seer in his own land that the fortune of his house is to be made by marriage but as he is like myself something the worse for the wearloves the wine house better than a ladys summer parlour and in short having some barrack tastes and likings which would make greatness in his own person rather an encumbrance to him he hath acted by my advice and resigns the pretentions acquired by the fate of slaying william de la marck to him by whom the wild boar was actually brought to bay who is his maternal nephew  i will vouch for that youths services and prudence said king louis overjoyed to see that fate had thrown so gallant a prize to one over whom he had some influence without his prudence and vigilance we had been ruined it was he who made us aware of the night sally  i then said charles owe him some reparation for doubting his veracity  and i can attest his gallantry as a man at arms said dunois  but interrupted crevecoeur though the uncle be a scottish gentillatre that makes not the nephew necessarily so  he is of the house of durward said crawford descended from that allan durward who was high steward of scotland  nay if it be young durward said crevecoeur i say no morefortune has declared herself on his side too plainly for me to struggle farther with her humoursome ladyshipbut it is strange from lord to horseboy how wonderfully these scots stick by each other  highlander shoulder to shoulder answered lord crawford laughing at the mortification of the proud burgundian  we have yet to inquire said charles thoughtfully what the fair ladys sentiments may be towards this fortunate adventurer  by the mass said crevecoeur i have but too much reason to believe your grace will find her more amenable to authority than on former occasionsbut why should i grudge this youth his preferment since after all it is sense firmness and gallantry which have put him in possession of wealth rank and beauty        i had already sent these sheets to the press concluding as i thought with a moral of excellent tendency for the encouragement of all fair haired blue eyed long legged stout hearted emigrants from my native country who might be willing in stirring times to take up the gallant profession of cavalieros of fortune but a friendly monitor one of those who like the lump of sugar which is found at the bottom of a tea cup as well as the flavour of the souchong itself has entered a bitter remonstrance and insists that i should give a precise and particular account of the espousals of the young heir of glen houlakin and the lovely flemish countess and tell what tournaments were held and how many lances were broken upon so interesting an occasion nor withhold from the curious reader the number of sturdy boys who inherited the valour of quentin durward and of bright damsels in whom were renewed the charms of isabelle de croye i replied in course of post that times were changed and public weddings were entirely out of fashion in days traces of which i myself can remember not only were the fifteen friends of the happy pair invited to witness their union but the bridal minstrelsy still continued as in the ancient mariner to nod their heads till morning shone on them the sack posset was eaten in the nuptial chamberthe stocking was thrownand the brides garter was struggled for in presence of the happy couple whom hymen had made one flesh the authors of the period were laudably accurate in following its fashions they spared you not a blush of the bride not a rapturous glance of the bridegroom not a diamond in her hair not a button on his embroidered waistcoat until at length with astraea they fairly put their characters to bed the reference is to the plays of mrs aphra behn the stage how loosely doth astraea tread who fairly puts each character to bed but how little does this agree with the modest privacy which induces our modern bridessweet bashful darlingsto steal from pomp and plate and admiration and flattery and like honest shenstone 17141763 an english poet best known by the schoolmistress        seek for freedom at an inn   to these unquestionably an exposure of the circumstances of publicity with which a bridal in the fifteenth century was always celebrated must appear in the highest degree disgusting isabelle de croye would be ranked in their estimation far below the maid who milks and does the meanest chores for even she were it in the church porch would reject the hand of her journeyman shoemaker should he propose faire des noces to celebrate a wedding festivity as it is called on parisian signs instead of going down on the top of the long coach to spend the honeymoon incognito at deptford or greenwich i will not therefore tell more of this matter but will steal away from the wedding as ariosto from that of angelica leaving it to whom it may please to add farther particulars after the fashion of their own imagination        some better bard shall sing in feudal state      how bracquemonts castle opd its gothic gate
