the spy by noon he had sold 3500 copiesa recordmaking sale by the bookselling standards of the time on 26 june almost five months later wiley quietly offered as we know from a notice in the patriot a new york newspaper tales for fifteen or imagination and heart an original work in one volume by jane morgan price 75c the actual author was the author of the spy and the two stories imagination and heart were obviously imitations of mrs amelia opies popular moral tales published as the paper cover noted when the spy was in its fourth edition the pioneers in its third and the pilot in press the sale was so small that only four copies are known to be extant why one may ask did james cooper who was in 1823 a writer of national and international reputation publish this volume of imitative stories for adolescent girls even though his identity was carefully concealed  according to coopers own account tales for fifteen was written and given to charles wiley as a gesture of friendship to help the publisher out of financial difficulties this explanation was echoed by the novelists daughter susan in a letter reprinted from the cooperstown freemans journal in the critic on 12 october 1889 it is true that wiley was having financial troubles in 1823 and cooper undoubtedly gave him the proceeds from tales for fifteen but to suppose as full acceptance of this explanation requires that cooper reverted even momentarily to the repudiated literary models of his first book precaution after the phenomenal success of the spy would be to infer in him an almost total want of critical judgment and common sense the real explanation which cooper might have been embarrassed to furnish and which the chronology of publication has obscured lies in a hitherto unsuspected phase of the curious story of coopers entrance to authorship  cooper wrote andrew thompson goodrich his first publisher on 31 may 1820 that precaution had been preceded by an experimental effort to write a short moral tale mrs opies simple tales 1807 and tales of real life 1813 would have been among the obvious models finding the tale swell to a rather unwieldy size cooper explained i destroyd the manuscript and changed it to a novel precaution which was completed on 12 june 1820 was probably written within a month and before the novel had begun its tortuous way through the press cooper commenced the writing of the spy by 28 june he had completed about sixty pages presumably manuscript pages and as the writing proceeded and his enthusiasm for the new work mounted his expectations for the success of precaution diminished he wrote goodrich on 12 july the spy goes on slowly and will not be finishd until late in the falli take more pains with itas it is to be an american novel professedly in fact the spy was completed only a short time before its publication in new york on 22 december 1821  during the eighteen months between the inception and publication of the spy cooper saw precaution through the press joined the new york literary circle which frequented charles wileys bookshop transferred his publishing business to wiley wrote three or four long book reviews for his friend charles k gardners literary and scientific repository finished the spy and commenced the pioneers while the period was thus not devoid of literary activity it was as the 1831 preface to the spy confessed a period of acute uncertainty having discovered his literary talent cooper had yet to discover how to use it profitably had indeed to be reassured of its true direction he could not afford to write at all unless he could make his new profession pay handsomely precaution had been a deliberate attempt to produce a bestseller and it succeeded only moderately as the preface to the first edition of the spy indicates cooper experienced severe selfdoubts and selfquestionings about this experiment for an extended period most probably during the first six months of 1821 he abandoned work on the spy which had been noticed as in press in the january issue of the repository fearing that the book could not succeed it was almost certainly during this time that he conceived and partly executed another literary project of which tales for fifteen is the abortive remains  as coopers hopes for the spy faded his confidence in the viability of the type of imitative writing he had attempted in precaution appears to have revived precaution was reviewed in a most laudatory manner in the repository for january 1821 and the comment accompanying the notice of publication in the repository was we only regret that the scene of this novel was not laid in america whether cooper persuaded himself or allowed himself to be persuaded by wiley gardner and other friends he seems to have decided that his mistake in precaution was not so much the choice of models as the choice of setting why not employ an american setting and continue his imitation of the british women during 1820 wiley goodrich and william b gilley had jointly published a collection of mrs opies stories called tales of the heart apparently they found it profitable accordingly cooper planned a series of stories which wiley noticed as in press in the repository for may 1822 and which he described as american tales by a lady viz imaginationheartmattermannermatter and manner 2 vols 18 mo wiley and halsted new york a briefer announcement had appeared earlier in the october 1821 issue of the repository although the spy which was certainly in press was not noticed in his letter of 7 january 1822 congratulating cooper on the great success of the spy wiley observed you speak of being engaged about the pioneerhave you forgotten the american tales which were commenced by a certain lady a long time ago  what happened evidently was that coopers interest in the spy had revived with such force that he had gone on to complete that book and to begin the pioneers wileys problem was then to persuade his reluctant author to complete a work in which he had lost interest but which was in press wiley was not successful the three final tales manner matter and manner and matter were never written eventually the publisher prevailed on cooper to bring heart the second of the stories to a hurried conclusion the author probably happy to settle the matter then wrote a coy preface alluding mysteriously to unforeseen circumstances which had prevented the completion of the series and gave the two stories to wiley on the condition that their authorship be concealed thus the american tales became tales for fifteen a more eloquent criticism by the author could hardly be wished  when cooper permitted imagination and heart to be reprinted in 1841 he was again conferring a favor on a publisher towards the close of 1840 george roberts publisher and proprietor of the boston notion subtitled without exaggeration the mammoth sheet of the world sent cooper a circular letter in the hand of a clerk to request a short contribution suitable for his new publication roberts semimonthly magazine normally cooper refused all such requests but he was under the erroneous impression that roberts had forwarded to him some danish translations of his works which longfellow had sent to america for him a few years before remembering these early stories he replied to roberts on 2 january 1841 some fifteen or twenty years since my publisher became embarrassed and i wrote two short tales to aid him he printed them under the title of tales for fifteen by jane morgan one of these stories rather a feeble one i fear was called heartthe other imagination this tale was written one rainy day half asleep and half awake but i retain rather a favorable impression of it if you can find a copy of the book you might think imagination worth reprinting and i suppose there can now be no objection to it it would have the freshness of novelty and would be american enough heaven knows it would fill three or four of your columns  cooper owned no copy of tales for fifteen but the resourceful publisher found a copy in new york and imagination filled almost the whole of the front page approximately 60 by 3412 inches of the boston notion on 30 january 1841 it was reprinted in what was apparently a second edition of roberts semimonthly magazine for 1 and 15 february 1841 and in london in william hazlitts romanticist and novelists library a subsequent request brought permission for the reprinting of heart which appeared in the boston notion for 13 and 20 march 1841 and in roberts semimonthly magazine for 1 and 15 april 1841 roberts expressed his gratitude by defending cooper in his paper from the charge of aristocratic bias which some new york journalists had brought against home as found doubtless the publisher would have been pleased to find other american writers sufficiently democratic to provide free copy  tales for fifteen owes most of its interest today to its crucial position in the cooper canon the literary value of imagination and heart as their author realized is slight they were essentially experiments in which he sought to deploy indigenous materials within the conventions of british domestic fiction imagination with its sprightly observation of american middleclass vulgarities betrays a satiric awareness that cooper did later develop but heart is a forced sentimental indulgence of a sort he never permitted by preference in later works though he sometimes tolerated it as a concession to feminine readers for cooper the chief significance of these stories was that they demonstrated forcibly if demonstration was necessary that neither the characteristic materials nor the characteristic forms employed by the british women were congenial to his imagination his failure was altogether fortunate for had the american tales been completed and published instead of the spy coopers career and the course of much of american literature might have been different  first editions of tales for fifteen are the rarest of all cooper firsts the four copies presently known are in the cooper collection of the yale university

1823      southern district of newyork      be it remembered that on the thirteenth day of june in the     fortyseventh year of the independence of the united states of     america charles wiley of the said district hath deposited in this     office the title of a book the right whereof he claims as     proprietor in the words and figures following to wit      tales for fifteen or imagination

intention to form a short series of such stories as it was hoped might not be entirely without moral advantage but unforeseen circumstances have prevented their completion and unwilling to delay the publication any longer she commits them to the world in their present unfinished state without any flattering anticipations of their reception they are intended for the perusal of young women at that tender age when the feelings of their nature begin to act on them most insidiously and when their minds are least prepared by reason and experience to contend with their passions  heart was intended for a much longer tale and is unavoidably incomplete but it is unnecessary to point out defects that even the juvenile reader will soon detect the author only hopes that if they do no good her tales will at least do no harm     imagination      i pray thee gentle mortal sing again     mine ear is much enamoured of thy note     so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape     and thy fair virtues force perforce doth move me     on the first view to say to swear i love thee      midsummer nights dream   dodo write to me often my dear anna said the weeping julia warren on parting for the first time since their acquaintance with the young lady whom she had honoured with the highest place in her affections think how dreadfully solitary and miserable i shall be here without a single companion or a soul to converse with now you are to be removed two hundred miles into the wilderness  oh trust me my love i shall not forget you now or ever replied her friend embracing the other slightly and perhaps rather hastily for so tender an adieu at the same time glancing her eye on the figure of a youth who stood in silent contemplation of the scene and doubt not but i shall soon tire you with my correspondence especially as i more than suspect it will be subjected to the criticisms of mr charles weston as she concluded the young lady curtisied to the youth in a manner that contradicted by its flattery the forced irony of her remark  never my dear girl exclaimed miss warren with extreme fervour the confidence of our friendship is sacred with me and nothing no nothing could ever tempt me to violate such a trust charles is very kind and very indulgent to all my whims but he never could obtain such an influence over me as to become the depositary of my secrets nothing but a friend like yourself can do that my dear anna  never miss warren said the youth with a lip that betrayed by its tremulous motion the interest he took in her speechnever includes a long period of time but he added with a smile of goodhumoured pleasantry if admitted to such a distinction i should not feel myself competent to the task of commenting on so much innocence and purity as i know i should find in your correspondence  yes said anna with a little of the energy of her friends manner you may with truth say so mr weston the imagination of my julia is as pure asas but turning her eyes from the countenance of julia to that of the youth rather suddenly the animated pleasure she saw delineated in his expressive though plain features drove the remainder of the speech from her recollection  as her heart cried charles weston with emphasis  as her heart sir repeated the young lady coldly  the last adieus were hastily exchanged and anna miller was handed into her fathers gig by charles weston in profound silence miss emmerson the maiden aunt of julia withdrew from the door where she had been conversing with mr miller and the travellers departed julia followed the vehicle with her eyes until it was hid by the trees and shrubbery that covered the lawn and then withdrew to her room to give vent to a sorrow that had sensibly touched her affectionate heart and in no trifling degree haunted her lively imagination  as miss emmerson by no means held the good qualities of the guest who had just left them in so high an estimation as did her niece she proceeded quietly and with great composure in the exercise of her daily duties not in the least suspecting the real distress that from a variety of causes this sudden separation had caused to her ward  the only sister of this good lady had died in giving birth to a female infant and the fever of 1805 had within a very few years of the death of the mother deprived the youthful orphan of her remaining parent her father was a merchant just commencing the foundations of what would in time have been a large estate and as both miss emmerson and her sister were possessed of genteel independencies and the aunt had long declared her intention of remaining single the fortune of julia if not brilliant was thought rather large than otherwise miss emmerson had been educated immediately after the war of the revolution and at a time when the intellect of the women of this country by no means received that attention it is thought necessary to bestow on the minds of the future mothers of our families at the present hour and when indeed the country itself required too much of the care of her rulers and patriots to admit of the consideration of lesser objects with the best of hearts and affections devoted to the welfare of her niece miss emmerson had early discovered her own incompetency to the labour of fitting julia for the world in which she was to live and shrunk with timid modesty from the arduous task of preparing herself by application and study for this sacred duty the fashions of the day were rapidly running into the attainment of accomplishments among the young of her own sex and the piano forte was already sending forth its sonorous harmony from one end of the union to the other while the glittering usefulness of the tambourframe was discarded for the pallet and brush the walls of our mansions were beginning to groan with the sickly green of imaginary fields that caricatured the beauties of nature and skies of sunny brightness that mocked the golden hues of even an american sun the experience of miss emmerson went no further than the simple evolutions of the country dance or the deliberate and dignified procession of the minuet no wonder therefore that her faculties were bewildered by the complex movements of the cotillion and in short as the good lady daily contemplated the improvements of the female youth around her she became each hour more convinced of her own inability to control or in any manner to superintend the education of her orphan niece julia was consequently entrusted to the government of a select boardingschool and as even the morals of the day were in some degree tinctured with the existing fashions her mind as well as her manners were absolutely submitted to the discretion of an hireling notwithstanding this willing concession of power on the part of miss emmerson there was no deficiency in ability to judge between right and wrong in her character but the homely nature of her good sense unassisted by any confidence in her own powers was unable to compete with the dazzling display of accomplishments which met her in every house where she visited and if she sometimes thought that she could not always discover much of the useful amid this excess of the agreeable she rather attributed the deficiency to her own ignorance than to any error in the new system of instruction from the age of six to that of sixteen julia had no other communications with miss emmerson than those endearments which neither could suppress and a constant and assiduous attention on the part of the aunt to the health and attire of her niece  miss emmerson had a brother residing in the city of newyork who was a man of eminence at the bar and who having been educated fifty years ago was from that circumstance just so much superior to his successors of his own sex by twenty years as his sisters were the losers from the same cause the family of mr emmerson was large and besides several sons he had two daughters one of whom remained still unmarried in the house of her father katherine emmerson was but eighteen months the senior of julia warren but her father had adopted a different course from that which was ordinarily pursued with girls of her expectations he had married a woman of sense and now reaped the richest blessing of such a connexion in her ability to superintend the education of her daughter a mothers care was employed to correct errors that a mothers tenderness could only discover and in the place of general systems and comprehensive theories was substituted the close and rigorous watchfulness which adapted the remedy to the disease which studied the disposition and which knew the failings or merits of the pupil and could best tell when to reward and how to punish the consequences were easily to be seen in the manners and character of their daughter her accomplishments even where a master had been employed in their attainment were naturally displayed and suited to her powers her manners instead of the artificial movements of prescribed rules exhibited the chaste and delicate modesty of refinement mingled with good principlessuch as were not worn in order to be in character as a woman and a lady but were deeply seated and formed part not only of her habits but if we may use the expression of her nature also miss emmerson had good sense enough to perceive the value of such an acquaintance for her ward but unfortunately for her wish to establish an intimacy between her nieces julia had already formed a friendship at school and did not conceive her heart was large enough to admit two at the same time to its sanctuary how much julia was mistaken the sequel of our tale will show  so long as anna miller was the inmate of the school julia was satisfied to remain also but the father of anna having determined to remove to an estate in the interior of the country his daughter was taken from school and while the arrangements were making for the reception of the family on the banks of the gennessee anna was permitted to taste for a short time the pleasures of the world at the residence of miss emmerson on the banks of the hudson  charles weston was a distant relative of the good aunt and was like julia an orphan who was moderately endowed with the goods of fortune he was a student in the office of her uncle and being a great favourite with miss emmerson spent many of his leisure hours during the heats of the summer in the retirement of her country residence  whatever might be the composure of the maiden aunt while julia was weeping in her chamber over the long separation that was now to exist between herself and her friend young weston by no means displayed the same philosophic indifference he paced the hall of the building with rapid steps cast many a longing glance at the door of his cousins room and then seated himself with an apparent intention to read the volume he held in his hands nor did he in any degree recover his composure until julia reappeared on the landing of the stairs moving slowly towards their bottom when taking one long look at her lovely face which was glowing with youthful beauty and if possible more charming from the traces of tears in her eyes he coolly pursued his studies julia had recovered her composure and charles weston felt satisfied miss emmerson and her niece took their seats quietly with their work at an open window of the parlour and order appeared to be restored in some measure to the mansion after pursuing their several occupations for some minutes with a silence that had lately been a stranger to them the aunt observed  you appear to have something new in hand my love surely you must abound with trimmings and yet you are working another already  it is for anna miller said julia with a flush of feeling  i was in hopes you would perform your promise to your cousin katherine now miss miller is gone and make your portion of the garments for the orphan asylum returned miss emmerson gravely  oh cousin katherine must wait i promised this trimming to anna to remember me by and i would not disappoint the dear girl for the world  it is not your cousin katherine but the orphans who will have to wait and surely a promise to a relation is as sacred as one to an acquaintance  acquaintance aunt echoed the niece with displeasure do not i entreat you call anna an acquaintance merely she is my friendmy very best friend and i love her as such  thank you my dear said the aunt dryly  oh i mean nothing disrespectful to yourself dear aunt continued julia you know how much i owe to you and ought to know that i love you as a mother  and would you prefer miss miller to a mother then  surely not in respect in gratitude in obedience but still i may love her you know indeed the feelings are so very different that they do not at all interfere with each otherin my heart at least  no said miss emmerson with a little curiosityi wish you would try and explain this difference to me that i may comprehend the distinctions that you are fond of making  why nothing is easier dear aunt said julia with animation you i love because you are kind to me attentive to my wants considerate for my good affectionate andandfrom habitand you are my aunt and take care of me  admirable reasons exclaimed charles weston who had laid aside his book to listen to this conversation  they are forcible ones i must admit said miss emmerson smiling affectionately on her niece but now for the other kind of love  why anna is my friend you know cried julia with eyes sparkling with enthusiasm i love her because she has feelings congenial with my own she has so much wit is so amusing so frank so like a girl of talentsso likelike every thing i admire myself  it is a pity that one so highly gifted cannot furnish herself with frocks said the aunt with a little more than her ordinary dryness of manner and suffer you to work for those who want them more  you forget it is in order to remember me said julia in a manner that spoke her own ideas of the value of the gift  one would think such a friendship would not require any thing to remind one of its existence returned the aunt  why it is not that she will forget me without it but that she may have something by her to remind her of me said julia rapidly but pausing as the contradiction struck even herself  i understand you perfectly my child interrupted the aunt merely as an unnecessary security you mean  to make assurance doubly sure cried charles weston with a laugh  oh you laugh mr weston said julia with a little anger but i have often said you were incapable of friendship  try me exclaimed the youth fervently do not condemn me without a trial  how can i said julia laughing in her turn you are not a girl  can girls then only feel friendship inquired charles taking the seat which miss emmerson had relinquished  i sometimes think so said julia with her own goodhumoured smile you are too grosstoo enviousin short you never see such friendships between men as exist between women  between girls i will readily admit returned the youth but let us examine this question after the manner of the courts  nay if you talk law i shall quit you interrupted the young lady gaily  certainly one so learned in the subject need not dread a crossexamination cried the youth in her own manner  well proceed cried the lady i have driven aunt margaret from the field and you will fare no better i can assure you  men you say are too gross to feel a pure friendship in the first place please to explain yourself on this point  why i mean that your friendships are generally interested that it requires services and good offices to support it  while that of women depends on  feeling alone  but what excites this feeling asked charles with a smile  what why sympathyand a knowledge of each others good qualities  then you think miss miller has more good qualities than katherine emmerson said weston  when did i ever say so cried julia in surprise  i infer it from your loving her better merely returned the young man with a little of miss emmersons dryness  it would be difficult to compare them said julia after a moments pause katherine is in the world and has had an opportunity of showing her merit that anna has never enjoyed katherine is certainly a most excellent girl and i like her very much but there is no reason to think that anna will not prove as fine a young woman as katherine when put to the trial  pray said the young lawyer with great gravity how many of these bosom these confidential friends can a young woman have at the same time  one only oneany more than she could have two lovers cried julia quickly  why then did you find it necessary to take that one from a set that was untried in the practice of welldoing when so excellent a subject as your cousin katherine offered  but anna i know i feel is every thing that is good and sincere and our sympathies drew us together katherine i loved naturally  how naturally  is it not natural to love your relatives said julia in surprise  no was the brief answer  surely charles weston you think me a simpleton does not every parent love its child by natural instinct  no no more than you love any of your amusements from instinct if the parent was present with a child that he did not know to be his own would instinct think you discover their vicinity  certainly not if they had never met before but then as soon as he knew it to be his he would love it from nature  it is a complicated question and one that involves a thousand connected feelings said charles but all love at least all love of the heart springs from the causes you mentioned to your auntgood offices a dependence on each other and habit  yes and nature too said the young lady rather positively and i contend that natural love and love from sympathy are two distinct things  very different i allow said charles only i very much doubt the durability of that affection which has no better foundation than fancy  you use such queer terms charles that you do not treat the subject fairly calling innate evidence of worth by the name of fancy is not candid  now indeed your own terms puzzle me said charles smiling what is innate evidence of worth  why a conviction that another possesses all that you esteem yourself and is discovered by congenial feelings and natural sympathies  upon my word julia you are quite a casuist on this subject does love then between the sexes depend on this congenial sympathy and innate evidence  now you talk on a subject that i do not understand said julia blushing and catching up the highly prized work she ran to her own room leaving the young man in a state of mingled admiration and pity     chapter ii   an anxious fortnight was passed by julia warren after this conversation without bringing any tidings from her friend she watched with feverish restlessness each steamboat that passed the door on its busy way towards the metropolis and met the servant each day at the gate of the lawn on his return from the city but it was only to receive added disappointments at length charles weston goodnaturedly offered his own services laughingly declaring that his luck was never known to fail julia herself had written several long epistles to anna and it was now the proper time that some of these should be answered independently of the thousand promises from her friend of writing regularly from every postoffice that she might pass on her route to the gennessee but the happy moment had arrived when disappointments were to cease as usual julia was waiting with eager impatience at the gate her lovely form occasionally gliding from the shrubbery to catch a glimpse of the passengers on the highway when charles appeared riding at a full gallop towards the house his whole manner announced success and julia sprang into the middle of the road to take the letter which he extended towards her  i knew i should be successful and it gives me almost as much pleasure as yourself that i have been so said the youth dismounting from his horse and opening the gate that his companion might pass  thank youthank you dear charles said julia kindly i never can forget how good you are to mehow much you love to oblige not only me but every one around you excuse me now i have this dear letter to read another time i will thank you as i ought  so saying julia ran into the summerhouse and fastening its door gave herself up to the pleasure of reading a first letter notes and short epistles from her aunt with divers letters from anna written slyly in the schoolroom and slipped into her lap she was already well acquainted with but of real genuine letters stamped by the postoffice rumpled by the mailbags consecrated by the steamboat this was certainly the first this indeed was a real letter rivers rolled and vast tracts of country lay between herself and its writer and that writer was a friend selected on the testimony of innate evidence it was necessary for julia to pause and breathe before she could open her letter and by the time this was done her busy fancy had clothed both epistle and writer with so much excellence that she was prepared to peruse the contents with a respect bordering on enthusiasm every word must be trueevery idea purity itself that our readers may know how accurately sixteen and a brilliant fancy had qualified her to judge we shall give them the letter entire       my dearest love       oh julia here i am and such a placeno town no churches no      broadway nothing that can make life desirable and i may add no      friendnobody to see and talk with but papa and mamma and a      house full of brothers and sisters you cant think how i miss you      every minute more and more but i am not without hopes of      persuading pa to let me spend the winter with your aunt in town i      declare it makes me sick every time i think of her sweet house in      parkplace if ever i marry and be sure i will it shall be a man      who lives in the city and next door to my julia oh how charming      that would be each of us to have one of those delightful new      houses with the newfashioned basement stories we would run in      and out at all hours of the day and it would be so convenient to      lend and borrow each others things i do think there is no      pleasure under heaven equal to that of wearing things that belong      to your friend dont you remember how fond i was of wearing your      clothes at school though you were not so fond of changing as      myself but that was no wonder for pas stinginess kept me so      shabbily dressed that i was ashamed to let you be seen in them      oh julia i shall never forget those happy hours nor you neither      aproposi hope you have not forgot the frock you promised to work      for me to remember you by i long for it dreadfully and hope you      will send it before the river shuts i suppose you and charles      weston do nothing but ride round among those beautiful villas on      the island and take comfort i do envy you your happiness i can      tell you for i think any beau better than none though mr weston      is not to my taste i am going to write you six sheets of paper      for there is nothing that i so delight in as communing with a      friend at a distance especially situated as i am without a soul to      say a word to unless it be my own sisters adieu my ever ever      beloved juliabe to me as i am to you a friend indeed one tried      and not found wanting in haste your       anna       gennessee june 15 1816       p s dont forget to jog aunt emmersons memory about asking me      to parkplace       p s june 25th not having yet sent my letter although i am sure      you must be dying with anxiety to hear how we get on i must add      that we have a companion here that would delight youa mr edward      stanley what a delightful name and he is as delightful as his      name his eye his nose his whole countenance are perfect in      short julia he is just such a man as we used to draw in our      conversation at school he is rich and brave and sensible and i      do nothing but talk to him of you he says he longs to see you      knows you must be handsome is sure you are sensible and feels      that you are good oh he is worth a dozen charles westons but you      may give my compliments to mr weston though i dont suppose he      ever thinks it worth his while to remember such a chick as me i      should like to hear what he says about me and i will tell you all      edward stanley says of you once more adieu your letters got here      safe and in due season i let edward take a peep at them  the first time julia read this letter she was certainly disappointed it contained no descriptions of the lovely scenery of the west the moon had risen and the sun had set on the lakes of the interior and anna had said not one word of either but the third and fourth time of reading began to afford more pleasure and at the thirteenth perusal she pronounced it charming there was evidently much to be understood vacuums that the fancy could easily fill and before julia had left the summerhouse the letter was extended in her imagination to the promised six sheets she walked slowly through the shrubbery towards the house musing on the contents of her letter or rather what it might be supposed to contain and unconsciously repeating to herself in a low tone  young handsome rich and sensiblejust as we used to paint in our conversation oh how delightful  delightful indeed to possess all those fine qualities and who is the happy individual that is so blessed asked charles weston who had been lingering in the walks with an umbrella to shield her on her return from an approaching shower  oh said julia starting i did not know you were near me i have been reading annas sweet letter pressing the paper to her bosom as she spoke  doubtless you must be done by this time julia and pointing to the clouds you had better hasten to the house i knew you would be terrified at the lightning all alone by yourself in that summerhouse so i came to protect you  you are very good charles but does it lighten said julia in terror and hastening her retreat to the dwelling  your letter must have interested you deeply not to have noticed the thunderyou who are so timid and fearful of the flashes  foolishly fearful you would say if you were not afraid of hurting my feelings i know said julia  it is a natural dread and therefore not to be laughed at answered charles mildly  then there is natural fear but no natural love mr charles now you are finely caught cried julia exultingly  well be it so with me fear is very natural and i can almost persuade myself love also  i hope you are not a coward charles weston a cowardly man is very despicable i could never love a cowardly man said julia laughing  i dont know whether i am what you call a coward said charles gravely but when in danger i am always afraid  the words were hardly uttered before a flash of lightning followed instantly by a tremendously heavy clap of thunder nearly stupified them both the suddenness of the shock had for a moment paralyzed the energy of the youth while julia was nearly insensible soon recovering himself however charles drew her after him into the house in time to escape a torrent of rain the storm was soon over and their natural fear and surprise were a source of mirth for julia women are seldom ashamed of their fears for their fright is thought to be feminine and attractive but men are less easy under the imputation of terror as it is thought to indicate an absence of manly qualities  oh you will never make a hero charles cried julia laughing heartily it is well you chose the law instead of the army as a profession  i dont know said the youth a little nettled i think i could muster courage to face a bullet  but remember that you shut your eyes and bent nearly double at the flashnow you owned all this yourself  at least he was candid and acknowledged his infirmities said miss emmerson who had been listening  i think most men would have done as i did at so heavy and so sudden a clap of thunder and so very near too said charles striving to conceal the uneasiness he felt  when apprehension for julia must have increased your terror said the aunt kindly  why noi rather believe i thought only of myself at the moment returned charles but then julia you must do me the justice to say that instantly i thought of the danger of your taking cold and drew you into the house  oh you ran from another clap said julia laughing till her dark eyes flashed with pleasure and shaking her head until her glossy hair fell in ringlets over her shoulders you will never make a hero charles  do you know any one who would have behaved better miss warren said the young man angrily  yeswhyi dont know yes i have heard of such an one i think answered julia slightly colouring but dear charles excuse my laughter she continued holding out her hand if you are not a hero you are very very good  but charles weston at the moment would rather be thought a hero than very very good he therefore rose and affecting a smile endeavoured to say something trifling as he retired  you have mortified charles said miss emmerson so soon as he was out of hearing  i am sure i hope not said julia with a good deal of anxiety he is the last person i would wish to offend he is so very kind  no young man of twenty is pleased with being thought no hero returned the aunt  and yet all are not so said julia  i hardly know what you mean by a hero if you mean such men as washington greene or warren all are surely not so these were heroes in deeds but others may be equally brave  i mean by a hero a man whose character is unstained by any low or degenerate vices or even feelings said julia with a little more than her ordinary enthusiasm whose courage is as natural as it is daring who is above fear except of doing wrong whose person is an index of his mind and whose mind is filled with images of glory thats what i call a hero aunt  then he must be handsome as well as valiant said miss emmerson with a smile that was hardly perceptible  why that isisnot absolutely material replied julia blushing but one would wish to have him handsome too  oh by all means it would render his virtues more striking but i think you intimated that you knew such a being returned miss emmerson fixing her mild eyes on julia in a manner that denoted great interest  did i said julia colouring scarlet i am surei have forgottenit must be a mistake surely dear aunt  very possibly i misunderstood you my dear said miss emmerson rising and withdrawing from the room in apparent indifference to the subject  julia continued musing on the dialogue which had passed and soon had recourse to the letter of her friend the postscript of which was all however that she thought necessary to read on this she dwelt until the periods were lengthened into paragraphs each syllable into words and each letter into syllables anna miller had furnished the outlines of a picture that the imagination of julia had completed the name of edward stanley was repeated internally so often that she thought it the sweetest name she had ever heard his eyes his nose his countenance were avowed to be handsome and her fancy soon gave a colour and form to each he was sensible how sensible her friend had not expressly stated but then the powers of anna great as they undoubtedly were could not compass the mighty extent of so gigantic a mind brave too anna had called him this she must have learnt from acts of desperate courage that he had performed in the war which had so recently terminated or perhaps he might have even distinguished himself in the presence of anna by some exploit of cool and determined daring her heart burned to know all the particulars but how was she to inquire them anna dear indiscreet girl had already shown her letters and her delicacy shrunk from the exposure of her curiosity to its object after a multitude of expedients had been adopted and rejected as impracticable julia resorted to the course of committing her inquiries to paper most solemnly enjoining her friend never to expose her weakness to mr stanley this thought julia she never could do it would be unjust to me and indelicate in her so julia wrote as follows first seeking her own apartment and carefully locking the door that she might devote her whole attention to friendship and her letter       dearest anna       your kind letter reachd me after many an anxious hour spent in      expectation and repays me tenfold for all my uneasiness surely      anna there is no one that can write half so agreeably as yourself      i know there must be a longlongepistle for me on the road      containing those descriptions and incidents you promised to favour      me with how i long to read them and to show them to my aunt      margaret who i believe does not suspect you to be capable of      doing that which i know or rather feel you can knowing from any      thing but feeling and the innate evidence of our sympathies seems      to me something like heresy in friendship oh anna how could you      be so cruel as to show my letters to any one and that to a      gentleman and a stranger i never would have served you so not      even to good charles weston whom i esteem so highly and who      really wants neither judgment nor good nature though he is      dreadfully deficient in fancy yet charles is a most excellent      young man and i gave him the compliments you desired he was so      much flattered by your notice that he could make no reply though i      doubt not he prized the honour as he ought we are all very happy      here only for the absence of my anna but so long as miles of      weary roads and endless rivers run between us perfect happiness      can never reign in the breast of your julia anna i conjure you by      all the sacred delicacy that consecrates our friendship never to      show this letter unless you would break my heart you never will      i am certain and therefore i will write to my anna in the      unreserved manner in which we conversed when fate less cruel than      at present suffered us to live in the sunshine of each others      smiles you speak of a certain person in your letter whom for      obvious reasons i will in future call antonio you describe him      with the partiality of a friend but how can i doubt his being      worthy of all that you say and moresensible brave rich and      handsome from his name i suppose of course he is well      connected what a constellation of attractions to centre in one      man but you have not told me allhis age his family his      profession though i presume he has borne arms in the service of      his country and that his manly breast is already covered with the      scars of honour ah anna he jests at scars who never felt a      wound but my dear creature you say that he talks of me what      under the sun can you find to say of such a poor girl as myself      though i suppose you have in the fondness of affection described      my person to him already i wonder if he likes black eyes and fair      complexion you cant conceive what a bloom the country has given      me i really begin to look more like a milkmaid than a lady dear      good aunt margaret has been quite sick since you left us and for      two days i was hardly out of her room this has put me back a      little in colour or i should be as ruddy as the morn but nothing      ought ever to tempt me to neglect my aunt and i hope nothing ever      will be assured that i shall beg her to write you to spend the      winter with us for i feel already that without you life is a      perfect blank you indeed must have something to enliven it with a      little in your new companions but here is nobody just now but      charles weston yet he is an excellent companion and does every      thing he can to make us all happy and comfortable heigho how i do      wish i could see you my anna and spend one sweet half hour in the      dear confidence of mutual sympathy but lie quiet my throbbing      heart the day approaches when i shall meet my friend again and      more than receive a reward for all our griefs ah anna never      betray your julia and write to me fully confidingly and      often       yours with all the tenderness of friendship that is founded on      mutual sympathy congenial souls and innate evidence of worth       julia       p s i should like to know whether antonio has any scars in his      face and what battles he was in only think my dear poor charles      weston was frightened by a clap of thunderbut charles has an      excellent heart  this letter was written and read sealed and kissed when miss emmerson tapped gently at the door of her niece and begged admission julia flew to open it and received her aunt with the guileless pleasure her presence ever gave her a few words of introductory matter were exchanged when being both seated at their needles again miss emmerson asked  to whom have you been writing my love  to my anna  do you recollect my child that in writing to miss miller you are writing to one out of your own family and whose interests are different from yours  i do not understand you aunt cried julia in surprise  i mean that you should be guarded in your correspondencetell no secrets out  tell no secrets to my anna exclaimed the niece in a species of horror that would be a deathblow to our friendship indeed  then let it die said miss emmerson coolly the affection that cannot survive the loss of such an excitement had better be suffered to expire as soon as possible or it may raise false expectations  why dear aunt in destroying confidence of this nature you destroy the great object of friendship who ever heard of a friendship without secrets  i never had a secret in my life said miss emmerson simply and yet i have had many a friend  well said julia yours must have been queer friends pray dear aunt name one or two of them  your mother was my friend said miss emmerson with strong emotion and i hope her daughter also is one  me my beloved aunt cried julia throwing herself into the arms of miss emmerson and bursting into tears i am more than a friend i am your childyour daughter  whatever be the name you give it julia you are very near and dear to me said the aunt tenderly kissing her charge but tell me my love did you ever feel such emotion in your intercourse with miss miller  it was some time before julia could reply when having suppressed the burst of her feelings she answered with a smile  oh that question is not fair you have brought me up nursed me in sickness are kind and good to me and the idea that you should suppose i did not love you was dreadfulbut you know i do  i firmly believe so my child it is you that i would have know what it is that you love i am satisfied for myself i repeat did anna miller ever excite such emotions  certainly not my love to you is natural but my friendship for anna rests on sympathy and a perfect knowledge of her character  i am glad however that you know her so well since you are so intimate what testimony have you of all this excellence  innate evidence i see iti feel ityes that is the best testimonyi feel her good qualities yes my friendship for anna forms the spring of my existence while any accident or evil to you would afflict me the same as if done to myselfthis is pure nature you know  i know it is pleasing to learn it come from what it will said the aunt smiling and rising to withdraw     chapter iii   several days passed after this conversation in the ordinary quiet of a well regulated family notwithstanding the house of miss emmerson stood in the midst of the numberless villas that adorn manhattan island the habits of its mistress were retiring and domestic julia was not of an age to mingle much in society and anna had furnished her with a theme for her meditations that rather rendered her averse from the confusion of company her mind was constantly employed in canvassing the qualities of the unseen antonio her friend had furnished her with a catalogue of his perfections in gross which her active thoughts were busily arranging into form and substance but little practised in the world or its disappointments the visionary girl had already figured to herself a person to suit these qualities and the animal was no less pleasing than the moral being of her fancy what principally delighted julia in these contemplations on the acquaintance of anna was the strong inclination he had expressed to know herself this flattered her tendency to believe in the strength of mutual sympathy and the efficacy of innate evidence of merit in the midst of this pleasing employment of her fancy she received a second letter from her friend in answer to the one we have already given to our readers it was couched in the following words       my own dear julia my friend       i received your letter with the pleasure i shall always hear from      you and am truly obliged to you for your kind offer to make      interest with your aunt to have me spend the next winter in town      to be with you is the greatest pleasure i have on earth besides      as i know i can write to you as freely as i think one can readily      tell what a tiresome place this must be to pass a winter in there      are absolutely but three young men in the whole county who can be      thought in any manner as proper matches for us and one had no      chance here of forming such an association as to give a girl an      opportunity of meeting with her congenial spirit so that i hope      and trust your desire to see me will continue as strong as mine      will ever be to see my julia you say that i have forgotten to give      you the description of our journey and of the lakes that i promised      to send you no my julia i have not forgotten the promise nor      you but the thought of enjoying such happiness without your dear      company has been too painful to dwell upon of this you may judge      for yourself our first journey was made in the steamboat to      albany she is a moving world the vessel ploughs through the      billowy waters in onward progress and the soul is left in silent      harmony to enjoy the change the passage of the highlands is most      delightful figure to yourself my julia the rushing waters      lessening from their expanded width to the degeneracy of the      stagnant poolrocks rise on rocks in overhanging mountains until      the weary eye refusing its natural office yields to the fancy      what its feeble powers can never conquer clouds impend over their      summits and the thoughts pierce the vast abyss ah julia these      are moments of awful romance how the soul longs for the      consolations of friendship albany is one of the most picturesque      places in the world situated most delightfully on the banks of the      hudson which here meanders in sylvan beauty through meadows of      evergreen and desert islands words are wanting to paint the      melancholy beauties of the ride to schenectady through gloomy      forests where the silvery pine waves in solemn grandeur to the      sighings of eolus while boreas threatens in vain their firmrooted      trunks but the lakes ah juliathe lakes the most beautiful is      the seneca named after a grecian king the limpid water neer      ruffled by the rude breathings of the wind shines with golden      tints to the homage of the rising sun while the light bark      gallantly lashes the surge rocking before the propelling gale and      forcibly brings to the appalled mind the fleeting hours of time      but i must pausemy pen refuses to do justice to the subject and      the remainder will furnish us hours of conversation during the      tedious moments of the delightful visit to parkplace you speak      of antoniodear girl with me the secret is hallowed he is yet      here his whole thoughts are of juliafrom my description only he      has drawn your picture which is the most striking in the world      and nothing can tear the dear emblem from his keeping he called      here yesterday in his phaeton and insisted on my riding a few      short miles in his company i assented for i knew it was to talk      of my friend he already feels your worth and handed me the      following verses which he begged me to offer as the sincere homage      of his heart he intends accompanying my father and me to town next      winterprovided i go      oh charming image of an artless fair       whose eyes with lightning fire the very soul     whose face portrays the mind and ebon hair       gives grace and harmony unto the whole      in vain i gaze entrancd in vain deplore       the leagues that roll between the maid and me     lonely i wander on the desert shore       and julias lovely form can never see      but fly ye fleeting hours i beg ye fly       and bring the time when anna seeks her friend     hasteoh haste or edward sure must die       arriveand quickly edwards sorrows end       i know you will think with me that these lines are beautiful and      merely a faint image of his manly heart in the course of our ride      during which he did nothing but converse on your beauty and merit      he gave me a detailed narrative of his life it was long but i can      do no less than favour you with an abridgment of it edward stanley      was early left an orphan no fathers guardian eye directed his      footsteps no mothers fostering care cherished his infancy his      estate was princely and his family noble being a wronged branch      of an english potentate during his early youth he had to contend      against the machinations of a malignant uncle who would have      robbed him of his large possessions and left him in black despair      to have eaten the bread of penury his courage and understanding      however conquered this difficulty and at the age of fourteen he      was quietly admitted to an university here he continued peacefully      to wander amid the academic bowers until the blast of war rung in      his ears and called him to the field of honour edward was ever      foremost in the hour of danger it was his fate to meet the enemy      often and as often did he pluck honour from the palefacd moon      he fought at chippewabled at the side of the gallant      lawrenceand nearly laid down his life on the ensanguined plains      of marengo but it would be a fruitless task to include all the      scenes of his danger and his glory thanks to the kind fates which      shield the lives of the brave he yet lives to adore my julia that      you may be as happy as you deserve and happier than your      heartstricken friend is the constant prayer of your       anna       p s write me soon and make my very best respects to your      excellent aunt it was laughable enough that charles weston should      be afraid of a flash of lightning i mentioned it to antonio who      cried while manly indignation clouded his brow chill penury      repressed his noble rage and froze the genial current of the      soul however say nothing to charles about it i charge you  julia fairly gasped for breath as she read this epistle her very soul was entranced by the song whatever of seeming contradiction there might be in the letter of her friend her active mind soon reconciled she was now really beloved and in a manner most grateful to her heartby the sole power of sympathy and congenial feelings whatever might be the adoration of edward stanley it was more than equalled by the admiration of this amiable girl her very soul seemed to her to be devoted to his worship she thought of him constantly and pictured out his various distresses and dangers she wept at his sufferings and rejoiced in his prosperityand all this in the short space of one hour julia was yet in the midst of this tumult of feeling when another letter was placed in her hands and on opening it she read as follows       dear julia       i should have remembered my promise and come out and spent a week      with you had not one of marys little boys been quite sick of      course i went to her until he recovered but if you will ask aunt      margaret to send for me i will come tomorrow with great pleasure      for i am sure you must find it solitary now miss miller has left      you tell aunt to send by the servant a list of such books as she      wants from goodrichs and i will get them for her or indeed any      thing else that i can do for her or you give my love to aunt and      tell her that knowing her eyes are beginning to fail i have      worked her a cap which i shall bring with me mamma desires her      love to you both and believe me to be affectionately your cousin       katherine emmerson  this was well enough but as it was merely a letter of business one perusal and that a somewhat hasty one was sufficient julia loved its writer more than she suspected herself but there was nothing in her manner or character that seemed calculated to excite strong emotion in short all her excellences were so evident that nothing was left dependent on innate evidence and our heroine seldom dwelt with pleasure on any character that did not give a scope to her imagination in whatever light she viewed the conduct or disposition of her cousin she was met by obstinate facts that admitted of no cavil nor of any exaggeration  turning quickly therefore from this barren contemplation to one better suited to her inclinations julias thoughts resumed the agreeable reverie from which she had been awakened she also could paint and after twenty trials she at length sketched an outline of the figure of a man that answered to annas description and satisfied her own eye without being conscious of the theft she had copied from a print of the apollo and clothed it in the uniform which bonaparte is said to have worn a small scar was traced on the cheek in such a manner that although it might be fancied as the ravages of a bullet it admirably answered all the purposes of a dimple two epaulettes graced the shoulders of the hero and before the picture was done although it was somewhat at variance with republican principles an aristocratical star glittered on its breast had he his birthright thought julia it would be there in reality and this idea amply justified the innovation to this image which it took several days to complete certain verses were addressed also but they were never submitted to the confidence of her friend the whole subject was now beginning to be too sacred even for such a communication and as the mind of julia every hour became more entranced with its new master her delicacy shrunk from an exposure of her weakness it was getting too serious for the light compositions of epistolary correspondence  we furnish a copy of the lines as they are not only indicative of her feelings but may give the reader some idea of the powers of her imagination      beloved image of a godlike mind       in sacred privacy thy power i feel     what bright perfection in thy forms combind       how sure to injure and how kind to heal      thine eagle eye bedazzles een the brain       thy gallant brow bespeaks the front of jove     while smiles enchant me tears in torrents rain       and each seductive charm impels to love      ah hapless maid why daring dost thou prove       the hidden dangers of the urchins dart     why fix thine eye on this the god of love       and heedless think thee to retain thy heart  this was but one of fifty similar effusions in which julia poured forth her soul the flame was kept alive by frequent letters from her friend in all of which she dwelt with rapture on the moment of their reunion and never failed to mention antonio in a manner that added new fuel to the fire that already began to consume julia and in some degree to undermine her health at least she thought so  in the mean time katherine emmerson paid her promised visit to her friends and our heroine was in some degree drawn from her musings on love and friendship the manners of this young lady were conspicuously natural she had a confirmed habit of calling things by their right names and never dwelt in the least in superlatives her affections seemed centered in the members of her own family nor had she ever given julia the least reason to believe she preferred her to her own sister notwithstanding that sister was married and beyond the years of romance yet julia loved her cousin and was hardly ever melancholy or out of spirits when in her company the cheerful and affectionate good humour of katherine was catching and all were pleased with her although but few discovered the reason charles weston soon forgot his displeasure and with the exception of julias hidden uneasiness the house was one quiet scene of peaceful content the party were sitting at their work the day after the arrival of katherine when julia thought it a good opportunity to intimate her wish to have the society of her friend during the ensuing winter  why did mr miller give up his house in town i wonder said julia i am sure it was inconsiderate to his family  rather say my child that it was in consideration to his children that he did so observed miss emmerson his finances would not bear the expense and suffer him to provide for his family after his death  i am sure a little money might be spent now to indulge his children in society and they would be satisfied with less hereafter continued julia mr miller must be rich and think aunt he has seven grown up daughters that he has dragged with him into the wilderness only think katherine how solitary they must be  had i six sisters i could be solitary no where said katherine simply besides i understand that the country where mr miller resides is beautiful and populous  oh there are men and women enough i dare say cried julia and the family is largeeleven in the whole but they must feel the want of friends in such a retired place  what with six sisters said katherine laughing and shaking her head  there is a difference between a sister and a friend you know said julia a little surprised  iindeed i have yet to learn that exclaimed the other in a little more astonishment  why you feel affection for your sisters from nature and habit but friendship is voluntary spontaneous and a much stronger feelingfriendship is a sentiment  and cannot one feel this sentiment as you call it for a sister asked katherine smiling  i should think not returned julia musing i never had a sister but it appears to me that the very familiarity of sisters would be destructive to friendship  why i thought it was the confidencethe familiaritythe secretswhich form the very essence of friendship cried katherine at least so i have always heard  true said julia eagerly you speak truethe confidence and the secretsbut not thethei am not sure that i express myself wellbut the intimate knowledge that one has of ones own sisterthat i should think would be destructive to the delicacy of friendship  julia means that a prophet has never honour in his own country cried charles with a laugha somewhat doubtful compliment to your sex ladies under her application of it  but what becomes of your innate evidence of worth in friendship asked miss emmerson i thought that was the most infallible of all kinds of testimony surely that must bring you intimately acquainted with each others secret foibles too  oh nothat is a species of sentimental knowledge returned julia it only dwells on the loftier parts of the character and never descends to the minute knowledge which makes us suffer so much in each others estimation it leaves all these to be filled by theby theby thewhat shall i call it  imagination said katherine dryly  well by the imagination then but it is an imagination that is purified by sentiment and  already rendered partial by the innate evidence of worth interrupted charles  julia had lost herself in the mazes of her own ideas and changed the subject under a secret suspicion that her companions were amusing themselves at her expense she therefore proceeded directly to urge the request of anna miller  oh aunt now we are on the subject of friends i wish to request you would authorize me to invite my anna to pass the next winter with us in parkplace  i confess my love said miss emmerson glancing her eye at katherine that i had different views for ourselves next winter has not miss miller a married sister living in town  yes but she has positively refused to ask the dear girl i know said julia anna is not a favourite with her sister  very odd that said the aunt gravely there must be a reason for her dislike then what can be the cause of this unusual distaste for each other  oh cried julia it is all the fault of mrs welton they quarrelled about something i dont know what but anna assures me mrs welton is entirely in fault  indeedand you are perfectly sure that mrs welton is in faultperhaps anna has however laid too strong a stress upon the error of her sister observed the aunt  oh not at all dear aunt i can assure you on my own knowledge continued julia anna was anxious for a reconciliation and offered to come and spend the winter with her sister but mrs welton declared positively that she would not have so selfish a creature round her children now this anna told me herself one day and wept nearly to break her heart at the time  perhaps mrs welton was right then said miss emmerson and prudence if not some other reason justified her refusal  how can you say so dear aunt interrupted julia with a little impatience when i tell you that anna herselfmy anna told me with her own lips here in this very house that mrs welton was entirely to blame and that she had never done any thing in her life to justify the treatment or the remarknow anna told me this with her own mouth  as julia spoke the ardour of her feelings brought the colour to her cheeks and an animation to her eyes that rendered her doubly handsome and charles weston who had watched her varying countenance with delight sighed as she concluded and rising left the room  i understand that your father intends spending his winter in carolina for his health said miss emmerson to katherine  yes returned the other in a low tone and bending over her work to conceal her feelings mother has persuaded him to avoid our winter  and you are to be left behind  i am afraid so was the modest reply  and your brother and sister go to washington together  that is the arrangement i believe  miss emmerson said no more but she turned an expressive look on her ward which julia was too much occupied with her thoughts to notice the illness of her father and the prospect of a long separation from her sister were too much for the fortitude of katherine at any time and hastily gathering her work in her hand she left the room just in time to prevent the tears which streamed down her cheeks from meeting the eyes of her companions  we ought to ask katherine to make one of our family in the absence of her mother and sister said miss emmerson as soon as the door was closed  ah yes cried julia fervently by all means poor katherine how solitary she would be any where elsei will go this instant and ask her  butstop a moment my love you will remember that we have not room for more than one guest if katherine is asked miss miller cannot be invited let us look at what we are about and leave nothing to repent of hereafter  ah it is true said julia reseating herself in great disappointment where will poor katherine stay then  i know my brother expects that i will take her under my charge and indeed i think he has right to ask it of me  but she has no such right as my anna who is my bosom friend you know katherine has a right here it is true but it is only such a right  as your own interrupted the aunt gravely you are the daughter of my sister and katherine is the daughter of my brother  truetrueif it be right lawful right that is to decide it then katherine must come i suppose said julia a little piqued  let us proceed with caution my love said miss emmerson kissing her niecedo you postpone your invitation until september when if you continue of the same mind we will give anna the desired invitation in the mean while prepare yourself for what i know will be a most agreeable surprise     chapter iv   although julia spent most of her time with her aunt and cousin opportunities for meditation were not wanting in the retirement of her closet she perused and reperused the frequent letters of her friend the modesty of julia or rather shame would have prevented her from making anna acquainted with all her feelings but it would have been treason to her friendship not to have poured out a little of her soul at the feet of miss miller accordingly in her letters julia did not avoid the name of antonio she mentioned it often but with womanly delicacy if not with discretion the seeds of constant association had unknown to herself taken deep root and it was not in the power of anna miller to eradicate impressions which had been fastened by the example of the aunt and cherished by the society of her cousin although deluded weak and even indiscreet julia was not indelicate yet enough escaped her to have given any experienced eye an insight into the condition of her mind had anna chosen to have exposed her letters to any one the danger of such a correspondence should alone deter any prudent female from its indulgence society has branded the man with scorn who dares abuse the confidence of a woman in this manner and the dread of the indignation of his associates makes it an offence which is rarely committed by the other sex but there is no such obligation imposed on women and that frequently passes for a joke which harrows every feeling that is dear to the female breast and violates all that is delicate and sensitive in our nature surely where it is necessary from any adventitious circumstances to lay the heart open in this manner it should only be done to those whose characters are connected with our own and who feel ridicule inflicted on us as disgrace heaped on themselves a peculiar evil of these confidential friendships is that they are most liable to occur when from their youth their victims are the least guarded and at the same time from inconstancy the most liable to change happily however for julias peace of mind she foresaw no such dangers from her intimacy with anna and letter and answer passed between them at short intervals during the remainder of the summer we shall give but one more specimen of each as they have strong resemblance to one anotherwe select two that were written late in august       my own and beloved julia       your letters are the only consolation that my anxious heart can      know in the dreary solitude of this place oh my friend how would      your tender heart bleed did you but know the least of my      sufferings but they are all requited by the delightful      anticipations of parkplace i hope your dear aunt has not found it      necessary to lay down her carriage in the change of the times      write me in your next about it antonio has been here again and he      solicited an audience with me in privateof course i granted it      for friendship hallows all that is done under its mantle it was a      moonlight nightmild luna shedding a balmy light on surrounding      objects and if possible rendering my heart more sensitive than      ever one solitary glimmering star showed by its paly quiverings      the impress of evening while not a cloud obscured the vast      firmament of heaven on such an evening antonio could do nothing      but converse of my absent friend he dwelt on the indescribable      grace of your person the lustre of your eye and the vermilion of      your lips until exhausted language could furnish no more epithets      of rapture then the transition to your mind was natural and easy      and it was while listening to his honied accents that i thought my      julia herself was talking      soft as the dews from heaven descend his gentle accents fell       ah julia nothing but a strong prepossession and my friendship      for you could remove the danger of such a scene yes friend of my      heart i must acknowledge my weakness there is a youth in      newyork who has long been master of my too sensitive heart and      without him life will be a burthen cruel fate divides us now but      when invited by your aunt to parkplace oh rapture unutterable      i shall be near my regulus this surely is all that can be      wanting to stimulate my julia to get the invitation from her aunt      antonio says that if i go to the city this fall he will hover near      me on the road to guard the friend of julia and that he will      eagerly avail himself of my presence to seek her society i am      called from my delightful occupation by one of my troublesome      sisters who wishes me to assist her in some trifle or other make      my most profound respects to your dear good aunt and believe me      your own true friend       anna  at length julia thought she had made the discovery of annas reason for her evident desire to spend the winter in townlike herself her friend had become the victim of the soft passion and from that moment julia determined that katherine emmerson must seek another residence in order that anna might breathe loves atmosphere how much a desire to see antonio governed this decision we cannot say but we are certain that if in the least julia was herself ignorant of the power with her it seemed to be the result of pure disinterested and confiding friendship in answer our heroine wrote as follows       my beloved anna       your kind consolatory letters are certainly the solace of my      life ah anna i have long thought that some important secret lay      heavy at your heart the incoherency of your letters and certain      things too trifling to mention had made me suspect that some      unusual calamity had befallen you you do not mention who regulus      is i am burning with curiosity to know although i doubt not but      he is every way worthy of your choice       i have in vain run over in my mind every young man that we know      but not one of them that i can find has any of the qualities of a      hero do relieve my curiosity in your next and i may have it in my      power to write you something of his movements oh anna why will      you dwell on the name of antonioi am sure i ought not to listen      as i do to what he saysand when we meet i am afraid that he      will not find all the attractions which your too partial friendship      has portrayed if he should be thus disappointed oh      annaannawhat would become of your friendbut i will not dwell      on the horrid idea charles weston is yet here and katherine      emmerson too so that but for the thoughts of my absent anna and      perhaps a little uneasiness on the subject of antonio i might be      perfectly happy you know how good and friendly katherine is and      really charles does all in his power to please if he were only a      little more heroical he would be a charming young man for      although he is not very handsome i dont think you notice it in      the least when you are intimate with him poor charles he was      terribly mortified about the flash of lightningbut then all are      not brave alike adieu my annaand if you do converse more with a      certain person about you know whom let it be with discretion or      you may raise expectations she will not equal your own       julia       p s i had almost forgotten to say that aunt has promised me that      i can ask you to stay with us if after the 20th september i      wish it as you may be sure that i will aunt keeps her carriage      yet and i hope will never want it in her old age  about the time this letter was written miss emmerson made both of her nieces acquainted with the promised project that was to give them the agreeable surpriseshe had long contemplated going to see the falls and she now intended putting her plan into execution katherine was herself pressed to make one of the party but the young lady at the same time she owned her wish to see this farfamed cataract declined the offer firmly but gratefully on account of her desire to spend the remaining time with her father and mother before they went to the south charles weston looked from katherine to julia during this dialogue and for an instant was at a loss to know which he thought the handsomest of the cousins but julia entered into the feelings of the others so quickly and so gracefully offered to give up the journey in order that miss emmerson might continue with her brother that aided by her superior beauty she triumphed it was evident that consideration for her niece was a strong inducement with the aunt for making the journey and the contest became as disinterested as it was pleasing to the auditors but the authority of miss emmerson prevailed and charles was instantly enlisted as their escort for the journey julia never looked more beautiful or amiable than during this short controversy it had been mentioned by the aunt that she should take the house of mr miller in her road and the information excited an emotion that brought all her lustre to her eyes and bloom to her cheeks charles thought it was a burst of generous friendship and admired the selfdenial with which she urged her aunt to relinquish the idea but julia was constitutionally generous and it was the excess of the quality that made her enthusiastic and visionary if she did not deserve all of charless admiration she was entitled to no small share of it as soon as the question was determined in favour of going miss emmerson and katherine withdrew leaving charles alone with the heroine of our tale under the age of fiveandtwenty men commonly act at the instigation of sudden impulse and young weston was not yet twentyone he had long admired julia for her beauty and good feelings he did not see one half of her folly and he knew all of her worth her enthusiastic friendship for miss miller was forgotten even her mirth at his own want of heroism had at the moment escaped his memoryand the power of the young lady over him was never greater  how admirable in you julia he said seating himself by her side to urge what was against your own wishes in order to oblige your aunt  do you think so charles said the other simply but you see i urged it feebly for i did not prevail  no for you mistook your aunts wishes it seems she desires to gobut then all the loveliness of the act was yours  at the word loveliness julia raised her eyes to his face with a slight blushit was new language for charles weston to use and it was just suited to her feelings after a moments pause however she replied  you use strong language cousin charles such as is unusual for you  julia although i may not often have expressed it i have long thought you to be very lovely exclaimed the young man borne away with his ardour at the moment  upon my word charles you improve said julia blushing yet more deeply and if possible looking still handsomer than before  juliamiss warrenyou tear my secret from me before its timei love you julia and would wish to make you my wife  this was certainly very plain english nor did julia misunderstand a syllable of what he saidbut it was entirely new and unexpected to her she had lived with charles weston with the confidence of a kinswoman but had never dreamt of him as a lover indeed she saw nothing in him that looked like a being to excite or to entertain such a passion and although from the moment of his declaration she began insensibly to think differently of him nothing was farther from her mind than to return his offered affection but then the opportunity of making a sacrifice to her secret love was glorious and her frankness forbade her to conceal the truth indeed what better way was there to destroy the unhappy passion of charles than to convince him of its hopelessness these thoughts flashed through her mind with the rapidity of lightningand trembling with the agitation and novelty of her situation she answered in a low voice  that charles can never be  why never julia cried the youth giving way at once to his longsuppressed feelingswhy never try me prove me there is nothing i will not do to gain your love  oh how seductive to a female ear is the first declaration of an attachment especially when urged by youth and meritit assails her heart in the most vulnerable part and if it be not fortified unusually well seldom fails of success happily for julia the image of antonio presented itself to save her from infidelity to her old attachment and she replied  you are kind and good charles and i esteem you highlybut ask no more i beg of you  why if you grant me this why forbid me to hope for more said the youth eagerly and looking really handsome  julia hesitated a moment and let her dark eyes fall before his ardent gaze at a loss what to saybut the face of apollo in the imperial uniform interposed to save her  i owe it to your candour mr weston to own my weakness she said and hesitated  go on juliamy julia said charles in an unusually soft voice kill me at once or bid me live  again julia paused and again she looked on her companion with kinder eyes than usualwhen she felt the picture which lay next her heart and proceeded  yes mr weston this heart this foolish weak heart is no longer my own  how exclaimed charles in astonishment and have i then a rival and a successful one too  you have said julia burying her face in her hands to conceal her blushesbut mr weston on your generosity i depend for secresybe as generous as myself  yesyesi will conceal my misery from others cried charles springing on his feet and rushing from the room would to god i could conceal it from myself  julia was sensibly touched with his distress and for an instant there was some regret mingled with selfsatisfaction at her own candourbut then the delightful reflection soon presented itself of the gratitude of antonio when he learnt her generous conduct and her selfdenial in favour of a man whom she had as yet never seenat the same time she was resolutely determined never to mention the occurrence herselfnot even to her anna  miss emmerson was enabled to discover some secret uneasiness between charles and julia although she was by no means able to penetrate the secret the good aunt had long anxiously wished for just such a declaration as had been made to her niece and it was one of the last of her apprehensions that it would not have been favourably received of simple and plain habits herself miss emmerson was but little versed in the human heart she thought that julia was evidently happy and pleased with her young kinsman and she considered him in every respect a most eligible connexion for her charge their joint fortunes would make an ample estate and they were alike affectionate and goodtemperedwhat more could be wanting nothing however passed in the future intercourse of the young couple to betray their secrets and miss emmerson soon forgot her surmises charles was much hurt at julias avowal and had in vain puzzled his brains to discover who his rival could be no young man that was in the least so he thought suitable to his mistress visited her and he gave up his conjectures in despair of discovering this unknown lover until accident or design should draw him into notice little did he suspect the truth on the other hand julia spent her secret hours in the delightful consciousness of having now done something that rendered her worthy of antonio with occasional regret that she was compelled by delicacy and love to refuse charles so hastily as she had done  very soon after this embarrassing explanation julia received a letter from her friend that was in no way distinguishable from the rest except that it contained the real name of regulus which she declared to be henry frederick st albans if charles was at a loss to discover julias hidden love julia herself was equally uncertain how to know who this mr st albans was after a vast deal of musing she remembered that anna was absent from school without leave one evening and had returned alone with a young man who was unknown to the mistress this incident was said by some to have completed her education rather within the usual time julia had herself thought her friend indiscreet but on the whole hardly treatedand they left the school together this must have been mr st albans and anna stood fully exculpated in her eyes the letter also announced the flattering fact that antonio had already left the country ordering his servants and horses home and that he had gone to newyork with the intention of hovering around julia in a mask that she could not possibly remove during the dangers of their expected journey anna acknowledged that she had betrayed antonios secret but pleaded her duty to her friend in justification she did not think that julia would be able to penetrate his disguise as he had declared his intentions so to conceal himself by paint and artifice as to be able to escape detection here was a new source of pleasure to our heroine antonio was already on the wing for the city perhaps arrivednay might have seen her might even now be within a short distance of the summerhouse where she was sitting at the time and watching her movements as this idea suggested itself julia started and unconsciously arranging her hair by bringing forward a neglected curl moved with trembling steps towards the dwelling at each turn of the walk our heroine threw a timid eye around in quest of an unknown figure and more than once fancied she saw the face of the god of music peering at her from the friendly covert of her aunts shrubberyand twice she mistook the light green of a neighbouring cornfield waving in the wind for the coat of antonio julia had so long associated the idea of her hero with the image in her bosom that she had given it perfect identity but on more mature reflection she was convinced of her error he would come disguised anna had told her and had ordered his servants home where that home was julia was left in ignorancebut she fervently hoped not far removed from her beloved aunt the idea of a separation from this affectionate relative who had proved a mother to her in her infancy gave great pain to her best feelings and julia again internally prayed that the residence of antonio might not be far distantwhat the disguise of her lover would be julia could not imagineprobably that of a wandering harper but then she remembered that there were no harpers in america and the very singularity might betray his secret music is the food of love and julia fancied for a moment that antonio might appear as an itinerant organistbut it was only for a moment for as soon as she figured to herself the apollo form bending under the awkward load of a musicgrinder she turned in disgust from the picture his taste thought julia will protect me from such a sightshe might have added his convenience too various disguises presented themselves to our heroine until on a view of the whole subject she concluded that antonio would not appear as a musician at all but in some capacity in which he might continue unsuspected near her person and execute his project of shielding her from the dangers of travelling it was then only as a servant that he could appear and after mature reflection julia confidently expected to see him in the character of a coachman  willing to spare her own horses miss emmerson had already sent to the city for the keeper of a liverystable to come out and contract with her for a travelling carriage to convey her to the falls of niagara the man came and it is no wonder that julia under her impressions chose to be present at the conversation  well then said miss emmerson to the man i will pay you your price but you must furnish me with good horses to meet me at albanyremember that i take all the useless expense between the two cities that i may know whom it is i deal with  miss emmerson ought to know me pretty well by this time said the man i have driven her enough i think  and a driver continued the lady musing who am i to have for a driverhere julia became all attention trembling and blushing with apprehension  oh a driver cried the horsedealer i have got you an excellent driver one of the first chop in the city  although these were not the terms that our heroine would have used herself in speaking of this personage yet she thought they plainly indicated his superiority and she waited in feverish suspense to hear more  he must be steady and civil and sober and expert and tenderhearted said miss emmerson who thought of any thing but a hero in disguise  yesyesyesyesyes replied the stablekeeper nodding his head and speaking at each requisite he is all that i can engage to miss emmerson  and his eyesight must be good continued the lady deeply intent on providing well for her journey we may ride late in the evening and it is particularly requisite that he have good eyes  yesyes maam said the man in a little embarrassment that did not escape julia he has as good an eye as any man in america  of what age is he asked miss emmerson  about fifty replied the man thinking years would be a recommendation  fifty exclaimed julia in a tone of disappointment  tis too old said miss emmerson he should be able to undergo fatigue  well i may be mistakenoh he cant be more than forty or thirty continued the man watching the countenance of julia he is a man that looks much older than he is  is he strong and active  i guess he ishes as strong as an ox and active as a cat said the other determined he should pass  well then said the aunt in her satisfied way let every thing be ready for us in albany by next tuesday we shall leave home on monday  the man withdrew  julia had heard enoughfor ox she had substituted hercules and for cat she read the feathered mercury     chapter v   the long expected monday at length arrived and miss emmerson and julia taking an affectionate leave of their relatives in the city went on board the steamboat under the protection of charles weston here a new scene indeed opened on our heroine for some time she even forgot to look around her in the throng in quest of antonio as the boat glided along the stream she stood leaning on one arm of charles while miss emmerson held the other in delighted gaze at the objects which they had scarcely distinguished before they were passed  see dear charles cried julia in a burst of what she would call natural feelingthere is our househere the summerhouse and there the little arbour where you read to us last week scotts new novelhow delightful every thing now seems and feels like home  would it were a home for us all said charles gently pressing her arm in his own and speaking only to be heard by julia then should i be happy indeed  julia thought no more of antonio but while her delighted eye rested on the wellknown scenes around their house and she stood in the world for the first time leaning on charles she thought him even nearer than their intimacy and consanguinity made them but the boat was famous for her speed and the house garden and every thing julia knew were soon out of sight and she by accident touching the picture which she had encased in an old gold setting of her mothers and lodged in her bosom was immediately restored to her former sense of things then her eye glanced rapidly round the boat but discovering no face which in the least resembled disguise she abandoned the expectation of meeting her lover before they reached albany her beauty drew many an eye on her however and catching the steady and admiring gaze of one or two of the gentlemen julias heart beat and her face was covered with blushes she was by no means sure that antonio would appear as a coachmanthis was merely a suggestion of her own and the idea that he might possibly be one of the gazers covered her with confusion her blushes drew still more attention and admiration upon her and we cannot say what might have been the result of her fascinations had not charles at this instant approached them and pointing to a sloop they were passing at the time exclaimed  see madamsee juliathere is our travelling equipage on board that sloop going up to meet us in albany  our heroine looked as directed and saw a vessel moving with tolerable rapidity up the river within a short distance from them on its deck were a travelling carriage and a pair of horses and by the latter stood a man who by the whip in his hand was evidently the driver his stature was tall and athletic his complexion dark to near blackness his face was buried in whiskers and his employer had spoken the truth when he said he had as good an eye as any man in americait was large black and might be piercing but then he had but oneat least the place where the other ought to be was covered by an enormous patch of green silk this then was antonio it is true he did not resemble apollo but his disguise altered him so that it was difficult to determine as they moved slowly by the vessel the driver recognised charles having had an interview with him the day before and saluted him with a low bowhis salutation was noticed by the young man who slightly touched his hat and gave him a familiar nod in returnjulia unconsciously bent her body and felt her cheeks glow with confusion as she rose again she could not muster resolution to raise her eyes towards the sloop but by a kind of instinctive coquetry dragged her companion to the other side of the boat as soon as she was able to recover her composure julia revolved in her mind the scene which had just occurred she had seen antonioevery thing about him equalled her expectationseven at the distance she had easily discerned the noble dignity of his mannershis eye gave assurance of his conscious worthhis very attitude was that of a gentleman not to know him for a man of birth of education and of fortune julia felt to her would be impossible and she trembled lest others as discerning as herself should discover his disguise and she in consequence be covered with confusion she earnestly hoped his incog would ever remain unknown for her delicacy shrunk at the publicity and notoriety which would then attend his attachment it was certainly delightful to be loved and so lovedto be attended and so attended but the heart of julia was too unpractised to relish the laugh and observations of a malignant world no my antonio she breathed internally hover around me shield me from impending dangers delight me with your presence and enchant me with your eye but claim me in the guise of a gentleman and a hero that no envious tongue may probe the secrets of our love nor any profane scoffer ridicule those sensitive pleasures that he is too unsentimental to enjoy with these and similar thoughts did julia occupy herself until charles pointed out to her the majestic entrance to the highlands our heroine who was truly alive to all the charms of nature gazed with rapture as the boat plunged between the mountains on either hand and turned a wistful gaze down the river in the vain hope that antonio might at the same moment be enjoying the scenebut the sluggish sloop was now far behind and the eye of antonio bright as it was could not pierce the distance julia felt rather relieved than otherwise when the vessel which contained her hero was hid from view by a mountain that they doubled her feelings were much like those of a girl who had long anxiously waited the declaration of a favourite youth had received it and acknowledged her own partiality she felt all the assurance of her conquest and would gladly for a time avoid the shame of her own acknowledgment the passage up the hudson furnishes in itself so much to charm the eye of a novice that none but one under the extraordinary circumstances of our heroine could have beheld the beauties of the river unmoved if julia did not experience quite as much rapture in the journey as she had anticipated she attributed it to the remarkably delicate situation she was in with her lover and possibly to a dread of his being detected an officer of his rank and reputation must be well known thought she and he may meet with acquaintances every where however by the attention of charles she passed the day with a very tolerable proportion of pleasure their arrival at albany was undistinguished by any remarkable event though julia looked in vain through the darkness of the night in quest of the fertile meadows and desert islands which anna had mentioned in her letter even the river seemed straight and uninteresting but julia was tiredit was nightand antonio was absent  the following morning miss emmerson and her niece attended by charles took a walk to examine the beauties of albany it did not strike our heroine as being so picturesque as it had her friend still it had novelty and that lent it many charms it might have wanted on a more intimate acquaintance their forenoon however exhausted the beauties of this charming town and they had returned to the inn and the ladies were sitting in rather a listless state when charles entered the room with a look of pleasure and cried he is here  who exclaimed julia starting and trembling like an aspen  hetony said charles in reply  julia was unable to say any more but her aunt without noticing her agitation asked mildly  and who is tony  why anthony the driverhe is here and wishes to see you  show him up charles and let us learn when he will be ready to go on  this was an awful moment to juliashe was on the eve of being confronted in a room for the first time with the man on whom she felt that her happiness or misery must depend although she knew the vast importance to her of good looks at such a moment she looked unusually illshe was pale from apprehension and awkward and ungraceful from her agitation she would have given the world to have got out of the room but this was impossiblethere was but one door and through that he must come she had just concluded that it was better to remain in her chair than incur the risk of fainting in the passage when he entered preceded by charles his upper and part of his lower lip were clean shaved a small part of one cheek and his nose were to be seen all the rest of his face was covered with hair or hid under the patch an enormous coloured handkerchief was tied in a particular manner round his neck and his coat made of plain materials and somewhat tarnished with service was buttoned as close to his throat as the handkerchief would allow in short his whole attire was that of a common driver of a hack carriage and no one who had not previously received an intimation that his character was different from his appearance would at all have suspected the deception  your name is anthony said miss emmerson as he bowed to her with due deference  yes maam anthonytony sandford was the replyit was uttered in a vulgar nasal tone that julia instantly perceived was counterfeited but miss emmerson with perfect innocency proceeded in her inquiries  are your horses gentle and good tony adopting the familiar nomenclature that seemed most to his fancy  as gentle as eer a lady in the land said tony turning his large black eye round the room and letting it dwell a moment on the beautiful face of juliaher heart throbbed with tumultuous emotion at the first sound of his voice and she was highly amused at the ingenuity he had displayed in paying a characteristic compliment to her gentleness in this clandestine mannerif he preserves his incognito so ingeniously he will never be detected thought julia and all will be well  and the carriage continued miss emmerson is it fit to carry us  i cant say how fit it may be to carry sich ladies as you be but it is as good a carriage as runs out of york  here was another delicate compliment thought julia and so artfully concealed under brutal indifference that it nearly deceived even herself  when will you be ready to start asked miss emmerson  this moment was the prompt replywe can easily reach schenectady by sundown  here julia saw the decision and promptitude of a soldier used to marches and movements besides an eager desire to remove her from the bustle of a large town and thoroughfare to a retirement where she would be more particularly under his protection miss emmerson on the other hand saw nothing but the anxiety of a careful hireling willing to promote the interest of his master who was to be paid for his conveyance by the jobso differently do sixty and sixteen judge the same actions at all events the offer was accepted and the man ordered to secure the baggage and prepare for their immediate departure  why dont you help antonio on with the baggage charles said julia as she stood looking at the driver tottering under the weight of the trunks charles stared a moment with surprisethe name created no astonishment but the request did julia had a habit of softening names that were rather harsh in themselves to which he was accustomed peter she called pierre robert was rubert and her aunts black footman timothy she had designated as timotheus but it was not usual for ladies to request gentlemen to perform menial officesuntil recollecting that julia had expressed unusual solicitude concerning a dressingbox that contained annas letters he at once supposed it was to that she wished him to attend charles left the room and superintended the whole arrangements when once enlisted julia now felt that every doubt of the identity of her lover with this coachman was removed he had ingeniously adopted the name of anthony as resembling in sound the one she herself had given him in her letters this he undoubtedly had learnt from annaand then sandford was very much like stanleyhis patch his dress his airevery thing about him united to confirm her impressions and julia at the same time she resolved to conduct herself towards him in their journey with a proper feminine reserve thought she could do no less to a man who submitted to so much to serve her than to suffer him to perceive that she was not entirely insensible to the obligation  our heroine could not but admire the knowing manner with which antonio took his seat on the carriage and the dexterity he discovered in the management of his horsesthis was infallible evidence of his acquaintance with the animal and a sure sign that he was the master of many and had long been accustomed to their service perhaps thought julia he has been an officer of cavalry  in the constant excitement produced by her situation julia could not enter into all the feelings described by her friend during the ride to schenectady its beauties might be melancholy but could she be melancholy and antonio so near the pines might be silvery and lofty but the proud stature of majestic man eclipsed in her eyes all their beauties not so charles he early began to lavish his abuse on the sterile grounds they passed and gave any thing but encomiums on the smoothness of the road they were travelling in the latter particular even the quiet spirit of miss emmerson joined him and julia herself was occasionally made sensible that she was not reposing on a bed of roses  do i drive too fast for the ladies asked antonio on hearing a slight complaint and a faint scream in the soft voice of julia oh how considerate he is thought our heroinehow tenderwithout his care i certainly should have been killed in this rude place it was expected that as she had complained she would answer and after a moment employed in rallying her senses for the undertaking she replied in a voice of breathing melody  oh no antonio you are very considerate  for a world julia could not have said more and miss emmerson thought that she had said quite as much as the occasion required but miss emmerson it will be remembered supposed their driver to be anthony sandford the hero himself on hearing such a gentle voice so softly replying to his question could not refrain from turning his face into the carriage and julia felt her own eyes lower before his earnest gaze while her cheeks burned with the blushes that suffused them but the look spoke volumeshe understands my antonio thought julia and perceives that to me he is no longer unknown that expressive glance has opened between us a communication that will cease but with our lives julia now enjoyed for the remainder of their journey to mr millers one of the greatest pleasures of loveunsuspected by others she could hold communion with him who had her heart by the eyes and a thousand tender and nameless little offices which give interest to affection and zest to passion  they had now got half way between the two cities and charles took a seat by the side of the driver with the intention as he expressed himself of stretching his legs the carriage was open and light so that all of the figures of the two young men could be seen by the ladies as well as their conversation heard charles never appeared to less advantage in his person thought julia than now seated by the side of the manly and noble antonio the figure of charles was light and by no means without grace yet it did not strike the fancy of our heroine as so fit to shield and support her through life as the more robust person of his companion julia herself was in form the counterpart of her mindshe was light airy and beautifully softened in all her outlines it was impossible to mistake her for any thing but a lady and one of the gentlest passions and sentiments she felt her own weakness and would repose it on the manly strength of antonio  which do you call the best of your horses asked charles so soon as he had got himself comfortably seated  the offbut both are true as steel was the laconic reply the comparison was new to julia and it evidently denoted a mind accustomed to the contemplation of arms  how long have you followed the business of a driver tony said charles in the careless manner of a gentleman when he wishes to introduce familiarity with an inferior by seeming to take an interest in the others affairs julia felt indignant at the freedom of his manner and particularly at the epithet of tonyyet her lover did not in the least regard eitheror rather his manner exhibited no symptoms of displeasurehe has made up his mind thought julia to support his disguise and it is best for us both that he should  ever since i was sixteen i have been used to horses was the reply of antonio to the question of charlesjulia smiled at the ambiguity of the answer and was confirmed in her impression that he had left college at that age to serve in the cavalry  you must understand them well by this time continued charles glancing his eye at his companion as if to judge of his yearsyou must be fortyjulia fidgeted a little at this guess of charles but soon satisfied herself with the reflection that his disguise contributed to the error  my age is very deceiving said the man i have seen great hardships in my time both of body and mind  here julia could scarcely breathe through anxiety every syllable that he uttered was devoured with eager curiosity by the enamoured girlhe knew that she was a listener and that she understood his disguise and doubtless meant in that indirect manner to acquaint her with the incidents of his life it was clear that he indicated his age to be less than what his appearance would have led her to believehis sufferings his cruel sufferings had changed him  the life of a coachman is not hard said charles  no sir far from itbut i have not been a coachman all my life  nothing could be plainer than thisit was a direct assertion of his degradation by the business in which he was then engaged  in what manner did you lose your eye tony said charles in a tone of sympathy that julia blessed him for in her heart although she knew that the member was uninjured and only hidden to favour his disguise antonio hesitated a little in his answer and stammered while giving itit was in the wars at length he got out and julia admired the noble magnanimity which would not allow him even in imagination to suffer in a less glorious mannernotwithstanding his eye is safe and as beautiful as the other he has suffered in the wars thought our heroine and it is pardonable for him to use the deception situated as he isit is nothing more than an equivoque but this was touching charles on a favourite chord little of a hero as julia fancied him to be he delighted in conversing about the war with those men who having acted in subordinate stations would give a different view of the subject from the official accounts in which he was deeply read it was no wonder therefore that he eagerly seized on the present opportunity to relieve the tedium of a ride between albany and schenectady  in what battle asked charles quickly by sea or by land  by sea said antonio speaking to his horses with an evident unwillingness to say any more on the subject  ah the deception and the idea of his friend lawrence are too much for his sensibility thought julia and to relieve him she addressed charles herself  how far are we from schenectady cousin charles  antonio certainly was not her cousin charles but as if he thought the answering such questions to be his peculiar province he replied immediately  four miles maam theres the stone  there was nothing in the answer itself or the manner of its delivery to attract notice in an unsuspecting listener but by julia it was well understoodit was the first time he had ever spoken directly to herselfit was a new era in their livesand his body turned half round toward her as he spoke showed his manly form to great advantage but the impressive and dignified manner in which he dropped his whip towards the milestone julia felt that she never could forgetit was intended to mark the spot where he had first addressed her he had chosen it with taste the stone stood under the shade of a solitary oak and might easily be fancied to be a monument erected to commemorate some important event in the lives of our lovers julia ran over in her mind the time when she should pay an annual visit to that hallowed place and leaning on the arm of her majestic husband murmur in his ear here on this loved spot did antonio first address his happy thrice happy julia  well tony said the mild voice of miss emmerson the sun is near setting let us go the four miles as fast as you please  im sure maam said antonio with profound respect you dont want to get in more than i do for i had no sleep all last night ill not keep you out one minute after nightso saying he urged his horses to a fast trot and was quite as good as his word how delicate in his attentions and yet how artfully has he concealed his anxiety on my account under a feigned desire for sleep thought julia  if any thing had been wanting either to convince julia of the truth of her conjecture or to secure the conquest of antonio our heroine felt that this short ride had abundantly supplied it     chapter vi   the following day our travellers were on the road before the sun and busily pursued their route through the delightful valley of the mohawk it was now that julia in some measure accustomed to her proximity to her hero began to enjoy the beauties of the scenery her eye dwelt with rapture on each opening glimpse that they caught of the river and took in its gaze meadows of neverfailing verdure which were beautifully interspersed with elms that seemed coeval with the country itself occasionally she would draw the attention of her aunt to some view of particular interest and if her eager voice caught the attention of antonio and he turned to gaze to ponder and to admirethen julia felt happy indeed for then it was that she felt the indescribable bliss of sharing our pleasures with those we love what heart of sensibility has stood and coldly gazed on a scene over which the eye that it loves to admire is roving with delight who is there that has yet to learn that if the strongest bond to love is propinquity so is its tenderest tie sympathy in this manner did our lovely heroine pass a day of hitherto untasted bliss antonio would frequently stop his horses on the summit of a hill and julia understood the motive turning her looks in the direction in which she saw the eye of her lover bent she would sit in silent and secret communion with his feelings in vain charles endeavoured to catch her attentionhis remarks were unnoticed and his simple efforts to please disregarded at length as they advanced towards the close of their days ride charles observing a mountain obtruding itself directly across their path and meeting the river which swept with great velocity around its base cried aloud with a laugh  anthony i wish you would remove your nose  charles exclaimed julia shocked at his rude familiarity with a man of antonios elevated character  poh said the young man in an under tone conceiving her surprise to be occasioned by his lowering himself to joke with an inferior he is a good honest fellow and dont mind a joke at all i assure you  charles was right for antonio moving his face with a laugh cried in his turnthere sir my nose is moved but you cant see no better after all  julia was amused with his condescension which she thought augured perfect goodnature and affability after all thought julia if noble and commanding qualities are necessary to excite admiration or to command respect familiar virtues induce us to love more tenderly and good temper is absolutely necessary to contribute to our comfort on the whole she was rather pleased than otherwise that antonio could receive and return what was evidently intended for a witticism although as yet she did not comprehend it but charles did not leave her long in doubt on the north side of the mohawk and at about fifty miles from its mouth is a mountain which as we have already said juts in a nearly perpendicular promontory into the bed of the river its inclination is sufficient to admit of its receiving the name of a nose without the least intention of alluding to our hero the early settlers had affixed the name of st anthony who appears to have been a kind of dutch deity in this state and to have monopolized all the natural noses within her boundaries to himself the vulgar idiom made the pronunciation antonys noseand all this charles briefly explained to miss emmerson and her niece by way of giving point to his own wit he had hardly made them comprehend the full brilliancy and beauty of his application of the mountain to their driver when they reached the pass itself the road was barely sufficient to suffer two carriages to move by each other without touching being from necessity dug out of the base of the mountain a precipice of many feet led to the river which was high and turbulent at the time there was no railing nor any protection on the side next the waterand in endeavouring to avoid the unprotected side of the road two wagons had met a short time before and one of them lost a wheel in the encounterits owner had gone to a distance for assistance leaving the vehicle where it had fallen the horses of antonio unaccustomed to such a sight were with some difficulty driven by the loaded wagon and when nearly past the object took a sudden fright at its top which was flapping in the wind all the skill and exertions of antonio to prevent their backing was useless and carriage and horses would inevitably have gone off the bank together had not charles with admirable presence of mind opened a door and springing out placed a billet of wood which had been used as a base for a lever in lifting the broken wagon under one of the wheels this checked the horses until antonio had time to rally them and by using the whip with energy bring them into the road again he certainly showed great dexterity as a coachman but unhappily the movement of charles had been misunderstood by julia and throwing open the door with the blindness of fear she sprang from the carriage also it was on the side next the water and her first leap was over the bank the hill was not perpendicular but too steep for julia to recover her balanceand partly running and partly falling the unfortunate girl was plunged into the rapid river charles heard the screams of miss emmerson and caught a glimpse of the dress of julia as she sprang from the carriage he ran to the bank just in time to see her fall into the water  oh god he cried juliamy juliaand without seeming to touch the earth he flew down the bank and threw himself headlong into the stream his great exertions and nervous arms soon brought him alongside of julia and happily for them both an eddy in the waters drew them to the land with some difficulty charles was enabled to reach the shore with his burthen  julia was not insensible nor in the least injured her aunt was soon by her side and folding her in her arms poured out her feelings in a torrent of tears charles would not however suffer any delay or expressions of gratitudebut forcing both aunt and niece into the carriage bid anthony drive rapidly to a tavern known to be at no great distanceon their arrival both julia and charles immediately clad themselves in dry clotheswhen miss emmerson commanded the presence of the young man in her own room on entering charles found julia sitting by a fire a thousand times handsomer if possible than ever her eyes were beaming with gratitude and her countenance was glowing with the excitement produced by the danger that she had encountered  ah charles my dear cousin cried julia rising and meeting him with both hands extended i owe my life to your bravery and presence of mind  and mine too charles said miss emmerson but for you we should have all gone off the hill together  yes if anthony had not managed the horses admirably you might have gone indeed said charles with a modest wish to get rid of their praise but this was an unlucky speech for charles he had unconsciously presented the image of a rival at the moment that he hoped he filled all the thoughts of julia  ah antonio she cried poor antonioand where is hewhy do you not send for him dear aunt  what my love into my bedchamber said miss emmerson in surprise fear has made the girl crazybut charles where is anthony  in the stable with the horses i believe said the youthno here he is under the window leading them to the pump  give him this money said miss emmerson and tell him it is for his admirable skill in saving my life  julia saw the danger of an exposure if she interfered yet she had the curiosity to go to the window and see how antonio would conduct in the mortifying dilemma  here anthony said charles miss emmerson has sent you ten dollars for driving so well and saving the carriage  ah sir it is no matteri can ask nothing for that im sure  but charles accustomed to the backwardness of the common americans to receive more than the price stipulated still extended his hand towards the man julia saw his embarrassment and knowing of no other expedient by which to relieve him said in a voice of persuasion  take it for my sake antonioif it be unworthy of you still take it to oblige me  the man no longer hesitated but took the money and gave julia a look and a bow that sunk deep into the tablet of her memorywhile charles thought him extremely well paid for what he had done but made due allowances for the excited state of his cousins feelings  you perceive said miss emmerson with a smile as julia withdrew from the window if charles be a little afraid of lightning he has no dread of the water  ah i retract my error cried julia charles must be brave or he never could have acted so coolly and so well  very true my love said miss emmerson excessively gratified to hear her niece praise the youth it is the surest test of courage when men behave with presence of mind in novel situations those accustomed to particular dangers easily discharge their duties because they know as it were instinctively what is to be done thus with tonyhe did well but i doubt not he was horribly frightenedand for the world he could not have done what charles did  not antonio echoed julia thrown a little off her guardi would pledge my life aunt that antonio would have done as much if not more than charles  why did he not thenit was his place to stop the carriagewhy did he not  it was his place said julia to manage the horses and you acknowledge that he did it well duties incurred no matter how unworthy of us must be discharged and although we may be conscious that our merit or our birth entitles us to a different station from the one we fill yet a noble mind will not cease to perform its duty even in poverty and disgrace  miss emmerson listened in surprise but as her niece often talked in a manner that she did not comprehend she attributed it to the improvements in education and was satisfied but julia had furnished herself with a clue to what had occasioned her some uneasiness at one time she thought antonio ought to have left carriage horses every thing and flown to her rescue as charles had done but now she saw that the probity of his soul forbade it he had doubtless by secret means induced the owner of the horses to entrust them to his keepingand could he a soldier one used to trust and responsibility forget his duty in the moment of need sooner would the sentinel quit his post unrelievedsooner the gallant soldier turn his back on his enemyor sooner would antonio forget his julia  with this view of the propriety of his conduct julia was filled with the desire to let him know that she approved of what he had done surely if any thing can be mortifying to a lover thought our heroine it must be to see a rival save the life of his mistress while imperious duty chains him to another task  young as julia was she had already learnt that it is not enough for our happiness that we have the consciousness of doing right but it is necessary that others should think we have done so too  accordingly early the following morning she arose and wandered around the house in hopes that chance would throw her lover in her way and give her an opportunity of relieving his mind from the load of mortification under which she knew he must be labouring it was seldom that our heroine had been in the public barroom of a tavernbut in gliding by the door she caught a glimpse of antonio in the bar and impelled by her feelings she was near him before she had time to collect her scattered senses to be with antonio and alone julia felt was dangerous for his passion might bring on a declaration and betray them both to the public and vulgar noticeanxious therefore to effect her object at once she gently laid her hand on his armantonio started and turned while the glass in his hands fell with its contents untasted on the floor  rest easy antonio said julia in the gentlest possible tones to me your conduct is satisfactory and your secret will never be exposed so saying she turned quickly and glided from the room  as i hope to be saved said antonio i meant nothing wrongbut should have paid the landlord the moment he came inbut julia heard him not her errand was happily executed and she was already by the side of her aunt on entering the carriage julia noticed the eye of antonio fixed on her with peculiar meaning and she felt that her conduct had been appreciatedfrom this time until the day of their arrival at the house of mr miller nothing material occurred antonio rose every hour in the estimation of julia and the young lady noticed a marked difference in her lovers conduct towards her a few miles before they reached the dwelling miss emmerson observed  tomorrow will be the twentieth of september when i am to know who will be my companion for the winter miss miller or katherine  ah aunt you may know that now if i am to decide said julia it will be anna my anna surely  her manner was enthusiastic and her voice a little louder than usual antonio turned his head and their eyes met julia read in that glance the approbation of her generous friendship miss emmerson was a good deal hurt at this decision of her niece who she thought knowing her sentiments would be induced to have been satisfied with the visit to anna and taken katherine for the winter it was with reluctance that the aunt abandoned this wish and after a pause she continued  remember julia that you have not my permission to ask your friend until the twentiethwe can stay but one night at mr millers but if anna is to spend the winter in park place we will return this way from the falls and take her with us to the city  thank you dear aunt cried julia kissing her with an affection that almost reconciled miss emmerson to the choicewhile charles weston whistled hail columbia happy land  julia saw that antonio pitied her impatiencefor the moment he arrived in sight of mr millers house he put his horses to their speed and dashed into the courtyard in the space of a few minutes for a little while all was confusion and joy anna seemed delighted to see her friend and julia was in rapturesthey flew into each others armsand if their parting embrace was embalmed in tears their meeting was enlivened with smiles with arms interlocked they went about the house the very pictures of joyeven antonio at the moment was forgotten and all devoted to friendship nay as if sensible of the impropriety of his appearance at that critical instant he withdrew himself from observationand his delicacy was not lost on julia happy are they who can act in consonance with their own delicate sentiments and rest satisfied with the knowledge that their motives are understood by those whom it is their greatest desire to pleasesuch too fortunate antonio was thy lotfor no emotion of thy sensitive mind no act of thy scrupulously honourable life passed unheeded by thy juliaso thought the maiden  it has been already mentioned that the family of mr miller was large and amid the tumult and confusion of receiving their guests no opportunity was afforded to the friends for conversation in private the evening passed swiftly and the hour for bed arrived without any other communications between julia and anna than whisperings and pressures of the hands together with a thousand glances of peculiar meaning with the eyes but julia did not regret this so much as if antonio had been unknownshe had been in his company for four days and knew or thought she knew already as much of his history as anna herselfbut one thought distressed her and that was that his residence might be far from the house of her aunt this reflection gave the tenderhearted girl real pain and her principal wish to converse with anna in private was to ascertain her future lot on this distressing point no opportunity however offered that night and julia saw that in the morning her time would be limited for miss emmerson desired mr miller to order her carriage to be in readiness to start so soon as they had breakfasted  when dear aunt am i to give anna the invitation said julia when they were left alone if you start so early in the morning  the proper time will be my child immediately before we get into the carriage said miss emmerson with a sigh of regret at the determination of her niece it will then be more pointed and call for an immediate answer  this satisfied julia who knew that it would be accepted by her friend and she soon fell asleep to dream a little of anna and a great deal of antonio  the following morning julia arose with the sun and her first employment was to seek her friend anna had also risen and was waiting impatiently for the others appearance in the vacant parlour  ah dear julia said she catching her arm and dragging her to a window i thought you would never comewell are we to spend the winter togetherhave you spoken to your dear dear aunt about it  you shall know in good time my anna said julia mindful of the wishes of her aunt and speaking with a smile that gave anna an assurance of her success  oh what a delightful winter we will have cried anna in rapture  i am tonguetied at present said julia laughing but not on every subject she continued blushing to the eyes do tell me of st albansof reguluswho is he  who is he echoed annawhy nobodyone must have something to write about you know to a friend  julia felt sick and fainther colour left her cheeks as she forced a smile and uttered in a low voicebut antoniostanley  a man of straw cried anna with unfeeling levity no such creature in the world i do assure you  julia made a mighty effort to conquer her emotions and wildly seizing anna by the arm she pointed to her aunts coachman who was at work on his carriage at no great distance and uttered  for gods sake who is he  he cried anna in surprise why your driverand an ugly wretch he isdont you know your own driver yet  julia burst from her treacherous friendrushed into the room of her auntand throwing herself into the arms of miss emmerson wept for an hour as if her heart would break miss emmerson saw that something had hurt her feelings excessively and that it was something she would not reveal believing that it was a quarrel with her friend and hoping at all events that it would interrupt their intercourse miss emmerson instead of trying to discover her nieces secret employed herself in persuading her to appear before the family with composure and to take leave of them with decency and respect in this she succeeded and the happy moment arrived anna in vain pressed near her friend to receive the invitationand her mother more than once hinted at the thousand pities it was to separate two that loved one another so fondly no invitation was givenand although anna spent half a day in searching for a letter that she insisted must be left in some romantic place none was ever found nor did any ever arrive  while resting with her foot on the step of the carriage about to enter it julia whose looks were depressed from shame saw a fluid that was discoloured with tobacco fall on her shoe and soil her stocking raising her eyes with disgust she perceived that the wind had wafted it from the mouth of antonio as he held open the doorand the same blast throwing aside his screen of silk discovered a face that was deformed with disease and wanting of an eye  our travellers returned to the city by the way of montreal and lake champlain nor was it until julia had been the happy wife of charles weston for more than a year that she could summon resolution to own that she had once been in love like thousands of her sex with a man of straw     heart      some live in airy fantasies     and in the clouds do move     and some do burn with inward flames     but few know how to love      anon ballad     chapter i   on one of those clear cold days of december which so frequently occur in our climate two very young women were walking on the fashionable promenade of newyork in the person of the elder of these females there was exhibited nothing more than the usual indications of youth and health but there were a delicacy and an expression of exquisite feeling in the countenance of her companion that caused many a plodding or idle passenger to turn and renew the gaze which had been attracted by so lovely a person her figure was light and possessed rather a character of aerial grace than the usual rounded lines of earthly beauty and her face was beaming more with the sentiments of the soul within than with the ordinary charms of complexion and features it was precisely that kind of youthful loveliness that a childless husband would pause to contemplate as the reality of the visions which his thoughts had often portrayed and which his nature coveted as the only treasure wanting to complete the sum of his earthly bliss it truly looked a being to be loved without the usual alloy of our passions and there was a modest ingenuousness which shone in her air that gently impelled the hearts of others to regard its possessor with a species of holy affection amongst the gay throng however that thoughtlessly glided along the broadway even this image of female perfection was suffered to move unnoticed by hundreds and it was owing to the obstruction offered to the passage of the ladies by a small crowd that had gathered on the sidewalk that a gentleman of uncommon personal endowments enjoyed an opportunity of examining it with more than ordinary attention the eldest of the females drew her companion away from this impediment to their passage by moving towards the opposite side of the street and observing as they crossed with an indifference in her manner  it is nothing charlotte but a drunken man if people will drink they must abide the consequences  he does not seem intoxicated maria replied the other in a voice whose tones corresponded with her appearance it is some sudden illness  one that i dare say he is accustomed to said maria without having even taken such a look at the sufferer as would enable her to identify his colour he will be well enough after he has slept  but is the pavement a place for him to sleep on rejoined her companion still gazing towards the miserable object and if he should be illwhy do they not raise himwhy do they suffer him to injure himself as he does  the speaker at the same time that she shrunk in a kind of sensitive horror from this exhibition of human infirmities now unconsciously stopped with an interest in the man that she could not control and thus compelled maria to pause also the crowd had withdrawn from the man giving him sufficient room to roll over in evident pain while they yet stood gazing at him with that indefinable feeling of curiosity and nerveless sympathy which characterises man when not called on to act by emulation vanity or the practice of welldoing no one offered to assist the sufferer although many said it ought to be done some spoke of sending for those who monopolized the official charity of the city many having satisfied their curiosity and finding that the moment for action was arriving quietly withdrew from a trouble that would interfere with their comforts or their businesswhile a few felt an impulse to aid the man but hesitated in being foremost in doing that which would be honourable to their feelings but might not accord with their condition or might seem as the ostentatious display of unusual benevolence where men are congregated conduct must be regulated by the touchstone of public opinion and although it is the fashion of newyork to applaud acts of charity and to do them too in a particular mannerit is by no means usual to run to the assistance of a fellow creature who is lying in distress on a pavement  whatever might be the impulses of the gentleman whom we have mentioned his attention was too much absorbed by the conversation and manner of the two ladies to regard any thing else and he followed them across the street and stopped also when they paused to view the scene he was inwardly and deeply admiring the most youthful of the females for the natural and simple display of those very qualities that he forgot himself to exercise when he was roused with a feeling of something like mortification by hearing charlotte exclaim with a slight glow on her cheek  ah there is george morton cominghe surely will not pass the poor man without offering to assist him  the gentleman turned his head quickly and noticed a youth making his way through the crowd successfully to the side of the sufferer the distance was too great to hear what passedbut an empty coach whose driver had stopped to gaze with the rest was instantly drawn up and the man lifted in and followed by the youth whose appearance had effected these movements with the silence and almost with the quickness of magic  george morton was far from possessing the elegant exterior of the uneasy observer of this scene yet were the eyes of the lovely young woman who had caught his attention fixed in evident delight on his person until it was hid from view in the carriage when drawing a long breath as if relieved from great uneasiness she said in a low voice  i knew that george morton would not pass him so unfeelinglybut where are they goingnot far i hope on this cold dayand george without his great coat  there was a plaintive and natural melody in the tones of the speakers voice as she thus unconsciously uttered her concern that impelled the listener to advance to the side of the carriage where a short conversation passed between the gentlemen and the stranger returned to the ladies who were yet lingering near the spot apparently unwilling to depart from a scene that had so deeply interested one of them raising his hat the gentleman addressing himself to the magnet that had attracted him said  your friend declines the offer of my coat and says that the carriage is quite warmthey are going to the almshouse and i am happy to inform you that the poor man is already much better and is recovering from his fit  charlotte now for the first time observed the speaker and a blush passed over her face as she courtesied her thanks in silence but her companion aroused from gazing at the finery of a shop window by the voice of the stranger turned quickly and with very manifest satisfaction exclaimed  bless me mr delafieldi did not observe you beforethen you think the poor wretch will not die  ah assuredly not returned the gentleman recognising the face of an acquaintance with an animation he could not conceal but how inadvertent i have been not to have noticed miss osgood beforewhile speaking his eyes rested on the lovely countenance of her friend as if by their direction he meant to explain the reason of his remissness  we were both too much engaged with the sufferings of the poor man for until this moment i did not observe you said the ladywith that kind of instinctive quickness that teaches the fair the importance of an amiable exterior in the eyes of the other sex  doubtless returned the gentleman gravely and for the first time withdrawing his gaze from the countenance of charlotte but the precaution was unnecessarythe young lady had been too much engrossed with her own sensations to notice the conduct of others and from the moment that the carriage had driven out of sight had kept her eyes on the ground as she walked silently and unobtrusively by the side of her companion  miss henlymr seymour delafield said maria the silent bow and courtesy that followed this introduction was succeeded by an animated discourse between the gentleman and his old acquaintance which was but seldom interrupted by any remark from their more retiring companion whenever she did speak however the gentleman listened with the most flattering attention that was the more remarkable from the circumstance of his talking frequently at the same time with maria osgood the trio took a long walk together and returned to the house of mr henly in time for the necessary arrangements for the coming dinner it was when within a short distance of the dwelling of charlotte that the gentleman ventured to allude to the event that had made them acquainted  the fearless manner in which you predicted the humanity of mr morton would be highly gratifying to himself miss henly he observed and were i of his acquaintance it should be my task to inform him of your good opinion  i believe mr morton has not now to learn that said charlotte simply but dropping her eyes i have been the next door neighbour of george all my life and have seen too much of his goodness of heart not to have expressed the same opinion often  but not to himself cried maria so mr delafield if you wish to apprise him of his good fortune you have only to attend my music party tomorrow evening and i will take particular care that you get acquainted with the humane hero  the invitation was gladly accepted and the gentleman took his leave at the door of the house  well charlotte you have seen him at last cried maria the instant the door had closed and i am dying to know how you like him  to save your life said the other laughing i will say a great deal although you so often accuse me of taciturnitybut who is him  him why delafieldseymour delafieldthe pattern for all the beauxthe magnet for all the bellesand the delight of all the parents in town  his own too inquired charlotte a little archly  he has nonethey are dead and gonebut their money is left behind and that brings him fathers and mothers by the dozen  it is fortunate that he can supply their loss in any way said charlotte with emphasis  to be sure he can he can do more than you or i could my dear he can pick his parents from the best in the cityand therefore he ought to be well provided  and could he be better provided as you call it in that respect than ourselves asked miss henly a little reproachfully  oh no surely not now if he were a woman how soon would he be marriedwhy child they say he is worth at least three hundred thousand dollarshed be a bride in a month  and miserable perhaps in a year said charlotte it is fortunate for him that he is a man by your tale or his wealth might purchase misery for him  oh no one can be miserable that is well married cried maria heigho the idea of oldmaidism is too shocking to think about  why does not mr delafield get married then if marriage be so very desirable said miss henly smiling at the customary rattle of her companion he can easily get a wife you say  it is the difficulty of choosingthere are so many attentive to him  maria  mercy i beg pardon of female delicacybut since the young man has returned from his travels he has been so muchmuch courtednay by the old people i meanand the girls beckon him about soand its mr delafield have you read salmagundiand mr delafield have you seen cookeand mr delafield do you think we shall have warand have you seen bonaparte and in short mr delafield with his handsome person and three hundred thousand dollars has been so much of allinall to the ladies that the man has never time to choose a wife  i really wonder that you never took the office upon yourself said charlotte busied in throwing aside her coat and gloves you appear to have so much interest in the gentleman  oh i did a month sincethe moment that he landed  indeed and who was it  myself  and have you told him of your choice asked the other laughing  not with my tongue but with my eyes a thousand timesand with all that unspeakable language that female invention can supplyi go where he goesif i see him in the street behind me i move slowly and with dignity still he passes meif before me i am in a hurrybut  you pass him interrupted charlotte amused with her companions humour  exactlywe never keep an equal pace this is the first time that he has walked with me since he returned from abroadand for this honour i am clearly indebted to yourself  to me maria said charlotte in surprise  to none otherhe talked to me but he looked at you ah he knows by instinct that you are an only childand i do believe that the wretch knows that i have twelve brothers and sistersbut you had better take him charlotte he is worth twenty george mortonsat least in money  what have the merits of george morton and mr delafield to do with each other said charlotte removing her hat and exhibiting a head of hair that opportunely fell in rich profusion over her shoulders so as to conceal the unusual flush on her ordinarily pale cheek  this concluded the conversation for charlotte instantly left the room and was occupied for some time in giving such orders as her office of assistant in housekeeping to her mother rendered necessary  charlotte henly was the only child that had been left from six who were born to her parents the others having died in their infancy the deaths of the rest of their children had occasioned the affection of her parents to center in the last of their offspring with more than common warmth and the tenderness of their love was heightened by the extraordinary qualities of their child possessed of an abundance of the goods of this world these doating parents were looking around with intense anxiety among their acquaintance and watching for the choice that was to determine the worldly happiness of their daughter  charlotte was but seventeen yet the customs of the country and the temptations of her expected wealth together with her own attractions had already placed her within the notice of the world but no symptom of that incipient affection which was to govern her life could either of her parents ever discover and in the exhibitions of her attachments there was nothing to be seen but that quiet and regulated esteem which grows out of association and good sense and which is so obviously different from the restless and varying emotions that are said to belong to the passion of love  maria osgood was a distant relative and an early associate who although as different from her cousin in appearance and character as black is from white was still dear to the latter both from habit and her unconquerable good nature  george morton the youth of whom such honourable mention has been made was the son of a gentleman who had long resided in the next dwelling to mr henly in the city and who also possessed a country house near his own villa these circumstances had induced an intimacy between the families that was cemented by the good opinion each entertained of the qualities of the other and which had been so long and so often tried in scenes of happiness and misery that were known to both young morton was a few years the senior of charlotte and at the time of commencing our tale was but lately released from his collegiate labours his goodness of heart and simplicity of manners made him an universal favourite while the peculiarity of their situation brought him oftener before the notice of charlotte than any other young man of her acquaintancebut notwithstanding the intimation of maria osgood none of their friends in the least suspected any other feeling to exist between the youthful pair than the natural and very obvious one of disinterested esteem as the family seated themselves at the dinner table their guest exclaimed in the heedless way that characterised her manner  oh mrs henly i have to congratulate you on the prospects of your soon having a son and one as amiable and attractive as your daughter  indeed returned the matron comprehending the others meaning intuitively and what may be the young gentlemans name  you will be the envy of all the mothers in town continued maria and deservedly so two such children to fall to the lot of one mothernay do not shake your head charlotte it must and shall be a match i am determined  my friendship for you would deter me from the measure should nothing else interfere said charlotte good humouredly  ah i have already abandoned my pretensionstwelve brothers and sisters my dear are a dreadful addition to bring into a family at once  i am sure i do not think so returned charlotte timidly glancing her eye at her mother besides i feel bound in honour to remember your original intention  i tell you i have abandoned it with all thoughts of the youth  and who is the youth asked mrs henly affecting an indifference that she did not feel  you will have the handsomest son in the city certainly said maria and possibly the richestand the most learnedand undeniably the most admired  you quite excite my curiosity to know who this paragon can be said the mother looking at her husband who returned the glance with one of equal solicitude  i do not think he is more than four and twenty added maria and his black eyes would form a charming contrast to your blue ones  to whom does miss osgood allude asked mrs henly yielding to a solicitude that she could no longer controul  to mr seymour delafield said charlotte raising her mild eyes to the face of her mother and smiling as she delicately pared her apple with a simple ingenuousness that banished uneasiness from the breast of her parent in an instant  i know him said mr henly but i did not think you had ever seen him charlotte  we met him in our morning walk sir and maria introduced him  he is thought to be very handsome continued her father helping himself to a glass of wine while speaking  and very justly returned the daughter i think him the handsomest man that i have ever seen  have i your permission for telling him so cried maria with a laugh  i have not the least objection to his knowing it on my own account except from the indelicacy of complimenting a gentleman said charlotte with perfect simplicity but whether it would be beneficial to himself or not you can best judge  you think him vain then observed her mother  not in the least or rather he did not exhibit it to mewas the answer with the same open air as before  he has also a great reputation for good sense continued her father avoiding the face of his child  i thought he had wit sir  and not good sense  am i a judge asked charlotte rising and holding a lighted paper to her father while he took a new segar her clear blue eyes resting on him in the fulness of filial affection as she performed this office and the open air with which she bent forward to receive the kiss he offered in thanks removed any apprehensions which the name of their mornings companion might have excited  mr henly knew nothing concerning this young man that would induce him at all to avoid the connexion but still he had not yet examined his character with that searching vigilance that he thought due to the innocence and merit of his child determining within himself however that this was a task that should no longer be neglected he rose and telling the ladies that he left the bottle with them withdrew to his study  the door had hardly closed behind mr henly when george morton entered the dining parlour with the freedom of an old and favourite friend and telling mrs henly that in consequence of his familys dining out and his own engagements he was fasting and begged her charity for a meal from the instant that he appeared charlotte had risen with alacrity and was no sooner acquainted with his wants than she rung to order what he required she brought him a glass of sparkling wine with her own hands and pushing a chair nearer to the fire than the one he occupied she said  sit here george you appear chilledi thought you would miss your coat  i thank you returned the youth turning on her an eye of the most open affection i do feel unusually cold and begin to think that with my weak lungs it would have been more prudent to have taken a surcout  and how was the poor man when you left him  much better and in extremely good quarters said george but turning quickly to miss osgood he added so miss maria your beau has condescended to walk with you at last  yes mr impudence said maria smiling but come fill your mouth with food and be silent  he did as requested and the conversation changed     chapter ii   notwithstanding the plenteous gifts which providence had bestowed on the parents of maria in the way of descendants fortune had sufficiently smiled on his labours to enable him to educate them in what is called a genteel manner and to support them in a corresponding style the family of mr osgood exhibited one of those pictures which are so frequent in america where no other artificial distinctions exist in society than those which are created by wealth and where obscurity has no other foe to contend with than the demon of poverty his children were indulged in luxuries that his death was to dissipate and enjoyed an opulence that was only coexistent with the life of their parent accordingly the music party that assembled on the following evening at the house of mr osgood was brilliant large and fashionable seven grownup daughters was a melancholy sight for the contemplation of the parents and they both felt like venders of goods who were exhibiting their wares to the best advantage the splendid chandeliers and lustres of the drawingroom were lighted for the same reason as the lamps in the glittering retail stores of broadway and the brilliant effect of the taste of the young ladies was intended much like the nightly lustre of the lotteryoffices to tempt adventurers to try their chances from this premeditated scheme of conquest we ought in justice however to except maria herself who from constitutional gayety and thoughtlessness seldom planned for the morrow and who perhaps from her association with charlotte had acquired a degree of disinterestedness that certainly belonged to no other member of her family  whatever were the views of the family in collecting their friends and acquaintances on this important evening they were completely successful in one point at least for before nine half the dilettanti of the city were assembled in greenwichstreet in a most elaborate state of musical excitement charlotte henly of course was of the party although she was absolutely ignorant of a single note nor knew how to praise a scientific execution or to manifest disgust at simple melody but her importance in the world of fashion and her friend maria obtained her a place there was a reason that secretly influenced charlotte in electing her evenings amusement that was not known however even to her friendgeorge morton played on the german flute in a manner that vibrated on her nerves with an exquisite thrill that she often strove to conquer and yet ever loved to indulge his musical powers were far from being generally applauded as they were thought to be deficient in compass and variety but charlotte never descended to criticism in music she conceived it to be an enjoyment for the senses only or rather she thought nothing about it and if the sounds failed to delight her she unhesitatingly attributed the circumstance to an absence of melody it was to listen to the flute of george morton then that the drawingroom of mrs osgood was adorned with the speaking countenance of miss henly  among the guests who made an early appearance in this temple of apollo was the youth who had attended the ladies in their walk seymour delafield glanced his eye impatiently around the apartment as soon as he had paid the customary compliments to the mistress of the mansion and her bevy of fair daughters but a look of disappointment betrayed the search to be an unsuccessful one both the look and the result were noticed by maria and turning a glance of rather saucy meaning on the gentleman she said  i apprehend your flute which by the by i am glad to see you have brought will be rather in the penseroso style this evening mr delafield  unless enlivened by the contagious gayety of your smile returned delafield endeavouring to look excessively unconcerned but  oh my very laugh is musical i know interrupted maria but then it is often shockingly out of time  it seldom fails to produce an accompaniment said the gentleman now smiling in reality but  where is charlotte henley said the young lady again interrupting him she has a perfect horror of the tuning of fiddles and the preparatory thrummings on the piano so endeavour to preserve the harmony of your temper for the second act  well it is some relief to know she is coming at all cried seymour quickly and then recovering himself with perfect breeding he addedfor one would wish to see you as happy as all your friends can make you on such an occasion  i am extremely indebted to your unbounded philanthropy said maria rising and courtseying with great gravity do not doubt of its being honourably mentioned at  nay nay cried the youth colouring and laughing you would not think of mentioning my remarks to  at the next meeting of the dorcas society of which i am an unworthy member continued maria without listening to his remonstrance  seymour delafield now laughed without any affectationand exchanging a look of perfect consciousness of each others meaning they separated as the preparations for the business of the evening were about to commence for a short time there was a confusion of sounds that perfectly justified the absence of miss henly when the music began in earnest within half an hour mr delafield who had suffered himself to be drawn to the back of the chair of a professed belle turning his head to conceal a yawn that neither the ladys skill nor his good manners could repress observed charlotte sitting quietly by the side of her friend her entrance had been conducted with such tact that had she possessed the most musical ear imaginable it were impossible to disturb the party less a circumstance that did not fail to impress seymour agreeably from its novelty he moved to the side of the fair vision that had engrossed all his thoughts since the moment they had first met and took the chair that the good nature of miss osgood offered to his acceptance between them  thank fortune miss henly he said the instant he was seated that bravura has ceased and i can now inquire how you recovered from the fatigue of your walk  i suffered no fatigue to recover from replied the lady raising her eyes to his with an expression that told the youth he had better talk straight forward at once i walk too much to be fatigued with so short an excursion  you came here to favour us with your skill on the harp miss henly  no  on the piano  on neitheri play on nothing  you sing then  not at all  what not with that voice exclaimed the young man in surprise  not with this voice and surely with no other  seymour felt uneasy and perhaps disappointed he did not seem to have roused a single sensation in the breast of his companion and it was seldom that the elegant possessor of three hundred thousand dollars failed to do so wherever he went or whatever he did but in the present instance there was nothing to be discerned in the countenance or manner of charlotte that indicated any thing more than the sweetness of her nature and the polish of her breeding he changed the subject  i hope your friend did not suffer yesterday from his humanity  i sincerely hope so too said charlotte with much simplicity and yet with a good deal of feeling  i am fearful that we idle spectators continued the gentleman suffered in your estimation in not discovering equal benevolence with mr morton  charlotte glanced her mild eyes at the speaker but made no reply  your silence miss henly assures me of the truth of my conjecture  you should never put a disagreeable construction on the acts of another said charlotte with a sweetness that tended greatly to dissipate the mortification mr delafield really felt at the same time that he was unwilling to acknowledge it even to himself  they were now again interrupted by the music which continued some time during which george morton made his appearance his coat close buttoned to his throat and an extra silk handkerchief around his neck which he removed only after he entered the apartment immediately arrested the attention of charlotte henly turning to maria she said in those tones of real interest that never can be mistaken for manner  i am afraid that george has suffered from his exposure do not ask him to play for he will be sure to comply  oh the chicken has only taken cold cried maria if he does not play what will you do you came here to hear him only  has miss henly ears for no other performer then asked seymour delafield  miss henly has as many ears as other people said maria but she does not condescend to use them on all occasions  rather say cried charlotte laughing that the want of taste in miss henly renders her ears of but little use to her  you are not fond of music then asked the youth a little vexed at thinking that an accomplishment on which he prided himself would fail to make its usual impression  passionately exclaimed charlotte then colouring to the eyes she added at least i sometimes think so but i believe i am thought to be without taste  those who think so must want it themselves said seymour in a low voice then obedient to the beck of one of the presiding nymphs he hastened to take his share in the performance  now charlotte you little prude whispered her friend the instant he withdrew is he not very very handsome  very said charlotte more so than any other gentleman i have ever seen  and engaging and agreeable and gentlemanlike  agreeable and gentlemanlike too  and graceful and loveable  graceful certainly and very possible loveable to those who know him  know himwhat more would you know of the man you see his beauty and eleganceyou witness his breedingyou listen to his sense and informationwhat more is necessary to fall in love with him  really i pretend to no reasoning upon the subject at all said charlotte smiling but if you have such an intention indulge in it freely i beg of you for you will not find a rival in mebut listen he is about to play a solo on his flute  a man with three hundred thousand dollars may play a solo but he never can be alone where there are any to listen the hearts of many throb at the very breathings of wealth through a flute who would remain callous to the bitterest sighs of poverty but delafield possessed other attractions to catch the attention of the audience his powers on the instrument greatly exceeded those of any of his competitors and his execution was really wonderful every tongue was silent every ear was attentive and every head nodded approbation excepting that of our heroine delafield perfectly master of his instrument and the music fixed his eye on the countenance of charlotte and he experienced a thrill at his heart as he witnessed her lovely face smiling approbation while his fingers glided over the flute with a rapidity and skill that produced an astonishing variety and gradation of sounds at length thought he i have succeeded and have made an impression on this charming girl that is allied to admiration the idea gave him spirits for the task and his performance exceeded any thing the company had ever witnessed before on laying down the instrument he approached the place where the friends were sitting with an exultation in his eyes that was inferior only to modesty in the power to captivate  certainly mr delafield cried maria osgood you have outdone your own outdoings  if i have been so fortunate as to please here then i am rewarded indeed said the youth with a bow and an expression that rendered it a little doubtful to which of the ladies the compliment was addressed at this instant george morton approached them  mr delafield let me make you acquainted with mr morton said maria glancing her eye at the former in a manner that he understood  i have great pleasure in taking mr morton by the hand said seymour if he will excuse the want of ceremony in this company the lesson that you gave to me yesterday sir will not soon be forgotten  in what manner sir inquired george with a little embarrassment and a conscious blush  in teaching me among others mr morton the difference between active and passive humanitybetween that which is satisfied with feeling and that which prompts to serve  to this unexpected compliment young morton could do no more than bow in silence for it was too flattering for a replyand too true to deny as delafield turned his eye at a little loss to know whether to be pleased or not with his own humility he met a look from charlotte that more than rewarded him for the effort it was a mild benevolent pure glance that spoke admiration and heartfelt pleasure he forgot his solo and the expected compliments and for the rest of the evening that thrilling expression floated in his brain and was present to his thoughts it was worth a thousand of the studied glances that were continually aimed at him from all sides of the room and with every variety of eyefrom the piercing black to the ogling gray it was a look that came directly from and went to the heart if young ladies always knew how nicely nature has qualified the other sex to judge of their actions what multitudes of astonishingly expressive glances and artfully contrived gestures and movements would sink down into looks that indicated feelings and motives that were adapted to the occasion what trouble in creating incidents that might draw out charms would be avoided and in short how much extra labour both of body and mind would be spared  this agreeable contemplation of mr delafield was soon interrupted by the cheerful voice of maria osgood who cried  bless me george you really do look ill  it is seldom that i have much health to boast of replied the youth in a feeble voice and with a still feebler smile  but said maria without reflecting you look worse than usual  there was so much truth in this remark that the young man could only smile in silence while seymour surveying the very plain exterior of his new acquaintance turned his eyes with additional satisfaction towards a mirror that reflected his own form from head to feet  you will not attempt the flute tonight george said charlotte  i believe i must or not fulfil my engagement to mrs osgood  surely continued charlotte in a low tone to her friend george had better not play looking so ill as he does  certainly not besides his performance would not shine after that of mr delafield  seymour overheard this speech which was really intended only for the ear of charlotte and he was instantly seized with an unaccountable desire to hear the flute of mr morton seymour was conscious that he played well and could he have forgotten the indifference that miss henly exhibited to his performance would have been abundantly flattered with the encomiums that were lavished on his skill  a request from the mistress of the mansion now compelled george to make his appearance among the musicians and in a few minutes his flute was heard alone there was a vacancy in the looks of charlotte during the scientific execution of the different individuals who had been labouring at the several instruments in the course of the evening that denoted a total indifference to the display but the moment that george was called on to take his part in the entertainment this listlessness disappeared and was succeeded by an expression of intense interest and deep anxiety the melody of george was simple and plaintive he aimed at no extraordinary exhibition of skill and it was difficult to compare his music with that of seymour the latter however studied the countenance of the young lady near him as the best index to their comparative merit and he was soon able to read his own want of success for the first few minutes anxiety was the principal expression portrayed in her lovely face but it was soon succeeded by a deep and powerful emotion there is something contagious in the natural expression of our passions that insensibly enlists the sympathies of the beholderand seymour felt a soft melancholy stealing over him as he gazed that was but a faint reflection of the tenderness excited in the breast of charlotte while she listened to sounds that penetrated to her very soul there is no mistaking the effect of music that depends only on its melody its appeal to the heart is direct and unequivocal and nothing but callous indifference can resist its power the most profound silence pervaded the apartment and george was enabled to finish his piece with a spirit that increased with the attention as the last breathing notes died on the ear delafield turned to meet those eyes which had already secured an unconscious victory and saw them moistened with a lustre that added to their natural softness beauty in tears is proverbially irresistibleand the youth bending forward said in a voice that was modulated to the stillness of the room  such melody miss henly captivates the senses  does it not touch the heart asked the young lady with a little of unusual animation  the heart too but mr morton looks exhausted after his labours  all the pleasure which had shone in the countenance of charlotte vanished instantly and gave place to deep concern  oh it is unjustifiable thus to purchase pleasure at the expense of another said she in a tone that seymour scarcely heard  how tenderly would the man be loved thought the youth who succeeded in engaging the affections of this young creature how disinterested is her regardand how considerate are her feelings here will i trust my hopes for happiness in this life and here will i conquer or here will i die  no two persons could possibly be actuated by sensations more different than charlotte and seymour delafield he had been so long palled with the attentions of managing mothers and designing daughters had seen so much of female manoeuvring and had so easily seen through it that the natural and inartificial loveliness of charlotte touched his senses with a freshness of delicacy that to him was as captivating as it was novel upon unpractised men the arts of the sex are often successful but generally they are allies that increase the number of the assailants without promoting the victory it is certain that many a fair one played that evening in order that mr delafield might applaud that some sighed that he might hear and others ogled that he might sigh but not one made the impression that the quiet speaking eye and artless but peaceful nature of charlotte produced on the youth while this novel feeling was gaining ground in the bosom of mr delafield charlotte saw nothing in her new acquaintance but a gentleman of extraordinary personal beauty agreeable manners and graceful addressqualities that are always sure to please and not unusually to captivate but to her he was a stranger and charlotte who never thought or reasoned on the subject would have been astonished had one seriously spoken of her loving him the road to conquest with her lay through her heart and was but little connected with her imagination  heigho george cried maria as he approached you have given me the dolefuls  and me both pleasure and pain said charlotte  why the latter asked the youth quickly  surely it was imprudent in you to play with such a cold  the lip of the youth quivered and a smile of mournful and indefinable meaning passed over his features but he continued silent  it is to be hoped it had one good effect at least continued maria  such as what  such as putting the little dears to sleep in the nursery which is directly over our heads  it is well if i have done that little good said george  you have brought tears into eyes that never should weep cried delafield and melancholy to a countenance that seems formed by nature to convey an idea of peaceful content  morton looked earnestly at the speaker for a moment when a painful feeling seemed suddenly to seize on his heartfor his cheek grew paler and his lip quivered with an agitation that apparently he could not control charlotte alone noticed the alteration and speaking in a low tone she said  do go home george you are far from being wellto oblige me go home  to oblige you i would do much more unwelcome biddings he replied with a slight colour but i believe you are right and having discharged my duty here i will retire  he rose and paying the customary compliments to the mistress of the mansion withdrew with him disappeared all the awakened interest of charlotte in the scene  in vain was seymour delafield attentive polite and even particularly so that devotedness of admiration for which so many sighed and which so many envied was entirely thrown away upon charlotte she listened she bowed and she smiledand sometimes she answered but it was evidently without meaning or interest until wearied with his fruitless efforts to make an impression and perhaps with a hope of exciting a little jealousy he turned his attention to her more lively companion  your mothers nursery miss osgood he cried ought on such an occasion to be tenantless  you think there are enough of us here to make it so returned the lady with an affected sigh  i really had not observed the number of your charming familyhow many are there of you  a bakers dozen  charlotte laughed and the youth felt mortified the laugh was natural and clearly extorted without a thought of himself  when you are all married he said you will form a little world in yourselves  when the sky falls we shall catch larks  surely you intend to marry  maria made no reply but turned her eyes on delafield with an affected expression of melancholy that excited another laugh in her friend  you certainly have made no rash vow on the subject continued seymour pretending to a slight interest in her answer  my troth is not yet plighted said the lady a little archly  but there is no telling how long it will continue so  i am afraid sothirteen is a dreadful divisor for a small family estate  a general movement in the party was gladly seized by charlotte as an excuse to go and delafield handed her to her carriage with the mortifying conviction that she was utterly indifferent to every thing but the civility of the act     chapter iii   it was quite early on the following morning when mr delafield rung at the door of the house in which the father of miss henly resided the gentleman had obtained the permission of the young lady the preceding evening to put himself on the list of her visiting acquaintance and a casual introduction to both of charlottes parents had smoothed the way to this intimacy it is certain that much as mr and mrs henly loved their child neither of them entertained the selfish wish of monopolizing all of her affections to themselves during life it was natural and a thing to be expected that charlotte should marry and among the whole of their acquaintance there appeared no one so unobjectionable as her new admirer he was agreeable in person in manners and in temper he was intelligent witty and a man of the world and moreover he was worththree hundred thousand dollars what parent is there whose judgment would remain unbiassed by these solid reasons in favour of a candidate for the hand of his child or what female is there whose heart could be steeled against such attractions in her suitor many were the hours of care that had been passed by the guardians of charlottes happiness in ruminating on the event that was to yield their charge to the keeping of another frequent were their discussions on this interesting subject and innumerable their plans to protect her inexperience against falling into those errors that had blasted the peace of so many around them but the appearance of seymour delafield seemed as the fulfilment of their most sanguine expectations to his refinement of manners they both thought that they could yield the sensitive delicacy of their child with confidence in his travelled experience they anticipated the permanency of a corrected taste nor was it a disagreeable consideration to either that as the silken cord of paternal discipline was to be loosened it was to be succeeded by the fetters of hymen cast in polished gold in what manner their daughter regarded the evident admiration of mr delafield will appear by the conclusion of our tale  on entering the parlour delafield found george morton seated in a chair near the fire with his person more than usually well guarded against the cold as if he were suffering under the effects of a serious indisposition the salutations between the young men were a little embarrassed on both sides the face of george growing even paler than before while the fine colour on delafields cheek mounted to his very temples after regarding for a moment with much inward dissatisfaction the apparent ease with which george was maintaining possession of the apartment by himself mr delafield overcame the sudden emotion created by the surprise and spoke  i am sorry that you appear so ill mr morton and i regret that you should have suffered so much in the cause of humanity when one so much better able to undergo the fatigue by constitution should have remained an idle spectator like myself  the silent bow of george might be interpreted into a desire to say nothing of his own conduct or into an assent with the selfcondemnation of the speaker delafield however took the chair which the other politely placed for him and continued  but sir you have your reward the interest and admiration excited in miss henly would compensate me for almost any privation or hardship that man could undergo  it is no hardship to ride a few miles in a comfortable coach said george with a feeble smile nor can i consider it a privation of enjoyment to be able to assist the distressedhe hesitated a moment and a flush gradually stole over his features as he continued it is true sir that i prize the good opinion of miss henly highly but i look to another quarter for approbation on such a subject  and very justly george said the soft voice of charlotte such applause as mine can be but of little moment to one who performs such acts as yours  the gentlemen were sitting with their faces towards the fire and had not heard the light step of miss henly as she entered the apartment but both instantly arose and paid their salutations the invalid by a silent bow and by handing a chair and delafield with many a graceful compliment on her good looks and divers protestations concerning the pleasure he felt at being permitted to visit at her house no two things could be more different than the manners of these gentlemen that of the latter was very highly polished insinuating and although far from unpleasantly so yet slightly artificial while that of the former was simple ingenuous and in the presence of miss henly was apt to be at times a little constrained charlotte certainly perceived the difference and she as certainly thought that it was not altogether to the advantage of george morton the idea seemed to give her pain for she showed several little attentions to her old friend that by their flattering but unstudied particularity were adapted to put any man at his ease and assure him of his welcome still the embarrassment of george did not disappear but he sat an uneasy listener to the conversation that occurred as if reluctant to stay and yet unwilling to depart after a few observations on the entertainment of the preceding evening mr delafield continued  i was lamenting to mr morton as you entered that he should have suffered so much from my want of thought the day before yesterday it requires a good constitution to endure exposure  and such i often tell you george you do not possess said charlotte kindly and with a little melancholy yet you neither seem to regard my warnings on the subject nor those of any of your friends  there is a warning that i have not disregarded returned the youth endeavouring to smile  and what is it asked charlotte struck with the melancholy resignation of his manner  that i am not fit company just now for hearts as gay as yours and mr delafields he returned and rising he made a hasty bow and withdrew  what can he mean said charlotte in amazement george does not appear well and latterly his manner is much alteredwhat can he mean mr delafield  he is ill said delafield far from feeling quite easy at the evident interest that the lady exhibited he is ill and should be in his bed instead of attending the morning levees of even miss henly  indeed he is too regardless of his health said charlotte in a low tone fixing her eyes on the grate where she continued gazing for some time every effort of seymour was made to draw off the attention of the young lady from a subject that however melancholy seemed to possess peculiar charms for her in this undertaking the gentleman would not have succeeded but for the fortunate appearance of miss osgood who came into the room very opportunely to keep alive the discourse  what teteatete exclaimed maria you should discharge your footman charlotte for saying that you were at home a young lady is never supposed to be at home when she is alonewith a gentleman  i shall then know how to understand the servant of mr osgood when i inquire for his daughter cried seymour gayly  ah mr delafield it is seldom that i have an opportunity of hearing soft things for i am never alone with a gentleman in my fathers house  and is mrs osgood so rigid returned the gentleman surely the gravity of her daughter should create more confidence  most humbly i thank you sir said maria courtseying low before she took the chair that he handed but it is not the caution of mrs osgood that prevents any solos in her mansion unless it be on a harp or flute or any possibility of a teteatete  now you have excited my curiosity to a degree that is painfully unpleasant said delafield i know you to be too generous not to allay it  oh it is nothing more than a magical number that frightens away all applicants for such a favour unless indeed it may be such as would not be very likely to be successful were they to apply and which even would render it physically impossible to have a tender interview within the four walls of the mansion  it is a charmed number indeed and is it on the door is it the number of the house  oh not at allonly the number of the family the bakers dozen that i mentioned last evening now in visiting miss henly there is no such interruption to be apprehended  charlotte could not refrain from smiling at the vivacity of her friend who perceiving that her wish to banish the look of care that clouded the brow of the other had vanished changed the discourse as abruptly as she had introduced it  i met george morton at the door and chatted with him for several minutes he appears quite ill but i know he has gone two miles in the country for his mother this raw day unless he is more careful of himself he will ruin his constitution which is none of the best now  maria spoke with feeling and with a manner that plainly showed that her ordinary levity was assumed and that she had at the bottom much better feelings than the trifling intercourse of the world would usually permit her to exhibit charlotte did not reply but her brightening looks once more changed to that pensive softness which so well became her delicate features and which gave to her countenance an expression such as might be supposed to shadow the glory of angels when from their abode of purity and love they look down with pity on the sorrows of man  the quick glance of delafield not only watched but easily detected both the rapid transitions and the character of these opposite emotions under the sudden influence of passions that probably will not escape our readers he could not forbear uttering in a tone in which pique might have been too apparent  really mr morton is a happy fellow  the blue eyes of charlotte were turned to the speaker with a look of innocent inquiry but she continued silent maria however not only bestowed a glance at the youth from her laughing hazel ones but found utterance for her tongue also  how so she askedhe is not of a strong constitution not immensely rich nor over and abovethat is not particularly handsome why is he so happy  ah i have discovered that a man may be happy without one of those qualifications  and miserable who has them all  nay nay miss osgood my experience does not extend so fari am not quite the puppy you think me  maria in her turn was silent but she arose from her seat and moved with an absent air to a distant part of the room and for a short time seemed to be particularly occupied in examining the beauties of a portfolio of prints with every one of which she was perfectly familiar the conversation was resumed by her friend  you have mortified miss osgood mr delafield said charlotte she is too good natured to judge any one so harshly  is her good nature in this particular infectious the young man rather whispered than uttered alouddoes her friend feel the same indulgence for the infirmities of a frail nature to which she really seems herself hardly to belong  you compliment me mr delafield at the expense of truth if it really be a compliment to tell me that i am not a girla female for if i am not a woman i must be something worse  you are an angel said delafield with uncontrollable fervour  charlotte was startled by his manner and his words and unconsciously turned to her friend as if to seek her protecting presence but to her astonishment she beheld maria in the act of closing the door as she was leaving the room  maria she cried whither in such a hurry i expected you to pass the morning with me  i shall see your mother and return replied miss osgood closing the door so rapidly as to prevent further remark this short speech however gave charlotte time to observe the change that something had produced in the countenance of her old companion where in place of the thoughtless gaiety that usually shone in her features was to be seen an expression of painful mortification and even the high glow that youth and health had imparted to her cheeks was supplanted by a deathlike paleness delafield had been endeavouring to peruse the countenance of miss henley in a vain effort to discover the effect produced by his warm exclamation and these observations which were made by the quick eye of friendship entirely escaped his notice  maria is not well mr delafield charlotte said hastily i know your goodness will excuse me while i follow her  the young man bowed with a mortified air and was somewhat ungraciously beginning to make a polite reply when the door opened a short space and the voice of miss osgood was once more heard saying in a forced but lively manner  i never was better in my life i shall run into mrs mortons for ten minutes let me find you here mr delafield when i return her footstep was heard tripping along the passage and in a moment after the street door of the house opened and shut charlotte perceiving that her friend was determined for some inexplicable reason to be alone quietly resumed her seat her musing air was soon changed to one of surprise by the following remark of her companion  you appear miss henley he said to be sensitively alive to the ailings of all you know but me  i did not know that you were ill mr delafield really sir i never met with any gentlemans looks which so belied him if you are otherwise than both well and happy  as much experience as delafield possessed in the trifling manoeuvres of managers or perhaps in the manifestations of feelings that are exhibited by everyday people he was an absolute novice in the emotions of a pure simple ingenuous female heart he was alive to the compliment to his acknowledged good looks conveyed in this speech but he was not able to appreciate the singleheartedness that prompted it perhaps his handsome face was as much illuminated by the consciousness of this emotion as by the deeper feelings he actually experienced while he replied  i am well or ill as you decree miss henley it is impossible that you should live in the world and be seen be known as you are and must have been seen and known and not long since learned the power you possess over the happiness of hundreds  though charlotte was simple unsuspecting pure and extremely modest she was far from dullshe was not now to learn the difference between the language of ordinary trifling and general compliment and that to which she now listened and which however vague was still so particular as to induce her to remain silent the looks and manner of the youthful female at that moment would have been a study to those who love to dwell on the better and purer beings of creation she was silent as we have already remarked because she could make no answer to a speech that either meant every thing or nothing the slight tinge that usually was seated on her cheek spreading over its whole surface like the faintest glow of sunset blending by mellow degrees with the surrounding clouds was heightened to richness and even diffused itself like a reflection across her polished forehead because she believed she was about to listen to a declaration that her years and her education united to tell her was never to approach female ears without slightly trespassing on the delicacy of her sex her mild blue eyes beaming with the glow on her face rose and fell from the carpet to the countenance of delafield but chiefly dwelt in open charity and possibly in anxiety on his own in fact there was thrown around her whole air such a touch of exquisite and shrinking delicacy so blended with feeling benevolence and even tender interest that it was no wonder that a man handsome to perfection young intelligent and rich mistook her feelings  pardon me miss henley he cried and the apology was unconsciously paid to the commanding purity and dignity of her air if i overstep the rules of decorum and hasten to declare that which i know years of trial would hardly justify my saying but your beauty your grace youryourwhere shall i find words to express ityour loveliness yes that means every thingyour loveliness has not been seen with impunity  this might have done very well for a sudden and unprepared declaration but being a little indefinite it failed to extract a reply his listener giving a respectful and at times a rather embarrassing attention to what he was to add after a short pause the youth who found words as he proceeded and with whom as with all others the first speech was the most difficult continued  i have known you but a short time miss henley but to see you once is to see you always you smile miss henley but give me leave to hope that time and assiduity will enable me to bring you to such a state of feeling that in some degree you may know how to appreciate my sensations  if i smile mr delafield said charlotte in a low but distinct voice it is not at you but at myself i who have been for seventeen years constantly with charlotte henley find each day something new in her not to admire but to reprehend she paused a moment and then added smiling most sweetly as she spoke i will not affect to misunderstand you mr delafield your language is not very intelligible but it is such that i am sure you would not use to me if you were not serious and did not feel or rather think you feel what you utter  think i feel he echoed dont i know it can i be mistaken in my own sentiments i may be misled in yoursmay have flattered myself with being able to accomplish that at some distant day which your obduracy may deny me but in my own feelings i cannot be mistaken  not where they are so very new nay do not start so eagerlywhere they must be so very new surely your fancy only leads you to say so much and tomorrow or next day your fancy unless encouraged by you to dwell on my unworthy self will lead you elsewhere  now miss henley what i most admire in your character is its lovely ingenuousness its simplicity its heart and i will own i did not expect such an answer to a question put like mine in sincerity and truth  if i have failed to answer any question you have put to me mr delafield it is because i am unconscious than any was asked and if i have displayed disengenuousness want of simplicity or want of feeling it has been unintentional i do assure you and only proves that i can be guilty of errors without their being detected by one who has known me so long and so intimately  my impetuosity has deceived me and distressed you said delafieldi would have said that i love you ardently passionately and constantly and shall for ever love you i should have asked your permission to say all this to your parents to entreat them to permit me to see you often to address you and if it were not impossible to hope that in time they would consent to intrust me with their greatest treasure and that you would not oppose their decree  this is certainly asking many questions in a breath said charlotte smiling but without either irony or triumph and were it not for that word breath i should experience some uneasiness at what you say i find great satisfaction mr delafield in reflecting that our acquaintance is not a week old  a week is time enough to learn to adore such a being as you are miss henley though an age would not suffice to do justice to your merits say have i your permission to speak to your father i do not ask you yet to return my affectionnay i question if you can ever love as i do  perhaps not said charlotte i can love enough to feel a great and deep interest in those who are dear to me but i never yet have experienced such emotions as you describei believe in this particular you have formed a just opinion of me mr delafield i suspect such passions are not in the compass of my feelings  they are they must be miss henley allow me to see you often to speak to your father and at least to hopemay i not hope that in time you will learn to think me a man to be trusted with your happiness as your husband  the quiet which had governed the manner of charlotte during this dialogue was sensibly affected by this appeal and for a short time she appeared too much embarrassed to reply during this interval delafield gazed on her in delight for with the sanguine feelings of youth he interpreted every symptom of emotion in his own favour finding however that she was distressed for a reply he renewed his suit  though i have known you but a few days i feel as if i had known you for years there are i believe miss henley spirits in the world who commune with each other imperceptibly who seem formed for each other and who know and love each other as by instinct  i have no pretensions to belong to that class said charlotte i must know well to love a little but i trust i feel kind sentiments to the whole human race  ah you do not know yourself you have lived all your life in the neighbourhood of that mr morton who just went out and you feel pity for his illness he does indeed look very illbut you have yet to learn what it is to love i ask the high favour of being permitted to attempt the office ofofof  of teaching me said charlotte with a smile  nothat word is too presumptuoustoo coarse  hear me mr delafield said miss henley after a short pause during which she seemed to have experienced some deep and perhaps painful emotionsi cannot undertake to give you a reason for my conductvery possibly i have no good one but i feel that i should be doing you injustice by encouraging what you are pleased to call hopesi wish to be understood now as saying that i cannot consent to your expecting that i should ever become your wife  delafield was certainly astonished at this refusal which was given in that still decided manner that admits of little opposition he had long been accustomed to apprehend a sudden acceptance and had been in the habit of strictly guarding both his manner and his language lest something that he did or said might justify expectations that would have been out of his power to fulfil but now when for the first time he had ventured a direct offer he met with a rejection that possessed all the characteristics of sincerity he was in truth utterly astounded after taking a sufficient time to collect in some degree his faculties he came to the conclusion that he had been too precipitate and had urged the suit too far and too hastily  such may be your sentiments now miss henley he said but you may alter them in time you are not called on for a definite answer  if not by you i am by truth mr delafield it would be wrong to lead you to expect what can never  never said delafieldyou cannot speak so decidedly  i do indeed i do returned charlotte firmly  i have not deceived myself in believing you to be disengaged miss henley  you have a right to require a definite answer to your questions mr delafield but you have no right to exact my reasons for declining your very flattering offeri am young very youngbut i know what is due to myself and to my sex  by heavens my suspicion is trueyou are already betrothed  it would be easy to say no to that assertion sir added charlotte rising but your right to a reason in a matter where inclination is so material is exactly the same as my right would be to ask you why you did not address me i thank you for the preference you have shown me mr delafield i have not so little of the woman about me not to remember it always with gratitude but i tell you plainly and firmly for it is necessary that i should do soi never can consent to receive your proposals  i understand you madami understand you said the young man with an offended air you wish my absencenay miss henley hear me further  no further mr delafield interrupted charlotte advancing to him with a kind but unembarrassed air and offering her handwe part friends at least but i think now we know each others sentiments we had better separate  the gentleman seized the hand she offered and kissed it more with the air of a lover than of an offended man and left the room a few minutes after he had gone miss osgood reappeared     chapter iv   notwithstanding the earnest injunction that maria had given to mr delafield to continue where she left him until her return she expressed no surprise at not finding him in the room the countenance of this young lady exhibited a droll mixture of playful mirth and sadness she glanced her eyes once around the apartment and perceiving it was occupied only by her friend she said laughing  well charlotte when is it to be i think i retired in very good season  perhaps you did maria returned the other without raising her face from the reflecting attitude in which she stoodi believe it is all very well  well you little philosopheri should think it was excellentthatthat isif i were in your place i suspected this from the moment you met  what have you suspected mariawhat is it you imagine has occurred  what why seymour delafield has been stammeringthen he looked dolefulthen he sighedthen he hemmedthen he said you were an angelnay you need not look prudish and affect to deny it he got as far as that before i left the roomthen he turned to see if i were not coming back again to surprise himthen he fell on his kneesthen he stretched out his handsome handit is too handsome for a mans handand said take it take me take my name and take my three hundred thousand dollarsnow dont deny a syllable of it till i tell your answer  charlotte smiled and taking her work quietly seated herself at her table before she replied  you go through cupids exercise so dexterously maria one is led to suspect you have seen some service  not under such an officer girl ah colonel delafield or generalno fieldmarshal delafield is an officer that might teachas miss osgood spoke with short interruptions between her epithets as if in search of proper terms she dwelt a moment on the last word in such a manner as to give it a particular emphasischarlotte started more perhaps from the manner than the expression and turning her glowing face towards her friend she cried involuntarily  is it possible that you could have overheard  what  nothingwhat nonsense  let me tell you miss prude it is in such nonsense however that the happiness or misery of us poor sports of fortune called women in a great measure blooms or fadesnow that i call poeticalbut for your answer first you saidindeed mr delafield this is so unexpectedthough you knew well enough what was comingthen you blushed as you did a little while ago and said i am so youngiam but poor seventeenthen he swore you were seventyno nobut he said you are old enough to be his ruling starhis destinyhis idolhis object of worshipha i do hit the right epithet now and then wellthen you said you had parents as if the poor man did not know that already and that they must be consulted and he desired you to ask the whole cityhe defied them all to say aught against himhe was regular at churchsubscribed to the widows society and the assembly and in short was called a good young man even in wallstreet  all this is very amusing mariabut  it is all very true then he was pressing and you were coy until finally he extorted your definitive answer which was maria paused and seemed to be intensely studying the looks of the othermiss henley smiled as she turned her placid ingenuous features to her gaze and continued the conversation by repeating  which was  no irretrievableunanswerableunalterable no  i have not authorized you to suspect any part of this rhapsody to be truei have not said you were right in a single particular  excuse me miss henley you have said all and seymour delafield told me the same as we passed each other at the street door  is it possible  it could not be otherwise his mouth was shut it is true and his tongue might have been in his pocket for any thing i know but his eyes and his head his walk and even his nose were downcast and spoke mortification on the other hand your little body looks an inch higher your eyes look resolute as much as to say avaunt false one your whole appearance is that of determined denial mingled  mingled with what trifler  mingled with a little secret womans pride that you have had an opportunity of showing your absolute character  you know these feelings from experience do you  no child my very nature is charity if the request had been made to me i should have sent the desponding youth to my father and if he refused to my mother  and if she refused  why then i should have said two negatives make an affirmative  charlotte laughed and in this manner the serious explanation which between friends so intimate might have been expected was avoided maria at the same time that she felt and manifested a deep interest in the têteàtête that she had promoted always avoided any thing like a grave explanation and we have failed in giving the desired view of the character of miss henley if our readers deem it probable that she would ever touch on the subject voluntarily  the winter passed by in the ordinary manner in which other winters pass in this climate being a mixture of mild delightful days clear sky and invigorating sun and of intense cold raw winds and snow storms the two latter seemed to try the constitution of poor george morton to the utmost the severe cold that he took in his charitable excursion lingered about him through the cold months and before the genial warmth of may occurred to relieve him his physicians pronounced that his lungs were irremediably affected during the period of doubt and apprehension which preceded the annunciation of this opinion and of distress and agony which succeeded it the family of mr henley warmly sympathized in the feelings of their neighbours the long intimacy that had existed between george and charlotte and their parents removed all superfluous forms and the latter passed a great deal of her time with mrs morton or by the side of the invalid her presence gave him such manifest and lively pleasure that it would have been cruel to have denied him what the other appeared to grant spontaneously charlotte had gradually withdrawn herself from society as the illness of george increased and his danger became more apparent and at the expiration of the month of april she was seldom visible to those who are called the world with the exception of the immediate connexions of her family and her friend maria osgood in the beginning of may both mr morton and his neighbour withdrew to their country houses and thus the retirement from the world and the intercourse between the two families became more complete  delafield had made one or two efforts to renew his addresses to charlotte but finding them in every instance firmly though mildly rejected he endeavoured to discover such imperfections in the object of his regard as might justify him in disliking her the more he reflected on her conduct however the more he became sensible of the propriety and simplicity of her deportment and had not the impression she had made on the young man proceeded rather from the effect on his fancy than from having touched his heart the consequences of his conviction of her purity and truth might have been more lasting and deplorable as it was his heated imagination gradually ceased to glow with the beauties of an image that was however perfect in itself extravagantly coloured by his own youthful imagination and in time if he thought at all of charlotte henley he thought of her as a beautiful object it is true but as of one that brought somewhat mortifying reflections along with it this might not have been manly or generous perhaps but we believe it is the manner in nine cases out of ten in which such sudden emotions expire especially if the ardour of the youth has precipitated a declaration that the more chastened feelings of the damsel are not yet prepared to reciprocate while the image of charlotte was still lingering in his mind he was in the habit of visiting maria osgood almost daily to ask questions about her and perhaps with a secret expectation of their meeting her at the house of her friend the gay trifling of miss osgood aided greatly both in cooling his spleen and removing his melancholy till in the course of a month he even proceeded so far as to make her the confidant of what she already knew though only by conjecture and inference delafield at this time was so urgent and secretly so determined to prevail in order that his pride if not his affections might be soothed that in an unguarded moment he induced the inconsiderate maria to betray we will not say the confidence of her friend but such facts as could only have come to her knowledge by the intimacy of unaffected association if there were any thing to extenuate this breach of decorum in maria it was the manner in which it was effected miss osgood had just returned from one of her frequent visits to the villa of mr henley when delafield made his customary morning call the absence of maria and the object of her visit had been well known to him and as it was a time when he began to speak of miss henley without much emotion and but little love he could not avoid yielding so far to his pique as to express himself as follows  so miss maria you have just returned from paying another visit to your beautiful little friend without any heart  my little friend without any heart of whom do you speak and what do you mean  i speak of miss charlotte henley the nunshe who has all of heaven about her but its lovethat brilliant casket without its jewelsthat womanyes that young woman without any heart  upon my word sir this is a very pretty poem you have been reciting but in my opinion your conclusion is wrong as she refused to give you her heart it is the more probable that she has it yet in that brilliant casket you speak of  noshe never had one she wants the greatest charm that nature can give to a womana warm grateful and affectionate heart  and pray sir said maria bending her eyes inquisitively toward the youth if she want it what has she done with it  she never had one miss osgood i will grant you that she is lovely exquisitely lovely pure gentle amiable every epithet you may wish to apply that indicates nothing but acquired excellence but as to natural feeling she is as cold as an iciclein short she is destitute of heartthe thing of all others i most prize in a woman and for which i admire you so much  maria laughed but she coloured also it had long been obvious to herself and to the world too that delafield sought her society now that he was not admitted at mr henleys much more than that of any other young woman in the city but she thought that she well understood the secret reason for this preference though the world might not how gratifying this speech was to the feelings of the gay girl the sequel of our tale must show the young man however did not judge her too favourably when he supposed her to possess those kindred sensations that unite us with our fellowbeings and he might have added a good deal of generosity to the catalogue of her virtues after a pause of a moment she replied  i suppose i must thank you delafield for the pretty compliment you have just paid me but i am so unused to this sort of thing that i really feel as bashful as sweet fifteen though i am at mature twenty  that is because you do feel miss osgood i might have said as much to charlotte henley without exciting the least emotion in her or of even bringing one tinge of that bright blush over her features which makes you look so handsome  mercy mercy have mercy i entreat you cried maria averting her face or i shall soon be as red as the cook but i cannot i will not consent to hear my friend traduced in such a manner so far from wanting feeling charlotte henley is all heart to use your own language she added turning her eyes towards him archly it is for her heart that i most love her  you deceive yourself early attachment and long association and your own generous warm feelings deceive you she is accustomed to show gentle and kind civilities to all around her and you mistake habit for affection  she is accustomed to do all that i own but to do it in a manner that adds to its value by her simple unaffected feelings she is not i must acknowledge like certain people of my acquaintance a bundle of tinder to take fire at every spark that approaches but she loves all she should love and i fear she loves one too well that she should not love  love one that she should not love cried delafield what is her heart then engaged to another is it possible that miss henley the cold prudish miss henley can indulge an improper attachment after all  mr delafield said miss osgood gravely i am not apt to betray what i ought to conceal although i am the giddy creature that i seem but i have spoken unguardedly and must explain in the first place i would not have you suppose that charlotte henley and i talk of our hearts and our lovers to each other like two girls at a boarding school if i know that she has such a thing as a heart at all it is not from herself but from my own observation and as for lovers though she may have had dozens for any thing i know to me they are absolutely strangersdont interrupt me i am not begging one after this explanation i will say trusting delafield entirely in your honour which i do believe you to possess in a high  you mayyou may interrupted the young man eagerly i will never betray your confidenceyou might trust yourself to my honour and good faith  i wish you would not be bringing yourself and myself constantly into the conversation said the lady compressing her lips to conceal a smile we are talking of charlotte henley and of her only she was brought up in the daily habit of seeing much of george morton who i believe even you will own has a heart for it will cost him his life  his life  i fear so nay it is without hope the cold he took in carrying the poor sufferer to the hospital last winter has thrown him into a decline i do believe that charlotte henley is fond of him but mind i do not say that she is in loveit appears to be less of passion than of intense affection  yes such as she would feel for a brother  she has no brother i do not intend to define the passions but i do believe that if he were to live and offer himself she would marry him and make him such a wife as any man might envy  what do you think she loves him unasked and yet refuse me who begged her hand like her slave  it is not unasked he has known her all her lifehas ever shown a preference for herhas been kind to her and to all others in her presencehe has long anticipated her wishes in trifles andandin short he has done just what he ought to do to gain her love  then you think i erred in the manner in which i made my advances  your advances as you call them would have succeeded with nine girls in ten though not with miss henleybesides you are too late  certainly not too late when no declaration had been made by any other  i am not about to discuss the proprieties of courtship with you mr delafield cried maria laughing and rising from her chair come let us walk it is a sin to shut ourselves up on such a morning the subject must now be changed and the scene too  he accepted her challenge and they proceeded through the streets together but she evaded every subsequent attempt he made to renew the discourse perhaps she felt that she had gone too farperhaps there was something in it that was painful to her own feelings  the explanation however had a great tendency to destroy the remains of what delafield mistook for love instead of having his affections seriously engaged in a short intercourse with miss henley our readers may easily perceive that it was nothing but his imagination that was excited and which had kept his brain filled with images still more lovely than the original but now that the wan features of george morton were constantly brought into the picture by the side of the deity he had worshipped the contemplation of these fancied beauties became hourly less pleasant and in a short time he ceased to dwell on the subject altogether  a consequence however grew out of his shortlived inclination that was as unlooked for by himself as by the others interested in the result he became so much accustomed to the society of maria osgood that at length he felt it was necessary to his comfort to the surprise of the whole city the handsome rich witty and accomplished mr seymour delafield declared himself in form before the spring had expired to one of the plain daughters of mr osgood a man with a large family and but little money maria had a difficult task to conceal the pleasure she felt as she listened to not the passionate declaration of her admirer but to his warm solicitations that she would unite her destinies to his own she did conceal it however and would only consent to receive his visits for a time on the condition that he was not to consider her as at all engaged by the permission     chapter v   while such happy prospects were opening on the future life of her friend the time of charlotte henley was very differently occupied in the country there is however a tendency in youth to rise with events that does not readily admit of depression and the disorder of george morton was one of all others the most flattering when near its close even the more mature experience of his parents was misled by the deceptive symptoms that his complaint assumed in the commencement of summer they who so fondly hoped the result began to believe that youth and the bland airs of june were overcoming the inexorable enemy that the strength of the young man lessened with every succeeding day was an event to be expected from his low diet and protracted confinement but his brightening eyes and the flitting colour that would at times add to their fiery radiance brought to the youthful charlotte the most heartfelt though secret rapture this state between reviving hope and momentary despondency had prevailed for several weeks when the affectionate girl entered an apartment that communicated with georges own room where she found the invalid reclining on a settee apparently deeply communing with himself he was alone and his appearance as well as the heavens and the earth united to encourage the sanguine expectation of the pure heart that throbbed so ardently when its owner witnessed any favourable change in the countenance of the young man the windows were raised and the balmy air of a june morning played through the apartment lending in reality an elastic vigour to the decaying organs of the sick youth the tinge in his cheeks was heightened by the mellow glow of the suns rays as they shone through the medium of the rosecoloured curtains of the window and charlotte thought she once more beheld the returning colour of health where it had been so long absent  how much better you appear this morning george she cried in a voice whose melody was even heightened by its gaiety we shall soon have you among us once more and then heedless one beware how you trifle again with that best of heavens gifts your health oh this is a blessed climate our summer atones with its mildness for the dreariness and perils of our winter it has even given me a colour paleface as i ami can feel it burn on my cheek  he raised his head from its musing position at the first sounds of her voice and smiled faintly and with an expression of anguish as she proceeded but when she had ended and taken her seat near him still keeping her eyes on his varying countenance he took her hand into his own before he replied a good deal surprised at his manner and at this act which exceeded the usual familiarity of even their affectionate intercourse the colour of which miss henley had been so playfully boasting changed once or twice with rapid transitions  seem i so well dear charlotte he at length said in a low tremulous and hollow voice seem i so well i believe you are right and that i shall shortly be bettermuch better  what mean you george feel you any worse have i disturbed you with my presence and my thoughtless gaiety  the young man smiled again but the expression of his face was no longer mingled with a look of anguish it was a kind benevolent gleam of gratitude and affection which crossed his ghastly features like a ray of sunshine enlivening the gloom of a day in winter  you disturb me charlotte he answered his very voice trembling as if in sympathy with his frame i do believe but for you i should have been long since in my grave  no no george this is too melancholy a theme for us both just now let us talk of your returning health  he pressed her hand to his heart before he repliedmy health will never return i am lost to this world and in fact at this moment i properly belong to another in my body would to god that i was purely so in feelings also  surely george you are alarming yourself unnecessarily  i am not alarmed he replied i have too long foreseen this event to feel alarmed at my approaching dissolutionno for that blessed be my god and my redeemer i am in some degree prepared but i feel it impossible to shake off the feelings of this life while the pulse continues to beat and yet the emotions i now experience must be in some measure allied to heaven they are not impure they are not selfish nothing can partake of either dear charlotte where your image is connected with the thoughts of a future world  oh george talk not so gloomily so cruelly this morningyour whole countenance contradicts your melancholy speech and you are betterindeed you areyou must be better  yes i am better i am nearly well returned the youth pausing a moment while a struggle of the most painful interest seemed to engross his thoughts as it passed away he drew his hand feebly across his clammy brow and smiling faintly resumed his speechon the brink of the grave at a moment when all thoughts of me must be connected with the image of death there can no longer be any necessity for silence you have been kind to us dear miss henley as you are kind to all but to me your sympathy has been trebly dear for it has brought with it a consolation and pleasure that you but little imagine  miss henley raised her tearful eyes from the floor to his wan features that now appeared illumined with more than human fires and her pale lips quivered but her voice was inaudible  yes charlotte i may now speak without injustice or the fear of being selfish i have long loved youhow tenderly how purely none can ever know but could i with a certainty of my fate before my eyes with the knowledge that my days were numbered and that the sun of my life could never reach its meridian woo you to my love to make you miserable no dearest your gentle heart will mourn the brother and the friend too much for its own peace it needed not the sting of a stronger grief  george george sobbed the convulsed girl think not of me speak not of meif it can cheer you at such a moment to know how much you are valued by me no cold reserve shall be found on my part  the young man started and fastened his eyes on her face with an indefinable look of delight mingled with sorrow  charlotte he exclaimed do i hear aright am i so miserable am i so happy repeat those wordsquickmy eyes grow dimmy senses deceive me  live george morton said charlotte firmly you are betteryour whole face bespeaks it and if the tender care of an affectionate wife can preserve your health you shall long live a blessing to all who love you  as charlotte uttered thus ingenuously her pure attachment the youth extended his hand towards her blindly she gave him her own which he drew to his heart and folded to his bosom with a warm pressure for an instant when his hold relaxed his form dropping backward on the sofa and in that attitude he expired without a struggle  we shall not dwell on the melancholy scenes that followed at the funeral of george morton miss henley was not to be seen nor was it generally understood that the young people had been connected in the closest ties of feeling she made no display of her griefs in her dress unless the slight testimonials of a few bright ribbands on the virgin white of her robe could be called such and the rumour that was at first propagated of their being engaged to each other was discredited because the traces of sorrow were not particularly visible in the attire of miss henley when the season of gaiety returned she appeared as usual in her place in society though her cheeks were seldom enriched with the faint glow that once rendered her so beautiful and she was less dazzling in her appearance yet if possible she was more lovely and attractive in the course of the winter several gentlemen approached her with the evident intention of offering their hands their advances were received with great urbanity but in most instances with that unembarrassed manner that is fatal to hope one of her admirers however persevered so far as to solicit her hand the denial was mild but resolute like most young men who think their happiness dependent on a ladys smile he wished to know if he had a successful rival he was assured he had not his curiosity even went so far as to inquire if miss henley had abjured matrimony the answer was a simple unaffected negative amazed at his own want of success the youth then intimated his intention of making a future application for her favour  in the mean time seymour delafield after casting one longing lingering look at miss henley became the husband of her friend and made the fourteenth in the prolific family of the osgoods where his wealth was not less agreeable to the parents than his person to the daughter  many years have rolled by since the occurrence of these events and miss henley continues the same in every thing but appearance the freshness of her beauty has given place to a look of intelligence and delicacy that seems gradually fitting her for her last and most important change the name of george morton is never heard to pass her lips mrs delafield declares it to be a subject that she never dares to approach nor in her repeated refusals of matrimonial offers has charlotte ever been known to allude to the desolation of her own heart her father is dead but to her mother miss henley has in a great measure supplied his loss with her friends she is always cheerful and apparently happy though the innocent gaiety of her childhood is sensibly checked and there are moments that betray the existence of a grief that is only the more durable because it is less violent in short she lives a pattern for her sex unfettered by any romantic and foolish pledges discharging all the natural duties of her years and station in an exemplary manner but unwilling to incur any new ones because she has but one heart and that was long since given with its purity sincerity and truth to him who is dead and can never become the property of another  when charlotte henley dies although she may not have fulfilled one of the principal objects of her being by becoming a mother her example will survive her and those who study her character and integrity of feeling will find enough to teach them what properties are the most valuable in forming that sacred characterwhile her own sex can learn that though in the case of miss henley providence has denied the full exercise of her excellences it has at the same time rendered her a striking instance of female dignity by exhibiting to the world the difference between affection and caprice and by shewing how much imagination is inferior to heart   the end
