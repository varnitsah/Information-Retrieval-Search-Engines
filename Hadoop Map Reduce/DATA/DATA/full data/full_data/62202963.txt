adventure     i  the dÉbut of bimbashi joyce   it was in the days when the tide of mahdism which had swept in such a flood from the great lakes and darfur to the confines of egypt had at last come to its full and even begun as some hoped to show signs of a turn at its outset it had been terrible it had engulfed hickss army swept over gordon and khartoum rolled behind the british forces as they retired down the river and finally cast up a spray of raiding parties as far north as assouan then it found other channels to east and to west to central africa and to abyssinia and retired a little on the side of egypt for ten years there ensued a lull during which the frontier garrisons looked out upon those distant blue hills of dongola behind the violet mists which draped them lay a land of blood and horror from time to time some adventurer went south towards those hazegirt mountains tempted by stories of gum and ivory but none ever returned once a mutilated egyptian and once a greek woman mad with thirst and fear made their way to the lines they were the only exports of that country of darkness sometimes the sunset would turn those distant mists into a bank of crimson and the dark mountains would rise from that sinister reek like islands in a sea of blood it seemed a grim symbol in the southern heaven when seen from the fortcapped hills by wady halfa  ten years of lust in khartoum ten years of silent work in cairo and then all was ready and it was time for civilisation to take a trip south once more travelling as her wont is in an armoured train everything was ready down to the last packsaddle of the last camel and yet no one suspected it for an unconstitutional government has its advantages a great administrator had argued and managed and cajoled a great soldier had organised and planned and made piastres do the work of pounds and then one night these two master spirits met and clasped hands and the soldier vanished away upon some business of his own and just at that very time bimbashi hilary joyce seconded from the royal mallow fusiliers and temporarily attached to the ninth soudanese made his first appearance in cairo  napoleon had said and hilary joyce had noted that great reputations are only to be made in the east here he was in the east with four tin cases of baggage a wilkinson sword a bonds slugthrowing pistol and a copy of greens introduction to the study of arabic with such a start and the blood of youth running hot in his veins everything seemed easy he was a little frightened of the general he had heard stories of his sternness to young officers but with tact and suavity he hoped for the best so leaving his effects at shepheards hotel he reported himself at headquarters  it was not the general but the head of the intelligence department who received him the chief being still absent upon that business which had called him hilary joyce found himself in the presence of a short thickset officer with a gentle voice and a placid expression which covered a remarkably acute and energetic spirit with that quiet smile and guileless manner he had undercut and outwitted the most cunning of orientals he stood a cigarette between his fingers looking at the newcomer  i heard that you had come sorry the chief isnt here to see you gone up to the frontier you know  my regiment is at wady halfa i suppose sir that i should report myself there at once  no i was to give you your orders he led the way to a map upon the wall and pointed with the end of his cigarette you see this place its the oasis of kurkura little quiet i am afraid but excellent air you are to get out there as quick as possible youll find a company of the ninth and half a squadron of cavalry you will be in command  hilary joyce looked at the name printed at the intersection of two black lines without another dot upon the map for several inches round it  a village sir  no a well not very good water im afraid but you soon get accustomed to natron its an important post as being at the junction of two caravan routes all routes are closed now of course but still you never know who might come along them  we are there i presume to prevent raiding  well between you and me theres really nothing to raid you are there to intercept messengers they must call at the wells of course you have only just come out but you probably understand already enough about the conditions of this country to know that there is a great deal of disaffection about and that the khalifa is likely to try and keep in touch with his adherents then again senoussi lives up that wayhe waved his cigarette to the westwardthe khalifa might send a message to him along that route anyhow your duty is to arrest every one coming along and get some account of him before you let him go you dont talk arabic i suppose  i am learning sir  well well youll have time enough for study there and youll have a native officer ali something or other who speaks english and can interpret for you well goodbyeill tell the chief that you reported yourself get on to your post now as quickly as you can  railway to baliani the postboat to assouan and then two days on a camel in the libyan desert with an ababdeh guide and three baggagecamels to tie one down to their own exasperating pace however even two and a half miles an hour mount up in time and at last on the third evening from the blackened slagheap of a hill which is called the jebel kurkur hilary joyce looked down upon a distant clump of palms and thought that this cool patch of green in the midst of the merciless blacks and yellows was the fairest colour effect that he had ever seen an hour later he had ridden into the little camp the guard had turned out to salute him his native subordinate had greeted him in excellent english and he had fairly entered into his own  it was not an exhilarating place for a lengthy residence there was one large bowlshaped grassy depression sloping down to the three pits of brown and brackish water there was the grove of palm trees also beautiful to look upon but exasperating in view of the fact that nature has provided her least shady trees on the very spot where shade is needed most a single widespread acacia did something to restore the balance here hilary joyce slumbered in the heat and in the cool he inspected his squareshouldered spindleshanked soudanese with their cheery black faces and their funny little porkpie forage caps joyce was a martinet at drill and the blacks loved being drilled so the bimbashi was soon popular among them but one day was exactly like another the weather the view the employment the foodeverything was the same at the end of three weeks he felt that he had been there for interminable years and then at last there came something to break the monotony  one evening as the sun was sinking hilary joyce rode slowly down the old caravan road it had a fascination for him this narrow track winding among the boulders and curving up the nullahs for he remembered how in the map it had gone on and on stretching away into the unknown heart of africa the countless pads of innumerable camels through many centuries had beaten it smooth so that now unused and deserted it still wound away the strangest of roads a foot broad and perhaps two thousand miles in length joyce wondered as he rode how long it was since any traveller had journeyed up it from the south and then he raised his eyes and there was a man coming along the path  for an instant joyce thought that it might be one of his own men but a second glance assured him that this could not be so the stranger was dressed in the flowing robes of an arab and not in the closefitting khaki of a soldier he was very tall and a high turban made him seem gigantic he strode swiftly along with head erect and the bearing of a man who knows no fear  who could he be this formidable giant coming out of the unknown the percursor possibly of a horde of savage spearmen and where could he have walked from the nearest well was a long hundred miles down the track at any rate the frontier post of kurkur could not afford to receive casual visitors hilary joyce whisked round his horse galloped into camp and gave the alarm then with twenty horsemen at his back he rode out again to reconnoitre  the man was still coming on in spite of these hostile preparations for an instant he had hesitated when first he saw the cavalry but escape was out of the question and he advanced with the air of one who makes the best of a bad job he made no resistance and said nothing when the hands of two troopers clutched at his shoulders but walked quietly between their horses into camp shortly afterwards the patrols came in again there were no signs of any dervishes the man was alone a splendid trotting camel had been found lying dead a little way down the track the mystery of the strangers arrival was explained but why and whence and whitherthese were questions for which a zealous officer must find an answer  hilary joyce was disappointed that there were no dervishes it would have been a great start for him in the egyptian army had he fought a little action on his own account but even as it was he had a rare chance of impressing the authorities he would love to show his capacity to the head of the intelligence and even more to that grim chief who never forgot what was smart or forgave what was slack the prisoners dress and bearing showed that he was of importance mean men do not ride purebred trotting camels joyce sponged his head with cold water drank a cup of strong coffee put on an imposing official tarboosh instead of his sunhelmet and formed himself into a court of inquiry and judgment under the acacia tree  he would have liked his people to have seen him now with his two black orderlies in waiting and his egyptian native officer at his side he sat behind a camptable and the prisoner strongly guarded was led up to him the man was a handsome fellow with bold grey eyes and a long black beard  why cried joyce the rascal is making faces at me  a curious contraction had passed over the mans features but so swiftly that it might have been a nervous twitch he was now a model of oriental gravity  ask him who he is and what he wants  the native officer did so but the stranger made no reply save that the same sharp spasm passed once more over his face  well im blessed cried hilary joyce of all the impudent scoundrels he keeps on winking at me who are you you rascal give an account of yourself dye hear  but the tall arab was as impervious to english as to arabic the egyptian tried again and again the prisoner looked at joyce with his inscrutable eyes and occasionally twitched his face at him but never opened his mouth the bimbashi scratched his head in bewilderment  look here mahomet ali weve got to get some sense out of this fellow you say there are no papers on him  no sir we found no papers  no clue of any kind  he has come far sir a trotting camel does not die easily he has come from dongola at least  well we must get him to talk  it is possible that he is deaf and dumb  not he i never saw a man look more all there in my life  you might send him across to assouan  and give some one else the credit no thank you this is my bird but how are we going to get him to find his tongue  the egyptians dark eyes skirted the encampment and rested on the cooks fire  perhaps said he if the bimbashi thought fit he looked at the prisoner and then at the burning wood  no no it wouldnt do no by jove thats going too far  a very little might do it  no no its all very well here but it would sound just awful if ever it got as far as fleet street but i say he whispered we might frighten him a bit theres no harm in that  no sir  tell them to undo the mans galabeeah order them to put a horseshoe in the fire and make it redhot  the prisoner watched the proceedings with an air which had more of amusement than of uneasiness he never winced as the black sergeant approached with the glowing shoe held upon two bayonets  will you speak now asked the bimbashi savagely  the prisoner smiled gently and stroked his beard  oh chuck the infernal thing away cried joyce jumping up in a passion theres no use trying to bluff the fellow he knows we wont do it but i can and i will flog him and you tell him from me that if he hasnt found his tongue by tomorrow morning ill take the skin off his back as sure as my names joyce have you said all that  yes sir  well you can sleep upon it you beauty and a good nights rest may it give you  he adjourned the court and the prisoner as imperturbable as ever was led away by the guard to his supper of rice and water  hilary joyce was a kindhearted man and his own sleep was considerably disturbed by the prospect of the punishment which he must inflict next day he had hopes that the mere sight of the koorbash and the thongs might prevail over his prisoners obstinacy and then again he thought how shocking it would be if the man proved to be really dumb after all the possibility shook him so that he had almost determined by daybreak that he would send the stranger on unhurt to assouan and yet what a tame conclusion it would be to the incident he lay upon his angareeb still debating it when the question suddenly and effectively settled itself ali mahomet rushed into his tent  sir he cried the prisoner is gone  gone  yes sir and your own best riding camel as well there is a slit cut in the tent and he got away unseen in the early morning  the bimbashi acted with all energy cavalry rode along every track scouts examined the soft sand of the wadys for signs of the fugitive but no trace was discovered the man had utterly disappeared with a heavy heart hilary joyce wrote an official report of the matter and forwarded it to assouan five days later there came a curt order from the chief that he should report himself there he feared the worst from the stern soldier who spared others as little as he spared himself  and his worst forebodings were realised travelstained and weary he reported himself one night at the generals quarters behind a table piled with papers and strewn with maps the famous soldier and his chief of intelligence were deep in plans and figures their greeting was a cold one  i understand captain joyce said the general that you have allowed a very important prisoner to slip through your fingers  i am sorry sir  no doubt but that will not mend matters did you ascertain anything about him before you lost him  no sir  how was that  i could get nothing out of him sir  did you try  yes sir i did what i could  what did you do  well sir i threatened to use physical force  what did he say  he said nothing  what was he like  a tall man sir rather a desperate character i should think  any way by which we could identify him  a long black beard sir grey eyes and a nervous way of twitching his face  well captain joyce said the general in his stern inflexible voice i cannot congratulate you upon your first exploit in the egyptian army you are aware that every english officer in this force is a picked man i have the whole british army from which to draw it is necessary therefore that i should insist upon the very highest efficiency it would be unfair upon the others to pass over any obvious want of zeal or intelligence you are seconded from the royal mallows i understand  yes sir  i have no doubt that your colonel will be glad to see you fulfilling your regimental duties again  hilary joyces heart was too heavy for words he was silent  i will let you know my final decision tomorrow morning  joyce saluted and turned upon his heel  you can sleep upon that you beauty and a good nights rest may it give you  joyce turned in bewilderment where had those words been used before who was it who had used them  the general was standing erect both he and the chief of the intelligence were laughing joyce stared at the tall figure the erect bearing the inscrutable grey eyes  good lord he gasped  well well captain joyce we are quits said the general holding out his hand you gave me a bad ten minutes with that infernal redhot horseshoe of yours ive done as much for you i dont think we can spare you for the royal mallows just yet awhile  but sir but  the fewer questions the better perhaps but of course it must seem rather amazing i had a little private business with the kabbabish it must be done in person i did it and came to your post in my return i kept on winking at you as a sign that i wanted a word with you alone  yes yes i begin to understand  i couldnt give it away before all those blacks or where should i have been the next time i used my false beard and arab dress you put me in a very awkward position but at last i had a word alone with your egyptian officer who managed my escape all right  he mahomet ali  i ordered him to say nothing i had a score to settle with you but we dine at eight captain joyce we live plainly here but i think i can do you a little better than you did me at kurkur     ii  the surgeon of gaster fell   i how the woman came to kirkbymalhouse  bleak and windswept is the little town of kirkbymalhouse harsh and forbidding are the fells upon which it stands it stretches in a single line of greystone slateroofed houses dotted down the furzeclad slope of the rolling moor  in this lonely and secluded village i james upperton found myself in the summer of 85 little as the hamlet had to offer it contained that for which i yearned above all thingsseclusion and freedom from all which might distract my mind from the high and weighty subjects which engaged it but the inquisitiveness of my landlady made my lodgings undesirable and i determined to seek new quarters  as it chanced i had in one of my rambles come upon an isolated dwelling in the very heart of these lonely moors which i at once determined should be my own it was a tworoomed cottage which had once belonged to some shepherd but had long been deserted and was crumbling rapidly to ruin in the winter floods the gaster beck which runs down gaster fell where the little dwelling stood had overswept its banks and torn away a part of the wall the roof was in ill case and the scattered slates lay thick amongst the grass yet the main shell of the house stood firm and true and it was no great task for me to have all that was amiss set right  the two rooms i laid out in a widely different mannermy own tastes are of a spartan turn and the outer chamber was so planned as to accord with them an oilstove by rippingille of birmingham furnished me with the means of cooking while two great bags the one of flour and the other of potatoes made me independent of all supplies from without in diet i had long been a pythagorean so that the scraggy longlimbed sheep which browsed upon the wiry grass by the gaster beck had little to fear from their new companion a ninegallon cask of oil served me as a sideboard while a square table a deal chair and a trucklebed completed the list of my domestic fittings at the head of my couch hung two unpainted shelvesthe lower for my dishes and cooking utensils the upper for the few portraits which took me back to the little that was pleasant in the long wearisome toiling for wealth and for pleasure which had marked the life i had left behind  if this dwellingroom of mine were plain even to squalor its poverty was more than atoned for by the luxury of the chamber which was destined to serve me as my study i had ever held that it was best for my mind to be surrounded by such objects as would be in harmony with the studies which occupied it and that the loftiest and most ethereal conditions of thought are only possible amid surroundings which please the eye and gratify the senses the room which i had set apart for my mystic studies was set forth in a style as gloomy and majestic as the thoughts and aspirations with which it was to harmonise both walls and ceilings were covered with a paper of the richest and glossiest black on which was traced a lurid and arabesque pattern of dead gold a black velvet curtain covered the single diamondpaned window while a thick yielding carpet of the same material prevented the sound of my own footfalls as i paced backward and forward from breaking the current of my thought along the cornices ran gold rods from which depended six pictures all of the sombre and imaginative caste which chimed best with my fancy  and yet it was destined that ere ever i reached this quiet harbour i should learn that i was still one of humankind and that it is an ill thing to strive to break the bond which binds us to our fellows it was but two nights before the date i had fixed upon for my change of dwelling when i was conscious of a bustle in the house beneath with the bearing of heavy burdens up the creaking stair and the harsh voice of my landlady loud in welcome and protestations of joy from time to time amid the whirl of words i could hear a gentle and softly modulated voice which struck pleasantly upon my ear after the long weeks during which i had listened only to the rude dialect of the dalesmen for an hour i could hear the dialogue beneaththe high voice and the low with clatter of cup and clink of spoon until at last a light quick step passed my study door and i knew that my new fellowlodger had sought her room  on the morning after this incident i was up betimes as is my wont but i was surprised on glancing from my window to see that our new inmate was earlier still she was walking down the narrow pathway which zigzags over the fella tall woman slender her head sunk upon her breast her arms filled with a bristle of wild flowers which she had gathered in her morning rambles the white and pink of her dress and the touch of deep red ribbon in her broad drooping hat formed a pleasant dash of colour against the duntinted landscape she was some distance off when i first set eyes upon her yet i knew that this wandering woman could be none other than our arrival of last night for there was a grace and refinement in her bearing which marked her from the dwellers of the fells even as i watched she passed swiftly and lightly down the pathway and turning through the wicket gate at the further end of our cottage garden she seated herself upon the green bank which faced my window and strewing her flowers in front of her set herself to arrange them  as she sat there with the rising sun at her back and the glow of the morning spreading like an aureole around her stately and wellpoised head i could see that she was a woman of extraordinary personal beauty her face was spanish rather than english in its typeoval olive with black sparkling eyes and a sweetly sensitive mouth from under the broad straw hat two thick coils of blueblack hair curved down on either side of her graceful queenly neck i was surprised as i watched her to see that her shoes and skirt bore witness to a journey rather than to a mere morning ramble her light dress was stained wet and bedraggled while her boots were thick with the yellow soil of the fells her face too wore a weary expression and her young beauty seemed to be clouded over by the shadow of inward trouble even as i watched her she burst suddenly into wild weeping and throwing down her bundle of flowers ran swiftly into the house  distrait as i was and weary of the ways of the world i was conscious of a sudden pang of sympathy and grief as i looked upon the spasm of despair which seemed to convulse this strange and beautiful woman i bent to my books and yet my thoughts would ever turn to her proud clearcut face her weatherstained dress her drooping head and the sorrow which lay in each line and feature of her pensive face  mrs adams my landlady was wont to carry up my frugal breakfast yet it was very rarely that i allowed her to break the current of my thoughts or to draw my mind by her idle chatter from weightier things this morning however for once she found me in a listening mood and with little prompting proceeded to pour into my ears all that she knew of our beautiful visitor  miss eva cameron be her name sir she said but who she be or where she came fra i know little more than yoursel maybe it was the same reason that brought her to kirkbymalhouse as fetched you there yoursel sir  possibly said i ignoring the covert question but i should hardly have thought that kirkbymalhouse was a place which offered any great attractions to a young lady  heh sir she cried theres the wonder of it the leddy has just come fra france and how her folk come to learn of me is just a wonder a week ago up comes a man to my doora fine man sir and a gentleman as one could see with half an eye you are mrs adams says he i engage your rooms for miss cameron says he she will be here in a week says he and then off without a word of terms last night there comes the young leddy herselsoftspoken and downcast with a touch of the french in her speech but my sakes sir i must away and mak her some tea for shell feel lonesomelike poor lamb when she wakes under a strange roof   ii how i went forth to gaster fell  i was still engaged upon my breakfast when i heard the clatter of dishes and the landladys footfall as she passed toward her new lodgers room an instant afterward she had rushed down the passage and burst in upon me with uplifted hand and startled eyes lord a mercy sir she cried and asking your pardon for troubling you but im feared o the young leddy sir she is not in her room  why there she is said i standing up and glancing through the casement she has gone back for the flowers she left upon the bank  oh sir see her boots and her dress cried the landlady wildly i wish her mother was here siri do where she has been is more than i ken but her bed has not been lain on this night  she has felt restless doubtless and went for a walk though the hour was certainly a strange one  mrs adams pursed her lip and shook her head but then as she stood at the casement the girl beneath looked smilingly up at her and beckoned to her with a merry gesture to open the window  have you my tea there she asked in a rich clear voice with a touch of the mincing french accent  it is in your room miss  look at my boots mrs adams she cried thrusting them out from under her skirt these fells of yours are dreadful placeseffroyableone inch two inch never have i seen such mud my dress toovoilà  eh miss but you are in a pickle cried the landlady as she gazed down at the bedraggled gown but you must be main weary and heavy for sleep  no no she answered laughingly i care not for sleep what is sleep it is a little deathvoilà tout but for me to walk to run to breathe the airthat is to live i was not tired and so all night i have explored these fells of yorkshire  lord a mercy miss and where did you go asked mrs adams  she waved her hand round in a sweeping gesture which included the whole western horizon there she cried o comme elles sont tristes et sauvages ces collines but i have flowers here you will give me water will you not they will wither else she gathered her treasures in her lap and a moment later we heard her light springy footfall upon the stair  so she had been out all night this strange woman what motive could have taken her from her snug room on to the bleak windswept hills could it be merely the restlessness the love of adventure of a young girl or was there possibly some deeper meaning in this nocturnal journey  deep as were the mysteries which my studies had taught me to solve here was a human problem which for the moment at least was beyond my comprehension i had walked out on the moor in the forenoon and on my return as i topped the brow that overlooks the little town i saw my fellowlodger some little distance off amongst the gorse she had raised a light easel in front of her and with papered board laid across it was preparing to paint the magnificent landscape of rock and moor which stretched away in front of her as i watched her i saw that she was looking anxiously to right and left close by me a pool of water had formed in a hollow dipping the cup of my pocketflask into it i carried it across to her  miss cameron i believe said i i am your fellowlodger upperton is my name we must introduce ourselves in these wilds if we are not to be for ever strangers  oh then you live also with mrs adams she cried i had thought that there were none but peasants in this strange place  i am a visitor like yourself i answered i am a student and have come for quiet and repose which my studies demand  quiet indeed said she glancing round at the vast circle of silent moors with the one tiny line of grey cottages which sloped down beneath us  and yet not quiet enough i answered laughing for i have been forced to move further into the fells for the absolute peace which i require  have you then built a house upon the fells she asked arching her eyebrows  i have and hope within a few days to occupy it  ah but that is triste she cried and where is it then this house which you have built  it is over yonder i answered see that stream which lies like a silver band upon the distant moor it is the gaster beck and it runs through gaster fell  she started and turned upon me her great dark questioning eyes with a look in which surprise incredulity and something akin to horror seemed to be struggling for mastery  and you will live on the gaster fell she cried  so i have planned but what do you know of gaster fell miss cameron i asked i had thought that you were a stranger in these parts  indeed i have never been here before she answered but i have heard my brother talk of these yorkshire moors and if i mistake not i have heard him name this very one as the wildest and most savage of them all  very likely said i carelessly it is indeed a dreary place  then why live there she cried eagerly consider the loneliness the barrenness the want of all comfort and of all aid should aid be needed  aid what aid should be needed on gaster fell  she looked down and shrugged her shoulders sickness may come in all places said she if i were a man i do not think i would live alone on gaster fell  i have braved worse dangers than that said i laughing but i fear that your picture will be spoiled for the clouds are banking up and already i feel a few raindrops  indeed it was high time we were on our way to shelter for even as i spoke there came the sudden steady swish of the shower laughing merrily my companion threw her light shawl over her head and seizing picture and easel ran with the lithe grace of a young fawn down the furzeclad slope while i followed after with campstool and paintbox                                       it was the eve of my departure from kirkbymalhouse that we sat upon the green bank in the garden she with dark dreamy eyes looking sadly out over the sombre fells while i with a book upon my knee glanced covertly at her lovely profile and marvelled to myself how twenty years of life could have stamped so sad and wistful an expression upon it  you have read much i remarked at last women have opportunities now such as their mothers never knew have you ever thought of going furtherof seeking a course of college or even a learned profession  she smiled wearily at the thought  i have no aim no ambition she said my future is blackconfuseda chaos my life is like to one of these paths upon the fells you have seen them monsieur upperton they are smooth and straight and clear where they begin but soon they wind to left and wind to right and so mid rocks and crags until they lose themselves in some quagmire at brussels my path was straight but now mon dieu who is there can tell me where it leads  it might take no prophet to do that miss cameron quoth i with the fatherly manner which twoscore years may show toward one if i may read your life i would venture to say that you were destined to fulfil the lot of womento make some good man happy and to shed around in some wider circle the pleasure which your society has given me since first i knew you  i will never marry said she with a sharp decision which surprised and somewhat amused me  not marryand why  a strange look passed over her sensitive features and she plucked nervously at the grass on the bank beside her  i dare not said she in a voice that quivered with emotion  dare not  it is not for me i have other things to do that path of which i spoke is one which i must tread alone  but this is morbid said i why should your lot miss cameron be separated from that of my own sisters or the thousand other young ladies whom every season brings out into the world but perhaps it is that you have a fear and distrust of mankind marriage brings a risk as well as a happiness  the risk would be with the man who married me she cried and then in an instant as though she had said too much she sprang to her feet and drew her mantle round her the night air is chill mr upperton said she and so swept swiftly away leaving me to muse over the strange words which had fallen from her lips  clearly it was time that i should go i set my teeth and vowed that another day should not have passed before i should have snapped this newly formed tie and sought the lonely retreat which awaited me upon the moors breakfast was hardly over in the morning before a peasant dragged up to the door the rude handcart which was to convey my few personal belongings to my new dwelling my fellowlodger had kept her room and steeled as my mind was against her influence i was yet conscious of a little throb of disappointment that she should allow me to depart without a word of farewell my handcart with its load of books had already started and i having shaken hands with mrs adams was about to follow it when there was a quick scurry of feet on the stair and there she was beside me all panting with her own haste  then you goyou really go said she  my studies call me  and to gaster fell she asked  yes to the cottage which i have built there  and you will live alone there  with my hundred companions who lie in that cart  ah books she cried with a pretty shrug of her graceful shoulders but you will make me a promise  what is it i asked in surprise  it is a small thing you will not refuse me  you have but to ask it  she bent forward her beautiful face with an expression of the most intense earnestness you will bolt your door at night said she and was gone ere i could say a word in answer to her extraordinary request  it was a strange thing for me to find myself at last duly installed in my lonely dwelling for me now the horizon was bounded by the barren circle of wiry unprofitable grass patched over with furze bushes and scarred by the profusion of natures gaunt and granite ribs a duller wearier waste i have never seen but its dulness was its very charm  and yet the very first night which i spent at gaster fell there came a strange incident to lead my thoughts back once more to the world which i had left behind me  it had been a sullen and sultry evening with great livid cloudbanks mustering in the west as the night wore on the air within my little cabin became closer and more oppressive a weight seemed to rest upon my brow and my chest from far away the low rumble of thunder came moaning over the moor unable to sleep i dressed and standing at my cottage door looked on the black solitude which surrounded me  taking the narrow sheep path which ran by this stream i strolled along it for some hundred yards and had turned to retrace my steps when the moon was finally buried beneath an inkblack cloud and the darkness deepened so suddenly that i could see neither the path at my feet the stream upon my right nor the rocks upon my left i was standing groping about in the thick gloom when there came a crash of thunder with a flash of lightning which lighted up the whole vast fell so that every bush and rock stood out clear and hard in the vivid light it was but for an instant and yet that momentary view struck a thrill of fear and astonishment through me for in my very path not twenty yards before me there stood a woman the livid light beating upon her face and showing up every detail of her dress and features  there was no mistaking those dark eyes that tall graceful figure it was sheeva cameron the woman whom i thought i had for ever left for an instant i stood petrified marvelling whether this could indeed be she or whether it was some figment conjured up by my excited brain then i ran swiftly forward in the direction where i had seen her calling loudly upon her but without reply again i called and again no answer came back save the melancholy wail of the owl a second flash illuminated the landscape and the moon burst out from behind its cloud but i could not though i climbed upon a knoll which overlooked the whole moor see any sign of this strange midnight wanderer for an hour or more i traversed the fell and at last found myself back at my little cabin still uncertain as to whether it had been a woman or a shadow upon which i gazed   iii of the grey cottage in the glen  it was either on the fourth or the fifth day after i had taken possession of my cottage that i was astonished to hear footsteps upon the grass outside quickly followed by a crack as from a stick upon the door the explosion of an infernal machine would hardly have surprised or discomfited me more i had hoped to have shaken off all intrusion for ever yet here was somebody beating at my door with as little ceremony as if it had been a village alehouse hot with anger i flung down my book and withdrew the bolt just as my visitor had raised his stick to renew his rough application for admittance he was a tall powerful man tawnybearded and deepchested clad in a loosefitting suit of tweed cut for comfort rather than elegance as he stood in the shimmering sunlight i took in every feature of his face the large fleshy nose the steady blue eyes with their thick thatch of overhanging brows the broad forehead all knitted and lined with furrows which were strangely at variance with his youthful bearing in spite of his weatherstained felt hat and the coloured handkerchief slung round his muscular brown neck i could see at a glance he was a man of breeding and education i had been prepared for some wandering shepherd or uncouth tramp but this apparition fairly disconcerted me  you look astonished said he with a smile did you think then that you were the only man in the world with a taste for solitude you see that there are other hermits in the wilderness besides yourself  do you mean to say that you live here i asked in no conciliatory voice  up yonder he answered tossing his head backward i thought as we were neighbours mr upperton that i could not do less than look in and see if i could assist you in any way  thank you i said coldly standing with my hand upon the latch of the door i am a man of simple tastes and you can do nothing for me you have the advantage of me in knowing my name  he appeared to be chilled by my ungracious manner  i learned it from the masons who were at work here he said as for me i am a surgeon the surgeon of gaster fell that is the name i have gone by in these parts and it serves as well as another  not much room for practice here i observed  not a soul except yourself for miles on either side  you appear to have had need of some assistance yourself i remarked glancing at a broad white splash as from the recent action of some powerful acid upon his sunburnt cheek  that is nothing he answered curtly turning his face half round to hide the mark i must get back for i have a companion who is waiting for me if i can ever do anything for you pray let me know you have only to follow the beck upward for a mile or so to find my place have you a bolt on the inside of your door  yes i answered rather startled at this question  keep it bolted then he said the fell is a strange place you never know who may be about it is as well to be on the safe side goodbye he raised his hat turned on his heel and lounged away along the bank of the little stream  i was still standing with my hand upon the latch gazing after my unexpected visitor when i became aware of yet another dweller in the wilderness some distance along the path which the stranger was taking there lay a great grey boulder and leaning against this was a small wizened man who stood erect as the other approached and advanced to meet him the two talked for a minute or more the taller man nodding his head frequently in my direction as though describing what had passed between us then they walked on together and disappeared in a dip of the fell presently i saw them ascending once more some rising ground farther on my acquaintance had thrown his arm round his elderly friend either from affection or from a desire to aid him up the steep incline the square burly figure and its shrivelled meagre companion stood out against the skyline and turning their faces they looked back at me at the sight i slammed the door lest they should be encouraged to return but when i peeped from the window some minutes afterward i perceived that they were gone  all day i bent over the egyptian papyrus upon which i was engaged but neither the subtle reasonings of the ancient philosopher of memphis nor the mystic meaning which lay in his pages could raise my mind from the things of earth evening was drawing in before i threw my work aside in despair my heart was bitter against this man for his intrusion standing by the beck which purled past the door of my cabin i cooled my heated brow and thought the matter over clearly it was the small mystery hanging over these neighbours of mine which had caused my mind to run so persistently on them that cleared up they would no longer cause an obstacle to my studies what was to hinder me then from walking in the direction of their dwelling and observing for myself without permitting them to suspect my presence what manner of men they might be doubtless their mode of life would be found to admit of some simple and prosaic explanation in any case the evening was fine and a walk would be bracing for mind and body lighting my pipe i set off over the moors in the direction which they had taken  about halfway down a wild glen there stood a small clump of gnarled and stunted oak trees from behind these a thin dark column of smoke rose into the still evening air clearly this marked the position of my neighbours house trending away to the left i was able to gain the shelter of a line of rocks and so reach a spot from which i could command a view of the building without exposing myself to any risk of being observed it was a small slatecovered cottage hardly larger than the boulders among which it lay like my own cabin it showed signs of having been constructed for the use of some shepherd but unlike mine no pains had been taken by the tenants to improve and enlarge it two little peeping windows a cracked and weatherbeaten door and a discoloured barrel for catching the rain water were the only external objects from which i might draw deductions as to the dwellers within yet even in these there was food for thought for as i drew nearer still concealing myself behind the ridge i saw that thick bars of iron covered the windows while the old door was slashed and plated with the same metal these strange precautions together with the wild surroundings and unbroken solitude gave an indescribably ill omen and fearsome character to the solitary building thrusting my pipe into my pocket i crawled upon my hands and knees through the gorse and ferns until i was within a hundred yards of my neighbours door there finding that i could not approach nearer without fear of detection i crouched down and set myself to watch  i had hardly settled into my hiding place when the door of the cottage swung open and the man who had introduced himself to me as the surgeon of gaster fell came out bareheaded with a spade in his hands in front of the door there was a small cultivated patch containing potatoes peas and other forms of green stuff and here he proceeded to busy himself trimming weeding and arranging singing the while in a powerful though not very musical voice he was all engrossed in his work with his back to the cottage when there emerged from the halfopen door the same attenuated creature whom i had seen in the morning i could perceive now that he was a man of sixty wrinkled bent and feeble with sparse grizzled hair and long colourless face with a cringing sidelong gait he shuffled toward his companion who was unconscious of his approach until he was close upon him his light footfall or his breathing may have finally given notice of his proximity for the worker sprang round and faced him each made a quick step toward the other as though in greeting and theneven now i feel the horror of the instantthe tall man rushed upon and knocked his companion to the earth then whipping up his body ran with great speed over the intervening ground and disappeared with his burden into the house  case hardened as i was by my varied life the suddenness and violence of the thing made me shudder the mans age his feeble frame his humble and deprecating manner all cried shame against the deed so hot was my anger that i was on the point of striding up to the cabin unarmed as i was when the sound of voices from within showed me that the victim had recovered the sun had sunk beneath the horizon and all was grey save a red feather in the cap of pennigent secure in the failing light i approached near and strained my ears to catch what was passing i could hear the high querulous voice of the elder man and the deep rough monotone of his assailant mixed with a strange metallic jangling and clanking presently the surgeon came out locked the door behind him and stamped up and down in the twilight pulling at his hair and brandishing his arms like a man demented then he set off walking rapidly up the valley and i soon lost sight of him among the rocks  when his footsteps had died away in the distance i drew nearer to the cottage the prisoner within was still pouring forth a stream of words and moaning from time to time like a man in pain these words resolved themselves as i approached into prayersshrill voluble prayers pattered forth with the intense earnestness of one who sees impending and imminent danger there was to me something inexpressibly awesome in this gush of solemn entreaty from the lonely sufferer meant for no human ear and jarring upon the silence of the night i was still pondering whether i should mix myself in the affair or not when i heard in the distance the sound of the surgeons returning footfall at that i drew myself up quickly by the iron bars and glanced in through the diamondpaned window the interior of the cottage was lighted up by a lurid glow coming from what i afterward discovered to be a chemical furnace by its rich light i could distinguish a great litter of retorts test tubes and condensers which sparkled over the table and threw strange grotesque shadows on the wall on the further side of the room was a wooden framework resembling a hencoop and in this still absorbed in prayer knelt the man whose voice i heard the red glow beating upon his upturned face made it stand out from the shadow like a painting from rembrandt showing up every wrinkle upon the parchmentlike skin i had but time for a fleeting glance then dropping from the window i made off through the rocks and the heather nor slackened my pace until i found myself back in my cabin once more there i threw myself upon my couch more disturbed and shaken than i had ever thought to feel again  such doubts as i might have had as to whether i had indeed seen my former fellowlodger upon the night of the thunderstorm were resolved the next morning strolling along down the path which led to the fell i saw in one spot where the ground was soft the impressions of a footthe small dainty foot of a wellbooted woman that tiny heel and high instep could have belonged to none other than my companion of kirkbymalhouse i followed her trail for some distance till it still pointed so far as i could discern it to the lonely and illomened cottage what power could there be to draw this tender girl through wind and rain and darkness across the fearsome moors to that strange rendezvous  i have said that a little beck flowed down the valley and past my very door a week or so after the doings which i have described i was seated by my window when i perceived something white drifting slowly down the stream my first thought was that it was a drowning sheep but picking up my stick i strolled to the bank and hooked it ashore on examination it prove to be a large sheet torn and tattered with the initials j c in the corner what gave it its sinister significance however was that from hem to hem it was all dabbled and discoloured  shutting the door of my cabin i set off up the glen in the direction of the surgeons cabin i had not gone far before i perceived the very man himself he was walking rapidly along the hillside beating the furze bushes with a cudgel and bellowing like a madman indeed at the sight of him the doubts as to his sanity which had risen in my mind were strengthened and confirmed  as he approached i noticed that his left arm was suspended in a sling on perceiving me he stood irresolute as though uncertain whether to come over to me or not i had no desire for an interview with him however so i hurried past him on which he continued on his way still shouting and striking about with his club when he had disappeared over the fells i made my way down to his cottage determined to find some clue to what occurred i was surprised on reaching it to find the ironplated door flung wide open the ground immediately outside it was marked with the signs of a struggle the chemical apparatus within and the furniture were all dashed about and shattered most suggestive of all the sinister wooden cage was stained with bloodmarks and its unfortunate occupant had disappeared my heart was heavy for the little man for i was assured i should never see him in this world more  there was nothing in the cabin to throw any light upon the identity of my neighbours the room was stuffed with chemical instruments in one corner a small bookcase contained a choice selection of works of science in another was a pile of geological specimens collected from the limestone  i caught no glimpse of the surgeon upon my homeward journey but when i reached my cottage i was astonished and indignant to find that somebody had entered it in my absence boxes had been pulled out from under the bed the curtains disarranged the chairs drawn out from the wall even my study had not been safe from this rough intruder for the prints of a heavy boot were plainly visible on the ebonyblack carpet   iv of the man who came in the night  the night set in gusty and tempestuous and the moon was all girt with ragged clouds the wind blew in melancholy gusts sobbing and sighing over the moor and setting all the gorse bushes agroaning from time to time a little sputter of rain pattered up against the windowpane i sat until near midnight glancing over the fragment on immortality by iamblichus the alexandrian platonist of whom the emperor julian said that he was posterior to plato in time but not in genius at last shutting up my book i opened my door and took a last look at the dreary fell and still more dreary sky as i protruded my head a swoop of wind caught me and sent the red ashes of my pipe sparkling and dancing through the darkness at the same moment the moon shone brilliantly out from between two clouds and i saw sitting on the hillside not two hundred yards from my door the man who called himself the surgeon of gaster fell he was squatted among the heather his elbows upon his knees and his chin resting upon his hands as motionless as a stone with his gaze fixed steadily upon the door of my dwelling  at the sight of this illomened sentinel a chill of horror and of fear shot through me for his gloomy and mysterious associations had cast a glamour round the man and the hour and place were in keeping with his sinister presence in a moment however a manly glow of resentment and selfconfidence drove this petty emotion from my mind and i strode fearlessly in his direction he rose as i approached and faced me with the moon shining on his grave bearded face and glittering on his eyeballs what is the meaning of this i cried as i came upon him what right have you to play the spy on me  i could see the flush of anger rise on his face your stay in the country has made you forget your manners he said the moor is free to all  you will say next that my house is free to all i said hotly you have had the impertinence to ransack it in my absence this afternoon  he started and his features showed the most intense excitement i swear to you that i had no hand in it he cried i have never set foot in your house in my life oh sir sir if you will but believe me there is a danger hanging over you and you would do well to be careful  i have had enough of you i said i saw that cowardly blow you struck when you thought no human eye rested upon you i have been to your cottage too and know all that it has to tell if there is a law in england you shall hang for what you have done as to me i am an old soldier sir and i am armed i shall not fasten my door but if you or any other villain attempt to cross my threshold it shall be at your own risk with these words i swung round upon my heel and strode into my cabin  for two days the wind freshened and increased with constant squalls of rain until on the third night the most furious storm was raging which i can ever recollect in england i felt that it was positively useless to go to bed nor could i concentrate my mind sufficiently to read a book i turned my lamp half down to moderate the glare and leaning back in my chair i gave myself up to reverie i must have lost all perception of time for i have no recollection how long i sat there on the borderland betwixt thought and slumber at last about 3 or possibly 4 oclock i came to myself with a startnot only came to myself but with every sense and nerve upon the strain looking round my chamber in the dim light i could not see anything to justify my sudden trepidation the homely room the rainblurred window and the rude wooden door were all as they had been i had begun to persuade myself that some halfformed dream had sent that vague thrill through my nerves when in a moment i became conscious of what it was it was a soundthe sound of a human step outside my solitary cottage  amid the thunder and the rain and the wind i could hear ita dull stealthy footfall now on the grass now on the stonesoccasionally stopping entirely then resumed and ever drawing nearer i sat breathlessly listening to the eerie sound it had stopped now at my very door and was replaced by a panting and gasping as of one who has travelled fast and far  by the flickering light of the expiring lamp i could see that the latch of my door was twitching as though a gentle pressure was exerted on it from without slowly slowly it rose until it was free of the catch and then there was a pause of a quarter minute or more while i still sat silent with dilated eyes and drawn sabre then very slowly the door began to revolve upon its hinges and the keen air of the night came whistling through the slit very cautiously it was pushed open so that never a sound came from the rusty hinges as the aperture enlarged i became aware of a dark shadowy figure upon my threshold and of a pale face that looked in at me the features were human but the eyes were not they seemed to burn through the darkness with a greenish brilliancy of their own and in their baleful shifty glare i was conscious of the very spirit of murder springing from my chair i had raised my naked sword when with a wild shouting a second figure dashed up to my door at its approach my shadowy visitant uttered a shrill cry and fled away across the fells yelping like a beaten hound  tingling with my recent fear i stood at my door peering through the night with the discordant cry of the fugitives still ringing in my ears at that moment a vivid flash of lightning illuminated the whole landscape and made it as clear as day by its light i saw far away upon the hillside two dark figures pursuing each other with extreme rapidity across the fells even at that distance the contrast between them forbid all doubt as to their identity the first was the small elderly man whom i had supposed to be dead the second was my neighbour the surgeon for an instant they stood out clear and hard in the unearthly light in the next the darkness had closed over them and they were gone as i turned to reenter my chamber my foot rattled against something on my threshold stooping i found it was a straight knife fashioned entirely of lead and so soft and brittle that it was a strange choice for a weapon to render it more harmless the top had been cut square off the edge however had been assiduously sharpened against a stone as was evident from the markings upon it so that it was still a dangerous implement in the grasp of a determined man  and what was the meaning of it all you ask many a drama which i have come across in my wandering life some as strange and as striking as this one has lacked the ultimate explanation which you demand fate is a grand weaver of tales but she ends them as a rule in defiance of all artistic laws and with an unbecoming want of regard for literary propriety as it happens however i have a letter before me as i write which i may add without comment and which will clear all that may remain dark       kirkby lunatic asylum       september 4th 1885       siri am deeply conscious that some apology and explanation      is due to you for the very startling and in your eyes      mysterious events which have recently occurred and which have      so seriously interfered with the retired existence which you      desire to lead i should have called upon you on the morning      after the recapture of my father but my knowledge of your      dislike to visitors and also ofyou will excuse my saying      ityour very violent temper led me to think that it was      better to communicate with you by letter       my poor father was a hardworking general practitioner in      birmingham where his name is still remembered and respected      about ten years ago he began to show signs of mental      aberration which we were inclined to put down to overwork and      the effects of a sunstroke feeling my own incompetence to      pronounce upon a case of such importance i at once sought the      highest advice in birmingham and london among others we      consulted the eminent alienist mr fraser brown who      pronounced my fathers case to be intermittent in its nature      but dangerous during the paroxysms it may take a homicidal      or it may take a religious turn he said or it may prove to      be a mixture of both for months he may be as well as you or i      and then in a moment he may break out you will incur a great      responsibility if you leave him without supervision       i need say no more sir you will understand the terrible task      which has fallen upon my poor sister and me in endeavoring to      save my father from the asylum which in his sane moments filled      him with horror i can only regret that your peace has been      disturbed by our misfortunes and i offer you in my sisters      name and my own our apologies       yours truly       j cameron     iii  borrowed scenes       it cannot be done people really would not stand it i know      because i have triedextract from an unpublished paper upon      george borrow and his writings   yes i tried and my experience may interest other people you must imagine then that i am soaked in george borrow especially in his lavengro and his romany rye that i have modelled both my thoughts my speech and my style very carefully upon those of the master and that finally i set forth one summer day actually to lead the life of which i had read behold me then upon the country road which leads from the railwaystation to the sussex village of swinehurst  as i walked i entertained myself by recollections of the founders of sussex of cerdic that mighty searover and of ella his son said by the bard to be taller by the length of a spearhead than the tallest of his fellows i mentioned the matter twice to peasants whom i met upon the road one a tallish man with a freckled face sidled past me and ran swiftly towards the station the other a smaller and older man stood entranced while i recited to him that passage of the saxon chronicle which begins then came leija with longships fortyfour and the fyrd went out against him i was pointing out to him that the chronicle had been written partly by the monks of saint albans and afterwards by those of peterborough but the fellow sprang suddenly over a gate and disappeared  the village of swinehurst is a straggling line of halftimbered houses of the early english pattern one of these houses stood as i observed somewhat taller than the rest and seeing by its appearance and by the sign which hung before it that it was the village inn i approached it for indeed i had not broken my fast since i had left london a stoutish man five foot eight perhaps in height with black coat and trousers of a greyish shade stood outside and to him i talked in the fashion of the master  why a rose and why a crown i asked as i pointed upwards  he looked at me in a strange manner the mans whole appearance was strange why not he answered and shrank a little backwards  the sign of a king said i  surely said he what else should we understand from a crown  and which king i asked  you will excuse me said he and tried to pass  which king i repeated  how should i know he asked  you should know by the rose said i which is the symbol of that tudoraptudor who coming from the mountains of wales yet seated his posterity upon the english throne tudor i continued getting between the stranger and the door of the inn through which he appeared to be desirous of passing was of the same blood as owen glendower the famous chieftain who is by no means to be confused with owen gwynedd the father of madoc of the sea of whom the bard made the famous cnylyn which runs in the welsh as follows  i was about to repeat the famous stanza of dafyddapgwilyn when the man who had looked very fixedly and strangely at me as i spoke pushed past me and entered the inn truly said i aloud it is surely swinehurst to which i have come since the same means the grove of the hogs so saying i followed the fellow into the bar parlour where i perceived him seated in a corner with a large chair in front of him four persons of various degrees were drinking beer at a central table whilst a small man of active build in a black shiny suit which seemed to have seen much service stood before the empty fireplace him i took to be the landlord and i asked him what i should have for my dinner  he smiled and said that he could not tell  but surely my friend said i you can tell me what is ready  even that i cannot do he answered but i doubt not that the landlord can inform us on this he rang the bell and a fellow answered to whom i put the same question  what would you have he asked  i thought of the master and i ordered a cold leg of pork to be washed down with tea and beer  did you say tea and beer asked the landlord  i did  for twentyfive years have i been in business said the landlord and never before have i been asked for tea and beer  the gentleman is joking said the man with the shining coat  or else said the elderly man in the corner  or what sir i asked  nothing said henothing there was something very strange in this man in the cornerhim to whom i had spoken of dafyddapgwilyn  then you are joking said the landlord  i asked him if he had read the works of my master george borrow he said that he had not i told him that in those five volumes he would not from cover to cover find one trace of any sort of a joke he would also find that my master drank tea and beer together now it happens that about tea i have read nothing either in the sagas or in the bardic cnylynions but whilst the landlord had departed to prepare my meal i recited to the company those icelandic stanzas which praise the beer of gunnar the longhaired son of harold the bear then lest the language should be unknown to some of them i recited my own translation ending with the line      if the beer be small then let the mug be large  i then asked the company whether they went to church or to chapel the question surprised them and especially the strange man in the corner upon whom i now fixed my eye i had read his secret and as i looked at him he tried to shrink behind the clockcase  the church or the chapel i asked him  the church he gasped  which church i asked  he shrank farther behind the clock i have never been so questioned he cried  i showed him that i knew his secret rome was not built in a day said i  he he he cried then as i turned away he put his head from behind the clockcase and tapped his forehead with his forefinger so also did the man with the shiny coat who stood before the empty fireplace  having eaten the cold leg of porkwhere is there a better dish save only boiled mutton with capersand having drunk both the tea and the beer i told the company that such a meal had been called to box harry by the master who had observed it to be in great favour with commercial gentlemen out of liverpool with this information and a stanza or two from lopez de vega i left the inn of the rose and crown behind me having first paid my reckoning at the door the landlord asked me for my name and address  and why i asked  lest there should be inquiry for you said the landlord  but why should they enquire for me  ah who knows said the landlord musing and so i left him at the door of the inn of the rose and crown whence came i observed a great tumult of laughter assuredly thought i rome was not built in a day  having walked down the main street of swinehurst which as i have observed consists of halftimbered buildings in the ancient style i came out upon the country road and proceeded to look for those wayside adventures which are according to the master as thick as blackberries for those who seek them upon an english highway i had already received some boxing lessons before leaving london so it seemed to me that if i should chance to meet some traveller whose size and age seemed such as to encourage the venture i would ask him to strip off his coat and settle any differences which we could find in the old english fashion i waited therefore by a stile for any one who should chance to pass and it was while i stood there that the screaming horror came upon me even as it came upon the master in the dingle i gripped the bar of the stile which was of good british oak oh who can tell the terrors of the screaming horror that was what i thought as i grasped the oaken bar of the stile was it the beeror was it the tea or was it that the landlord was right and that other the man with the black shiny coat he who had answered the sign of the strange man in the corner but the master drank tea with beer yes but the master also had the screaming horror all this i thought as i grasped the bar of british oak which was the top of the stile for half an hour the horror was upon me then it passed and i was left feeling very weak and still grasping the oaken bar  i had not moved from the stile where i had been seized by the screaming horror when i heard the sound of steps behind me and turning round i perceived that a pathway led across the field upon the farther side of the stile a woman was coming towards me along this pathway and it was evident to me that she was one of those gipsy rias of whom the master has said so much looking beyond her i could see the smoke of a fire from a small dingle which showed where her tribe were camping the woman herself was of a moderate height neither tall nor short with a face which was much sunburned and freckled i must confess that she was not beautiful but i do not think that any one save the master has found very beautiful women walking about upon the highroads of england such as she was i must make the best of her and well i knew how to address her for many times had i admired the mixture of politeness and audacity which should be used in such a case therefore when the woman had come to the stile i held out my hand and helped her over  what says the spanish poet calderon said i i doubt not that you have read the couplet which has been thus englished      oh maiden may i humbly pray     that i may help you on your way  the woman blushed but said nothing  where i asked are the romany chals and the romany chis  she turned her head away and was silent  though i am a gorgio said i i know something of the romany lil and to prove it i sang the stanza      coliko coliko saulo wer     apopli to the farming ker     will wel and mang him mullo     will wel and mang his truppo  the girl laughed but said nothing it appeared to me from her appearance that she might be one of those who make a living at telling fortunes or dukkering as the master calls it at racecourses and other gatherings of the sort  do you dukker i asked  she slapped me on the arm well you are a pot of ginger said she  i was pleased at the slap for it put me in mind of the peerless belle you can use long melford said i an expression which with the master meant fighting  get along with your sauce said she and struck me again  you are a very fine young woman said i and remind me of grunelda the daughter of hjalmar who stole the golden bowl from the king of the islands  she seemed annoyed at this you keep a civil tongue young man said she  i meant no harm belle i was but comparing you to one of whom the saga says her eyes were like the shine of sun upon icebergs  this seemed to please her for she smiled my name aint belle she said at last  what is your name  henrietta  the name of a queen i said aloud  go on said the girl  of charless queen said i of whom waller the poet for the english also have their poets though in this respect far inferior to the basquesof whom i say waller the poet said      that she was queen was the creators act     belated man could but endorse the fact  i say cried the girl how you do go on  so now said i since i have shown you that you are a queen you will surely give me a choomerthis being a kiss in romany talk  ill give you one on the earhole she cried  then i will wrestle with you said i if you should chance to put me down i will do penance by teaching you the armenian alphabetthe very word alphabet as you will perceive shows us that our letters came from greece if on the other hand i should chance to put you down you will give me a choomer  i had got so far and she was climbing the stile with some pretence of getting away from me when there came a van along the road belonging as i discovered to a baker in swinehurst the horse which was of a brown colour was such as is bred in the new forest being somewhat under fifteen hands and of a hairy illkempt variety as i know less than the master about horses i will say no more of this horse save to repeat that its colour was brownnor indeed had the horse nor the horses colour anything to do with my narrative i might add however that it could either be taken as a small horse or as a large pony being somewhat tall for the one but undersized for the other i have now said enough about this horse which has nothing to do with my story and i will turn my attention to the driver  this was a man with a broad florid face and brown sidewhiskers he was of a stout build and had rounded shoulders with a small mole of a reddish colour over his left eyebrow his jacket was of velveteen and he had large ironshod boots which were perched upon the splashboard in front of him he pulled up the van as he came up to the stile near which i was standing with the maiden who had come from the dingle and in a civil fashion he asked me if i could oblige him with a light for his pipe then as i drew a matchbox from my pocket he threw his reins over the splashboard and removing his large ironshod boots he descended on to the road he was a burly man but inclined to fat and scant of breath it seemed to me that it was a chance for one of those wayside boxing adventures which were so common in the olden times it was my intention that i should fight the man and that the maiden from the dingle standing by me should tell me when to use my right or my left as the case might be picking me up also in case i should be so unfortunate as to be knocked down by the man with the ironshod boots and the small mole of a reddish colour over his left eyebrow  do you use long melford i asked  he looked at me in some surprise and said that any mixture was good enough for him  by long melford said i i do not mean as you seem to think some form of tobacco but i mean that art and science of boxing which was held in such high esteem by our ancestors that some famous professors of it such as the great gully have been elected to the highest offices of the state there were men of the highest character amongst the bruisers of england of whom i would particularly mention tom of hereford better known as tom spring though his fathers name as i have been given to understand was winter this however has nothing to do with the matter in hand which is that you must fight me  the man with the florid face seemed very much surprised at my words so that i cannot think that adventures of this sort were as common as i had been led by the master to expect  fight said he what about  it is a good old english custom said i by which we may determine which is the better man  ive nothing against you said he  nor i against you i answered so that we will fight for love which was an expression much used in olden days it is narrated by harold sygvynson that among the danes it was usual to do so even with battleaxes as is told in his second set of runes therefore you will take off your coat and fight as i spoke i stripped off my own  the mans face was less florid than before im not going to fight said he  indeed you are i answered and this young woman will doubtless do you the service to hold your coat  youre clean balmy said henrietta  besides said i if you will not fight me for love perhaps you will fight me for this and i held out a sovereign will you hold his coat i said to henrietta  ill hold the thick un said she  no you dont said the man and put the sovereign into the pocket of his trousers which were of a corduroy material now said he what am i do to earn this  fight said i  how do you do it he asked  put up your hands i answered  he put them up as i had said and stood there in a sheepish manner with no idea of anything further it seemed to me that if i could make him angry he would do better so i knocked off his hat which was black and hard of the kind which is called billycock  heh guvnor he cried what are you up to  that was to make you angry said i  well i am angry said he  then here is your hat said i and afterwards we shall fight  i turned as i spoke to pick up his hat which had rolled behind where i was standing as i stooped to reach it i received such a blow that i could neither rise erect nor yet sit down this blow which i received as i stooped for his billycock hat was not from his fist but from his ironshod boot the same which i had observed upon the splashboard being unable either to rise erect or yet to sit down i leaned upon the oaken bar of the stile and groaned loudly on account of the pain of the blow which i had received even the screaming horror had given me less pain than this blow from the ironshod boot when at last i was able to stand erect i found that the floridfaced man had driven away with his cart which could no longer be seen the maiden from the dingle was standing at the other side of the stile and a ragged man was running across the field from the direction of the fire  why did you not warn me henrietta i asked  i hadnt time said she why were you such a chump as to turn your back on him like that  the ragged man had reached us where i stood talking to henrietta by the stile i will not try to write his conversation as he said it because i have observed that the master never condescends to dialect but prefers by a word introduced here and there to show the fashion of a mans speech i will only say that the man from the dingle spoke as did the anglosaxons who were wont as is clearly shown by the venerable bede to call their leaders enjist and orsa two words which in their proper meaning signify a horse and a mare  what did he hit you for asked the man from the dingle he was exceedingly ragged with a powerful frame a lean brown face and an oaken cudgel in his hand his voice was very hoarse and rough as is the case with those who live in the open air the bloke hit you said he what did the bloke hit you for  he asked him to said henrietta  asked him toasked him what  why he asked him to hit him gave him a thick un to do it  the ragged man seemed surprised see here guvnor said he if youre collectin i could let you have one halfprice  he took me unawares said i  what else would the bloke do when you bashed his hat said the maiden from the dingle  by this time i was able to straighten myself up by the aid of the oaken bar which formed the top of the stile having quoted a few lines of the chinese poet lotunan to the effect that however hard a knock might be it might always conceivably be harder i looked about for my coat but could by no means find it  henrietta i said what have you done with my coat  look here guvnor said the man from the dingle not so much henrietta if its the same to you this womans my wife who are you to call her henrietta  i assured the man from the dingle that i had meant no disrespect to his wife i had thought she was a mort said i but the ria of a romany chal is always sacred to me  clean balmy said the woman  some other day said i i may visit you in your camp in the dingle and read you the masters book about the romanys  whats romanys asked the man  myself romanys are gipsies  the man we aint gipsies  myself what are you then  the man we are hoppers  myself to henrietta then how did you understand all i have said to you about gipsies  henrietta i didnt  i again asked for my coat but it was clear now that before offering to fight the floridfaced man with the mole over his left eyebrow i must have hung my coat upon the splashboard of his van i therefore recited a verse from ferideddinatar the persian poet which signifies that it is more important to preserve your skin than your clothes and bidding farewell to the man from the dingle and his wife i returned into the old english village of swinehurst where i was able to buy a secondhand coat which enabled me to make my way to the station where i should start for london i could not but remark with some surprise that i was followed to the station by many of the villagers together with the man with the shiny coat and that other the strange man he who had slunk behind the clockcase from time to time i turned and approached them hoping to fall into conversation with them but as i did so they would break and hasten down the road only the village constable came on and he walked by my side and listened while i told him the history of hunyadi janos and the events which occurred during the wars between that hero known also as corvinus or the crowlike and mahommed the second he who captured constantinople better known as byzantium before the christian epoch together with the constable i entered the station and seating myself in a carriage i took paper from my pocket and i began to write upon the paper all that had occurred to me in order that i might show that it was not easy in these days to follow the example of the master as i wrote i heard the constable talk to the stationmaster a stout middlesized man with a red necktie and tell him of my own adventures in the old english village of swinehurst  he is a gentleman too said the constable and i doubt not that he lives in a big house in london town  a very big house if every man had his rights said the stationmaster and waving his hand he signalled that the train should proceed     iv  the man from archangel   on the fourth day of march in the year 1867 i being at that time in my fiveandtwentieth year i wrote down the following words in my notebookthe result of much mental perturbation and conflict  the solar system amidst a countless number of other systems as large as itself rolls ever silently through space in the direction of the constellation of hercules the great spheres of which it is composed spin and spin through the eternal void ceaselessly and noiselessly of these one of the smallest and most insignificant is that conglomeration of solid and of liquid particles which we have named the earth it whirls onwards now as it has done before my birth and will do after my deatha revolving mystery coming none know whence and going none know whither upon the outer crust of this moving mass crawl many mites of whom i john mvittie am one helpless impotent being dragged aimlessly through space yet such is the state of things amongst us that the little energy and glimmering of reason which i possess is entirely taken up with the labours which are necessary in order to procure certain metallic discs wherewith i may purchase the chemical elements necessary to build up my everwasting tissues and keep a roof over me to shelter me from the inclemency of the weather i thus have no thought to expend upon the vital questions which surround me on every side yet miserable entity as i am i can still at times feel some degree of happiness and am evensave the markpuffed up occasionally with a sense of my own importance  these words as i have said i wrote down in my notebook and they reflected accurately the thoughts which i found rooted far down in my soul ever present and unaffected by the passing emotions of the hour at last however came a time when my uncle mvittie of glencairn diedthe same who was at one time chairman of committees of the house of commons he divided his great wealth among his many nephews and i found myself with sufficient to provide amply for my wants during the remainder of my life and became at the same time the owner of a bleak tract of land upon the coast of caithness which i think the old man must have bestowed upon me in derision for it was sandy and valueless and he had ever a grim sense of humour up to this time i had been an attorney in a midland town in england now i saw that i could put my thoughts into effect and leaving all petty and sordid aims could elevate my mind by the study of the secrets of nature my departure from my english home was somewhat accelerated by the fact that i had nearly slain a man in a quarrel for my temper was fiery and i was apt to forget my own strength when enraged there was no legal action taken in the matter but the papers yelped at me and folk looked askance when i met them it ended by my cursing them and their vile smokepolluted town and hurrying to my northern possession where i might at last find peace and an opportunity for solitary study and contemplation i borrowed from my capital before i went and so was able to take with me a choice collection of the most modern philosophical instruments and books together with chemicals and such other things as i might need in my retirement  the land which i had inherited was a narrow strip consisting mostly of sand and extending for rather over two miles round the coast of mansie bay in caithness upon this strip there had been a rambling greystone buildingwhen erected or wherefore none could tell meand this i had repaired so that it made a dwelling quite good enough for one of my simple tastes one room was my laboratory another my sittingroom and in a third just under the sloping roof i slung the hammock in which i always slept there were three other rooms but i left them vacant except one which was given over to the old crone who kept house for me save the youngs and the mleods who were fisherfolk living round at the other side of fergus ness there were no other people for many miles in each direction in front of the house was the great bay behind it were two long barren hills capped by other loftier ones beyond there was a glen between the hills and when the wind was from the land it used to sweep down this with a melancholy sough and whisper among the branches of the firtrees beneath my attic window  i dislike my fellowmortals justice compels me to add that they appear for the most part to dislike me i hate their little crawling ways their conventionalities their deceits their narrow rights and wrongs they take offence at my brusque outspokenness my disregard for their social laws my impatience of all constraint among my books and my drugs in my lonely den at mansie i could let the great drove of the human race pass onwards with their politics and inventions and tittletattle and i remained behind stagnant and happy not stagnant either for i was working in my own little groove and making progress i have reason to believe that daltons atomic theory is founded upon error and i know that mercury is not an element  during the day i was busy with my distillations and analyses often i forgot my meals and when old madge summoned me to my tea i found my dinner lying untouched upon the table at night i read bacon descartes spinoza kantall those who have pried into what is unknowable they are all fruitless and empty barren of result but prodigal of polysyllables reminding me of men who while digging for gold have turned up many worms and then exhibit then exultantly as being what they sought at times a restless spirit would come upon me and i would walk thirty and forty miles without rest or breaking fast on these occasions when i used to stalk through the country villages gaunt unshaven and dishevelled the mothers would rush into the road and drag their children indoors and the rustics would swarm out of their pothouses to gaze at me i believe that i was known far and wide as the mad laird o mansie it was rarely however that i made these raids into the country for i usually took my exercise upon my own beach where i soothed my spirit with strong black tobacco and made the ocean my friend and my confidant  what companion is there like the great restless throbbing sea what human mood is there which it does not match and sympathise with there are none so gay but that they may feel gayer when they listen to its merry turmoil and see the long green surges racing in with the glint of the sunbeams in their sparkling crests but when the grey waves toss their heads in anger and the wind screams above them goading them on to madder and more tumultuous efforts then the darkestminded of men feels that there is a melancholy principle in nature which is as gloomy as his own thoughts when it was calm in the bay of mansie the surface would be as clear and bright as a sheet of silver broken only at one spot some little way from the shore where a long black line projected out of the water looking like the jagged back of some sleeping monster this was the top of the dangerous ridge of rocks known to the fishermen as the ragged reef o mansie when the wind blew from the east the waves would break upon it like thunder and the spray would be tossed far over my house and up to the hills behind the bay itself was a bold and noble one but too much exposed to the northern and eastern gales and too much dreaded for its reef to be much used by mariners there was something of romance about this lonely spot i have lain in my boat upon a calm day and peering over the edge i have seen far down the flickering ghostly forms of great fishfish as it seemed to me such as naturalist never knew and which my imagination transformed into the genii of that desolate bay once as i stood by the brink of the waters upon a quiet night a great cry as of a woman in hopeless grief rose from the bosom of the deep and swelled out upon the still air now sinking and now rising for a space of thirty seconds this i heard with my own ears  in this strange spot with the eternal hills behind me and the eternal sea in front i worked and brooded for more than two years unpestered by my fellow men by degrees i had trained my old servant into habits of silence so that she now rarely opened her lips though i doubt not that when twice a year she visited her relations in wick her tongue during those few days made up for its enforced rest i had come almost to forget that i was a member of the human family and to live entirely with the dead whose books i pored over when a sudden incident occurred which threw all my thoughts into a new channel  three rough days in june had been succeeded by one calm and peaceful one there was not a breath of air that evening the sun sank down in the west behind a line of purple clouds and the smooth surface of the bay was gashed with scarlet streaks along the beach the pools left by the tide showed up like gouts of blood against the yellow sand as if some wounded giant had toilfully passed that way and had left these red traces of his grievous hurt behind him as the darkness closed in certain ragged clouds which had lain low on the eastern horizon coalesced and formed a great irregular cumulus the glass was still low and i knew that there was mischief brewing about nine oclock a dull moaning sound came up from the sea as from a creature who much harassed learns that the hour of suffering has come round again at ten a sharp breeze sprang up from the eastward at eleven it had increased to a gale and by midnight the most furious storm was raging which i ever remember upon that weatherbeaten coast  as i went to bed the shingle and seaweed were pattering up against my attic window and the wind was screaming as though every gust were a lost soul by that time the sounds of the tempest had become a lullaby to me i knew that the grey walls of the old house would buffet it out and for what occurred in the world outside i had small concern old madge was usually as callous to such things as i was myself it was a surprise to me when about three in the morning i was awoke by the sound of a great knocking at my door and excited cries in the wheezy voice of my housekeeper i sprang out of my hammock and roughly demanded of her what was the matter  eh maister maister she screamed in her hateful dialect come doun mun come doun theres a muckle ship gaun ashore on the reef and the puir folks are a yammerin and cain for helpand i doobt theyll a be drooned oh maister mvittie come doun  hold your tongue you hag i shouted back in a passion what is it to you whether they are drowned or not get back to your bed and leave me alone i turned in again and drew the blankets over me those men out there i said to myself have already gone through half the horrors of death if they be saved they will but have to go through the same once more in the space of a few brief years it is best therefore that they should pass away now since they have suffered that anticipation which is more than the pain of dissolution with this thought in my mind i endeavoured to compose myself to sleep once more for that philosophy which had taught me to consider death as a small and trivial incident in mans eternal and everchanging career had also broken me of much curiosity concerning worldly matters on this occasion i found however that the old leaven still fermented strongly in my soul i tossed from side to side for some minutes endeavouring to beat down the impulses of the moment by the rules of conduct which i had framed during months of thought then i heard a dull roar amid the wild shriek of the gale and i knew that it was the sound of a signalgun driven by an uncontrollable impulse i rose dressed and having lit my pipe walked out on to the beach  it was pitch dark when i came outside and the wind blew with such violence that i had to put my shoulder against it and push my way along the shingle my face pringled and smarted with the sting of the gravel which was blown against it and the red ashes of my pipe streamed away behind me dancing fantastically through the darkness i went down to where the great waves were thundering in and shading my eyes with my hands to keep off the salt spray i peered out to sea i could distinguish nothing and yet it seemed to me that shouts and great inarticulate cries were borne to me by the blasts suddenly as i gazed i made out the glint of a light and then the whole bay and the beach were lit up in a moment by a vivid blue glare they were burning a coloured signallight on board of the vessel there she lay on her beam ends right in the centre of the jagged reef hurled over to such an angle that i could see all the planking of her deck she was a large twomasted schooner of foreign rig and lay perhaps a hundred and eighty or two hundred yards from the shore every spar and rope and writhing piece of cordage showed up hard and clear under the livid light which sputtered and flickered from the highest portion of the forecastle beyond the doomed ship out of the great darkness came the long rolling lines of black waves never ending never tiring with a petulant tuft of foam here and there upon their crests each as it reached the broad circle of unnatural light appeared to gather strength and volume and to hurry on more impetuously until with a roar and a jarring crash it sprang upon its victim clinging to the weather shrouds i could distinctly see some ten or twelve frightened seamen who when their light revealed my presence turned their white faces towards me and waved their hands imploringly i felt my gorge rise against these poor cowering worms why should they presume to shirk the narrow pathway along which all that is great and noble among mankind has travelled there was one there who interested me more than they he was a tall man who stood apart from the others balancing himself upon the swaying wreck as though he disdained to cling to rope or bulwark his hands were clasped behind his back and his head was sunk upon his breast but even in that despondent attitude there was a litheness and decision in his pose and in every motion which marked him as a man little likely to yield to despair indeed i could see by his occasional rapid glances up and down and all around him that he was weighing every chance of safety but though he often gazed across the raging surf to where he could see my dark figure upon the beach his selfrespect or some other reason forbade him from imploring my help in any way he stood dark silent and inscrutable looking down on the black sea and waiting for whatever fortune fate might send him  it seemed to me that that problem would very soon be settled as i looked an enormous billow topping all the others and coming after them like a driver following a flock swept over the vessel her foremast snapped short off and the men who clung to the shrouds were brushed away like a swarm of flies with a rending riving sound the ship began to split in two where the sharp back of the mansie reef was sawing into her keel the solitary man upon the forecastle ran rapidly across the deck and seized hold of a white bundle which i had already observed but failed to make out as he lifted it up the light fell upon it and i saw that the object was a woman with a spar lashed across her body and under her arms in such a way that her head should always rise above water he bore her tenderly to the side and seemed to speak for a minute or so to her as though explaining the impossibility of remaining upon the ship her answer was a singular one i saw her deliberately raise her hand and strike him across the face with it he appeared to be silenced for a moment or so by this but he addressed her again directing her as far as i could gather from his motions how she should behave when in the water she shrank away from him but he caught her in his arms he stooped over her for a moment and seemed to press his lips against her forehead then a great wave came welling up against the side of the breaking vessel and leaning over he placed her upon the summit of it as gently as a child might be committed to its cradle i saw her white dress flickering among the foam on the crest of the dark billow and then the light sank gradually lower and the riven ship and its lonely occupant were hidden from my eyes  as i watched those things my manhood overcame my philosophy and i felt a frantic impulse to be up and doing i threw my cynicism to one side as a garment which i might don again at leisure and i rushed wildly to my boat and my sculls she was a leaky tub but what then was i who had cast many a wistful doubtful glance at my opium bottle to begin now to weigh chances and to cavil at danger i dragged her down to the sea with the strength of a maniac and sprang in for a moment or two it was a question whether she could live among the boiling surge but a dozen frantic strokes took me through it half full of water but still afloat i was out on the unbroken waves now at one time climbing climbing up the broad black breast of one then sinking down down on the other side until looking up i could see the gleam of the foam all around me against the dark heavens far behind me i could hear the wild wailings of old madge who seeing me start thought no doubt that my madness had come to a climax as i rowed i peered over my shoulder until at last on the belly of a great wave which was sweeping towards me i distinguished the vague white outline of the woman stooping over i seized her as she swept by me and with an effort lifted her all sodden with water into the boat there was no need to row back for the next billow carried us in and threw us upon the beach i dragged the boat out of danger and then lifting up the woman i carried her to the house followed by my housekeeper loud with congratulation and praise  now that i had done this thing a reaction set in upon me i felt that my burden lived for i heard the faint beat of her heart as i pressed my ear against her side in carrying her knowing this i threw her down beside the fire which madge had lit with as little sympathy as though she had been a bundle of fagots i never glanced at her to see if she were fair or no for many years i had cared little for the face of a woman as i lay in my hammock upstairs however i heard the old woman as she chafed the warmth back into her crooning a chorus of eh the puir lassie eh the bonnie lassie from which i gathered that this piece of jetsam was both young and comely                                       the morning after the gale was peaceful and sunny as i walked along the long sweep of sand i could hear the panting of the sea it was heaving and swirling about the reef but along the shore it rippled in gently enough there was no sign of the schooner nor was there any wreckage upon the beach which did not surprise me as i knew there was a great undertow in those waters a couple of broadwinged gulls were hovering and skimming over the scene of the shipwreck as though many strange things were visible to them beneath the waves at times i could hear their raucous voices as they spoke to one another of what they saw  when i came back from my walk the woman was waiting at the door for me i began to wish when i saw her that i had never saved her for here was an end of my privacy she was very youngat the most nineteen with a pale somewhat refined face yellow hair merry blue eyes and shining teeth her beauty was of an ethereal type she looked so white and light and fragile that she might have been the spirit of that stormfoam from out of which i plucked her she had wreathed some of madges garments round her in a way which was quaint and not unbecoming as i strode heavily up the pathway she put out her hands with a pretty childlike gesture and ran down towards me meaning as i surmise to thank me for having saved her but i put her aside with a wave of my hand and passed her at this she seemed somewhat hurt and the tears sprang into her eyes but she followed me into the sittingroom and watched me wistfully what country do you come from i asked her suddenly  she smiled when i spoke but shook her head  français i asked deutsch espagnoleach time she shook her head and then she rippled off into a long statement in some tongue of which i could not understand one word  after breakfast was over however i got a clue to her nationality passing along the beach once more i saw that in a cleft of the ridge a piece of wood had been jammed i rowed out to it in my boat and brought it ashore it was part of the sternpost of a boat and on it or rather on the piece of wood attached to it was the word archangel painted in strange quaint lettering so i thought as i paddled slowly back this pale damsel is a russian a fit subject for the white czar and a proper dweller on the shores of the white sea it seemed to me strange that one of her apparent refinement should perform so long a journey in so frail a craft when i came back into the house i pronounced the word archangel several times in different intonations but she did not appear to recognise it  i shut myself up in the laboratory all the morning continuing a research which i was making upon the nature of the allotropic forms of carbon and of sulphur when i came out at midday for some food she was sitting by the table with a needle and thread mending some rents in her clothes which were now dry i resented her continued presence but i could not turn her out on the beach to shift for herself presently she presented a new phase of her character pointing to herself and then to the scene of the shipwreck she held up one finger by which i understood her to be asking whether she was the only one saved i nodded my head to indicate that she was on this she sprang out of her chair with a cry of great joy and holding the garment which she was mending over her head and swaying it from side to side with the motion of her body she danced as lightly as a feather all round the room and then out through the open door into the sunshine as she whirled round she sang in a plaintive shrill voice some uncouth barbarous chant expressive of exultation i called out to her come in you young fiend come in and be silent but she went on with her dance then she suddenly ran towards me and catching my hand before i could pluck it away she kissed it while we were at dinner she spied one of my pencils and taking it up she wrote the two words sophie ramusine upon a piece of paper and then pointed to herself as a sign that that was her name she handed the pencil to me evidently expecting that i would be equally communicative but i put it in my pocket as a sign that i wished to hold no intercourse with her  every moment of my life now i regretted the unguarded precipitancy with which i had saved this woman what was it to me whether she had lived or died i was no young hotheaded youth to do such things it was bad enough to be compelled to have madge in the house but she was old and ugly and could be ignored this one was young and lively and so fashioned as to divert attention from graver things where could i send her and what could i do with her if i sent information to wick it would mean that officials and others would come to me and pry and peep and chattera hateful thought it was better to endure her presence than that  i soon found that there were fresh troubles in store for me there is no place safe from the swarming restless race of which i am a member in the evening when the sun was dipping down behind the hills casting them into dark shadow but gilding the sands and casting a great glory over the sea i went as is my custom for a stroll along the beach sometimes on these occasions i took my book with me i did so on this night and stretching myself upon a sanddune i composed myself to read as i lay there i suddenly became aware of a shadow which interposed itself between the sun and myself looking round i saw to my great surprise a very tall powerful man who was standing a few yards off and who instead of looking at me was ignoring my existence completely and was gazing over my head with a stern set face at the bay and the black line of the mansie reef his complexion was dark with black hair and short curling beard a hawklike nose and golden earrings in his earsthe general effect being wild and somewhat noble he wore a faded velveteen jacket a redflannel shirt and high sea boots coming halfway up his thighs i recognised him at a glance as being the same man who had been left on the wreck the night before  hullo i said in an aggrieved voice you got ashore all right then  yes he answered in good english it was no doing of mine the waves threw me up i wish to god i had been allowed to drown there was a slight foreign lisp in his accent which was rather pleasing two good fishermen who live round yonder point pulled me out and cared for me yet i could not honestly thank them for it  ho ho thought i here is a man of my own kidney  why do you wish to be drowned i asked  because he cried throwing out his long arms with a passionate despairing gesture therethere in that blue smiling bay lies my soul my treasureeverything that i loved and lived for  well well i said people are ruined every day but theres no use making a fuss about it let me inform you that this ground on which you walk is my ground and that the sooner you take yourself off it the better pleased i shall be one of you is quite trouble enough  one of us he gasped  yesif you could take her off with you i should be still more grateful  he gazed at me for a moment as if hardly able to realise what i said and then with a wild cry he ran away from me with prodigious speed and raced along the sands towards my house never before or since have i seen a human being run so fast i followed as rapidly as i could furious at this threatened invasion but long before i reached the house he had disappeared through the open door i heard a great scream from the inside and as i came nearer the sound of a mans bass voice speaking rapidly and loudly when i looked in the girl sophie ramusine was crouching in a corner cowering away with fear and loathing expressed on her averted face and in every line of her shrinking form the other with his dark eyes flashing and his outstretched hands quivering with emotion was pouring forth a torrent of passionate pleading words he made a step forward to her as i entered but she writhed still further away and uttered a sharp cry like that of a rabbit when the weasel has him by the throat  here i said pulling him back from her this is a pretty todo what do you mean do you think this is a wayside inn or place of public accommodation  oh sir he said excuse me this woman is my wife and i feared that she was drowned you have brought me back to life  who are you i asked roughly  i am a man from archangel he said simply a russian man  what is your name  ourganeff  ourganeffand hers is sophie ramusine she is no wife of yours she has no ring  we are man and wife in the sight of heaven he said solemnly looking upwards we are bound by higher laws than those of earth as he spoke the girl slipped behind me and caught me by the other hand pressing it as though beseeching my protection give me up my wife sir he went on let me take her away from here  look here youwhatever your name is i said sternly i dont want this wench here i wish i had never seen her if she died it would be no grief to me but as to handing her over to you when it is clear she fears and hates you i wont do it so now just clear your great body out of this and leave me to my books i hope i may never look upon your face again  you wont give her up to me he said hoarsely  ill see you damned first i answered  suppose i take her he cried his dark face growing darker  all my tigerish blood flashed up in a moment i picked up a billet of wood from beside the fireplace go i said in a low voice go quick or i may do you an injury he looked at me irresolutely for a moment and then he left the house he came back again in a moment however and stood in the doorway looking in at us  have a heed what you do he said the woman is mine and i shall have her when it comes to blows a russian is as good a man as a scotchman  we shall see that i cried springing forward but he was already gone and i could see his tall form moving away through the gathering darkness  for a month or more after this things went smoothly with us i never spoke to the russian girl nor did she ever address me sometimes when i was at work in my laboratory she would slip inside the door and sit silently there watching me with her great eyes at first this intrusion annoyed me but by degrees finding that she made no attempt to distract my attention i suffered her to remain encouraged by this concession she gradually came to move the stool on which she sat nearer and nearer to my table until after gaining a little every day during some weeks she at last worked her way right up to me and used to perch herself beside me whenever i worked in this position she used still without ever obtruding her presence in any way to make herself very useful by holding my pens testtubes or bottles and handing me whatever i wanted with neverfailing sagacity by ignoring the fact of her being a human being and looking upon her as a useful automatic machine i accustomed myself to her presence so far as to miss her on the few occasions when she was not at her post i have a habit of talking aloud to myself at times when i work so as to fix my results better in my mind the girl must have had a surprising memory for sounds for she could always repeat the words which i let fall in this way without of course understanding in the least what they meant i have often been amused at hearing her discharge a volley of chemical equations and algebraic symbols at old madge and then burst into a ringing laugh when the crone would shake her head under the impression no doubt that she was being addressed in russian  she never went more than a few yards from the house and indeed never put her foot over the threshold without looking carefully out of each window in order to be sure that there was nobody about by this i knew that she suspected that her fellowcountryman was still in the neighbourhood and feared that he might attempt to carry her off she did something else which was significant i had an old revolver with some cartridges which had been thrown away among the rubbish she found this one day and at once proceeded to clean it and oil it she hung it up near the door with the cartridges in a little bag beside it and whenever i went for a walk she would take it down and insist upon my carrying it with me in my absence she would always bolt the door apart from her apprehensions she seemed fairly happy busying herself in helping madge when she was not attending upon me she was wonderfully nimblefingered and natty in all domestic duties  it was not long before i discovered that her suspicions were well founded and that this man from archangel was still lurking in the vicinity being restless one night i rose and peered out of the window the weather was somewhat cloudy and i could barely make out the line of the sea and the loom of my boat upon the beach as i gazed however and my eyes became accustomed to the obscurity i became aware that there was some other dark blur upon the sands and that in front of my very door where certainly there had been nothing of the sort the preceding night as i stood at my diamondpaned lattice still peering and peeping to make out what this might be a great bank of clouds rolled slowly away from the face of the moon and a flood of cold clear light was poured down upon the silent bay and the long sweep of its desolate shores then i saw what this was which haunted my doorstep it was he the russian he squatted there like a gigantic toad with his legs doubled under him in strange mongolian fashion and his eyes fixed apparently upon the window of the room in which the young girl and the housekeeper slept the light fell upon his upturned face and i saw once more the hawklike grace of his countenance with the single deeplyindented line of care upon his brow and the protruding beard which marks the passionate nature my first impulse was to shoot him as a trespasser but as i gazed my resentment changed into pity and contempt poor fool i said to myself is it then possible that you whom i have seen looking openeyed at present death should have your whole thoughts and ambitions centred upon this wretched slip of a girla girl too who flies from you and hates you most women would love youwere it but for that dark face and great handsome body of yoursand yet you must needs hanker after the one in a thousand who will have no traffic with you as i returned to my bed i chuckled much to myself over this thought i knew that my bars were strong and my bolts thick it mattered little to me whether this strange man spent his night at my door or a hundred leagues off so long as he was gone by the morning as i expected when i rose and went out there was no sign of him nor had he left any trace of his midnight vigil  it was not long however before i saw him again i had been out for a row one morning for my head was aching partly from prolonged stooping and partly from the effects of a noxious drug which i had inhaled the night before i pulled along the coast some miles and then feeling thirsty i landed at a place where i knew that a fresh water stream trickled down into the sea this rivulet passed through my land but the mouth of it where i found myself that day was beyond my boundary line i felt somewhat taken aback when rising from the stream at which i had slaked my thirst i found myself face to face with the russian i was as much a trespasser now as he was and i could see at a glance that he knew it  i wish to speak a few words to you he said gravely  hurry up then i answered glancing at my watch i have no time to listen to chatter  chatter he repeated angrily ah but there you scotch people are strange men your face is hard and your words rough but so are those of the good fishermen with whom i stay yet i find that beneath it all there lie kind honest natures no doubt you are kind and good too in spite of your roughness  in the name of the devil i said say your say and go your way i am weary of the sight of you  can i not soften you in any way he cried ah seesee herehe produced a small grecian cross from inside his velvet jacket look at this our religions may differ in form but at least we have some common thoughts and feelings when we see this emblem  i am not so sure of that i answered  he looked at me thoughtfully  you are a very strange man he said at last i cannot understand you you still stand between me and sophie it is a dangerous position to take sir oh believe me before it is too late if you did but know what i have done to gain that womanhow i have risked my body how i have lost my soul you are a small obstacle to some which i have surmountedyou whom a rip with a knife or a blow from a stone would put out of my way for ever but god preserve me from that he cried wildly i am deeptoo deepalready anything rather than that  you would do better to go back to your country i said than to skulk about these sandhills and disturb my leisure when i have proof that you have gone away i shall hand this woman over to the protection of the russian consul at edinburgh until then i shall guard her myself and not you nor any muscovite that ever breathed shall take her from me  and what is your object in keeping me from sophie he asked do you imagine that i would injure her why man i would give my life freely to save her from the slightest harm why do you do this thing  i do it because it is my good pleasure to act so i answered i give no man reasons for my conduct  look here he cried suddenly blazing into fury and advancing towards me with his shaggy mane bristling and his brown hands clenched if i thought you had one dishonest thought towards this girlif for a moment i had reason to believe that you had any base motive for detaining heras sure as there is a god in heaven i should drag the heart out of your bosom with my hands the very idea seemed to have put the man in a frenzy for his face was all distorted and his hands opened and shut convulsively i thought that he was about to spring at my throat  stand off i said putting my hand on my pistol if you lay a finger on me i shall kill you  he put his hand into his pocket and for a moment i thought he was about to produce a weapon too but instead of that he whipped out a cigarette and lit it breathing the smoke rapidly into his lungs no doubt he had found by experience that this was the most effectual way of curbing his passions  i told you he said in a quieter voice that my name is ourganeffalexis ourganeff i am a finn by birth but i have spent my life in every part of the world i was one who could never be still nor settle down to a quiet existence after i came to own my own ship there is hardly a port from archangel to australia which i have not entered i was rough and wild and free but there was one at home sir who was prim and whitehanded and softtongued skilful in little fancies and conceits which women love this youth by his wiles and tricks stole from me the love of the girl whom i had ever marked as my own and who up to that time had seemed in some sort inclined to return my passion i had been on a voyage to hammerfest for ivory and coming back unexpectedly i learned that my pride and treasure was to be married to this softskinned boy and that the party had actually gone to the church in such moments sir something gives way in my head and i hardly know what i do i landed with a boats crewall men who had sailed with me for years and who were as true as steel we went up to the church they were standing she and he before the priest but the thing had not been done i dashed between them and caught her round the waist my men beat back the frightened bridegroom and the lookers on we bore her down to the boat and aboard our vessel and then getting up anchor we sailed away across the white sea until the spires of archangel sank down behind the horizon she had my cabin my room every comfort i slept among the men in the forecastle i hoped that in time her aversion to me would wear away and that she would consent to marry me in england or in france for days and days we sailed we saw the north cape die away behind us and we skirted the grey norwegian coast but still in spite of every attention she would not forgive me for tearing her from that palefaced lover of hers then came this cursed storm which shattered both my ship and my hopes and has deprived me even of the sight of the woman for whom i have risked so much perhaps she may learn to love me yet you sir he said wistfully look like one who has seen much of the world do you not think that she may come to forget this man and to love me  i am tired of your story i said turning away for my part i think you are a great fool if you imagine that this love of yours will pass away you had best amuse yourself as best you can until it does if on the other hand it is a fixed thing you cannot do better than cut your throat for that is the shortest way out of it i have no more time to waste on the matter with this i hurried away and walked down to the boat i never looked round but i heard the dull sound of his feet upon the sands as he followed me  i have told you the beginning of my story he said and you shall know the end some day you would do well to let the girl go  i never answered him but pushed the boat off when i had rowed some distance out i looked back and saw his tall figure upon the yellow sand as he stood gazing thoughtfully after me when i looked again some minutes later he had disappeared  for a long time after this my life was as regular and as monotonous as it had been before the shipwreck at times i hoped that the man from archangel had gone away altogether but certain footsteps which i saw upon the sand and more particularly a little pile of cigarette ash which i found one day behind a hillock from which a view of the house might be obtained warned me that though invisible he was still in the vicinity my relations with the russian girl remained the same as before old madge had been somewhat jealous of her presence at first and seemed to fear that what little authority she had would be taken away from her by degrees however as she came to realise my utter indifference she became reconciled to the situation and as i have said before profited by it as our visitor performed much of the domestic work  and now i am coming near the end of this narrative of mine which i have written a great deal more for my own amusement than for that of any one else the termination of the strange episode in which these two russians had played a part was as wild and as sudden as the commencement the events of one single night freed me from all my troubles and left me once more alone with my books and my studies as i had been before their intrusion let me endeavour to describe how this came about  i had had a long day of heavy and wearying work so that in the evening i determined upon taking a long walk when i emerged from the house my attention was attracted by the appearance of the sea it lay like a sheet of glass so that never a ripple disturbed its surface yet the air was filled with that indescribable moaning sound which i have alluded to beforea sound as though the spirits of all those who lay beneath those treacherous waters were sending a sad warning of coming troubles to their brethren in the flesh the fishermens wives along that coast know the eerie sound and look anxiously across the waters for the brown sails making for the land when i heard it i stepped back into the house and looked at the glass it was down below 29° then i knew that a wild night was coming upon us  underneath the hills where i walked that evening it was dull and chill but their summits were rosyred and the sea was brightened by the sinking sun there were no clouds of importance in the sky yet the dull groaning of the sea grew louder and stronger i saw far to the eastward a brig beating up for wick with a reef in her topsails it was evident that her captain had read the signs of nature as i had done behind her a long lurid haze lay low upon the water concealing the horizon i had better push on i thought to myself or the wind may rise before i can get back  i suppose i must have been at least half a mile from the house when i suddenly stopped and listened breathlessly my ears were so accustomed to the noises of nature the sighing of the breeze and the sob of the waves that any other sound made itself heard at a great distance i waited listening with all my ears yes there it was againa longdrawn shrill cry of despair ringing over the sands and echoed back from the hills behind mea piteous appeal for aid it came from the direction of my house i turned and ran back homewards at the top of my speed ploughing through the sand racing over the shingle in my mind there was a great dim perception of what had occurred  about a quarter of a mile from the house there is a high sandhill from which the whole country round is visible when i reached the top of this i paused for a moment there was the old grey buildingthere the boat everything seemed to be as i had left it even as i gazed however the shrill scream was repeated louder than before and the next moment a tall figure emerged from my door the figure of the russian sailor over his shoulder was the white form of the young girl and even in his haste he seemed to bear her tenderly and with gentle reverence i could hear her wild cries and see her desperate struggles to break away from him behind the couple came my old housekeeper staunch and true as the aged dog who can no longer bite still snarls with toothless gums at the intruder she staggered feebly along at the heels of the ravisher waving her long thin arms and hurling no doubt volleys of scotch curses and imprecations at his head i saw at a glance that he was making for the boat a sudden hope sprang up in my soul that i might be in time to intercept him i ran for the beach at the top of my speed as i ran i slipped a cartridge into my revolver this i determined should be the last of these invasions  i was too late by the time i reached the waters edge he was a hundred yards away making the boat spring with every stroke of his powerful arms i uttered a wild cry of impotent anger and stamped up and down the sands like a maniac he turned and saw me rising from his seat he made me a graceful bow and waved his hand to me it was not a triumphant or a derisive gesture even my furious and distempered mind recognised it as being a solemn and courteous leavetaking then he settled down to his oars once more and the little skiff shot away out over the bay the sun had gone down now leaving a single dull red streak upon the water which stretched away until it blended with the purple haze on the horizon gradually the skiff grew smaller and smaller as it sped across this lurid band until the shades of night gathered round it and it became a mere blur upon the lonely sea then this vague loom died away also and darkness settled over ita darkness which should never be raised  and why did i pace the solitary shore hot and wrathful as a wolf whose whelp has been torn from it was it that i loved this muscovite girl noa thousand times no i am not one who for the sake of a white skin or a blue eye would belie my own life and change the whole tenor of my thoughts and existence my heart was untouched but my prideah there i had been cruelly wounded to think that i had been unable to afford protection to the helpless one who craved it of me and who relied on me it was that which made my heart sick and sent the blood buzzing through my ears  that night a great wind rose up from the sea and the wild waves shrieked upon the shore as though they would tear it back with them into the ocean the turmoil and the uproar were congenial to my vexed spirit all night i wandered up and down wet with spray and rain watching the gleam of the white breakers and listening to the outcry of the storm my heart was bitter against the russian i joined my feeble pipe to the screaming of the gale if he would but come back again i cried with clenched hands if he would but come back  he came back when the grey light of morning spread over the eastern sky and lit up the great waste of yellow tossing waters with the brown clouds drifting swiftly over them then i saw him once again a few hundred yards off along the sand there lay a long dark object cast up by the fury of the waves it was my boat much shattered and splintered a little farther on a vague shapeless something was washing to and fro in the shallow water all mixed with shingle and with seaweed i saw at a glance that it was the russian face downwards and dead i rushed into the water and dragged him up on to the beach it was only when i turned him over that i discovered that she was beneath him his dead arms encircling her his mangled body still intervening between her and the fury of the storm it seemed that the fierce german sea might beat the life from him but with all its strength it was unable to tear this oneidead man from the woman whom he loved there were signs which led me to believe that during that awful night the womans fickle mind had come at last to learn the worth of the true heart and strong arm which struggled for her and guarded her so tenderly why else should her little head be nestling so lovingly on his broad breast while her yellow hair entwined itself with his flowing beard why too should there be that bright smile of ineffable happiness and triumph which death itself had not had power to banish from his dusky face i fancy that death had been brighter to him than life had ever been  madge and i buried them there on the shores of the desolate northern sea they lie in one grave deep down beneath the yellow sand strange things may happen in the world around them empires may rise and may fall dynasties may perish great wars may come and go but heedless of it all those two shall embrace each other for ever and aye in their lonely shrine by the side of the sounding ocean i sometimes have thought that their spirits flit like shadowy seamews over the wild waters of the bay no cross or symbol marks their restingplace but old madge puts wild flowers upon it at times and when i pass on my daily walk and see the fresh blossoms scattered over the sand i think of the strange couple who came from afar and broke for a little space the dull tenor of my sombre life     v  the great brownpericord motor   it was a cold foggy dreary evening in may along the strand blurred patches of light marked the position of the lamps the flaring shop windows flickered vaguely with steamy brightness through the thick and heavy atmosphere  the high lines of houses which led down to the embankment were all dark and deserted or illuminated only by the glimmering lamp of the caretaker at one point however there shone out from three windows upon the second floor a rich flood of light which broke the sombre monotony of the terrace passersby glanced up curiously and drew each others attention to the ruddy glare for it marked the chambers of francis pericord the inventor and electrical engineer long into the watches of the night the gleam of his lamps bore witness to the untiring energy and restless industry which was rapidly carrying him to the first rank in his profession  within the chamber sat two men the one was pericord himselfhawkfaced and angular with the black hair and brisk bearing which spoke of his celtic origin the otherthick sturdy and blueeyed was jeremy brown the wellknown mechanician they had been partners in many an invention in which the creative genius of the one had been aided by the practical abilities of the other it was a question among their friends as to which was the better man  it was no chance visit which had brought brown into pericords workshop at so late an hour business was to be donebusiness which was to decide the failure or success of months of work and which might affect their whole careers between them lay a long brown table stained and corroded by strong acids and littered with giant carboys faures accumulators voltaic piles coils of wire and great blocks of nonconducting porcelain in the midst of all this lumber there stood a singular whizzing whirring machine upon which the eyes of both partners were riveted  a small square metal receptacle was connected by numerous wires to a broad steel girdle furnished on either side with two powerful projecting joints the girdle was motionless but the joints with the short arms attached to them flashed round every few seconds with a pause between each rhythmic turn the power which moved them came evidently from the metal box a subtle odour of ozone was in the air  how about the flanges brown asked the inventor  they were too large to bring they are seven foot by three there is power enough there to work them however i will answer for that  aluminium with an alloy of copper  yes  see how beautifully it works pericord stretched out a thin nervous hand and pressed a button upon the machine the joints revolved more slowly and came presently to a dead stop again he touched a spring and the arms shivered and woke up again into their crisp metallic life the experimenter need not exert his muscular powers he remarked he has only to be passive and use his intelligence  thanks to my motor said brown  our motor the other broke in sharply  oh of course said his colleague impatiently the motor which you thought of and which i reduced to practicecall it what you like  i call it the brownpericord motor cried the inventor with an angry flash of his dark eyes you worked out the details but the abstract thought is mine and mine alone  an abstract thought wont turn an engine said brown doggedly  that was why i took you into partnership the other retorted drumming nervously with his fingers upon the table i invent you build it is a fair division of labour  brown pursed up his lips as though by no means satisfied upon the point seeing however that further argument was useless he turned his attention to the machine which was shivering and rocking with each swing of its arms as though a very little more would send it skimming from the table  is it not splendid cried pericord  it is satisfactory said the more phlegmatic anglosaxon  theres immortality in it  theres money in it  our names will go down with montgolfiers  with rothschilds i hope  no no brown you take too material a view cried the inventor raising his gleaming eyes from the machine to his companion our fortunes are a mere detail money is a thing which every heavywitted plutocrat in the country shares with us my hopes rise to something higher than that our true reward will come in the gratitude and goodwill of the human race  brown shrugged his shoulders you may have my share of that he said i am a practical man we must test our invention  where can we do it  that is what i wanted to speak about it must be absolutely secret if we had private grounds of our own it would be an easy matter but there is no privacy in london  we must take it into the country  i have a suggestion to offer said brown my brother has a place in sussex on the high land near beachy head there is i remember a large and lofty barn near the house will is in scotland but the key is always at my disposal why not take the machine down tomorrow and test it in the barn  nothing could be better  there is a train to eastbourne at one  i shall be at the station  bring the gear with you and i will bring the flanges said the mechanician rising tomorrow will prove whether we have been following a shadow or whether fortune is at our feet one oclock at victoria he walked swiftly down the stair and was quickly reabsorbed into the flood of comfortless clammy humanity which ebbed and flowed along the strand                                       the morning was bright and springlike a pale blue sky arched over london with a few gauzy white clouds drifting lazily across it at eleven oclock brown might have been seen entering the patent office with a great roll of parchment diagrams and plans under his arm at twelve he emerged again smiling and opening his pocketbook he packed away very carefully a small slip of official blue paper at five minutes to one his cab rolled into victoria station two giant canvascovered parcels like enormous kites were handed down by the cabman from the top and consigned to the care of a guard on the platform pericord was pacing up and down with long eager step and swinging arms a tinge of pink upon his sunken and sallow cheeks  all right he asked  brown pointed in answer to his baggage  i have the motor and the girdle already packed away in the guards van be careful guard for it is delicate machinery of great value so now we can start with an easy conscience  at eastbourne the precious motor was carried to a fourwheeler and the great flanges hoisted on the top a long drive took them to the house where the keys were kept whence they set off across the barren downs the building which was their destination was a commonplace whitewashed structure with straggling stables and outhouses standing in a grassy hollow which sloped down from the edge of the chalk cliffs it was a cheerless house even when in use but now with its smokeless chimneys and shuttered windows it looked doubly dreary the owner had planted a grove of young larches and firs around it but the sweeping spray had blighted them and they hung their withered heads in melancholy groups it was a gloomy and forbidding spot  but the inventors were in no mood to be moved by such trifles the lonelier the place the more fitted for their purpose with the help of the cabman they carried their packages down the footpath and laid them in the darkened diningroom the sun was setting as the distant murmur of wheels told them that they were finally alone  pericord had thrown open the shutters and the mellow evening light streamed in through the discoloured windows brown drew a knife from his pocket and cut the packthread with which the canvas was secured as the brown covering fell away it disclosed two great yellow metal fans these he leaned carefully against the wall the girdle the connectingbands and the motor were then in turn unpacked it was dark before all was set out in order a lamp was lit and by its light the two men continued to tighten screws clinch rivets and make the last preparations for their experiment  that finishes it said brown at last stepping back and surveying the machine  pericord said nothing but his face glowed with pride and expectation  we must have something to eat brown remarked laying out some provisions which he had brought with him  afterwards  no now said the stolid mechanician i am half starved he pulled up to the table and made a hearty meal while his celtic companion strode impatiently up and down with twitching fingers and restless eyes  now then said brown facing round and brushing the crumbs from his lap who is to put it on  i shall cried his companion eagerly what we do tonight is likely to be historic  but there is some danger suggested brown we cannot quite tell how it may act  that is nothing said pericord with a wave of his hand  but there is no use our going out of our way to incur danger  what then one of us must do it  not at all the motor would act equally well if attached to any inanimate object  that is true said pericord thoughtfully  there are bricks by the barn i have a sack here why should not a bagful of them take our place  it is a good idea i see no objection  come on then and the two sallied out bearing with them the various sections of their machine the moon was shining cold and clear though an occasional ragged cloud drifted across her face all was still and silent upon the downs they stood and listened before they entered the barn but not a sound came to their ears save the dull murmur of the sea and the distant barking of a dog pericord journeyed backwards and forwards with all that they might need while brown filled a long narrow sack with bricks  when all was ready the door of the barn was closed and the lamp balanced upon an empty packingcase the bag of bricks was laid upon two trestles and the broad steel girdle was buckled round it then the great flanges the wires and the metal box containing the motor were in turn attached to the girdle last of all a flat steel rudder shaped like a fishs tail was secured to the bottom of the sack  we must make it travel in a small circle said pericord glancing round at the bare high walls  tie the rudder down at one side suggested brown now it is ready press the connection and off she goes  pericord leaned forward his long sallow face quivering with excitement his white nervous hands darted here and there among the wires brown stood impassive with critical eyes there was a sharp burr from the machine the huge yellow wings gave a convulsive flap then another then a third slower and stronger with a fuller sweep then a fourth which filled the barn with a blast of driven air at the fifth the bag of bricks began to dance upon the trestles at the sixth it sprang into the air and would have fallen to the ground but the seventh came to save it and fluttered it forward through the air slowly rising it flapped heavily round in a circle like some great clumsy bird filling the barn with its buzzing and whirring in the uncertain yellow light of the single lamp it was strange to see the loom of the ungainly thing flapping off into the shadows and then circling back into the narrow zone of light  the two men stood for a while in silence then pericord threw his long arms up into the air  it acts he cried the brownpericord motor acts he danced about like a madman in his delight browns eyes twinkled and he began to whistle  see how smoothly it goes brown cried the inventor and the rudderhow well it acts we must register it tomorrow  his comrades face darkened and set it is registered he said with a forced laugh  registered said pericord registered he repeated the word first in a whisper and then in a kind of scream who has dared to register my invention  i did it this morning there is nothing to be excited about it is all right  you registered the motor under whose name  under my own said brown sullenly i consider that i have the best right to it  and my name does not appear  no but  you villain screamed pericord you thief and villain you would steal my work you would filch my credit i will have that patent back if i have to tear your throat out a sombre fire burned in his black eyes and his hands writhed themselves together with passion brown was no coward but he shrank back as the other advanced upon him  keep your hands off he said drawing a knife from his pocket i will defend myself if you attack me  you threaten me cried pericord whose face was livid with anger you are a bully as well as a cheat will you give up the patent  no i will not  brown i say give it up  i will not i did the work  pericord sprang madly forward with blazing eyes and clutching fingers his companion writhed out of his grasp but was dashed against the packingcase over which he fell the lamp was extinguished and the whole barn plunged into darkness a single ray of moonlight shining through a narrow chink flickered over the great waving fans as they came and went  will you give up the patent brown  there was no answer  will you give it up  again no answer not a sound save the humming and creaking overhead a cold pang of fear and doubt struck through pericords heart he felt aimlessly about in the dark and his fingers closed upon a hand it was cold and unresponsive with all his anger turned to icy horror he struck a match set the lamp up and lit it  brown lay huddled up on the other side of the packingcase pericord seized him in his arms and with convulsive strength lifted him across then the mystery of his silence was explained he had fallen with his right arm doubled up under him and his own weight had driven the knife deeply into his body he had died without a groan the tragedy had been sudden horrible and complete  pericord sat silently on the edge of the case staring blankly down and shivering like one with the ague while the great brownpericord motor boomed and hurtled above him how long he sat there can never be known it might have been minutes or it might have been hours a thousand mad schemes flashed through his dazed brain it was true that he had been only the indirect cause but who would believe that he glanced down at his bloodspattered clothing everything was against him it would be better to fly than to give himself up relying upon his innocence no one in london knew where they were if he could dispose of the body he might have a few days clear before any suspicion would be aroused  suddenly a loud crash recalled him to himself the flying sack had gradually risen with each successive circle until it had struck against the rafters the blow displaced the connectinggear and the machine fell heavily to the ground pericord undid the girdle the motor was uninjured a sudden strange thought flashed upon him as he looked at it the machine had become hateful to him he might dispose both of it and the body in a way that would baffle all human search  he threw open the barn door and carried his companion out into the moonlight there was a hillock outside and on the summit of this he laid him reverently down then he brought from the barn the motor the girdle and the flanges with trembling fingers he fastened the broad steel belt round the dead mans waist then he screwed the wings into the sockets beneath he slung the motorbox fastened the wires and switched on the connection for a minute or two the huge yellow fans flapped and flickered then the body began to move in little jumps down the side of the hillock gathering a gradual momentum until at last it heaved up into the air and soared heavily off in the moonlight he had not used the rudder but had turned the head for the south gradually the weird thing rose higher and sped faster until it had passed over the line of cliff and was sweeping over the silent sea pericord watched it with a white drawn face until it looked like a black bird with golden wings half shrouded in the mist which lay over the waters                                       in the new york state lunatic asylum there is a wildeyed man whose name and birthplace are alike unknown his reason has been unseated by some sudden shock the doctors say though of what nature they are unable to determine it is the most delicate machine which is most readily put out of gear they remark and point in proof of their axiom to the complicated electric engines and remarkable aeronautic machines which the patient is fond of devising in his more lucid moments     vi  the sealed room   a solicitor of an active habit and athletic tastes who is compelled by his hopes of business to remain within the four walls of his office from ten till five must take what exercise he can in the evenings hence it was that i was in the habit of indulging in very long nocturnal excursions in which i sought the heights of hampstead and highgate in order to cleanse my system from the impure air of abchurch lane it was in the course of one of these aimless rambles that i first met felix stanniford and so led up to what has been the most extraordinary adventure of my lifetime  one eveningit was in april or early may of the year 1894i made my way to the extreme northern fringe of london and was walking down one of those fine avenues of high brick villas which the huge city is for ever pushing farther and farther out into the country it was a fine clear spring night the moon was shining out of an unclouded sky and i having already left many miles behind me was inclined to walk slowly and look about me in this contemplative mood my attention was arrested by one of the houses which i was passing  it was a very large building standing in its own grounds a little back from the road it was modern in appearance and yet it was far less so than its neighbours all of which were crudely and painfully new their symmetrical line was broken by the gap caused by the laurelstudded lawn with the great dark gloomy house looming at the back of it evidently it had been the country retreat of some wealthy merchant built perhaps when the nearest street was a mile off and now gradually overtaken and surrounded by the red brick tentacles of the london octopus the next stage i reflected would be its digestion and absorption so that the cheap builder might rear a dozen eightypoundayear villas upon the garden frontage and then as all this passed vaguely through my mind an incident occurred which brought my thoughts into quite another channel  a fourwheeled cab that opprobium of london was coming jolting and creaking in one direction while in the other there was a yellow glare from the lamp of a cyclist they were the only moving objects in the whole long moonlit road and yet they crashed into each other with that malignant accuracy which brings two ocean liners together in the broad waste of the atlantic it was the cyclists fault he tried to cross in front of the cab miscalculated his distance and was knocked sprawling by the horses shoulder he rose snarling the cabman swore back at him and then realising that his number had not yet been taken lashed his horse and lumbered off the cyclist caught at the handles of his prostrate machine and then suddenly sat down with a groan oh lord he said  i ran across the road to his side any harm done i asked  its my ankle said he only a twist i think but its pretty painful just give me your hand will you  he lay in the yellow circle of the cycle lamp and i noted as i helped him to his feet that he was a gentlemanly young fellow with a slight dark moustache and large brown eyes sensitive and nervous in appearance with indications of weak health upon his sunken cheeks work or worry had left its traces upon his thin yellow face he stood up when i pulled his hand but he held one foot in the air and he groaned as he moved it  i cant put it to the ground said he  where do you live  here he nodded his head towards the big dark house in the garden i was cutting across to the gate when that confounded cab ran into me could you help me so far  it was easily done i put his cycle inside the gate and then i supported him down the drive and up the steps to the hall door there was not a light anywhere and the place was as black and silent as if no one had ever lived in it  that will do thank you very much said he fumbling with his key in the lock  no you must allow me to see you safe  he made some feeble petulant protest and then realised that he could really do nothing without me the door had opened into a pitchdark hall he lurched forward with my hand still on his arm  this door to the right said he feeling about in the darkness  i opened the door and at the same moment he managed to strike a light there was a lamp upon the table and we lit it between us now im all right you can leave me now goodbye said he and with the words he sat down in the armchair and fainted dead away  it was a queer position for me the fellow looked so ghastly that really i was not sure that he was not dead presently his lips quivered and his breast heaved but his eyes were two white slits and his colour was horrible the responsibility was more than i could stand i pulled at the bellrope and heard the bell ringing furiously far away but no one came in response the bell tinkled away into silence which no murmur or movement came to break i waited and rang again with the same result there must be some one about this young gentleman could not live all alone in that huge house his people ought to know of his condition if they would not answer the bell i must hunt them out myself i seized the lamp and rushed from the room  what i saw outside amazed me the hall was empty the stairs were bare and yellow with dust there were three doors opening into spacious rooms and each was uncarpeted and undraped save for the grey webs which drooped from the cornice and rosettes of lichen which had formed upon the walls my feet reverberated in those empty and silent chambers then i wandered on down the passage with the idea that the kitchens at least might be tenanted some caretaker might lurk in some secluded room no they were all equally desolate despairing of finding any help i ran down another corridor and came on something which surprised me more than ever  the passage ended in a large brown door and the door had a seal of red wax the size of a fiveshilling piece over the keyhole this seal gave me the impression of having been there for a long time for it was dusty and discoloured i was still staring at it and wondering what that door might conceal when i heard a voice calling behind me and running back found my young man sitting up in his chair and very much astonished at finding himself in darkness  why on earth did you take the lamp away he asked  i was looking for assistance  you might look for some time said he i am alone in the house  awkward if you get an illness  it was foolish of me to faint i inherit a weak heart from my mother and pain or emotion has that effect upon me it will carry me off some day as it did her youre not a doctor are you  no a lawyer frank alder is my name  mine is felix stanniford funny that i should meet a lawyer for my friend mr perceval was saying that we should need one soon  very happy i am sure  well that will depend upon him you know did you say that you had run with that lamp all over the ground floor  yes  all over it he asked with emphasis and he looked at me very hard  i think so i kept on hoping that i should find some one  did you enter all the rooms he asked with the same intent gaze  well all that i could enter  oh then you did notice it said he and he shrugged his shoulders with the air of a man who makes the best of a bad job  notice what  why the door with the seal on it  yes i did  werent you curious to know what was in it  well it did strike me as unusual  do you think you could go on living alone in this house year after year just longing all the time to know what is at the other side of that door and yet not looking  do you mean to say i cried that you dont know yourself  no more than you do  then why dont you look  i mustnt said he  he spoke in a constrained way and i saw that i had blundered on to some delicate ground i dont know that i am more inquisitive than my neighbours but there certainly was something in the situation which appealed very strongly to my curiosity however my last excuse for remaining in the house was gone now that my companion had recovered his senses i rose to go  are you in a hurry he asked  no i have nothing to do  well i should be very glad if you would stay with me a little the fact is that i live a very retired and secluded life here i dont suppose there is a man in london who leads such a life as i do it is quite unusual for me to have any one to talk with  i looked round at the little room scantily furnished with a sofabed at one side then i thought of the great bare house and the sinister door with the discoloured red seal upon it there was something queer and grotesque in the situation which made me long to know a little more perhaps i should if i waited i told him that i should be very happy  you will find the spirits and a siphon upon the side table you must forgive me if i cannot act as host but i cant get across the room those are cigars in the tray there ill take one myself i think and so you are a solicitor mr alder  yes  and i am nothing i am that most helpless of living creatures the son of a millionaire i was brought up with the expectation of great wealth and here i am a poor man without any profession at all and then on the top of it all i am left with this great mansion on my hands which i cannot possibly keep up isnt it an absurd situation for me to use this as my dwelling is like a coster drawing his barrow with a thoroughbred a donkey would be more useful to him and a cottage to me  but why not sell the house i asked  i mustnt  let it then  no i mustnt do that either  i looked puzzled and my companion smiled  ill tell you how it is if it wont bore you said he  on the contrary i should be exceedingly interested  i think after your kind attention to me i cannot do less than relieve any curiosity that you may feel you must know that my father was stanislaus stanniford the banker  stanniford the banker i remembered the name at once his flight from the country some seven years before had been one of the scandals and sensations of the time  i see that you remember said my companion my poor father left the country to avoid numerous friends whose savings he had invested in an unsuccessful speculation he was a nervous sensitive man and the responsibility quite upset his reason he had committed no legal offence it was purely a matter of sentiment he would not even face his own family and he died among strangers without ever letting us know where he was  he died said i  we could not prove his death but we know that it must be so because the speculations came right again and so there was no reason why he should not look any man in the face he would have returned if he were alive but he must have died in the last two years  why in the last two years  because we heard from him two years ago  did he not tell you then where he was living  the letter came from paris but no address was given it was when my poor mother died he wrote to me then with some instructions and some advice and i have never heard from him since  had you heard before  oh yes we had heard before and thats where our mystery of the sealed door upon which you stumbled tonight has its origin pass me that desk if you please here i have my fathers letters and you are the first man except mr perceval who has seen them  who is mr perceval may i ask  he was my fathers confidential clerk and he has continued to be the friend and adviser of my mother and then of myself i dont know what we should have done without perceval he saw the letters but no one else this is the first one which came on the very day when my father fled seven years ago read it to yourself  this is the letter which i read       my ever dearest wife       since sir william told me how weak your heart is and how      harmful any shock might be i have never talked about my      business affairs to you the time has come when at all risks i      can no longer refrain from telling you that things have been      going badly with me this will cause me to leave you for a      little time but it is with the absolute assurance that we      shall see each other very soon on this you can thoroughly      rely our parting is only for a very short time my own      darling so dont let it fret you and above all dont let it      impair your health for that is what i want above all things to      avoid       now i have a request to make and i implore you by all that      binds us together to fulfil it exactly as i tell you there are      some things which i do not wish to be seen by any one in my      dark roomthe room which i use for photographic purposes at      the end of the garden passage to prevent any painful thoughts      i may assure you once for all dear that it is nothing of      which i need be ashamed but still i do not wish you or felix      to enter that room it is locked and i implore you when you      receive this to at once place a seal over the lock and leave      it so do not sell or let the house for in either case my      secret will be discovered as long as you or felix are in the      house i know that you will comply with my wishes when felix      is twentyone he may enter the roomnot before       and now goodbye my own best of wives during our short      separation you can consult mr perceval on any matters which      may arise he has my complete confidence i hate to leave felix      and youeven for a timebut there is really no choice       ever and always your loving husband       stanislaus stanniford       june 4th 1887                                       these are very private family matters for me to inflict upon you said my companion apologetically you must look upon it as done in your professional capacity i have wanted to speak about it for years  i am honoured by your confidence i answered and exceedingly interested by the facts  my father was a man who was noted for his almost morbid love of truth he was always pedantically accurate when he said therefore that he hoped to see my mother very soon and when he said that he had nothing to be ashamed of in that dark room you may rely upon it that he meant it  then what can it be i ejaculated  neither my mother nor i could imagine we carried out his wishes to the letter and placed the seal upon the door there it has been ever since my mother lived for five years after my fathers disappearance although at the time all the doctors said that she could not survive long her heart was terribly diseased during the first few months she had two letters from my father both had the paris postmark but no address they were short and to the same effect that they would soon be reunited and that she should not fret then there was a silence which lasted until her death and then came a letter to me of so private a nature that i cannot show it to you begging me never to think evil of him giving me much good advice and saying that the sealing of the room was of less importance now than during the lifetime of my mother but that the opening might still cause pain to others and that therefore he thought it best that it should be postponed until my twentyfirst year for the lapse of time would make things easier in the meantime he committed the care of the room to me so now you can understand how it is that although i am a very poor man i can neither let nor sell this great house  you could mortgage it  my father had already done so  it is a most singular state of affairs  my mother and i were gradually compelled to sell the furniture and to dismiss the servants until now as you see i am living unattended in a single room but i have only two more months  what do you mean  why that in two months i come of age the first thing that i do will be to open that door the second to get rid of the house  why should your father have continued to stay away when these investments had recovered themselves  he must be dead  you say that he had not committed any legal offence when he fled the country  none  why should he not take your mother with him  i do not know  why should he conceal his address  i do not know  why should he allow your mother to die and be buried without coming back  i do not know  my dear sir said i if i may speak with the frankness of a professional adviser i should say that it is very clear that your father had the strongest reasons for keeping out of the country and that if nothing has been proved against him he at least thought that something might be and refused to put himself within the power of the law surely that must be obvious for in what other possible way can the facts be explained  my companion did not take my suggestion in good part  you had not the advantage of knowing my father mr alder he said coldly i was only a boy when he left us but i shall always look upon him as my ideal man his only fault was that he was too sensitive and too unselfish that any one should lose money through him would cut him to the heart his sense of honour was most acute any theory of his disappearance which conflicts with that is a mistaken one  it pleased me to hear the lad speak out so roundly and yet i knew that the facts were against him and that he was incapable of taking an unprejudiced view of the situation  i only speak as an outsider said i and now i must leave you for i have a long walk before me your story has interested me so much that i should be glad if you could let me know the sequel  leave me your card said he and so having bade him goodnight i left him  i heard nothing more of the matter for some time and had almost feared that it would prove to be one of those fleeting experiences which drift away from our direct observation and end only in a hope or a suspicion one afternoon however a card bearing the name of mr j h perceval was brought up to my office in abchurch lane and its bearer a small dry brighteyed fellow of fifty was ushered in by the clerk  i believe sir said he that my name has been mentioned to you by my young friend mr felix stanniford  of course i answered i remember  he spoke to you i understand about the circumstances in connection with the disappearance of my former employer mr stanislaus stanniford and the existence of a sealed room in his former residence  he did  and you expressed an interest in the matter  it interested me extremely  you are aware that we hold mr stannifords permission to open the door on the twentyfirst birthday of his son  i remember  the twentyfirst birthday is today  have you opened it i asked eagerly  not yet sir said he gravely i have reason to believe that it would be well to have witnesses present when that door is opened you are a lawyer and you are acquainted with the facts will you be present on the occasion  most certainly  you are employed during the day and so am i shall we meet at nine oclock at the house  i will come with pleasure  then you will find us waiting for you goodbye for the present he bowed solemnly and took his leave  i kept my appointment that evening with a brain which was weary with fruitless attempts to think out some plausible explanation of the mystery which we were about to solve mr perceval and my young acquaintance were waiting for me in the little room i was not surprised to see the young man looking pale and nervous but i was rather astonished to find the dry little city man in a state of intense though partially suppressed excitement his cheeks were flushed his hands twitching and he could not stand still for an instant  stanniford greeted me warmly and thanked me many times for having come and now perceval said he to his companion i suppose there is no obstacle to our putting the thing through without delay i shall be glad to get it over  the bankers clerk took up the lamp and led the way but he paused in the passage outside the door and his hand was shaking so that the light flickered up and down the high bare walls  mr stanniford said he in a cracking voice i hope you will prepare yourself in case any shock should be awaiting you when that seal is removed and the door is opened  what could there be perceval you are trying to frighten me  no mr stanniford but i should wish you to be ready  to be braced up  not to allow yourself  he had to lick his dry lips between every jerky sentence and i suddenly realised as clearly as if he had told me that he knew what was behind that closed door and that it was something terrible here are the keys mr stanniford but remember my warning  he had a bunch of assorted keys in his hand and the young man snatched them from him then he thrust a knife under the discoloured seal and jerked it off the lamp was rattling and shaking in percevals hands so i took it from him and held it near the keyhole while stanniford tried key after key at last one turned in the lock the door flew open he took one step into the room and then with a horrible cry the young man fell senseless at our feet  if i had not given heed to the clerks warning and braced myself for a shock i should certainly have dropped the lamp the room windowless and bare was fitted up as a photographic laboratory with a tap and sink at the side of it a shelf of bottles and measures stood at one side and a peculiar heavy smell partly chemical partly animal filled the air a single table and chair were in front of us and at this with his back turned towards us a man was seated in the act of writing his outline and attitude were as natural as life but as the light fell upon him it made my hair rise to see that the nape of his neck was black and wrinkled and no thicker than my wrist dust lay upon himthick yellow dustupon his hair his shoulders his shrivelled lemoncoloured hands his head had fallen forward upon his breast his pen still rested upon a discoloured sheet of paper  my poor master my poor poor master cried the clerk and the tears were running down his cheeks  what i cried mr stanislaus stanniford  here he has sat for seven years oh why would he do it i begged him i implored him i went on my knees to him but he would have his way you see the key on the table he had locked the door upon the inside and he has written something we must take it  yes yes take it and for gods sake let us get out of this i cried the air is poisonous come stanniford come taking an arm each we half led and half carried the terrified man back to his own room  it was my father he cried as he recovered his consciousness he is sitting there dead in his chair you knew it perceval this was what you meant when you warned me  yes i knew it mr stanniford i have acted for the best all along but my position has been a terribly difficult one for seven years i have known that your father was dead in that room  you knew it and never told us  dont be harsh with me mr stanniford sir make allowance for a man who has had a hard part to play  my head is swimming round i cannot grasp it he staggered up and helped himself from the brandy bottle these letters to my mother and to myselfwere they forgeries  no sir your father wrote them and addressed them and left them in my keeping to be posted i have followed his instructions to the very letter in all things he was my master and i have obeyed him  the brandy had steadied the young mans shaken nerves tell me about it i can stand it now said he  well mr stanniford you know that at one time there came a period of great trouble upon your father and he thought that many poor people were about to lose their savings through his fault he was a man who was so tenderhearted that he could not bear the thought it worried him and tormented him until he determined to end his life oh mr stanniford if you knew how i have prayed him and wrestled with him over it you would never blame me and he in turn prayed me as no man has ever prayed me before he had made up his mind and he would do it in any case he said but it rested with me whether his death should be happy and easy or whether it should be most miserable i read in his eyes that he meant what he said and at last i yielded to his prayers and i consented to do his will  what was troubling him was this he had been told by the first doctor in london that his wifes heart would fail at the slightest shock he had a horror of accelerating her end and yet his own existence had become unendurable to him how could he end himself without injuring her  you know now the course that he took he wrote the letter which she received there was nothing in it which was not literally true when he spoke of seeing her again so soon he was referring to her own approaching death which he had been assured could not be delayed more than a very few months so convinced was he of this that he only left two letters to be forwarded at intervals after his death she lived five years and i had no letters to send  he left another letter with me to be sent to you sir upon the occasion of the death of your mother i posted all these in paris to sustain the idea of his being abroad it was his wish that i should say nothing and i have said nothing i have been a faithful servant seven years after his death he thought no doubt that the shock to the feelings of his surviving friends would be lessened he was always considerate for others  there was a silence for some time it was broken by young stanniford  i cannot blame you perceval you have spared my mother a shock which would certainly have broken her heart what is that paper  it is what your father was writing sir shall i read it to you  do so  i have taken the poison and i feel it working in my veins it is strange but not painful when these words are read i shall if my wishes have been faithfully carried out have been dead many years surely no one who has lost money through me will still bear me animosity and you felix you will forgive me this family scandal may god find rest for a sorely wearied spirit  amen we cried all three     tales of medical life     vii  a physiologists wife   professor ainslie grey had not come down to breakfast at the usual hour the presentation chimingclock which stood between the terracotta busts of claude bernard and of john hunter upon the diningroom mantelpiece had rung out the halfhour and the threequarters now its golden hand was verging upon the nine and yet there were no signs of the master of the house  it was an unprecedented occurrence during the twelve years that she had kept house for him his younger sister had never known him a second behind his time she sat now in front of the high silver coffeepot uncertain whether to order the gong to be resounded or to wait on in silence either course might be a mistake her brother was not a man who permitted mistakes  miss ainslie grey was rather above the middle height thin with peering puckered eyes and the rounded shoulders which mark the bookish woman her face was long and spare flecked with colour above the cheekbones with a reasonable thoughtful forehead and a dash of absolute obstinacy in her thin lips and prominent chin snowwhite cuffs and collar with a plain dark dress cut with almost quakerlike simplicity bespoke the primness of her taste an ebony cross hung over her flattened chest she sat very upright in her chair listening with raised eyebrows and swinging her eyeglasses backwards and forwards with a nervous gesture which was peculiar to her  suddenly she gave a sharp satisfied jerk of the head and began to pour out the coffee from outside there came the dull thudding sound of heavy feet upon thick carpet the door swung open and the professor entered with a quick nervous step he nodded to his sister and seating himself at the other side of the table began to open the small pile of letters which lay beside his plate  professor ainslie grey was at that time fortythree years of agenearly twelve years older than his sister his career had been a brilliant one at edinburgh at cambridge and at vienna he had laid the foundations of his great reputation both in physiology and in zoology  his pamphlet on the mesoblastic origin of excitomotor nerve roots had won him his fellowship of the royal society and his researches upon the nature of bathybius with some remarks upon lithococci had been translated into at least three european languages he had been referred to by one of the greatest living authorities as being the very type and embodiment of all that was best in modern science no wonder then that when the commercial city of birchespool decided to create a medical school they were only too glad to confer the chair of physiology upon mr ainslie grey they valued him the more from the conviction that their class was only one step in his upward journey and that the first vacancy would remove him to some more illustrious seat of learning  in person he was not unlike his sister the same eyes the same contour the same intellectual forehead his lips however were firmer and his long thin lower jaw was sharper and more decided he ran his finger and thumb down it from time to time as he glanced over his letters  those maids are very noisy he remarked as a clack of tongues sounded in the distance  it is sarah said his sister i shall speak about it  she had handed over his coffeecup and was sipping at her own glancing furtively through her narrowed lids at the austere face of her brother  the first great advance of the human race said the professor was when by the development of their left frontal convolutions they attained the power of speech their second advance was when they learned to control that power woman has not yet attained the second stage  he half closed his eyes as he spoke and thrust his chin forward but as he ceased he had a trick of suddenly opening both eyes very wide and staring sternly at his interlocutor  i am not garrulous john said his sister  no ada in many respects you approach the superior or male type  the professor bowed over his egg with the manner of one who utters a courtly compliment but the lady pouted and gave an impatient little shrug of her shoulders  you were late this morning john she remarked after a pause  yes ada i slept badly some little cerebral congestion no doubt due to overstimulation of the centres of thought i have been a little disturbed in my mind  his sister stared across at him in astonishment the professors mental processes had hitherto been as regular as his habits twelve years continual intercourse had taught her that he lived in a serene and rarefied atmosphere of scientific calm high above the petty emotions which affect humbler minds  you are surprised ada he remarked well i cannot wonder at it i should have been surprised myself if i had been told that i was so sensitive to vascular influences for after all all disturbances are vascular if you probe them deep enough i am thinking of getting married  not mrs ojames cried ada grey laying down her eggspoon  my dear you have the feminine quality of receptivity very remarkably developed mrs ojames is the lady in question  but you know so little of her the esdailes themselves know so little she is really only an acquaintance although she is staying at the lindens would it not be wise to speak to mrs esdaile first john  i do not think ada that mrs esdaile is at all likely to say anything which would materially affect my course of action i have given the matter due consideration the scientific mind is slow at arriving at conclusions but having once formed them it is not prone to change matrimony is the natural condition of the human race i have as you know been so engaged in academical and other work that i have had no time to devote to merely personal questions it is different now and i see no valid reason why i should forego this opportunity of seeking a suitable helpmate  and you are engaged  hardly that ada i ventured yesterday to indicate to the lady that i was prepared to submit to the common lot of humanity i shall wait upon her after my morning lecture and learn how far my proposals meet with her acquiescence but you frown ada  his sister started and made an effort to conceal her expression of annoyance she even stammered out some few words of congratulation but a vacant look had come into her brothers eyes and he was evidently not listening to her  i am sure john she said that i wish you the happiness which you deserve if i hesitated at all it is because i know how much is at stake and because the thing is so sudden so unexpected her thin white hand stole up to the black cross upon her bosom these are moments when we need guidance john if i could persuade you to turn to spiritual  the professor waved the suggestion away with a deprecating hand  it is useless to reopen that question he said we cannot argue upon it you assume more than i can grant i am forced to dispute your premises we have no common basis  his sister sighed  you have no faith she said  i have faith in those great evolutionary forces which are leading the human race to some unknown but elevated goal  you believe in nothing  on the contrary my dear ada i believe in the differentiation of protoplasm  she shook her head sadly it was the one subject upon which she ventured to dispute her brothers infallibility  this is rather beside the question remarked the professor folding up his napkin if i am not mistaken there is some possibility of another matrimonial event occurring in the family eh ada what  his small eyes glittered with sly facetiousness as he shot a twinkle at his sister she sat very stiff and traced patterns upon the cloth with the sugartongs  dr james mmurdo obrien said the professor sonorously  dont john dont cried miss ainslie grey  dr james mmurdo obrien continued her brother inexorably is a man who has already made his mark upon the science of the day he is my first and my most distinguished pupil i assure you ada that his remarks upon the bilepigments with special reference to urobilin is likely to live as a classic it is not too much to say that he has revolutionised our views about urobilin  he paused but his sister sat silent with bent head and flushed cheeks the little ebony cross rose and fell with her hurried breathings  dr james mmurdo obrien has as you know the offer of the physiological chair at melbourne he has been in australia five years and has a brilliant future before him today he leaves us for edinburgh and in two months time he goes out to take over his new duties you know his feeling towards you it rests with you as to whether he goes out alone speaking for myself i cannot imagine any higher mission for a woman of culture than to go through life in the company of a man who is capable of such a research as that which dr james mmurdo obrien has brought to a successful conclusion  he has not spoken to me murmured the lady  ah there are signs which are more subtle than speech said her brother wagging his head you are pale your vasomotor system is excited your arterioles have contracted let me entreat you to compose yourself i think i hear the carriage i fancy that you may have a visitor this morning ada you will excuse me now  with a quick glance at the clock he strode off into the hall and within a few minutes he was rattling in his quiet wellappointed brougham through the bricklined streets of birchespool  his lecture over professor ainslie grey paid a visit to his laboratory where he adjusted several scientific instruments made a note as to the progress of three separate infusions of bacteria cut half a dozen sections with a microtome and finally resolved the difficulties of seven different gentlemen who were pursuing researches in as many separate lines of inquiry having thus conscientiously and methodically completed the routine of his duties he returned to his carriage and ordered the coachman to drive him to the lindens his face as he drove was cold and impassive but he drew his fingers from time to time down his prominent chin with a jerky twitchy movement  the lindens was an oldfashioned ivyclad house which had once been in the country but was now caught in the long redbrick feelers of the growing city it still stood back from the road in the privacy of its own grounds a winding path lined with laurel bushes led to the arched and porticoed entrance to the right was a lawn and at the far side under the shadow of a hawthorn a lady sat in a gardenchair with a book in her hands at the click of the gate she started and the professor catching sight of her turned away from the door and strode in her direction  what wont you go in and see mrs esdaile she asked sweeping out from under the shadow of the hawthorn  she was a small woman strongly feminine from the rich coils of her lightcoloured hair to the dainty garden slipper which peeped from under her creamtinted dress one tiny wellgloved hand was outstretched in greeting while the other pressed a thick greencovered volume against her side her decision and quick tactful manner bespoke the mature woman of the world but her upraised face had preserved a girlish and even infantile expression of innocence in its large fearless grey eyes and sensitive humorous mouth mrs ojames was a widow and she was twoandthirty years of age but neither fact could have been deduced from her appearance  you will surely go in and see mrs esdaile she repeated glancing up at him with eyes which had in them something between a challenge and a caress  i did not come to see mrs esdaile he answered with no relaxation of his cold and grave manner i came to see you  i am sure i should be highly honoured she said with just the slightest little touch of brogue in her accent what are the students to do without their professor  i have already completed my academic duties take my arm and we shall walk in the sunshine surely we cannot wonder that eastern people should have made a deity of the sun it is the great beneficent force of naturemans ally against cold sterility and all that is abhorrent to him what were you reading  hales matter and life  the professor raised his thick eyebrows  hale he said and then again in a kind of whisper hale  you differ from him she asked  it is not i who differ from him i am only a monada thing of no moment the whole tendency of the highest plane of modern thought differs from him he defends the indefensible he is an excellent observer but a feeble reasoner i should not recommend you to found your conclusions upon hale  i must read natures chronicle to counteract his pernicious influence said mrs ojames with a soft cooing laugh  natures chronicle was one of the many books in which professor ainslie grey had enforced the negative doctrines of scientific agnosticism  it is a faulty work said he i cannot recommend it i would rather refer you to the standard writings of some of my older and more eloquent colleagues  there was a pause in their talk as they paced up and down on the green velvetlike lawn in the genial sunshine  have you thought at all he asked at last of the matter upon which i spoke to you last night  she said nothing but walked by his side with her eyes averted and her face aslant  i would not hurry you unduly he continued i know that it is a matter which can scarcely be decided offhand in my own case it cost me some thought before i ventured to make the suggestion i am not an emotional man but i am conscious in your presence of the great evolutionary instinct which makes either sex the complement of the other  you believe in love then she asked with a twinkling upward glance  i am forced to  and yet you can deny the soul  how far these questions are psychic and how far material is still sub judice said the professor with an air of toleration protoplasm may prove to be the physical basis of love as well as of life  how inflexible you are she exclaimed you would draw love down to the level of physics  or draw physics up to the level of love  come that is much better she cried with her sympathetic laugh that is really very pretty and puts science in quite a delightful light  her eyes sparkled and she tossed her chin with a pretty wilful air of a woman who is mistress of the situation  i have reason to believe said the professor that my position here will prove to be only a steppingstone to some wider scene of scientific activity yet even here my chair brings me in some fifteen hundred pounds a year which is supplemented by a few hundreds from my books i should therefore be in a position to provide you with those comforts to which you are accustomed so much for my pecuniary position as to my constitution it has always been sound i have never suffered from any illness in my life save fleeting attacks of cephalalgia the result of too prolonged a stimulation of the centres of cerebration my father and mother had no sign of any morbid diathesis but i will not conceal from you that my grandfather was afflicted with podagra  mrs ojames looked startled  is that very serious she asked  it is gout said the professor  oh is that all it sounded much worse than that  it is a grave taint but i trust that i shall not be a victim to atavism i have laid these facts before you because they are factors which cannot be overlooked in forming your decision may i ask now whether you see your way to accepting my proposal  he paused in his walk and looked earnestly and expectantly down at her  a struggle was evidently going on in her mind her eyes were cast down her little slipper tapped the lawn and her fingers played nervously with her chatelain suddenly with a sharp quick gesture which had in it something of abandon and recklessness she held out her hand to her companion  i accept she said  they were standing under the shadow of the hawthorn he stooped gravely down and kissed her glovecovered fingers  i trust that you may never have cause to regret your decision he said  i trust that you never may she cried with a heaving breast  there were tears in her eyes and her lips twitched with some strong emotion  come into the sunshine again said he it is the great restorative your nerves are shaken some little congestion of the medulla and pons it is always instructive to reduce psychic or emotional conditions to their physical equivalents you feel that your anchor is still firm in a bottom of ascertained fact  but it is so dreadfully unromantic said mrs ojames with her old twinkle  romance is the offspring of imagination and of ignorance where science throws her calm clear light there is happily no room for romance  but is not love romance she asked  not at all love has been taken away from the poets and has been brought within the domain of true science it may prove to be one of the great cosmic elementary forces when the atom of hydrogen draws the atom of chlorine towards it to form the perfected molecule of hydrochloric acid the force which it exerts may be intrinsically similar to that which draws me to you attraction and repulsion appear to be the primary forces this is attraction  and here is repulsion said mrs ojames as a stout florid lady came sweeping across the lawn in their direction so glad you have come out mrs esdaile here is professor grey  how do you do professor said the lady with some little pomposity of manner you were very wise to stay out here on so lovely a day is it not heavenly  it is certainly very fine weather the professor answered  listen to the wind sighing in the trees cried mrs esdaile holding up one finger it is natures lullaby could you not imagine it professor grey to be the whisperings of angels  the idea had not occurred to me madam  ah professor i have always the same complaint against you a want of rapport with the deeper meanings of nature shall i say a want of imagination you do not feel an emotional thrill at the singing of that thrush  i confess that i am not conscious of one mrs esdaile  or at the delicate tint of that background of leaves see the rich greens  chlorophyll murmured the professor  science is so hopelessly prosaic it dissects and labels and loses sight of the great things in its attention to the little ones you have a poor opinion of womans intellect professor grey i think that i have heard you say so  it is a question of avoirdupois said the professor closing his eyes and shrugging his shoulders the female cerebrum averages two ounces less in weight than the male no doubt there are exceptions nature is always elastic  but the heaviest thing is not always the strongest said mrs ojames laughing isnt there a law of compensation in science may we not hope to make up in quality what we lack in quantity  i think not remarked the professor gravely but there is your luncheongong no thank you mrs esdaile i cannot stay my carriage is waiting goodbye goodbye mrs ojames  he raised his hat and stalked slowly away among the laurel bushes  he has no taste said mrs esdaileno eye for beauty  on the contrary mrs ojames answered with a saucy little jerk of the chin he has just asked me to be his wife                                       as professor ainslie grey ascended the steps of his house the halldoor opened and a dapper gentleman stepped briskly out he was somewhat sallow in the face with dark beady eyes and a short black beard with an aggressive bristle thought and work had left their traces upon his face but he moved with the brisk activity of a man who had not yet bade goodbye to his youth  im in lucks way he cried i wanted to see you  then come back into the library said the professor you must stay and have lunch with us  the two men entered the hall and the professor led the way into his private sanctum he motioned his companion into an armchair  i trust that you have been successful obrien said he i should be loath to exercise any undue pressure upon my sister ada but i have given her to understand that there is no one whom i should prefer for a brotherinlaw to my most brilliant scholar the author of some remarks upon the bilepigments with special reference to urobilin  you are very kind professor greyyou have always been very kind said the other i approached miss grey upon the subject she did not say no  she said yes then  no she proposed to leave the matter open until my return from edinburgh i go today as you know and i hope to commence my research tomorrow  on the comparative anatomy of the vermiform appendix by james mmurdo obrien said the professor sonorously it is a glorious subjecta subject which lies at the very root of evolutionary philosophy  ah she is the dearest girl cried obrien with a sudden little spurt of celtic enthusiasmshe is the soul of truth and of honour  the vermiform appendix began the professor  she is an angel from heaven interrupted the other i fear that it is my advocacy of scientific freedom in religious thought which stands in my way with her  you must not truckle upon that point you must be true to your convictions let there be no compromise there  my reason is true to agnosticism and yet i am conscious of a voida vacuum i had feelings at the old church at home between the scent of the incense and the roll of the organ such as i have never experienced in the laboratory or the lectureroom  sensuouspurely sensuous said the professor rubbing his chin vague hereditary tendencies stirred into life by the stimulation of the nasal and auditory nerves  maybe so maybe so the younger man answered thoughtfully but this was not what i wished to speak to you about before i enter your family your sister and you have a claim to know all that i can tell you about my career of my worldly prospects i have already spoken to you there is only one point which i have omitted to mention i am a widower  the professor raised his eyebrows  this is news indeed said he  i married shortly after my arrival in australia miss thurston was her name i met her in society it was a most unhappy match  some painful emotion possessed him his quick expressive features quivered and his white hands tightened upon the arms of the chair the professor turned away towards the window  you are the best judge he remarked but i should not think that it was necessary to go into details  you have a right to know everythingyou and miss grey it is not a matter on which i can well speak to her direct poor jinny was the best of women but she was open to flattery and liable to be misled by designing persons she was untrue to me grey it is a hard thing to say of the dead but she was untrue to me she fled to auckland with a man whom she had known before her marriage the brig which carried them foundered and not a soul was saved  this is very painful obrien said the professor with a deprecatory motion of his hand i cannot see however how it affects your relation to my sister  i have eased my conscience said obrien rising from his chair i have told you all that there is to tell i should not like the story to reach you through any lips but my own  you are right obrien your action has been most honourable and considerate but you are not to blame in the matter save that perhaps you showed a little precipitancy in choosing a lifepartner without due care and inquiry  obrien drew his hand across his eyes  poor girl he cried god help me i love her still but i must go  you will lunch with us  no professor i have my packing still to do i have already bade miss grey adieu in two months i shall see you again  you will probably find me a married man  married  yes i have been thinking of it  my dear professor let me congratulate you with all my heart i had no idea who is the lady  mrs ojames is her namea widow of the same nationality as yourself but to return to matters of importance i should be very happy to see the proofs of your paper upon the vermiform appendix i may be able to furnish you with material for a footnote or two  your assistance will be invaluable to me said obrien with enthusiasm and the two men parted in the hall the professor walked back into the diningroom where his sister was already seated at the luncheontable  i shall be married at the registrars he remarked i should strongly recommend you to do the same  professor ainslie grey was as good as his word a fortnights cessation of his classes gave him an opportunity which was too good to let pass mrs ojames was an orphan without relations and almost without friends in the country there was no obstacle in the way of a speedy wedding they were married accordingly in the quietest manner possible and went off to cambridge together where the professor and his charming wife were present at several academic observances and varied the routine of their honeymoon by incursions into biological laboratories and medical libraries scientific friends were loud in their congratulations not only upon mrs greys beauty but upon the unusual quickness and intelligence she displayed in discussing physiological questions the professor was himself astonished at the accuracy of her information you have a remarkable range of knowledge for a woman jeannette he remarked upon more than one occasion he was even prepared to admit that her cerebrum might be of the normal weight  one foggy drizzling morning they returned to birchespool for the next day would reopen the session and professor ainslie grey prided himself upon having never once in his life failed to appear in his lectureroom at the very stroke of the hour miss ada grey welcomed them with a constrained cordiality handed over the keys of office to the new mistress mrs grey pressed her warmly to remain but she explained that she had already accepted an invitation which would engage her for some months the same evening she departed for the south of england  a couple of days later the maid carried a card just after breakfast into the library where the professor sat revising his morning lecture it announced the rearrival of dr james mmurdo obrien their meeting was effusively genial on the part of the younger man and coldly precise on that of his former teacher  you see there have been changes said the professor  so i heard miss grey told me in her letters and i read the notice in the british medical journal so its really married you are how quickly and quietly you have managed it all  i am constitutionally averse to anything in the nature of show or ceremony my wife is a sensible womani may even go the length of saying that for a woman she is abnormally sensible she quite agreed with me in the course which i have adopted  and your research on vallisneria  this matrimonial incident has interrupted it but i have resumed my classes and we shall soon be quite in harness again  i must see miss grey before i leave england we have corresponded and i think that all will be well she must come out with me i dont think i could go without her  the professor shook his head  your nature is not so weak as you pretend he said questions of this sort are after all quite subordinate to the great duties of life  obrien smiled  you would have me take out my celtic soul and put in a saxon one he said either my brain is too small or my heart is too big but when may i call and pay my respects to mrs grey will she be at home this afternoon  she is at home now come into the morningroom she will be glad to make your acquaintance  they walked across the linoleumpaved hall the professor opened the door of the room and walked in followed by his friend mrs grey was sitting in a basketchair by the window light and fairylike in a looseflowing pink morning gown seeing a visitor she rose and swept towards them the professor heard a dull thud behind him obrien had fallen back into a chair with his hand pressed tight to his side  jinny he gaspedjinny  mrs grey stopped dead in her advance and stared at him with a face from which every expression had been struck out save one of astonishment and horror then with a sharp intaking of the breath she reeled and would have fallen had the professor not thrown his long nervous arm round her  try this sofa said he  she sank back among the cushions with the same white cold dead look upon her face the professor stood with his back to the empty fireplace and glanced from the one to the other  so obrien he said at last you have already made the acquaintance of my wife  your wife cried his friend hoarsely she is no wife of yours god help me she is my wife  the professor stood rigidly upon the hearthrug his long thin fingers were intertwined and his head had sunk a little forward his two companions had eyes only for each other  jinny said he  james  how could you leave me so jinny how could you have the heart to do it i thought you were dead i mourned for your deathay and you have made me mourn for you living you have withered my life  she made no answer but lay back among the cushions with her eyes still fixed upon him  why do you not speak  because you are right james i have treated you cruellyshamefully but it is not as bad as you think  you fled with de horta  no i did not at the last moment my better nature prevailed he went alone but i was ashamed to come back after what i had written to you i could not face you i took passage alone to england under a new name and here i have lived ever since it seemed to me that i was beginning life again i knew that you thought i was drowned who could have dreamed that fate would throw us together again when the professor asked me  she stopped and gave a gasp for breath  you are faint said the professorkeep the head low it aids the cerebral circulation he flattened down the cushion i am sorry to leave you obrien but i have my class duties to look to possibly i may find you here when i return  with a grim and rigid face he strode out of the room not one of the three hundred students who listened to his lecture saw any change in his manner and appearance or could have guessed that the austere gentleman in front of them had found out at last how hard it is to rise above ones humanity the lecture over he performed his routine duties in the laboratory and then drove back to his own house he did not enter by the front door but passed through the garden to the folding glass casement which led out of the morningroom as he approached he heard his wifes voice and obriens in loud and animated talk he paused among the rosebushes uncertain whether to interrupt them or no nothing was further from his nature than to play the eavesdropper but as he stood still hesitating words fell upon his ear which struck him rigid and motionless  you are still my wife jinny said obrien i forgive you from the bottom of my heart i love you and i have never ceased to love you though you had forgotten me  no james my heart was always in melbourne i have always been yours i thought that it was better for you that i should seem to be dead  you must choose between us now jinny if you determine to remain here i shall not open my lips there shall be no scandal if on the other hand you come with me its little i care about the worlds opinion perhaps i am as much to blame as you are i thought too much of my work and too little of my wife  the professor heard the cooing caressing laugh which he knew so well  i shall go with you james she said  and the professor  the poor professor but he will not mind much james he has no heart  we must tell him our resolution  there is no need said professor ainslie grey stepping in through the open casement i have overheard the latter part of your conversation i hesitated to interrupt you before you came to a conclusion  obrien stretched out his hand and took that of the woman they stood together with the sunshine on their faces the professor paused at the casement with his hands behind his back and his long black shadow fell between them  you have come to a wise decision said he go back to australia together and let what has passed be blotted out of your lives  but youyou stammered obrien  the professor waved his hand  never trouble about me he said  the woman gave a gasping cry  what can i do or say she wailed how could i have foreseen this i thought my old life was dead but it has come back again with all its hopes and its desires what can i say to you ainslie i have brought shame and disgrace upon a worthy man i have blasted your life how you must hate and loathe me i wish to god that i had never been born  i neither hate nor loathe you jeannette said the professor quietly you are wrong in regretting your birth for you have a worthy mission before you in aiding the lifework of a man who has shown himself capable of the highest order of scientific research i cannot with justice blame you personally for what has occurred how far the individual monad is to be held responsible for hereditary and engrained tendencies is a question upon which science has not yet said her last word  he stood with his fingertips touching and his body inclined as one who is gravely expounding a difficult and impersonal subject obrien had stepped forward to say something but the others attitude and manner froze the words upon his lips condolence or sympathy would be an impertinence to one who could so easily merge his private griefs in broad questions of abstract philosophy  it is needless to prolong the situation the professor continued in the same measured tones my brougham stands at the door i beg that you will use it as your own perhaps it would be as well that you should leave the town without unnecessary delay your things jeannette shall be forwarded  obrien hesitated with a hanging head  i hardly dare offer you my hand he said  on the contrary i think that of the three of us you come best out of the affair you have nothing to be ashamed of  your sister  i shall see that the matter is put to her in its true light goodbye let me have a copy of your recent research goodbye jeannette  goodbye  their hands met and for one short moment their eyes also it was only a glance but for the first and last time the womans intuition cast a light for itself into the dark places of a strong mans soul she gave a little gasp and her other hand rested for an instant as white and as light as thistledown upon his shoulder  james james she cried dont you see that he is stricken to the heart  he turned her quietly away from him  i am not an emotional man he said i have my dutiesmy research on vallisneria the brougham is there your cloak is in the hall tell john where you wish to be driven he will faring you anything you need now go  his last two words were so sudden so volcanic in such contrast to his measured voice and masklike face that they swept the two away from him he closed the door behind them and paced slowly up and down the room then he passed into the library and looked out over the wire blind the carriage was rolling away he caught a last glimpse of the woman who had been his wife he saw the feminine droop of her head and the curve of her beautiful throat  under some foolish aimless impulse he took a few quick steps towards the door then he turned and throwing himself into his study chair he plunged back into his work                                       there was little scandal about this singular domestic incident the professor had few personal friends and seldom went into society his marriage had been so quiet that most of his colleagues had never ceased to regard him as a bachelor mrs esdaile and a few others might talk but their field for gossip was limited for they could only guess vaguely at the cause of this sudden separation  the professor was as punctual as ever at his classes and as zealous in directing the laboratory work of those who studied under him his own private researches were pushed on with feverish energy it was no uncommon thing for his servants when they came down of a morning to hear the shrill scratchings of his tireless pen or to meet him on the staircase as he ascended grey and silent to his room in vain his friends assured him that such a life must undermine his health he lengthened his hours until day and night were one long ceaseless task  gradually under this discipline a change came over his appearance his features always inclined to gauntness became even sharper and more pronounced there were deep lines about his temples and across his brow his cheek was sunken and his complexion bloodless his knees gave under him when he walked and once when passing out of his lectureroom he fell and had to be assisted to his carriage  this was just before the end of the session and soon after the holidays commenced the professors who still remained in birchespool were shocked to hear that their brother of the chair of physiology had sunk so low that no hopes could be entertained of his recovery two eminent physicians had consulted over his case without being able to give a name to the affection from which he suffered a steadily decreasing vitality appeared to be the only symptoma bodily weakness which left the mind unclouded he was much interested himself in his own case and made notes of his subjective sensations as an aid to diagnosis of his approaching end he spoke in his usual unemotional and somewhat pedantic fashion it is the assertion he said of the liberty of the individual cell as opposed to the cellcommune it is the dissolution of a cooperative society the process is one of great interest  and so one grey morning his cooperative society dissolved very quietly and softly he sank into his eternal sleep his two physicians felt some slight embarrassment when called upon to fill in his certificate  it is difficult to give it a name said one  very said the other  if he were not such an unemotional man i should have said that he had died from some sudden nervous shockfrom in fact what the vulgar would call a broken heart  i dont think poor grey was that sort of a man at all  let us call it cardiac anyhow said the other physician  so they did so     viii  behind the times   my first interview with dr james winter was under dramatic circumstances it occurred at two in the morning in the bedroom of an old country house i kicked him twice on the white waistcoat and knocked off his gold spectacles while he with the aid of a female accomplice stifled my angry cries in a flannel petticoat and thrust me into a warm bath i am told that one of my parents who happened to be present remarked in a whisper that there was nothing the matter with my lungs i cannot recall how dr winter looked at the time for i had other things to think of but his description of my own appearance is far from flattering a fluffy head a body like a trussed goose very bandy legs and feet with the soles turned inwardsthose are the main items which he can remember  from this time onwards the epochs of my life were the periodical assaults which dr winter made upon me he vaccinated me he cut me for an abscess he blistered me for mumps it was a world of peace and he the one dark cloud that threatened but at last there came a time of real illnessa time when i lay for months together inside my wickerwork basket bed and then it was that i learned that that hard face could relax that those countrymade creaking boots could steal very gently to a bedside and that that rough voice could thin into a whisper when it spoke to a sick child  and now the child is himself a medical man and yet dr winter is the same as ever i can see no change since first i can remember him save that perhaps the brindled hair is a trifle whiter and the huge shoulders a little more bowed he is a very tall man though he loses a couple of inches from his stoop that big back of his has curved itself over sick beds until it has set in that shape his face is of a walnut brown and tells of long winter drives over bleak country roads with the wind and the rain in his teeth it looks smooth at a little distance but as you approach him you see that it is shot with innumerable fine wrinkles like a last years apple they are hardly to be seen when he is in repose but when he laughs his face breaks like a starred glass and you realise then that though he looks old he must be older than he looks  how old that is i could never discover i have often tried to find out and have struck his stream as high up as george the fourth and even of the regency but without ever getting quite to the source his mind must have been open to impressions very early but it must also have closed early for the politics of the day have little interest for him while he is fiercely excited about questions which are entirely prehistoric he shakes his head when he speaks of the first reform bill and expresses grave doubts as to its wisdom and i have heard him when he was warmed by a glass of wine say bitter things about robert peel and his abandoning of the corn laws the death of that statesman brought the history of england to a definite close and dr winter refers to everything which had happened since then as to an insignificant anticlimax  but it was only when i had myself become a medical man that i was able to appreciate how entirely he is a survival of a past generation he had learned his medicine under that obsolete and forgotten system by which a youth was apprenticed to a surgeon in the days when the study of anatomy was often approached through a violated grave his views upon his own profession are even more reactionary than his politics fifty years have brought him little and deprived him of less vaccination was well within the teaching of his youth though i think he has a secret preference for inoculation bleeding he would practise freely but for public opinion chloroform he regards as a dangerous innovation and he always clicks with his tongue when it is mentioned he has even been known to say vain things about laennec and to refer to the stethoscope as a newfangled french toy he carries one in his hat out of deference to the expectations of his patients but he is very hard of hearing so that it makes little difference whether he uses it or not  he always reads as a duty his weekly medical paper so that he has a general idea as to the advance of modern science he persists in looking upon it however as a huge and rather ludicrous experiment the germ theory of disease set him chuckling for a long time and his favourite joke in the sickroom was to say shut the door or the germs will be getting in as to the darwinian theory it struck him as being the crowning joke of the century the children in the nursery and the ancestors in the stable he would cry and laugh the tears out of his eyes  he is so very much behind the day that occasionally as things move round in their usual circle he finds himself to his own bewilderment in the front of the fashion dietetic treatment for example had been much in vogue in his youth and he has more practical knowledge of it than any one whom i have met massage too was familiar to him when it was new to our generation he had been trained also at a time when instruments were in a rudimentary state and when men learned to trust more to their own fingers he has a model surgical hand muscular in the palm tapering in the fingers with an eye at the end of each i shall not easily forget how dr patterson and i cut sir john sirwell the county member and were unable to find the stone it was a horrible moment both our careers were at stake and then it was that dr winter whom we had asked out of courtesy to be present introduced into the wound a finger which seemed to our excited senses to be about nine inches long and hooked out the stone at the end of it  its always well to bring one in your waistcoat pocket said he with a chuckle but i suppose you youngsters are above all that  we made him president of our branch of the british medical association but he resigned after the first meeting the young men are too much for me he said i dont understand what they are talking about yet his patients do very well he has the healing touchthat magnetic thing which defies explanation or analysis but which is a very evident fact none the less his mere presence leaves the patient with more hopefulness and vitality the sight of disease affects him as dust does a careful housewife it makes him angry and impatient tut tut this will never do he cries as he takes over a new case he would shoo death out of the room as though he were an intrusive hen but when the intruder refuses to be dislodged when the blood moves more slowly and the eyes grow dimmer then it is that dr winter is of more avail than all the drugs in his surgery dying folk cling to his hand as if the presence of his bulk and vigour gives them more courage to face the change and that kindly windbeaten face has been the last earthly impression which many a sufferer has carried into the unknown  when dr patterson and i both of us young energetic and uptodate settled in the district we were most cordially received by the old doctor who would have been only too happy to be relieved of some of his patients the patients themselves however followed their own inclinations which is a reprehensible way that patients have so that we remained neglected with our modern instruments and our latest alkaloids while he was serving out senna and calomel to all the countryside we both of us loved the old fellow but at the same time in the privacy of our own intimate conversations we could not help commenting upon this deplorable lack of judgment  it is all very well for the poorer people said patterson but after all the educated classes have a right to expect that their medical man will know the difference between a mitral murmur and a bronchitic rale its the judicial frame of mind not the sympathetic which is the essential one  i thoroughly agreed with patterson in what he said it happened however that very shortly afterwards the epidemic of influenza broke out and we were all worked to death one morning i met patterson on my round and found him looking rather pale and fagged out he made the same remark about me i was in fact feeling far from well and i lay upon the sofa all afternoon with a splitting headache and pains in every joint as evening closed in i could no longer disguise the fact that the scourge was upon me and i felt that i should have medical advice without delay it was of patterson naturally that i thought but somehow the idea of him had suddenly become repugnant to me i thought of his cold critical attitude of his endless questions of his tests and his tappings i wanted something more soothingsomething more genial  mrs hudson said i to my housekeeper would you kindly run along to old dr winter and tell him that i should be obliged to him if he would step round  she was back with an answer presently  dr winter will come round in an hour or so sir but he has just been called in to attend dr patterson     ix  his first operation   it was the first day of a winter session and the third years man was walking with the first years man twelve oclock was just booming out from the tron church  let me see said the third years man you have never seen an operation  never  then this way please this is rutherfords historic bar a glass of sherry please for this gentleman you are rather sensitive are you not  my nerves are not very strong i am afraid  hum another glass of sherry for this gentleman we are going to an operation now you know  the novice squared his shoulders and made a gallant attempt to look unconcerned  nothing very badeh  well yespretty bad  anan amputation  no its a bigger affair than that  i thinki think they must be expecting me at home  theres no sense in funking if you dont go today you must tomorrow better get it over at once feel pretty fit  oh yes all right  the smile was not a success  one more glass of sherry then now come on or we shall be late i want you to be well in front  surely that is not necessary  oh it is far better what a drove of students there are plenty of new men among them you can tell them easily enough cant you if they were going down to be operated upon themselves they could not look whiter  i dont think i should look as white  well i was just the same myself but the feeling soon wears off you see a fellow with a face like plaster and before the week is out he is eating his lunch in the dissecting rooms ill tell you all about the case when we get to the theatre  the students were pouring down the sloping street which led to the infirmaryeach with his little sheaf of notebooks in his hand there were pale frightened lads fresh from the high schools and callous old chronics whose generation had passed on and left them they swept in an unbroken tumultuous stream from the university gate to the hospital the figures and gait of the men were young but there was little youth in most of their faces some looked as if they ate too littlea few as if they drank too much tall and short tweed coated and black roundshouldered bespectacled and slim they crowded with clatter of feet and rattle of sticks through the hospital gate now and again they thickened into two lines as the carriage of a surgeon of the staff rolled over the cobblestones between  theres going to be a crowd at archers whispered the senior man with suppressed excitement it is grand to see him at work ive seen him jab all round the aorta until it made me jumpy to watch him this way and mind the whitewash  they passed under an archway and down a long stoneflagged corridor with drabcoloured doors on either side each marked with a number some of them were ajar and the novice glanced into them with tingling nerves he was reassured to catch a glimpse of cheery fires lines of whitecounterpaned beds and a profusion of coloured texts upon the wall the corridor opened upon a small hall with a fringe of poorlyclad people seated all round upon benches a young man with a pair of scissors stuck like a flower in his buttonhole and a notebook in his hand was passing from one to the other whispering and writing  anything good asked the third years man  you should have been here yesterday said the outpatient clerk glancing up we had a regular field day a popliteal aneurism a colles fracture a spina bifida a tropical abscess and an elephantiasis hows that for a single haul  im sorry i missed it but theyll come again i suppose whats up with the old gentleman  a broken workman was sitting in the shadow rocking himself slowly to and fro and groaning a woman beside him was trying to console him patting his shoulder with a hand which was spotted over with curious little white blisters  its a fine carbuncle said the clerk with the air of a connoisseur who describes his orchids to one who can appreciate them its on his back and the passage is draughty so we must not look at it must we daddy pemphigus he added carelessly pointing to the womans disfigured hands would you care to stop and take out a metacarpal  no thank you we are due at archers come on and they rejoined the throng which was hurrying to the theatre of the famous surgeon  the tiers of horseshoe benches rising from the floor to the ceiling were already packed and the novice as he entered saw vague curving lines of faces in front of him and heard the deep buzz of a hundred voices and sounds of laughter from somewhere up above him his companion spied an opening on the second bench and they both squeezed into it  this is grand the senior man whispered youll have a rare view of it all  only a single row of heads intervened between them and the operating table it was of unpainted deal plain strong and scrupulously clean a sheet of brown waterproofing covered half of it and beneath stood a large tin tray full of sawdust on the farther side in front of the window there was a board which was strewed with glittering instruments forceps tenacula saws canulas and trocars a line of knives with long thin delicate blades lay at one side two young men lounged in front of this one threading needles the other doing something to a brass coffeepotlike thing which hissed out puffs of steam  thats peterson whispered the senior the big bald man in the front row hes the skingrafting man you know and thats anthony browne who took a larynx out successfully last winter and theres murphy the pathologist and stoddart the eye man youll come to know them all soon  who are the two men at the table  nobodydressers one has charge of the instruments and the other of the puffing billy its listers antiseptic spray you know and archers one of the carbolic acid men hayes is the leader of the cleanlinessandcoldwater school and they all hate each other like poison  a flutter of interest passed through the closelypacked benches as a woman in petticoat and bodice was led in by two nurses a red woollen shawl was draped over her head and round her neck the face which looked out from it was that of a woman in the prime of her years but drawn with suffering and of a peculiar beeswax tint her head drooped as she walked and one of the nurses with her arm round her waist was whispering consolation in her ear she gave a quick side glance at the instrument table as she passed but the nurses turned her away from it  what ails her asked the novice  cancer of the parotid its the devil of a case extends right away back behind the carotids theres hardly a man but archer would dare to follow it ah here he is himself  as he spoke a small brisk irongrey man came striding into the room rubbing his hands together as he walked he had a cleanshaven face of the naval officer type with large bright eyes and a firm straight mouth behind him came his big house surgeon with his gleaming pincenez and a trail of dressers who grouped themselves into the corners of the room  gentlemen cried the surgeon in a voice as hard and brisk as his manner we have here an interesting case of tumour of the parotid originally cartilaginous but now assuming malignant characteristics and therefore requiring excision on to the table nurse thank you chloroform clerk thank you you can take the shawl off nurse  the woman lay back upon the waterproofed pillow and her murderous tumour lay revealed in itself it was a pretty thing ivory white with a mesh of blue veins and curving gently from jaw to chest but the lean yellow face and the stringy throat were in horrible contrast with the plumpness and sleekness of this monstrous growth the surgeon placed a hand on each side of it and pressed it slowly backwards and forwards  adherent at one place gentlemen he cried the growth involves the carotids and jugulars and passes behind the ramus of the jaw whither we must be prepared to follow it it is impossible to say how deep our dissection may carry us carbolic tray thank you dressings of carbolic gauze if you please push the chloroform mr johnson have the small saw ready in case it is necessary to remove the jaw  the patient was moaning gently under the towel which had been placed over her face she tried to raise her arms and to draw up her knees but two dressers restrained her the heavy air was full of the penetrating smells of carbolic acid and of chloroform a muffled cry came from under the towel and then a snatch of a song sung in a high quavering monotonous voice      he says says he     if you fly with me             youll be mistress of the icecream van             youll be mistress of the  it mumbled off into a drone and stopped the surgeon came across still rubbing his hands and spoke to an elderly man in front of the novice  narrow squeak for the government he said  oh ten is enough  they wont have ten long theyd do better to resign before they are driven to it  oh i should fight it out  whats the use they cant get past the committee even if they get a vote in the house i was talking to  patients ready sir said the dresser  talking to mdonaldbut ill tell you about it presently he walked back to the patient who was breathing in long heavy gasps i propose said he passing his hands over the tumour in an almost caressing fashion to make a free incision over the posterior border and to take another forward at right angles to the lower end of it might i trouble you for a medium knife mr johnson  the novice with eyes which were dilating with horror saw the surgeon pick up the long gleaming knife dip it into a tin basin and balance it in his fingers as an artist might his brush then he saw him pinch up the skin above the tumour with his left hand at the sight his nerves which had already been tried once or twice that day gave way utterly his head swam round and he felt that in another instant he might faint he dared not look at the patient he dug his thumbs into his ears lest some scream should come to haunt him and he fixed his eyes rigidly upon the wooden ledge in front of him one glance one cry would he knew break down the shred of selfpossession which he still retained he tried to think of cricket of green fields and rippling water of his sisters at homeof anything rather than of what was going on so near him  and yet somehow even with his ears stopped up sounds seemed to penetrate to him and to carry their own tale he heard or thought that he heard the long hissing of the carbolic engine then he was conscious of some movement among the dressers were there groans too breaking in upon him and some other sound some fluid sound which was more dreadfully suggestive still his mind would keep building up every step of the operation and fancy made it more ghastly than fact could have been his nerves tingled and quivered minute by minute the giddiness grew more marked the numb sickly feeling at his heart more distressing and then suddenly with a groan his head pitching forward and his brow cracking sharply upon the narrow wooden shelf in front of him he lay in a dead faint                                       when he came to himself he was lying in the empty theatre with his collar and shirt undone the third years man was dabbing a wet sponge over his face and a couple of grinning dressers were looking on  all right cried the novice sitting up and rubbing his eyes im sorry to have made an ass of myself  well so i should think said his companion what on earth did you faint about  i couldnt help it it was that operation  what operation  why that cancer  there was a pause and then the three students burst out laughing  why you juggins cried the senior man there never was an operation at all they found the patient didnt stand the chloroform well and so the whole thing was off archer has been giving us one of his racy lectures and you fainted just in the middle of his favourite story     x  the third generation   scudamore lane sloping down riverwards from just behind the monument lies at night in the shadow of two black and monstrous walls which loom high above the glimmer of the scattered gaslamps the footpaths are narrow and the causeway is paved with rounded cobblestones so that the endless drays roar along it like so many breaking waves a few oldfashioned houses lie scattered among the business premises and in one of thesehalfway down on the lefthand sidedr horace selby conducts his large practice it is a singular street for so big a man but a specialist who has a european reputation can afford to live where he likes in his particular branch too patients do not always consider seclusion to be a disadvantage  it was only ten oclock the dull roar of the traffic which converged all day upon london bridge had died away now to a mere confused murmur it was raining heavily and the gas shone dimly through the streaked and dripping glass throwing little yellow circles upon the glistening cobblestones the air was full of the sounds of rain the thin swish of its fall the heavier drip from the eaves and the swirl and gurgle down the two steep gutters and through the sewer grating there was only one figure in the whole length of scudamore lane it was that of a man and it stood outside the door of dr horace selby  he had just rung and was waiting for an answer the fanlight beat full upon the gleaming shoulders of his waterproof and upon his upturned features it was a wan sensitive clearcut face with some subtle nameless peculiarity in its expressionsomething of the startled horse in the whiterimmed eye something too of the helpless child in the drawn cheek and the weakening of the lower lip the manservant knew the stranger as a patient at a bare glance at those frightened eyes such a look had been seen at that door before  is the doctor in  the man hesitated  he has had a few friends to dinner sir he does not like to be disturbed outside his usual hours sir  tell him that i must see him tell him that it is of the very first importance here is my card he fumbled with his trembling fingers in trying to draw one from the case sir francis norton is the name tell him that sir francis norton of deane park must see him at once  yes sir the butler closed his fingers upon the card and the halfsovereign which accompanied it better hang your coat up here in the hall it is very wet now if you will wait here in the consultingroom i have no doubt that i shall be able to send the doctor in to you  it was a large and lofty room in which the young baronet found himself the carpet was so soft and thick that his feet made no sound as he walked across it the two gasjets were turned only halfway up and the dim light with the faint aromatic smell which filled the air had a vaguely religious suggestion he sat down in a shining leather armchair by the smouldering fire and looked gloomily about him two sides of the room were taken up with books fat and sombre with broad gold lettering upon their backs beside him was the high oldfashioned mantelpiece of white marble the top of it strewed with cotton wadding and bandages graduated measures and little bottles there was one with a broad neck just above him containing bluestone and another narrower one with what looked like the ruins of a broken pipe stem and caustic outside upon a red label thermometers hypodermic syringes bistouries and spatulas were scattered thickly about both on the mantelpiece and on the central table on either side of the sloping desk on the same table to the right stood copies of the five books which dr horace selby had written upon the subject with which his name is peculiarly associated while on the left on the top of a red medical directory lay a huge glass model of a human eye the size of a turnip which opened down the centre to expose the lens and double chamber within  sir francis norton had never been remarkable for his powers of observation and yet he found himself watching these trifles with the keenest attention even the corrosion of the cork of an acid bottle caught his eye and he wondered that the doctor did not use glass stoppers tiny scratches where the light glinted off from the table little stains upon the leather of the desk chemical formulæ scribbled upon the labels of some of the phialsnothing was too slight to arrest his attention and his sense of hearing was equally alert the heavy ticking of the solemn black clock above the fireplace struck quite painfully upon his ears yet in spite of it and in spite also of the thick oldfashioned wooden partition walls he could hear the voices of men talking in the next room and could even catch scraps of their conversation second hand was bound to take it why you drew the last of them yourself how could i play the queen when i knew the ace was against me the phrases came in little spurts falling back into the dull murmur of conversation and then suddenly he heard a creaking of a door and a step in the hall and knew with a tingling mixture of impatience and horror that the crisis of his life was at hand  dr horace selby was a large portly man with an imposing presence his nose and chin were bold and pronounced yet his features were puffya combination which would blend more freely with the wig and cravat of the early georges than with the closecropped hair and black frockcoat of the end of the nineteenth century he was clean shaven for his mouth was too good to cover large flexible and sensitive with a kindly human softening at either corner which with his brown sympathetic eyes had drawn out many a shamestruck sinners secret two masterful little bushy side whiskers bristled out from under his ears spindling away upwards to merge in the thick curves of his brindled hair to his patients there was something reassuring in the mere bulk and dignity of the man a high and easy bearing in medicine as in war bears with it a hint of victories in the past and a promise of others to come dr horace selbys face was a consolation and so too were the large white soothing hands one of which he held out to his visitor  i am sorry to have kept you waiting it is a conflict of duties you perceive a host to his guests and an adviser to his patient but now i am entirely at your disposal sir francis but dear me you are very cold  yes i am cold  and you are trembling all over tut tut this will never do this miserable night has chilled you perhaps some little stimulant  no thank you i would really rather not and it is not the night which has chilled me i am frightened doctor  the doctor half turned in his chair and patted the arch of the young mans knee as he might the neck of a restless horse  what then he asked looking over his shoulder at the pale face with the startled eyes  twice the young man parted his lips then he stooped with a sudden gesture and turning up the right leg of his trousers he pulled down his sock and thrust forward his shin the doctor made a clicking noise with his tongue as he glanced at it  both legs  no only one  suddenly  this morning  hum the doctor pouted his lips and drew his finger and thumb down the line of his chin can you account for it he said briskly  no  a trace of sternness came into the large brown eyes  i need not point out to you that unless the most absolute frankness  the patient sprang from his chair  so help me god doctor he cried i have nothing in my life with which to reproach myself do you think that i would be such a fool as to come here and tell you lies once for all i have nothing to regret  he was a pitiful halftragic and halfgrotesque figure as he stood with one trouser leg rolled to his knee and that everpresent horror still lurking in his eyes a burst of merriment came from the cardplayers in the next room and the two looked at each other in silence  sit down said the doctor abruptly your assurance is quite sufficient he stooped and ran his finger down the line of the young mans shin raising it at one point hum serpiginous he murmured shaking his head any other symptoms  my eyes have been a little weak  let me see your teeth he glanced at them and again made the gentle clicking sound of sympathy and disapprobation  now the eye he lit a lamp at the patients elbow and holding a small crystal lens to concentrate the light he threw it obliquely upon the patients eye as he did so a glow of pleasure came over his large expressive face a flush of such enthusiasm as the botanist feels when he packs the rare plant into his tin knapsack or the astronomer when the longsought comet first swims into the field of his telescope  this is very typicalvery typical indeed he murmured turning to his desk and jotting down a few memoranda upon a sheet of paper curiously enough i am writing a monograph upon the subject it is singular that you should have been able to furnish so well marked a case  he had so forgotten the patient in his symptom that he had assumed an almost congratulatory air towards its possessor he reverted to human sympathy again as his patient asked for particulars  my dear sir there is no occasion for us to go into strictly professional details together said he soothingly if for example i were to say that you have interstitial keratitis how would you be the wiser there are indications of a strumous diathesis in broad terms i may say that you have a constitutional and hereditary taint  the young baronet sank back in his chair and his chin fell forward upon his chest the doctor sprang to a side table and poured out a half glass of liqueur brandy which he held to his patients lips a little fleck of colour came into his cheeks as he drank it down  perhaps i spoke a little abruptly said the doctor but you must have known the nature of your complaint why otherwise should you have come to me  god help me i suspected itbut only today when my leg grew bad my father had a leg like this  it was from him then  no from my grandfather you have heard of sir rupert norton the great corinthian  the doctor was a man of wide reading with a retentive memory the name brought back to him instantly the remembrance of the sinister reputation of its ownera notorious buck of the thirties who had gambled and duelled and steeped himself in drink and debauchery until even the vile set with whom he consorted had shrunk away from him in horror and left him to a sinister old age with the barmaid wife whom in some drunken frolic he had espoused as he looked at the young man still leaning back in the leather chair there seemed for the instant to flicker up behind him some vague presentiment of that foul old dandy with his dangling seals manywreathed scarf and dark satyric face what was he now an armful of bones in a mouldy box but his deedsthey were living and rotting the blood in the veins of an innocent man  i see that you have heard of him said the young baronet he died horribly i have been told but not more horribly than he had lived my father was his only son he was a studious man fond of books and canaries and the country but his innocent life did not save him  his symptoms were cutaneous i understand  he wore gloves in the house that was the first thing i can remember and then it was his throat and then his legs he used to ask me so often about my own health and i thought him so fussy for how could i tell what the meaning of it was he was always watching mealways with a sidelong eye fixed upon me now at last i know what he was watching for  had you brothers or sisters  none thank god  well well it is a sad case and very typical of many which come in my way you are no lonely sufferer sir francis there are many thousands who bear the same cross as you do  but wheres the justice of it doctor cried the young man springing from the chair and pacing up and down the consultingroom if i were heir to my grandfathers sins as well as to their results i could understand it but i am of my fathers type i love all that is gentle and beautiful music and poetry and art the coarse and animal is abhorrent to me ask any of my friends and they would tell you that and now that this vile loathsome thingach i am polluted to the marrow soaked in abomination and why havent i a right to ask why did i do it was it my fault could i help being born and look at me now blighted and blasted just as life was at its sweetest talk about the sins of the father how about the sins of the creator he shook his two clenched hands in the air the poor impotent atom with his pinpoint of brain caught in the whirl of the infinite  the doctor rose and placing his hands upon his shoulders he pressed him back into his chair again  there there my dear lad said he you must not excite yourself you are trembling all over your nerves cannot stand it we must take these great questions upon trust what are we after all half evolved creatures in a transition stage nearer perhaps to the medusa on the one side than to perfected humanity on the other with half a complete brain we cant expect to understand the whole of a complete fact can we now it is all very dim and dark no doubt but i think popes famous couplet sums the whole matter up and from my heart after fifty years of varied experience i can say that  but the young baronet gave a cry of impatience and disgust  words words words you can sit comfortably there in your chair and say themand think them too no doubt youve had your life but ive never had mine youve healthy blood in your veins mine is putrid and yet i am as innocent as you what would words do for you if you were in this chair and i in that ah its such a mockery and a makebelief dont think me rude though doctor i dont mean to be that i only say that it is impossible for you or any man to realise it but ive a question to ask you doctor its one on which my whole life must depend  he writhed his fingers together in an agony of apprehension  speak out my dear sir i have every sympathy with you  do you thinkdo you think the poison has spent itself on me do you think if i had children that they would suffer  i can only give one answer to that the third and fourth generation says the trite old text you may in time eliminate it from your system but many years must pass before you can think of marriage  i am to be married on tuesday whispered the patient  it was dr horace selbys turn to be thrilled with horror there were not many situations which would yield such a sensation to his wellseasoned nerves he sat in silence while the babble of the cardtable broke in again upon them we had a double ruff if you had returned a heart i was bound to clear the trumps they were hot and angry about it  how could you cried the doctor severely it was criminal  you forget that i have only learned how i stand today he put his two hands to his temples and pressed them convulsively you are a man of the world doctor selby you have seen or heard of such things before give me some advice im in your hands it is all so sudden and horrible and i dont think i am strong enough to bear it  the doctors heavy brows thickened into two straight lines and he bit his nails in perplexity  the marriage must not take place  then what am i to do  at all costs it must not take place  and i must give her up  there can be no question about that  the young man took out a pocketbook and drew from it a small photograph holding it out towards the doctor the firm face softened as he looked at it  it is very hard on you no doubt i can appreciate it more now that i have seen that but there is no alternative at all you must give up all thought of it  but this is madness doctormadness i tell you no i wont raise my voice i forgot myself but realise it man i am to be married on tuesdaythis coming tuesday you know and all the world knows it how can i put such a public affront upon her it would be monstrous  none the less it must be done my dear sir there is no way out of it  you would have me simply write brutally and break the engagement at this last moment without a reason i tell you i couldnt do it  i had a patient once who found himself in a somewhat similar situation some years ago said the doctor thoughtfully his device was a singular one he deliberately committed a penal offence and so compelled the young ladys people to withdraw their consent to the marriage  the young baronet shook his head  my personal honour is as yet unstained said he i have little else left but that at least i will preserve  well well its a nice dilemma and the choice lies with you  have you no other suggestion  you dont happen to have property in australia  none  but you have capital  yes  then you could buy sometomorrow morning for example a thousand mining shares would do then you might write to say that urgent business affairs have compelled you to start at an hours notice to inspect your property that would give you six months at any rate  well that would be possibleyes certainly it would be possible but think of her positionthe house full of wedding presentsguests coming from a distance it is awful and you say there is no alternative  the doctor shrugged his shoulders  well then i might write it now and start tomorroweh perhaps you would let me use your desk thank you i am so sorry to keep you from your guests so long but i wont be a moment now he wrote an abrupt note of a few lines then with a sudden impulse he tore it to shreds and flung it into the fireplace no i cant sit down and tell her a lie doctor said he rising we must find some other way out of this i will think it over and let you know my decision you must allow me to double your fee as i have taken such an unconscionable time now goodbye and thank you a thousand times for your sympathy and advice  why dear me you havent even got your prescription yet this is the mixture and i should recommend one of these powders every morning and the chemist will put all directions upon the ointment box you are placed in a cruel situation but i trust that these may be but passing clouds when may i hope to hear from you again  tomorrow morning  very good how the rain is splashing in the street you have your waterproof there you will need it goodbye then until tomorrow  he opened the door a gust of cold damp air swept into the hall and yet the doctor stood for a minute or more watching the lonely figure which passed slowly through the yellow splotches of the gaslamps and into the broad bars of darkness between it was but his own shadow which trailed up the wall as he passed the lights and yet it looked to the doctors eye as though some huge and sombre figure walked by a mannikins side and led him silently up the lonely street  doctor horace selby heard again of his patient next morning and rather earlier than he had expected a paragraph in the daily news caused him to push away his breakfast untasted and turned him sick and faint while he read it a deplorable accident it was headed and it ran in this way       a fatal accident of a peculiarly painful character is reported      from king william street about eleven oclock last night a      young man was observed while endeavouring to get out of the      way of a hansom to slip and fall under the wheels of a heavy      twohorse dray on being picked up his injuries were found to      be of a most shocking character and he expired while being      conveyed to the hospital an examination of his pocketbook and      cardcase shows beyond any question that the deceased is none      other than sir francis norton of deane park who has only      within the last year come into the baronetcy the accident is      made the more deplorable as the deceased who was only just of      age was on the eve of being married to a young lady belonging      to one of the oldest families in the south with his wealth and      his talents the ball of fortune was at his feet and his many      friends will be deeply grieved to know that his promising      career has been cut short in so sudden and tragic a fashion     xi  the curse of eve   robert johnson was an essentially commonplace man with no feature to distinguish him from a million others he was pale of face ordinary in looks neutral in opinions thirty years of age and a married man by trade he was a gentlemans outfitter in the new north road and the competition of business squeezed out of him the little character that was left in his hope of conciliating customers he had become cringing and pliable until working ever in the same routine from day to day he seemed to have sunk into a soulless machine rather than a man no great question had ever stirred him at the end of this smug century selfcontained in his own narrow circle it seemed impossible that any of the mighty primitive passions of mankind could ever reach him yet birth and lust and illness and death are changeless things and when one of these harsh facts springs out upon a man at some sudden turn of the path of life it dashes off for the moment his mask of civilisation and gives a glimpse of the stranger and stronger face below  johnsons wife was a quiet little woman with brown hair and gentle ways his affection for her was the one positive trait in his character together they would lay out the shop window every monday morning the spotless shirts in their green cardboard boxes below the neckties above hung in rows over the brass rails the cheap studs glistening from the white cards at either side while in the background were the rows of cloth caps and the bank of boxes in which the more valuable hats were screened from the sunlight she kept the books and sent out the bills no one but she knew the joys and sorrows which crept into his small life she had shared his exultation when the gentleman who was going to india had bought ten dozen shirts and an incredible number of collars and she had been stricken as he when after the goods had gone the bill was returned from the hotel address with the intimation that no such person had lodged there for five years they had worked building up the business thrown together all the more closely because their marriage had been a childless one now however there were signs that a change was at hand and that speedily she was unable to come downstairs and her mother mrs peyton came over from camberwell to nurse her and to welcome her grandchild  little qualms of anxiety came over johnson as his wifes time approached however after all it was a natural process other mens wives went through it unharmed and why should not his he was himself one of a family of fourteen and yet his mother was alive and hearty it was quite the exception for anything to go wrong and yet in spite of his reasonings the remembrance of his wifes condition was always like a sombre background to all his other thoughts  doctor miles of bridport place the best man in the neighbourhood was retained five months in advance and as time stole on many little packets of absurdly small white garments with frill work and ribbons began to arrive among the big consignments of male necessities and then one evening as johnson was ticketing the scarves in the shop he heard a bustle upstairs and mrs peyton came running down to say that lucy was bad and that she thought the doctor ought to be there without delay  it was not robert johnsons nature to hurry he was prim and staid and liked to do things in an orderly fashion it was a quarter of a mile from the corner of the new north road where his shop stood to the doctors house in bridport place there were no cabs in sight so he set off upon foot leaving the lad to mind the shop at bridport place he was told that the doctor had just gone to harman street to attend a man in a fit johnson started off for harman street losing a little of his primness as he became more anxious two full cabs but no empty ones passed him on the way at harman street he learned that the doctor had gone on to a case of measles fortunately he had left the address69 dunstan road at the other side of the regents canal johnsons primness had vanished now as he thought of the women waiting at home and he began to run as hard as he could down the kingsland road some way along he sprang into a cab which stood by the curb and drove to dunstan road the doctor had just left and robert johnson felt inclined to sit down upon the steps in despair  fortunately he had not sent the cab away and he was soon back at bridport place doctor miles had not returned yet but they were expecting him every instant johnson waited drumming his fingers on his knees in a high dimlit room the air of which was charged with a faint sickly smell of ether the furniture was massive and the books in the shelves were sombre and a squat black clock ticked mournfully on the mantelpiece it told him that it was halfpast seven and that he had been gone an hour and a quarter whatever would the women think of him every time that a distant door slammed he sprang from his chair in a quiver of eagerness his ears strained to catch the deep notes of the doctors voice and then suddenly with a gush of joy he heard a quick step outside and the sharp click of the key in the lock in an instant he was out in the hall before the doctors foot was over the threshold  if you please doctor ive come for you he cried the wife was taken bad at six oclock  he hardly knew what he expected the doctor to do something very energetic certainlyto seize some drugs perhaps and rush excitedly with him through the gaslit streets instead of that doctor miles threw his umbrella into the rack jerked off his hat with a somewhat peevish gesture and pushed johnson back into the room  lets see you did engage me didnt you he asked in no very cordial voice  oh yes doctor last november johnson the outfitter you know in the new north road  yes yes its a bit overdue said the doctor glancing at a list of names in a notebook with a very shiny cover well how is she  i dont  ah of course its your first youll know more about it next time  mrs peyton said it was time you were there sir  my dear sir there can be no very pressing hurry in a first case we shall have an allnight affair i fancy you cant get an engine to go without coals mr johnson and i have had nothing but a light lunch  we could have something cooked for yousomething hot and a cup of tea  thank you but i fancy my dinner is actually on the table i can do no good in the earlier stages go home and say that i am coming and i will be round immediately afterwards  a sort of horror filled robert johnson as he gazed at this man who could think about his dinner at such a moment he had not imagination enough to realise that the experience which seemed so appallingly important to him was the merest everyday matter of business to the medical man who could not have lived for a year had he not amid the rush of work remembered what was due to his own health to johnson he seemed little better than a monster his thoughts were bitter as he sped back to his shop  youve taken your time said his motherinlaw reproachfully looking down the stairs as he entered  i couldnt help it he gasped is it over  over shes got to be worse poor dear before she can be better wheres doctor miles  hes coming after hes had dinner  the old woman was about to make some reply when from the halfopened door behind a high whinnying voice cried out for her she ran back and closed the door while johnson sick at heart turned into the shop there he sent the lad home and busied himself frantically in putting up shutters and turning out boxes when all was closed and finished he seated himself in the parlour behind the shop but he could not sit still he rose incessantly to walk a few paces and then fall back into a chair once more suddenly the clatter of china fell upon his ear and he saw the maid pass the door with a cup on a tray and a smoking teapot  who is that for jane he asked  for the mistress mr johnson she says she would fancy it  there was immeasurable consolation to him in that homely cup of tea it wasnt so very bad after all if his wife could think of such things so lighthearted was he that he asked for a cup also he had just finished it when the doctor arrived with a small blackleather bag in his hand  well how is she he asked genially  oh shes very much better said johnson with enthusiasm  dear me thats bad said the doctor perhaps it will do if i look in on my morning round  no no cried johnson clutching at his thick frieze overcoat we are so glad that you have come and doctor please come down soon and let me know what you think about it  the doctor passed upstairs his firm heavy steps resounding through the house johnson could hear his boots creaking as he walked about the floor above him and the sound was a consolation to him it was crisp and decided the tread of a man who had plenty of selfconfidence presently still straining his ears to catch what was going on he heard the scraping of a chair as it was drawn along the floor and a moment later he heard the door fly open and some one came rushing downstairs johnson sprang up with his hair bristling thinking that some dreadful thing had occurred but it was only his motherinlaw incoherent with excitement and searching for scissors and some tape she vanished again and jane passed up the stairs with a pile of newlyaired linen then after an interval of silence johnson heard the heavy creaking tread and the doctor came down into the parlour  thats better said he pausing with his hand upon the door you look pale mr johnson  oh no sir not at all he answered deprecatingly mopping his brow with his handkerchief  there is no immediate cause for alarm said doctor miles the case is not all that we could wish it still we will hope for the best  is there danger sir gasped johnson  well there is always danger of course it is not altogether a favourable case but still it might be much worse i have given her a draught i saw as i passed that they have been doing a little building opposite to you its an improving quarter the rents go higher and higher you have a lease of your own little place eh  yes sir yes cried johnson whose ears were straining for every sound from above and who felt none the less that it was very soothing that the doctor should be able to chat so easily at such a time thats to say no sir i am a yearly tenant  ah i should get a lease if i were you theres marshall the watchmaker down the street i attended his wife twice and saw him through the typhoid when they took up the drains in prince street i assure you his landlord sprung his rent nearly forty a year and he had to pay or clear out  did his wife get through it doctor  oh yes she did very well hullo hullo  he slanted his ear to the ceiling with a questioning face and then darted swiftly from the room  it was march and the evenings were chill so jane had lit the fire but the wind drove the smoke downwards and the air was full of its acrid taint johnson felt chilled to the bone though rather by his apprehensions than by the weather he crouched over the fire with his thin white hands held out to the blaze at ten oclock jane brought in the joint of cold meat and laid his place for supper but he could not bring himself to touch it he drank a glass of the beer however and felt the better for it the tension of his nerves seemed to have reacted upon his hearing and he was able to follow the most trivial things in the room above once when the beer was still heartening him he nerved himself to creep on tiptoe up the stair and to listen to what was going on the bedroom door was half an inch open and through the slit he could catch a glimpse of the cleanshaven face of the doctor looking wearier and more anxious than before then he rushed downstairs like a lunatic and running to the door he tried to distract his thoughts by watching what was going on in the street the shops were all shut and some rollicking boon companions came shouting along from the publichouse he stayed at the door until the stragglers had thinned down and then came back to his seat by the fire in his dim brain he was asking himself questions which had never intruded themselves before where was the justice of it what had his sweet innocent little wife done that she should be used so why was nature so cruel he was frightened at his own thoughts and yet wondered that they had never occurred to him before  as the early morning drew in johnson sick at heart and shivering in every limb sat with his greatcoat huddled round him staring at the grey ashes and waiting hopelessly for some relief his face was white and clammy and his nerves had been numbed into a halfconscious state by the long monotony of misery but suddenly all his feelings leapt into keen life again as he heard the bedroom door open and the doctors steps upon the stair robert johnson was precise and unemotional in everyday life but he almost shrieked now as he rushed forward to know if it were over  one glance at the stern drawn face which met him showed that it was no pleasant news which had sent the doctor downstairs his appearance had altered as much as johnsons during the last few hours his hair was on end his face flushed his forehead dotted with beads of perspiration there was a peculiar fierceness in his eye and about the lines of his mouth a fighting look as befitted a man who for hours on end had been striving with the hungriest of foes for the most precious of prizes but there was a sadness too as though his grim opponent had been overmastering him he sat down and leaned his head upon his hand like a man who is fagged out  i thought it my duty to see you mr johnson and to tell you that it is a very nasty case your wifes heart is not strong and she has some symptoms which i do not like what i wanted to say is that if you would like to have a second opinion i shall be very glad to meet any one whom you might suggest  johnson was so dazed by his want of sleep and the evil news that he could hardly grasp the doctors meaning the other seeing him hesitate thought that he was considering the expense  smith or hawley would come for two guineas said he but i think pritchard of the city road is the best man  oh yes bring the best man cried johnson  pritchard would want three guineas he is a senior man you see  id give him all i have if he would pull her through shall i run for him  yes go to my house first and ask for the green baize bag the assistant will give it to you tell him i want the ace mixture her heart is too weak for chloroform then go for pritchard and bring him back with you  it was heavenly for johnson to have something to do and to feel that he was of some use to his wife he ran swiftly to bridport place his footfalls clattering through the silent streets and the big dark policemen turning their yellow funnels of light on him as he passed two tugs at the nightbell brought down a sleepy halfclad assistant who handed him a stoppered glass bottle and a cloth bag which contained something which clinked when you moved it johnson thrust the bottle into his pocket seized the green bag and pressing his hat firmly down ran as hard as he could set foot to ground until he was in the city road and saw the name of pritchard engraved in white upon a red ground he bounded in triumph up the three steps which led to the door and as he did so there was a crash behind him his precious bottle was in fragments upon the pavement  for a moment he felt as if it were his wifes body that was lying there but the run had freshened his wits and he saw that the mischief might be repaired he pulled vigorously at the nightbell  well whats the matter asked a gruff voice at his elbow he started back and looked up at the windows but there was no sign of life he was approaching the bell again with the intention of pulling it when a perfect roar burst from the wall  i cant stand shivering here all night cried the voice say who you are and what you want or i shut the tube  then for the first time johnson saw that the end of a speaking tube hung out of the wall just above the bell he shouted up it  i want you to come with me to meet doctor miles at a confinement at once  how far shrieked the irascible voice  the new north road hoxton  my consultation fee is three guineas payable at the time  all right shouted johnson you are to bring a bottle of ace mixture with you  all right wait a bit  five minutes later an elderly hardfaced man with grizzled hair flung open the door as he emerged a voice from somewhere in the shadows cried  mind you take your cravat john and he impatiently growled something over his shoulder in reply  the consultant was a man who had been hardened by a life of ceaseless labour and who had been driven as so many others have been by the needs of his own increasing family to set the commercial before the philanthropic side of his profession yet beneath his rough crust he was a man with a kindly heart  we dont want to break a record said he pulling up and panting after attempting to keep up with johnson for five minutes i would go quicker if i could my dear sir and i quite sympathise with your anxiety but really i cant manage it  so johnson on fire with impatience had to slow down until they reached the new north road when he ran ahead and had the door open for the doctor when he came he heard the two meet outside the bedroom and caught scraps of their conversation sorry to knock you upnasty casedecent people then it sank into a mumble and the door closed behind them  johnson sat up in his chair now listening keenly for he knew that a crisis must be at hand he heard the two doctors moving about and was able to distinguish the step of pritchard which had a drag in it from the clean crisp sound of the others footfall there was silence for a few minutes and then a curious drunken mumbling singsong voice came quavering up very unlike anything which he had heard hitherto at the same time a sweetish insidious scent imperceptible perhaps to any nerves less strained than his crept down the stairs and penetrated into the room the voice dwindled into a mere drone and finally sank away into silence and johnson gave a long sigh of relief for he knew that the drug had done its work and that come what might there should be no more pain for the sufferer  but soon the silence became even more trying to him than the cries had been he had no clue now as to what was going on and his mind swarmed with horrible possibilities he rose and went to the bottom of the stairs again he heard the clink of metal against metal and the subdued murmur of the doctors voices then he heard mrs peyton say something in a tone as of fear or expostulation and again the doctors murmured together for twenty minutes he stood there leaning against the wall listening to the occasional rumbles of talk without being able to catch a word of it and then of a sudden there rose out of the silence the strangest little piping cry and mrs peyton screamed out in her delight and the man ran into the parlour and flung himself down upon the horsehair sofa drumming his heels on it in his ecstasy  but often the great cat fate lets us go only to clutch us again in a fiercer grip as minute after minute passed and still no sound came from above save those thin glutinous cries johnson cooled from his frenzy of joy and lay breathless with his ears straining they were moving slowly about they were talking in subdued tones still minute after minute passing and no word from the voice for which he listened his nerves were dulled by his night of trouble and he waited in limp wretchedness upon his sofa there he still sat when the doctors came down to hima bedraggled miserable figure with his face grimy and his hair unkempt from his long vigil he rose as they entered bracing himself against the mantelpiece  is she dead he asked  doing well answered the doctor  and at the words that little conventional spirit which had never known until that night the capacity for fierce agony which lay within it learned for the second time that there were springs of joy also which it had never tapped before his impulse was to fall upon his knees but he was shy before the doctors  can i go up  in a few minutes  im sure doctor im veryim very he grew inarticulate here are your three guineas doctor pritchard i wish they were three hundred  so do i said the senior man and they laughed as they shook hands  johnson opened the shop door for them and heard their talk as they stood for an instant outside  looked nasty at one time  very glad to have your help  delighted im sure wont you step round and have a cup of coffee  no thanks im expecting another case  the firm step and the dragging one passed away to the right and the left johnson turned from the door still with that turmoil of joy in his heart he seemed to be making a new start in life he felt that he was a stronger and a deeper man perhaps all this suffering had an object then it might prove to be a blessing both to his wife and to him the very thought was one which he would have been incapable of conceiving twelve hours before he was full of new emotions if there had been a harrowing there had been a planting too  can i come up he cried and then without waiting for an answer he took the steps three at a time  mrs peyton was standing by a soapy bath with a bundle in her hands from under the curve of a brown shawl there looked out at him the strangest little red face with crumpled features moist loose lips and eyelids which quivered like a rabbits nostrils the weak neck had let the head topple over and it rested upon the shoulder  kiss it robert cried the grandmother kiss your son  but he felt a resentment to the little red blinking creature he could not forgive it yet for that long night of misery he caught sight of a white face in the bed and he ran towards it with such love and pity as his speech could find no words for  thank god it is over lucy dear it was dreadful  but im so happy now i never was so happy in my life  her eyes were fixed upon the brown bundle  you mustnt talk said mrs peyton  but dont leave me whispered his wife  so he sat in silence with his hand in hers the lamp was burning dim and the first cold light of dawn was breaking through the window the night had been long and dark but the day was the sweeter and the purer in consequence london was waking up the roar began to rise from the street lives had come and lives had gone but the great machine was still working out its dim and tragic destiny     xii  a medical document   medical men are as a class very much too busy to take stock of singular situations or dramatic events thus it happens that the ablest chronicler of their experiences in our literature was a lawyer a life spent in watching over deathbedsor over birthbeds which are infinitely more tryingtakes something from a mans sense of proportion as constant strong waters might corrupt his palate the overstimulated nerve ceases to respond ask the surgeon for his best experiences and he may reply that he has seen little that is remarkable or break away into the technical but catch him some night when the fire has spurted up and his pipe is reeking with a few of his brother practitioners for company and an artful question or allusion to set him going then you will get some raw green facts new plucked from the tree of life  it is after one of the quarterly dinners of the midland branch of the british medical association twenty coffee cups a dozen liqueur glasses and a solid bank of blue smoke which swirls slowly along the high gilded ceiling gives a hint of a successful gathering but the members have shredded off to their homes the line of heavy bulgepocketed overcoats and of stethoscopebearing top hats is gone from the hotel corridor round the fire in the sittingroom three medicos are still lingering however all smoking and arguing while a fourth who is a mere layman and young at that sits back at the table under cover of an open journal he is writing furiously with a stylographic pen asking a question in an innocent voice from time to time and so flickering up the conversation whenever it shows a tendency to wane  the three men are all of that staid middle age which begins early and lasts late in the profession they are none of them famous yet each is of good repute and a fair type of his particular branch the portly man with the authoritative manner and the white vitriol splash upon his cheek is charley manson chief of the wormley asylum and author of the brilliant monographobscure nervous lesions in the unmarried he always wears his collar high like that since the halfsuccessful attempt of a student of revelations to cut his throat with a splinter of glass the second with the ruddy face and the merry brown eyes is a general practitioner a man of vast experience who with his three assistants and his five horses takes twentyfive hundred a year in halfcrown visits and shilling consultations out of the poorest quarter of a great city that cheery face of theodore foster is seen at the side of a hundred sickbeds a day and if he has onethird more names on his visiting list than in his cashbook he always promises himself that he will get level some day when a millionaire with a chronic complaintthe ideal combinationshall seek his services the third sitting on the right with his dressshoes shining on the top of the fender is hargrave the rising surgeon his face has none of the broad humanity of theodore fosters the eye is stern and critical the mouth straight and severe but there is strength and decision in every line of it and it is nerve rather than sympathy which the patient demands when he is bad enough to come to hargraves door he calls himself a jawman a mere jawman as he modestly puts it but in point of fact he is too young and too poor to confine himself to a specialty and there is nothing surgical which hargrave has not the skill and the audacity to do  before after and during murmurs the general practitioner in answer to some interpolation of the outsiders i assure you manson one sees all sorts of evanescent forms of madness  ah puerperal throws in the other knocking the curved grey ash from his cigar but you had some case in your mind foster  well there was one only last week which was new to me i had been engaged by some people of the name of silcoe when the trouble came round i went myself for they would not hear of an assistant the husband who was a policeman was sitting at the head of the bed on the further side this wont do said i oh yes doctor it must do said she its quite irregular and he must go said i its that or nothing said she i wont open my mouth or stir a finger the whole night said he so it ended by my allowing him to remain and there he sat for eight hours on end she was very good over the matter but every now and again he would fetch a hollow groan and i noticed that he held his right hand just under the sheet all the time where i had no doubt that it was clasped by her left when it was all happily over i looked at him and his face was the colour of this cigar ash and his head had dropped on to the edge of the pillow of course i thought he had fainted with emotion and i was just telling myself what i thought of myself for having been such a fool as to let him stay there when suddenly i saw that the sheet over his hand was all soaked with blood i whisked it down and there was the fellows wrist half cut through the woman had one bracelet of a policemans handcuff over her left wrist and the other round his right one when she had been in pain she had twisted with all her strength and the iron had fairly eaten into the bone of the mans arm aye doctor said she when she saw i had noticed it hes got to take his share as well as me turn and turn said she  dont you find it a very wearing branch of the profession asks foster after a pause  my dear fellow it was the fear of it that drove me into lunacy work  aye and it has driven men into asylums who never found their way on to the medical staff i was a very shy fellow myself as a student and i know what it means  no joke that in general practice says the alienist  well you hear men talk about it as though it were but i tell you its much nearer tragedy take some poor raw young fellow who has just put up his plate in a strange town he has found it a trial all his life perhaps to talk to a woman about lawn tennis and church services when a young man is shy he is shyer than any girl then down comes an anxious mother and consults him upon the most intimate family matters i shall never go to that doctor again says she afterwards his manner is so stiff and unsympathetic unsympathetic why the poor lad was struck dumb and paralysed i have known general practitioners who were so shy that they could not bring themselves to ask the way in the street fancy what sensitive men like that must endure before they get broken in to medical practice and then they know that nothing is so catching as shyness and that if they do not keep a face of stone their patient will be covered with confusion and so they keep their face of stone and earn the reputation perhaps of having a heart to correspond i suppose nothing would shake your nerve manson  well when a man lives year in year out among a thousand lunatics with a fair sprinkling of homicidals among them ones nerves either get set or shattered mine are all right so far  i was frightened once says the surgeon it was when i was doing dispensary work one night i had a call from some very poor people and gathered from the few words they said that their child was ill when i entered the room i saw a small cradle in the corner raising the lamp i walked over and putting back the curtains i looked down at the baby i tell you it was sheer providence that i didnt drop that lamp and set the whole place alight the head on the pillow turned and i saw a face looking up at me which seemed to me to have more malignancy and wickedness than ever i had dreamed of in a nightmare it was the flush of red over the cheekbones and the brooding eyes full of loathing of me and of everything else that impressed me ill never forget my start as instead of the chubby face of an infant my eyes fell upon this creature i took the mother into the next room what is it i asked a girl of sixteen said she and then throwing up her arms oh pray god she may be taken the poor thing though she spent her life in this little cradle had great long thin limbs which she curled up under her i lost sight of the case and dont know what became of it but ill never forget the look in her eyes  thats creepy says doctor foster but i think one of my experiences would run it close shortly after i put up my plate i had a visit from a little hunchbacked woman who wished me to come and attend to her sister in her trouble when i reached the house which was a very poor one i found two other little hunchedbacked women exactly like the first waiting for me in the sittingroom not one of them said a word but my companion took the lamp and walked upstairs with her two sisters behind her and me bringing up the rear i can see those three queer shadows cast by the lamp upon the wall as clearly as i can see that tobacco pouch in the room above was the fourth sister a remarkably beautiful girl in evident need of my assistance there was no wedding ring upon her finger the three deformed sisters seated themselves round the room like so many graven images and all night not one of them opened her mouth im not romancing hargrave this is absolute fact in the early morning a fearful thunderstorm broke out one of the most violent i have ever known the little garret burned blue with the lightning and the thunder roared and rattled as if it were on the very roof of the house it wasnt much of a lamp i had and it was a queer thing when a spurt of lightning came to see those three twisted figures sitting round the walls or to have the voice of my patient drowned by the booming of the thunder by jove i dont mind telling you that there was a time when i nearly bolted from the room all came right in the end but i never heard the true story of the unfortunate beauty and her three crippled sisters  thats the worst of these medical stories sighs the outsider they never seem to have an end  when a man is up to his neck in practice my boy he has no time to gratify his private curiosity things shoot across him and he gets a glimpse of them only to recall them perhaps at some quiet moment like this but ive always felt manson that your line had as much of the terrible in it as any other  more groans the alienist a disease of the body is bad enough but this seems to be a disease of the soul is it not a shocking thinga thing to drive a reasoning man into absolute materialismto think that you may have a fine noble fellow with every divine instinct and that some little vascular change the dropping we will say of a minute spicule of bone from the inner table of his skull on to the surface of his brain may have the effect of changing him to a filthy and pitiable creature with every low and debasing tendency what a satire an asylum is upon the majesty of man and no less upon the ethereal nature of the soul  faith and hope murmurs the general practitioner  i have no faith not much hope and all the charity i can afford says the surgeon when theology squares itself with the facts of life ill read it up  you were talking about cases says the outsider jerking the ink down into his stylographic pen  well take a common complaint which kills many thousands every year like gp for instance  whats gp  general practitioner suggests the surgeon with a grin  the british public will have to know what gp is says the alienist gravely its increasing by leaps and bounds and it has the distinction of being absolutely incurable general paralysis is its full title and i tell you it promises to be a perfect scourge heres a fairly typical case now which i saw last monday week a young farmer a splendid fellow surprised his friends by taking a very rosy view of things at a time when the whole countryside was grumbling he was going to give up wheat give up arable land too if it didnt pay plant two thousand acres of rhododendrons and get a monopoly of the supply for covent gardenthere was no end to his schemes all sane enough but just a bit inflated i called at the farm not to see him but on an altogether different matter something about the mans way of talking struck me and i watched him narrowly his lip had a trick of quivering his words slurred themselves together and so did his handwriting when he had occasion to draw up a small agreement a closer inspection showed me that one of his pupils was ever so little larger than the other as i left the house his wife came after me isnt it splendid to see job looking so well doctor said she hes that full of energy he can hardly keep himself quiet i did not say anything for i had not the heart but i knew that the fellow was as much condemned to death as though he were lying in the cell at newgate it was a characteristic case of incipient gp  good heavens cries the outsider my own lips tremble i often slur my words i believe ive got it myself  three little chuckles come from the front of the fire  theres the danger of a little medical knowledge to the layman  a great authority has said that every first years student is suffering in silent agony from four diseases remarks the surgeon one is heart disease of course another is cancer of the parotid i forget the two other  where does the parotid come in  oh its the last wisdom tooth coming through  and what would be the end of that young farmer asks the outsider  paresis of all the muscles ending in fits coma and death it may be a few months it may be a year or two he was a very strong young man and would take some killing  by the way says the alienist did i ever tell you about the first certificate i ever signed i stood as near ruin then as a man could go  what was it then  i was in practice at the time one morning a mrs cooper called upon me and informed me that her husband had shown signs of delusions lately they took the form of imagining that he had been in the army and had distinguished himself very much as a matter of fact he was a lawyer and had never been out of england mrs cooper was of opinion that if i were to call it might alarm him so it was agreed between us that she should send him up in the evening on some pretext to my consultingroom which would give me the opportunity of having a chat with him and if i were convinced of his insanity of signing his certificate another doctor had already signed so that it only needed my concurrence to have him placed under treatment well mr cooper arrived in the evening about half an hour before i had expected him and consulted me as to some malarious symptoms from which he said that he suffered according to his account he had just returned from the abyssinian campaign and had been one of the first of the british forces to enter magdala no delusion could possibly be more marked for he would talk of little else so i filled in the papers without the slightest hesitation when his wife arrived after he had left i put some questions to her to complete the forms what is his age i asked fifty said she fifty i cried why the man i examined could not have been more than thirty and so it came out that the real mr cooper had never called upon me at all but that by one of those coincidences which takes a mans breath away another cooper who really was a very distinguished young officer of artillery had come in to consult me my pen was wet to sign the paper when i discovered it says dr manson mopping his forehead  we were talking about nerve just now observes the surgeon just after my qualifying i served in the navy for a time as i think you know i was on the flagship on the west african station and i remember a singular example of nerve which came to my notice at that time one of our small gunboats had gone up the calabar river and when there the surgeon died of coast fever on the same day a mans leg was broken by a spar falling upon it and it became quite obvious that it must be taken off above the knee if his life was to be saved the young lieutenant who was in charge of the craft searched among the dead doctors effects and laid his hands upon some chloroform a hipjoint knife and a volume of greys anatomy he had the man laid by the steward upon the cabin table and with a picture of the cross section of the thigh in front of him he began to take off the limb every now and then referring to the diagram he would say stand by with the lashings steward theres blood on the chart about here then he would jab with his knife until he cut the artery and he and his assistant would tie it up before they went any further in this way they gradually whittled the leg off and upon my word they made a very excellent job of it the man is hopping about the portsmouth yard at this day  its no joke when the doctor of one of these isolated gunboats himself falls ill continues the surgeon after a pause you might think it easy for him to prescribe for himself but this fever knocks you down like a club and you havent strength left to brush a mosquito off your face i had a touch of it at lagos and i know what i am telling you but there was a chum of mine who really had a curious experience the whole crew gave him up and as they had never had a funeral aboard the ship they began rehearsing the forms so as to be ready they thought that he was unconscious but he swears he could hear every word that passed corpse comin up the atchway cried the cockney sergeant of marines present harms he was so amused and so indignant too that he just made up his mind that he wouldnt be carried through that hatchway and he wasnt either  theres no need for fiction in medicine remarks foster for the facts will always beat anything you can fancy but it has seemed to me sometimes that a curious paper might be read at some of these meetings about the uses of medicine in popular fiction  how  well of what the folk die of and what diseases are made most use of in novels some are worn to pieces and others which are equally common in real life are never mentioned typhoid is fairly frequent but scarlet fever is unknown heart disease is common but then heart disease as we know it is usually the sequel of some foregoing disease of which we never hear anything in the romance then there is the mysterious malady called brain fever which always attacks the heroine after a crisis but which is unknown under that name to the text books people when they are overexcited in novels fall down in a fit in a fairly large experience i have never known any one to do so in real life the small complaints simply dont exist nobody ever gets shingles or quinsy or mumps in a novel all the diseases too belongs to the upper part of the body the novelist never strikes below the belt  ill tell you what foster says the alienist there is a side of life which is too medical for the general public and too romantic for the professional journals but which contains some of the richest human materials that a man could study its not a pleasant side i am afraid but if it is good enough for providence to create it is good enough for us to try and understand it would deal with strange outbursts of savagery and vice in the lives of the best men curious momentary weaknesses in the record of the sweetest women known but to one or two and inconceivable to the world around it would deal too with the singular phenomena of waxing and of waning manhood and would throw a light upon those actions which have cut short many an honoured career and sent a man to a prison when he should have been hurried to a consultingroom of all evils that may come upon the sons of men god shield us principally from that one  i had a case some little time ago which was out of the ordinary says the surgeon there was a famous beauty in london societyi mention no nameswho used to be remarkable a few seasons ago for the very low dresses which she would wear she had the whitest of skins and most beautiful of shoulders so it was no wonder then gradually the frilling at her neck lapped upwards and upwards until last year she astonished every one by wearing quite a high collar at a time when it was completely out of fashion well one day this very woman was shown into my consultingroom when the footman was gone she suddenly tore off the upper part of her dress for gods sake do something for me she cried then i saw what the trouble was a rodent ulcer was eating its way upwards coiling on in its serpiginous fashion until the end of it was flush with her collar the red streak of its trail was lost below the line of her bust year by year it had ascended and she had heightened her dress to hide it until now it was about to invade her face she had been too proud to confess her trouble even to a medical man  and did you stop it  well with zinc chloride i did what i could but it may break out again she was one of those beautiful whiteandpink creatures who are rotten with struma you may patch but you cant mend  dear dear dear cries the general practitioner with that kindly softening of the eyes which has endeared him to so many thousands i suppose we mustnt think ourselves wiser than providence but there are times when one feels that something is wrong in the scheme of things ive seen some sad things in my life did i ever tell you that case where nature divorced a most loving couple he was a fine young fellow an athlete and a gentleman but he overdid athletics you know how the force that controls us gives us a little tweak to remind us when we get off the beaten track it may be a pinch on the great toe if we drink too much and work too little or it may be a tug on our nerves if we dissipate energy too much with the athlete of course its the heart or the lungs he had bad phthisis and was sent to davos well as luck would have it she developed rheumatic fever which left her heart very much affected now do you see the dreadful dilemma in which those poor people found themselves when he came below 4000 feet or so his symptoms became terrible she could come up about 2500 and then her heart reached its limit they had several interviews halfway down the valley which left them nearly dead and at last the doctors had to absolutely forbid it and so for four years they lived within three miles of each other and never met every morning he would go to a place which overlooked the chalet in which she lived and would wave a great white cloth and she answer from below they could see each other quite plainly with their field glasses and they might have been in different planets for all their chance of meeting  and one at last died says the outsider  no sir im sorry not to be able to clinch the story but the man recovered and is now a successful stockbroker in drapers gardens the woman too is the mother of a considerable family but what are you doing there  only taking a note or two of your talk  the three medical men laugh as they walk towards their overcoats  why weve done nothing but talk shop says the general practitioner what possible interest can the public take in that     xiii  the surgeon talks   men die of the diseases which they have studied most remarked the surgeon snipping off the end of a cigar with all his professional neatness and finish its as if the morbid condition was an evil creature which when it found itself closely hunted flew at the throat of its pursuer if you worry the microbes too much they may worry you ive seen cases of it and not necessarily in microbic diseases either there was of course the wellknown instance of liston and the aneurism and a dozen others that i could mention you couldnt have a clearer case than that of poor old walker of st christophers not heard of it well of course it was a little before your time but i wonder that it should have been forgotten you youngsters are so busy in keeping up to the day that you lose a good deal that is interesting of yesterday  walker was one of the best men in europe on nervous disease you must have read his little book on sclerosis of the posterior columns its as interesting as a novel and epochmaking in its way he worked like a horse did walkerhuge consulting practicehours a day in the clinical wardsconstant original investigations and then he enjoyed himself also de mortuis of course but still its an open secret among all who knew him if he died at fortyfive he crammed eighty years into it the marvel was that he could have held on so long at the pace at which he was going but he took it beautifully when it came  i was his clinical assistant at the time walker was lecturing on locomotor ataxia to a wardful of youngsters he was explaining that one of the early signs of the complaint was that the patient could not put his heels together with his eyes shut without staggering as he spoke he suited the action to the word i dont suppose the boys noticed anything i did and so did he though he finished his lecture without a sign  when it was over he came into my room and lit a cigarette  just run over my reflexes smith said he  there was hardly a trace of them left i tapped away at his kneetendon and might as well have tried to get a jerk out of that sofacushion he stood with his eyes shut again and he swayed like a bush in the wind  so said he it was not intercostal neuralgia after all  then i knew that he had had the lightning pains and that the case was complete there was nothing to say so i sat looking at him while he puffed and puffed at the cigarette here he was a man in the prime of life one of the handsomest men in london with money fame social success everything at his feet and now without a moments warning he was told that inevitable death lay before him a death accompanied by more refined and lingering tortures than if he were bound upon a red indian stake he sat in the middle of the blue cigarette cloud with his eyes cast down and the slightest little tightening of his lips then he rose with a motion of his arms as one who throws off old thoughts and enters upon a new course  better put this thing straight at once said he i must make some fresh arrangements may i use your paper and envelopes  he settled himself at my desk and he wrote half a dozen letters it is not a breach of confidence to say that they were not addressed to his professional brothers walker was a single man which means that he was not restricted to a single woman when he had finished he walked out of that little room of mine leaving every hope and ambition of his life behind him and he might have had another year of ignorance and peace if it had not been for the chance illustration in his lecture  it took five years to kill him and he stood it well if he had ever been a little irregular he atoned for it in that long martyrdom he kept an admirable record of his own symptoms and worked out the eye changes more fully than has ever been done when the ptosis got very bad he would hold his eyelid up with one hand while he wrote then when he could not coordinate his muscles to write he dictated to his nurse so died in the odour of science james walker æt 45  poor old walker was very fond of experimental surgery and he broke ground in several directions between ourselves there may have been some more groundbreaking afterwards but he did his best for his cases you know mnamara dont you he always wears his hair long he lets it be understood that it comes from his artistic strain but it is really to conceal the loss of one of his ears walker cut the other one off but you must not tell mac i said so  it was like this walker had a fad about the portio durathe motor to the face you knowand he thought paralysis of it came from a disturbance of the blood supply something else which counterbalanced that disturbance might he thought set it right again we had a very obstinate case of bells paralysis in the wards and had tried it with every conceivable thing blistering tonics nervestretching galvanism needles but all without result walker got it into his head that removal of the ear would increase the blood supply to the part and he very soon gained the consent of the patient to the operation  well we did it at night walker of course felt that it was something of an experiment and did not wish too much talk about it unless it proved successful there were half a dozen of us there mnamara and i among the rest the room was a small one and in the centre was the narrow table with a mackintosh over the pillow and a blanket which extended almost to the floor on either side two candles on a sidetable near the pillow supplied all the light in came the patient with one side of his face as smooth as a babys and the other all in a quiver with fright he lay down and the chloroform towel was placed over his face while walker threaded his needles in the candle light the chloroformist stood at the head of the table and mnamara was stationed at the side to control the patient the rest of us stood by to assist  well the man was about half over when he fell into one of those convulsive flurries which come with the semiunconscious stage he kicked and plunged and struck out with both hands over with a crash went the little table which held the candles and in an instant we were left in total darkness you can think what a rush and a scurry there was one to pick up the table one to find the matches and some to restrain the patient who was still dashing himself about he was held down by two dressers the chloroform was pushed and by the time the candles were relit his incoherent halfsmothered shoutings had changed to a stertorous snore his head was turned on the pillow and the towel was still kept over his face while the operation was carried through then the towel was withdrawn and you can conceive our amazement when we looked upon the face of mnamara  how did it happen why simply enough as the candles went over the chloroformist had stopped for an instant and had tried to catch them the patient just as the light went out had rolled off and under the table poor mnamara clinging frantically to him had been dragged across it and the chloroformist feeling him there had naturally clapped the towel across his mouth and nose the others had secured him and the more he roared and kicked the more they drenched him with chloroform walker was very nice about it and made the most handsome apologies he offered to do a plastic on the spot and make as good an ear as he could but mnamara had had enough of it as to the patient we found him sleeping placidly under the table with the ends of the blanket screening him on both sides walker sent mnamara round his ear next day in a jar of methylated spirit but macs wife was very angry about it and it led to a good deal of illfeeling some people say that the more one has to do with human nature and the closer one is brought in contact with it the less one thinks of it i dont believe that those who know most would uphold that view my own experience is dead against it i was brought up in the miserablemortalclay school of theology and yet here i am after thirty years of intimate acquaintance with humanity filled with respect for it the evil lies commonly upon the surface the deeper strata are good a hundred times i have seen folk condemned to death as suddenly as poor walker was sometimes it was to blindness or to mutilations which are worse than death men and women they almost all took it beautifully and some with such lovely unselfishness and with such complete absorption in the thought of how their fate would affect others that the man about town or the frivolouslydressed woman had seemed to change into an angel before my eyes i have seen deathbeds too of all ages and of all creeds and want of creeds i never saw any of them shrink save only one poor imaginative young fellow who had spent his blameless life in the strictest of sects of course an exhausted frame is incapable of fear as any one can vouch who is told in the midst of his seasickness that the ship is going to the bottom that is why i rate courage in the face of mutilation to be higher than courage when a wasting illness is fining away into death  now ill take a case which i had in my own practice last wednesday a lady came in to consult methe wife of a wellknown sporting baronet the husband had come with her but remained at her request in the waitingroom i need not go into details but it proved to be a peculiarly malignant case of cancer i knew it said she how long have i to live i fear that it may exhaust your strength in a few months i answered poor old jack said she ill tell him that it is not dangerous why should you deceive him i asked well hes very uneasy about it and he is quaking now in the waitingroom he has two old friends to dinner tonight and i havent the heart to spoil his evening tomorrow will be time enough for him to learn the truth out she walked the brave little woman and a moment later her husband with his big red face shining with joy came plunging into my room to shake me by the hand no i respected her wish and i did not undeceive him i dare bet that evening was one of the brightest and the next morning the darkest of his life  its wonderful how bravely and cheerily a woman can face a crushing blow it is different with men a man can stand it without but it knocks him dazed and silly all the same but the woman does not lose her wits any more than she does her courage now i had a case only a few weeks ago which would show you what i mean a gentleman consulted me about his wife a very beautiful woman she had a small tubercular nodule upon her upper arm according to him he was sure that it was of no importance but he wanted to know whether devonshire or the riviera would be the better for her i examined her and found a frightful sarcoma of the bone hardly showing upon the surface but involving the shoulderblade and clavicle as well as the humerus a more malignant case i have never seen i sent her out of the room and i told him the truth what did he do why he walked slowly round that room with his hands behind his back looking with the greatest interest at the pictures i can see him now putting up his gold pincenez and staring at them with perfectly vacant eyes which told me that he saw neither them nor the wall behind them amputation of the arm he asked at last and of the collarbone and shoulderblade said i quite so the collarbone and shoulderblade he repeated still staring about him with those lifeless eyes it settled him i dont believe hell ever be the same man again but the woman took it as bravely and brightly as could be and she has done very well since the mischief was so great that the arm snapped as we drew it from the nightdress no i dont think that there will be any return and i have every hope of her recovery  the first patient is a thing which one remembers all ones life mine was commonplace and the details are of no interest i had a curious visitor however during the first few months after my plate went up it was an elderly woman richly dressed with a wickerwork picnic basket in her hand this she opened with the tears streaming down her face and out there waddled the fattest ugliest and mangiest little pug dog that i have ever seen i wish you to put him painlessly out of the world doctor she cried quick quick or my resolution may give way she flung herself down with hysterical sobs upon the sofa the less experienced a doctor is the higher are his notions of professional dignity as i need not remind you my young friend so i was about to refuse the commission with indignation when i bethought me that quite apart from medicine we were gentleman and lady and that she had asked me to do something for her which was evidently of the greatest possible importance in her eyes i led off the poor little doggie therefore and with the help of a saucerful of milk and a few drops of prussic acid his exit was as speedy and painless as could be desired is it over she cried as i entered it was really tragic to see how all the love which should have gone to husband and children had in default of them been centred upon this uncouth little animal she left quite broken down in her carriage and it was only after her departure that i saw an envelope sealed with a large red seal and lying upon the blotting pad of my desk outside in pencil was writteni have no doubt that you would willingly have done this without a fee but i insist upon your acceptance of the enclosed i opened it with some vague notions of an eccentric millionaire and a fifty pound note but all i found was a postal order for four and sixpence the whole incident struck me as so whimsical that i laughed until i was tired youll find theres so much tragedy in a doctors life my boy that he would not be able to stand it if it were not for the strain of comedy which comes every now and then to leaven it  and a doctor has very much to be thankful for also dont you ever forget it it is such a pleasure to do a little good that a man should pay for the privilege instead of being paid for it still of course he has his home to keep up and his wife and children to support but his patients are his friendsor they should be so he goes from house to house and his step and his voice are loved and welcomed in each what could a man ask for more than that and besides he is forced to be a good man it is impossible for him to be anything else how can a man spend his whole life in seeing suffering bravely borne and yet remain a hard or a vicious man it is a noble generous kindly profession and you youngsters have got to see that it remains so     xiv  the doctors of hoyland   doctor james ripley was always looked upon as an exceedingly lucky dog by all of the profession who knew him his father had preceded him in a practice in the village of hoyland in the north of hampshire and all was ready for him on the very first day that the law allowed him to put his name at the foot of a prescription in a few years the old gentleman retired and settled on the south coast leaving his son in undisputed possession of the whole countryside save for doctor horton near basingstoke the young surgeon had a clear run of six miles in every direction and took his fifteen hundred pounds a year though as is usual in country practices the stable swallowed up most of what the consultingroom earned  doctor james ripley was twoandthirty years of age reserved learned unmarried with set rather stern features and a thinning of the dark hair upon the top of his head which was worth quite a hundred a year to him he was particularly happy in his management of ladies he had caught the tone of bland sternness and decisive suavity which dominates without offending ladies however were not equally happy in their management of him professionally he was always at their service socially he was a drop of quicksilver in vain the country mammas spread out their simple lures in front of him dances and picnics were not to his taste and he preferred during his scanty leisure to shut himself up in his study and to bury himself in virchows archives and the professional journals  study was a passion with him and he would have none of the rust which often gathers round a country practitioner it was his ambition to keep his knowledge as fresh and bright as at the moment when he had stepped out of the examination hall he prided himself on being able at a moments notice to rattle off the seven ramifications of some obscure artery or to give the exact percentage of any physiological compound after a long days work he would sit up half the night performing iridectomies and extractions upon the sheeps eyes sent in by the village butcher to the horror of his housekeeper who had to remove the débris next morning his love for his work was the one fanaticism which found a place in his dry precise nature  it was the more to his credit that he should keep up to date in his knowledge since he had no competition to force him to exertion in the seven years during which he had practiced in hoyland three rivals had pitted themselves against him two in the village itself and one in the neighbouring hamlet of lower hoyland of these one had sickened and wasted being as it was said himself the only patient whom he had treated during his eighteen months of ruralising a second had bought a fourth share of a basingstoke practice and had departed honourably while a third had vanished one september night leaving a gutted house and an unpaid drug bill behind him since then the district had become a monopoly and no one had dared to measure himself against the established fame of the hoyland doctor  it was then with a feeling of some surprise and considerable curiosity that on driving through lower hoyland one morning he perceived that the new house at the end of the village was occupied and that a virgin brass plate glistened upon the swinging gate which faced the high road he pulled up his fifty guinea chestnut mare and took a good look at it verrinder smith md was printed across it in very neat small lettering the last man had had letters half a foot long with a lamp like a firestation doctor james ripley noted the difference and deduced from it that the newcomer might possibly prove a more formidable opponent he was convinced of it that evening when he came to consult the current medical directory by it he learned that doctor verrinder smith was the holder of superb degrees that he had studied with distinction at edinburgh paris berlin and vienna and finally that he had been awarded a gold medal and the lee hopkins scholarship for original research in recognition of an exhaustive inquiry into the functions of the anterior spinal nerve roots doctor ripley passed his fingers through his thin hair in bewilderment as he read his rivals record what on earth could so brilliant a man mean by putting up his plate in a little hampshire hamlet  but doctor ripley furnished himself with an explanation to the riddle no doubt dr verrinder smith had simply come down there in order to pursue some scientific research in peace and quiet the plate was up as an address rather than as an invitation to patients of course that must be the true explanation in that case the presence of this brilliant neighbour would be a splendid thing for his own studies he had often longed for some kindred mind some steel on which he might strike his flint chance had brought it to him and he rejoiced exceedingly  and this joy it was which led him to take a step which was quite at variance with his usual habits it is the custom for a newcomer among medical men to call first upon the older and the etiquette upon the subject is strict doctor ripley was pedantically exact on such points and yet he deliberately drove over next day and called upon doctor verrinder smith such a waiving of ceremony was he felt a gracious act upon his part and a fit prelude to the intimate relations which he hoped to establish with his neighbour  the house was neat and well appointed and doctor ripley was shown by a smart maid into a dapper little consultingroom as he passed in he noticed two or three parasols and a ladys sunbonnet hanging in the hall it was a pity that his colleague should be a married man it would put them upon a different footing and interfere with those long evenings of high scientific talk which he had pictured to himself on the other hand there was much in the consultingroom to please him elaborate instruments seen more often in hospitals than in the houses of private practitioners were scattered about a sphygmograph stood upon the table and a gasometerlike engine which was new to doctor ripley in the corner a bookcase full of ponderous volumes in french and german papercovered for the most part and varying in tint from the shell to the yolk of a ducks egg caught his wandering eyes and he was deeply absorbed in their titles when the door opened suddenly behind him turning round he found himself facing a little woman whose plain palish face was remarkable only for a pair of shrewd humorous eyes of a blue which had two shades too much green in it she held a pincenez in her left hand and the doctors card in her right  how do you do doctor ripley said she  how do you do madam returned the visitor your husband is perhaps out  i am not married said she simply  oh i beg your pardon i meant the doctordr verrinder smith  i am doctor verrinder smith  doctor ripley was so surprised that he dropped his hat and forgot to pick it up again  what he gasped the lee hopkins prizeman you  he had never seen a woman doctor before and his whole conservative soul rose up in revolt at the idea he could not recall any biblical injunction that the man should remain ever the doctor and the woman the nurse and yet he felt as if a blasphemy had been committed his face betrayed his feelings only too clearly  i am sorry to disappoint you said the lady drily  you certainly have surprised me he answered picking up his hat  you are not among our champions then  i cannot say that the movement has my approval  and why  i should much prefer not to discuss it  but i am sure you will answer a ladys question  ladies are in danger of losing their privileges when they usurp the place of the other sex they cannot claim both  why should a woman not earn her bread by her brains  doctor ripley felt irritated by the quiet manner in which the lady crossquestioned him  i should much prefer not to be led into a discussion miss smith  doctor smith she interrupted  well doctor smith but if you insist upon an answer i must say that i do not think medicine a suitable profession for women and that i have a personal objection to masculine ladies  it was an exceedingly rude speech and he was ashamed of it the instant after he had made it the lady however simply raised her eyebrows and smiled  it seems to me that you are begging the question said she of course if it makes women masculine that would be a considerable deterioration  it was a neat little counter and doctor ripley like a pinked fencer bowed his acknowledgment  i must go said he  i am sorry that we cannot come to some more friendly conclusion since we are to be neighbours she remarked  he bowed again and took a step towards the door  it was a singular coincidence she continued that at the instant that you called i was reading your paper on locomotor ataxia in the lancet  indeed said he drily  i thought it was a very able monograph  you are very good  but the views which you attribute to professor pitres of bordeaux have been repudiated by him  i have his pamphlet of 1890 said doctor ripley angrily  here is his pamphlet of 1891 she picked it from among a litter of periodicals if you have time to glance your eye down this passage  doctor ripley took it from her and shot rapidly through the paragraph which she indicated there was no denying that it completely knocked the bottom out of his own article he threw it down and with another frigid bow he made for the door as he took the reins from the groom he glanced round and saw that the lady was standing at her window and it seemed to him that she was laughing heartily  all day the memory of this interview haunted him he felt that he had come very badly out of it she had showed herself to be his superior on his own pet subject she had been courteous while he had been rude selfpossessed when he had been angry and then above all there was her presence her monstrous intrusion to rankle in his mind a woman doctor had been an abstract thing before repugnant but distant now she was there in actual practice with a brass plate up just like his own competing for the same patients not that he feared competition but he objected to this lowering of his ideal of womanhood she could not be more than thirty and had a bright mobile face too he thought of her humorous eyes and of her strong wellturned chin it revolted him the more to recall the details of her education a man of course could come through such an ordeal with all his purity but it was nothing short of shameless in a woman  but it was not long before he learned that even her competition was a thing to be feared the novelty of her presence had brought a few curious invalids into her consultingrooms and once there they had been so impressed by the firmness of her manner and by the singular newfashioned instruments with which she tapped and peered and sounded that it formed the core of their conversation for weeks afterwards and soon there were tangible proofs of her powers upon the countryside farmer eyton whose callous ulcer had been quietly spreading over his shin for years back under a gentle régime of zinc ointment was painted round with blistering fluid and found after three blasphemous nights that his sore was stimulated into healing mrs crowder who had always regarded the birthmark upon her second daughter eliza as a sign of the indignation of the creator at a third helping of raspberry tart which she had partaken of during a critical period learned that with the help of two galvanic needles the mischief was not irreparable in a month doctor verrinder smith was known and in two she was famous  occasionally doctor ripley met her as he drove upon his rounds she had started a high dogcart taking the reins herself with a little tiger behind when they met he invariably raised his hat with punctilious politeness but the grim severity of his face showed how formal was the courtesy in fact his dislike was rapidly deepening into absolute detestation the unsexed woman was the description of her which he permitted himself to give to those of his patients who still remained staunch but indeed they were a rapidlydecreasing body and every day his pride was galled by the news of some fresh defection the lady had somehow impressed the countryfolk with almost superstitious belief in her power and from far and near they flocked to her consultingroom  but what galled him most of all was when she did something which he had pronounced to be impracticable for all his knowledge he lacked nerve as an operator and usually sent his worst cases up to london the lady however had no weakness of the sort and took everything that came in her way it was agony to him to hear that she was about to straighten little alec turners clubfoot and right at the fringe of the rumour came a note from his mother the rectors wife asking him if he would be so good as to act as chloroformist it would be inhumanity to refuse as there was no other who could take the place but it was gall and wormwood to his sensitive nature yet in spite of his vexation he could not but admire the dexterity with which the thing was done she handled the little waxlike foot so gently and held the tiny tenotomy knife as an artist holds his pencil one straight insertion one snick of a tendon and it was all over without a stain upon the white towel which lay beneath he had never seen anything more masterly and he had the honesty to say so though her skill increased his dislike of her the operation spread her fame still further at his expense and selfpreservation was added to his other grounds for detesting her and this very detestation it was which brought matters to a curious climax  one winters night just as he was rising from his lonely dinner a groom came riding down from squire faircastles the richest man in the district to say that his daughter had scalded her hand and that medical help was needed on the instant the coachman had ridden for the lady doctor for it mattered nothing to the squire who came as long as it were speedily doctor ripley rushed from his surgery with the determination that she should not effect an entrance into this stronghold of his if hard driving on his part could prevent it he did not even wait to light his lamps but sprang into his gig and flew off as fast as hoof could rattle he lived rather nearer to the squires than she did and was convinced that he could get there well before her  and so he would but for that whimsical element of chance which will for ever muddle up the affairs of this world and dumbfound the prophets whether it came from the want of his lights or from his mind being full of the thoughts of his rival he allowed too little by half a foot in taking the sharp turn upon the basingstoke road the empty trap and the frightened horse clattered away into the darkness while the squires groom crawled out of the ditch into which he had been shot he struck a match looked down at his groaning companion and then after the fashion of rough strong men when they see what they have not seen before he was very sick  the doctor raised himself a little on his elbow in the glint of the match he caught a glimpse of something white and sharp bristling through his trouserleg halfway down the shin  compound he groaned a three months job and fainted  when he came to himself the groom was gone for he had scudded off to the squires house for help but a small page was holding a giglamp in front of his injured leg and a woman with an open case of polished instruments gleaming in the yellow light was deftly slitting up his trouser with a crooked pair of scissors  its all right doctor said she soothingly i am so sorry about it you can have doctor horton tomorrow but i am sure you will allow me to help you tonight i could hardly believe my eyes when i saw you by the roadside  the groom has gone for help groaned the sufferer  when it comes we can move you into the gig a little more light john so ah dear dear we shall have laceration unless we reduce this before we move you allow me to give you a whiff of chloroform and i have no doubt that i can secure it sufficiently to  doctor ripley never heard the end of that sentence he tried to raise a hand and to murmur something in protest but a sweet smell was in his nostrils and a sense of rich peace and lethargy stole over his jangled nerves down he sank through clear cool water ever down and down into the green shadows beneath gently without effort while the pleasant chiming of a great belfry rose and fell in his ears then he rose again up and up and ever up with a terrible tightness about his temples until at last he shot out of those green shadows and was in the light once more two bright shining golden spots gleamed before his dazed eyes he blinked and blinked before he could give a name to them they were only the two brass balls at the end posts of his bed and he was lying in his own little room with a head like a cannon ball and a leg like an iron bar turning his eyes he saw the calm face of doctor verrinder smith looking down at him  ah at last said she i kept you under all the way home for i knew how painful the jolting would be it is in good position now with a strong side splint i have ordered a morphia draught for you shall i tell your groom to ride for doctor horton in the morning  i should prefer that you should continue the case said doctor ripley feebly and then with a halfhysterical laughyou have all the rest of the parish as patients you know so you may as well make the thing complete by having me also  it was not a very gracious speech but it was a look of pity and not of anger which shone in her eyes as she turned away from his bedside  doctor ripley had a brother william who was assistant surgeon at a london hospital and who was down in hampshire within a few hours of his hearing of the accident he raised his brows when he heard the details  what you are pestered with one of those he cried  i dont know what i should have done without her  ive no doubt shes an excellent nurse  she knows her work as well as you or i  speak for yourself james said the london man with a sniff but apart from that you know that the principle of the thing is all wrong  you think there is nothing to be said on the other side  good heavens do you  well i dont know it struck me during the night that we may have been a little narrow in our views  nonsense james its all very fine for women to win prizes in the lectureroom but you know as well as i do that they are no use in an emergency now i warrant that this woman was all nerves when she was setting your leg that reminds me that i had better just take a look at it and see that it is all right  i would rather that you did not undo it said the patient i have her assurance that it is all right  brother william was deeply shocked  of course if a womans assurance is of more value than the opinion of the assistant surgeon of a london hospital there is nothing more to be said he remarked  i should prefer that you did not touch it said the patient firmly and doctor william went back to london that evening in a huff  the lady who had heard of his coming was much surprised on learning of his departure  we had a difference upon a point of professional etiquette said doctor james and it was all the explanation he would vouchsafe  for two long months doctor ripley was brought in contact with his rival every day and he learned many things which he had not known before she was a charming companion as well as a most assiduous doctor her short presence during the long weary day was like a flower in a sand waste what interested him was precisely what interested her and she could meet him at every point upon equal terms and yet under all her learning and her firmness ran a sweet womanly nature peeping out in her talk shining in her greenish eyes showing itself in a thousand subtle ways which the dullest of men could read and he though a bit of a prig and a pedant was by no means dull and had honesty enough to confess when he was in the wrong  i dont know how to apologise to you he said in his shamefaced fashion one day when he had progressed so far as to be able to sit in an armchair with his leg upon another one i feel that i have been quite in the wrong  why then  over this woman question i used to think that a woman must inevitably lose something of her charm if she took up such studies  oh you dont think they are necessarily unsexed then she cried with a mischievous smile  please dont recall my idiotic expression  i feel so pleased that i should have helped in changing your views i think that it is the most sincere compliment that i have ever had paid me  at any rate it is the truth said he and was happy all night at the remembrance of the flush of pleasure which made her pale face look quite comely for the instant  for indeed he was already far past the stage when he would acknowledge her as the equal of any other woman already he could not disguise from himself that she had become the one woman her dainty skill her gentle touch her sweet presence the community of their tastes had all united to hopelessly upset his previous opinions it was a dark day for him now when his convalescence allowed her to miss a visit and darker still that other one which he saw approaching when all occasion for her visits would be at an end it came round at last however and he felt that his whole lifes fortune would hang upon the issue of that final interview he was a direct man by nature so he laid his hand upon hers as it felt for his pulse and he asked her if she would be his wife  what and unite the practices said she  he started in pain and anger  surely you do not attribute any such base motive to me he cried i love you as unselfishly as ever a woman was loved  no i was wrong it was a foolish speech said she moving her chair a little back and tapping her stethoscope upon her knee forget that i ever said it i am so sorry to cause you any disappointment and i appreciate most highly the honour which you do me but what you ask is quite impossible  with another woman he might have urged the point but his instincts told him that it was quite useless with this one her tone of voice was conclusive he said nothing but leaned back in his chair a stricken man  i am so sorry she said again if i had known what was passing in your mind i should have told you earlier that i intend to devote my life entirely to science there are many women with a capacity for marriage but few with a taste for biology i will remain true to my own line then i came down here while waiting for an opening in the paris physiological laboratory i have just heard that there is a vacancy for me there and so you will be troubled no more by my intrusion upon your practice i have done you an injustice just as you did me one i thought you narrow and pedantic with no good quality i have learned during your illness to appreciate you better and the recollection of our friendship will always be a very pleasant one to me  and so it came about that in a very few weeks there was only one doctor in hoyland but folks noticed that the one had aged many years in a few months that a weary sadness lurked always in the depths of his blue eyes and that he was less concerned than ever with the eligible young ladies whom chance or their careful country mammas placed in his way     xv  crabbes practice   i wonder how many men remember tom waterhouse crabbe student of medicine in this city he was a man whom it was not easy to forget if you had once come across him geniuses are more commonly read about than seen but one could not speak five minutes with crabbe without recognising that he had inherited some touch of that subtle indefinable essence there was a bold originality in his thought and a convincing earnestness in his mode of expressing it which pointed to something higher than mere cleverness he studied spasmodically and irregularly yet he was one of the first mencertainly the most independent thinkerof his year poor crabbethere was something delightfully original even in his mistakes i can remember how he laboriously explained to his examiner that the spanish fly grew in spain and how he gave five drops of sabin oil credit for producing that state which it is usually believed to rectify  crabbe was not at all the type of man whom we usually associate with the word genius he was not pale nor thin neither was his hair of abnormal growth on the contrary he was a powerfully built squareshouldered fellow full of vitality with a voice like a bull and a laugh that could be heard across the meadows a muscular christian too and one of the best rugby forwards in edinburgh  i remember my first meeting with crabbe it gave me a respect both for his cool reasoning powers and for his courage it was at one of the bulgarian atrocity meetings held in edinburgh in 78 the hall was densely packed and the ventilation defective so that i was not sorry to find that owing to my lateness i was unable to get any place and had to stand in the doorway leaning against the wall there i could both enjoy the cool air and hear the invectives which speaker after speaker was hurling at the conservative ministry the audience seemed enthusiastically unanimous a burst of cheering hailed every argument and sarcasm there was not one dissentient voice the speaker paused to moisten his lips and there was a silence over the hall then a clear voice rose from the middle of it all very fine but what did gladstone there was a howl of execration and yells of turn him out but the voice was still audible what did gladstone do in 63 it demanded turn him out show him out of the window put him out there was a perfect hurricane of threats and abuse men sprang upon the benches shaking their sticks and peering over each others shoulders to get a glimpse of the daring conservative what did gladstone do in 63 roared the voice i insist upon being answered there was another howl of execration a great swaying of the crowd and an eddy in the middle of it then the mass of people parted and a man was borne out kicking and striking and after a desperate resistance was precipitated down the stairs  as the meeting became somewhat monotonous after this little divertisement i went down into the street to cool myself there was my inquisitive friend leaning up against a lamppost with his coat torn to shreds and a pipe in his mouth recognising him by his cut as being a medical student i took advantage of the freemasonry which exists between members of that profession  excuse me i said you are a medical arent you  yes he said thomas crabbe a varsity man  my name is barton i said pardon my curiosity but would you mind telling me what gladstone did do in 63  my dear chap said crabbe taking my arm and marching up the street with me i havent the remotest idea in the world you see i was confoundedly hot and i wanted a smoke and there seemed no chance of getting out for i was jammed up right in the middle of the hall so i thought id just make them carry me out and i didnot a bad idea was it if you have nothing better to do come up to my digs and have some supper  certainly said i and that was the foundation of my friendship with thomas crabbe  crabbe took his degree a year before i did and went down to a large port in england with the intention of setting up there a brilliant career seemed to lie before him for besides his deep knowledge of medicine acquired in the most practical school in the world he had that indescribable manner which gains a patients confidence at once it is curious how seldom the two are united that charming doctor my dear madam who pulled the young charley through the measles so nicely and had such a pleasant manner and such a clever face was a noted duffer at college and the laughingstock of his year while poor little doctor grinder whom you snubbed so and who seemed so nervous and didnt know where to put his hands he won a gold medal for original research and was as good a man as his professors after all it is generally the outside case not the inside works which is noticed in this world  crabbe went down with his young degree and a still younger wife to settle in this town which we will call brisport i was acting as assistant to a medical man in manchester and heard little from my former friend save that he had set up in considerable style and was making a bid for a highclass practice at once i read one most deep and erudite paper in a medical journal entitled curious development of a discopherous bone in the stomach of a duck which emanated from his pen but beyond this and some remarks on the embryology of fishes he seemed strangely quiet  one day to my surprise i received a telegram from mrs crabbe begging me to run down to brisport and see her husband as he was far from well having obtained leave of absence from my principal i started by the next train seriously anxious about my friend mrs crabbe met me at the station she told me tom was getting very much broken down by continued anxiety the expenses of keeping up his establishment were heavy and patients were few and far between he wished my advice and knowledge of practical work to guide him in this crisis  i certainly found crabbe altered very much for the worse he looked gaunt and cadaverous and much of his old reckless joyousness had left him though he brightened up wonderfully on seeing an old friend  after dinner the three of us held a solemn council of war in which he laid before me all his difficulties what in the world am i to do barton he said if i could make myself known it would be all right but no one seems to look at my doorplate and the place is overstocked with doctors i believe they think i am a dd i wouldnt mind if these other fellows were good men but they are not they are all antiquated old fogies at least half a century behind the day now there is old markham who lives in that brick house over there and does most of the practice in the town ill swear he doesnt know the difference between locomotor ataxia and a hypodermic syringe but he is known so they flock into his surgery in a manner which is simply repulsive and davidson down the road he is only an lsa talked about epispastic paralysis at the society the other nightconfused it with liquor epispasticus you know yet that fellow makes a pound to my shilling  get your name known and write said i  but what on earth am i to write about asked crabbe if a man has no cases how in the world is he to describe them help yourself and pass the bottle  couldnt you invent a case just to raise the wind  not a bad idea said crabbe thoughtfully by the way did you see my discopherous bone in a ducks stomach  yes it seemed rather good  good i believe you why man it was a domino which the old duck had managed to gorge itself with it was a perfect godsend then i wrote about embryology of fishes because i knew nothing about it and reasoned that ninetynine men in a hundred would be in the same boat but as to inventing whole cases it seems rather daring does it not  a desperate disease needs desperate remedies said i you remember old hobson at college he writes once a year to the british medical and asks if any correspondent can tell him how much it costs to keep a horse in the country and then he signs himself in the medical register as the contributor of several unostentatious queries and remarks to scientific papers  it was quite a treat to hear crabbe laugh with his old student guffaw well old man he said well talk it over tomorrow we mustnt be selfish and forget that you are a visitor here come along out and see the beauties save the mark of brisport so saying he donned a funereal coat a pair of spectacles and a hat with a desponding brim and we spent the remainder of the evening roaming about and discussing mind and matter  we had another council of war next day it was a sunday and as we sat in the window smoking our pipes and watching the crowded street we brooded over many plans for gaining notoriety  ive done bob sawyers dodge said tom despondingly i never go to church without rushing out in the middle of the sermon but no one knows who i am so it is no good i had a nice slide in front of the door last winter for three weeks and used to give it a polish up after dusk every night but there was only one man ever fell on it and he actually limped right across the road to markhams surgery wasnt that hard lines  very hard indeed said i  something might be done with orange peel continued tom but it looks so awfully bad to have the whole pavement yellow with peel in front of a doctors house  it certainly does i agreed  there was one fellow came in with a cut head one night said tom and i sewed him up but he had forgotten his purse he came back in a week to have the stitches taken out but without the money that man is going about to this day jack with half a yard of my catgut in himand in him itll stay until i see the coin  couldnt we get up some incident said i which would bring your name really prominently before the public  my dear fellow thats exactly what i want if i could get my name into the brisport chronicle it would be worth five hundred a year to me theres a family connection you know and people only want to realise that i am here but how am i to do it unless by brawling in the street or by increasing my family now there was the excitement about the discopherous bone if huxley or some of these fellows had taken the matter up it might have been the making of me but they took it all in with a disgusting complacency as if it was the most usual thing in the world and dominoes were the normal food of ducks ill tell you what ill do he continued moodily eyeing his fowls ill puncture the floors of their fourth ventricles and present them to markham you know that makes them ravenous and theyd eat him out of house and home in time eh jack  look here thomas said i you want your name in the papersis that it  thats about the state of the case  well by jove you shall have it  eh why how  theres a pretty considerable crowd of people outside isnt there tom i continued they are coming out of church arent they if there was an accident now it would make some noise  i say youre not going to let rip among them with a shot gun are you in order to found a practice for me  no not exactly but how would this read in tomorrows chroniclepainful occurrence in george streetas the congregation were leaving george street cathedral after the morning service they were horrified to see a handsome fashionably dressed gentleman stagger and fall senseless upon the pavement he was taken up and carried writhing in terrible convulsions into the surgery of the wellknown practitioner doctor crabbe who had been promptly upon the spot we are happy to state that the fit rapidly passed off and that owing to the skilful attention which he received the gentleman who is a distinguished visitor in our city was able to regain his hotel and is now rapidly becoming convalescent how would that do eh  splendid jacksplendid  well my boy im your fashionably dressed stranger and i promise you they wont carry me into markhams  my dear fellow you are a treasureyou wont mind my bleeding you  bleeding me confound you yes i do very much mind  just opening a little vein pleaded tom  not a capillary said i now look here ill throw up the whole business unless you give me your word to behave yourself i dont draw the line at brandy  very well brandy be it grumbled tom  well im off said i ill go into the fit against your garden gate  all right old man  by the way what sort of a fit would you like i could give you either an epileptic or an apoplectic easily but perhaps youd like something more ornatea catalepsy or a trade spasm maybewith miners nystagmus or something of that kind  wait a bit till i think said tom and he sat puffing at his pipe for five minutes sit down again jack he continued i think we could do something better than this you see a fit isnt a very deadly thing and if i did bring you through one there would be no credit in it if we are going to work this thing we may as well work it well we can only do it once it wouldnt do for the same fashionably dressed stranger to be turning up a second time people would begin to smell a rat  so they would said i but hang it you cant expect me to tumble off the cathedral spire in order that you may hold an inquest on my remains i you may command me in anything reasonable however what shall it be  tom seemed lost in thought can you swim he said presently  fairly well  you could keep yourself afloat for five minutes  yes i could do that  youre not afraid of water  im not much afraid of anything  then come out said tom and well go over the ground  i couldnt get one word out of him as to his intentions so i trotted along beside him wondering what in the wide world he was going to do our first stoppage was at a small dock which is crossed by a swinging iron bridge he hailed an amphibious man with topboots do you keep rowingboats and let them out he asked  yes sir said the man  then good day and to the boatmans profound and audible disgust we set off at once in the other direction  our next stoppage was at the jolly mariners arms did they keep beds yes they kept beds we then proceeded to the chemists did he keep a galvanic battery once again the answer was in the affirmative and with a satisfied smile tom crabbe headed for home once more leaving some very angry people behind him  that evening over a bowl of punch he revealed his planand the council of three revised it modified it and ended by adopting it with the immediate result that i at once changed my quarters to the brisport hotel  i was awakened next day by the sun streaming in at my bedroom window it was a glorious morning i sprang out of bed and looked at my watch it was nearly nine oclock only an hour i muttered and nearly a mile to walk and proceeded to dress with all the haste i could well i soliloquised as i sharpened my razor if old tom crabbe doesnt get his name in the papers today it isnt my fault i wonder if any friend would do as much for me i finished my toilet swallowed a cup of coffee and sallied out  brisport seemed unusually lively this morning the streets were crowded with people i wormed my way down waterloo street through the old square and past crabbes house the cathedral bells were chiming ten oclock as i reached the abovementioned little dock with the iron swinging bridge a man was standing on the bridge leaning over the balustrades there was no mistaking the heartbroken hat rim and the spectacles of thomas waterhouse crabbe mb  i passed him without sign of recognition dawdled a little on the quay and then sauntered down to the boathouse our friend of yesterday was standing at the door with a short pipe in his mouth  could i have a boat for an hour i asked  he beamed all over one minute sir he said an ill get the sculls would you want me to row you sir  yes youd better i replied  he bustled about and in a short time managed to launch a leakylooking old tub into which he stepped while i squatted down in the sheets  take me round the docks i said i want to have a look at the shipping  aye aye sir said he and away we went and paddled about the docks for the best part of an hour at the end of that time we turned back and pulled up to the little quay from which he had started it was past eleven now and the place was crowded with people half brisport seemed to have concentrated round the iron bridge the melancholy hat was still visible  shall i pull in sir asked the boatman  give me the sculls said i i want a bit of exerciselet us change places and i stood up  take care sir yelled the boatman as i gave a stagger look out and he made a frantic grab at me but too late for with a melodramatic scream i reeled and fell over into the brisport dock  i hardly realised what it was i was going to do until i had done it it was not a pleasant feeling to have the thick clammy water closing over ones head i struck the bottom with my feet and shot up again to the surface the air seemed alive with shouts heave a rope wheres a boathook catch him there he is the boatman managed to hit me me a smart blow on the head with something an oar i fancy and i went down again but not before i had got my lungs well filled with air i came up again and my topbooted friend seized me by the hair of my head as if he would tear my scalp off dont struggle he yelled and ill save you yet but i shook him off and took another plunge there was no resisting him next time however for he got a boathook into my collar and though i kept my head under water as long as possible i was ignominiously hauled to land  there i lay on the hard stones of the quay feeling very much inclined to laugh but looking no doubt very blue and ghastly hes gone poor chap said some one send for a doctor run run to markham quite dead turn him upside down feel his pulse slap him on the back  stop said a solemn voicestop can i be of any assistance i am a medical man what has occurred  a man drowned cried a score of voices stand back make a ringroom for the doctor  my name is doctor crabbe dear me poor young gentleman drop his hand he roared at a man who was making for my pulse i tell you in such a state the least pressure or impediment to the arterial circulation might prove fatal  to save my life i couldnt help giving a very audible inward chuckle at toms presence of mind there was a murmur of surprise among the crowd tom solemnly took off his hat the death rattle he whispered the young soul has flownyet perchance science may yet recall it bear him up to the tavern  a shutter was brought i was solemnly hoisted on to the top of it and the melancholy cortège passed along the quay the corpse being really the most cheerful member of the company  we got to the mariners arms and i was stripped and laid in the best bed the news of the accident seemed to have spread for there was a surging crowd in the street and the staircase was thronged with people tom would only admit about a dozen of the more influential of the townspeople into the room but issued bulletins out of the window every five minutes to the crowd below  quite dead i heard him roar respiration has ceasedno pulsationbut we still persevere it is our duty  shall i bring brandy said the landlady  yes and towels and a hip bath and a basinbut the brandy first  this sentiment met with the hearty approbation of the corpse  why hes drinking it said the landlady as she applied the glass to my lips  merely an instance of a reflex automatic action said tom my good woman any corpse will drink brandy if you only apply it to the glossopharyngeal tract stand aside and we will proceed to try marshall halls method of resuscitation  the citizens stood round in a solemn ring while tom stripped off his coat and climbing on the bed proceeded to roll me about in a manner which seemed to dislocate every bone in my body  hang it man stop i growled but he only paused to make a dart for the window and yell out no sign of life and then fell upon me with greater energy than ever we will now try sylvestres method he said when the perspiration was fairly boiling out of him and with that he seized me again and performed a series of evolutions even more excruciating than the first it is hopeless he said at last stopping and covering my head reverently with the bedclothes send for the coroner he has gone to a better land here is my card he continued to an inspector of police who had arrived doctor crabbe of george street you will see that the matter is accurately reported poor young man and tom drew his handkerchief across his eyes and walked towards the door while a groan of sympathy rose from the crowd outside  he had his hand upon the handle when a thought seemed to strike him and he turned back there is yet a possible hope he said we have not tried the magical effects of electricitythat subtle power next of kin to nervous force is there a chemists near  yes doctor theres mr mclagan just round the corner  then run run a human life trembles in the balanceget his strongest battery quick and away went half the crowd racing down the street and tumbling over each other in the effort to be first at mr mclagans they came back very red and hot and one of them bore a shining brown mahogany box in his arms which contained the instrument in question  now gentlemen said tom i believe i may say that i am the first practitioner in great britain who has applied electricity to this use in my student days i have seen the learned rokilansky of vienna employ it in some such way i apply the negative pole over the solar plexus while the positive i place on the inner side of the patella i have seen it produce surprising effects it may again in this case  it certainly did whether it was an accident or whether toms innate reckless devilry got the better of him i cannot say he himself always swore that it was an accident but at any rate he sent the strongest current of a most powerful battery rattling and crashing through my system i gave one earsplitting yell and landed with a single bound into the middle of the room i was charged with electricity like a leyden jar my very hair bristled with it  you confounded idiot i shouted shaking my fist in toms face isnt it enough to dislocate every bone in my body with your ridiculous resuscitations without ruining my constitution with this thing and i gave a vicious kick at the mahogany box never was there such a stampede the inspector of police and the correspondent of the chronicle sprang down the staircase followed by the twelve respectable citizens the landlady crawled under the bed a lodger who was nursing her baby while she conversed with a neighbour in the street below let the child drop upon her friends head in fact tom might have founded the nucleus of a practice there and then as it was his usual presence of mind carried him through a miracle he yelled from the window a miracle our friend has been brought back to us send for a cab and then sotto voce for goodness sake jack behave like a christian and crawl into bed again remember the landlady is in the room and dont go prancing about in your shirt  hang the landlady said i i feel like a lightning conductoryouve ruined me  poor fellow cried tom once more addressing the crowd he is alive but his intellect is irretrievably affected he thinks he is a lightning conductor make way for the cab thats right now help me to lead him in he is out of all danger now he can dress at his hotel if any of you have any information to give which may throw light upon this case my address is 81 george street remember doctor crabbe 81 george street good day kind friends goodbye and with that he bundled me into the cab to prevent my making any further disclosures and drove off amid the enthusiastic cheers of the admiring crowd  i could not stay in brisport long enough to see the effect of my coup détat tom gave us a champagne supper that night and the fun was fast and furious but in the midst of it a telegram from my principal was handed in ordering me to return to manchester by the next train i waited long enough to get an early copy of the brisport chronicle and beguiled the tedious journey by perusing the glowing account of my mishap a column and a half was devoted to dr crabbe and the extraordinary effects of electricity upon a drowned man it ultimately got into some of the london papers and was gravely commented upon in the lancet  as to the pecuniary success of our little experiment i can only judge from the following letter from tom crabbe which i transcribe exactly as i received it       what ho my resuscitated corpse       you want to know how all goes in brisport i suppose well      ill tell you im cutting markham and davidson out completely      my boy the day after our little joke i got a bruised leg that      baby a cut head the woman the baby fell upon an      erysipelas and a bronchitis next day a fine rich cancer of      markhams threw him up and came
