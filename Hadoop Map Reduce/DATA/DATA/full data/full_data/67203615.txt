67203615	maxims for revolutionists  by  george bernard shaw  18561950    the golden rule  do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you  their tastes may not be the same  never resist temptation prove all things hold fast that which is good  do not love your neighbor as yourself  if you are on good terms with yourself it is an impertinence if on bad an injury  the golden rule is that there are no golden rules    idolatry  the art of government is the organization of idolatry  the bureaucracy consists of functionaries the aristocracy of idols the democracy of idolaters  the populace cannot understand the bureaucracy it can only worship the national idols  the savage bows down to idols of wood and stone the civilized man to idols of flesh and blood  a limited monarchy is a device for combining the inertia of a wooden idol with the credibility of a flesh and blood one  when the wooden idol does not answer the peasants prayer he beats it when the flesh and blood idol does not satisfy the civilized man he cuts its head off  he who slays a king and he who dies for him are alike idolaters    royalty  kings are not born they are made by artificial hallucination  when the process is interrupted by adversity at a critical age as in the case of charles ii the subject becomes sane and never completely recovers his kingliness  the court is the servants hall of the sovereign  vulgarity in a king flatters the majority of the nation  the flunkeyism propagated by the throne is the price we pay for its political convenience    democracy  if the lesser mind could measure the greater as a footrule can measure a pyramid there would be finality in universal suffrage  as it is the political problem remains unsolved  democracy substitutes election by the incompetent many for appointment by the corrupt few  democratic republics can no more dispense with national idols than monarchies with public functionaries  government presents only one problem the discovery of a trustworthy anthropometric method    imperialism  excess of insularity makes a briton an imperialist  excess of local selfassertion makes a colonist an imperialist  a colonial imperialist is one who raises colonial troops equips a colonial squadron claims a federal parliament sending its measures to the throne instead of to the colonial office and being finally brought by this means into insoluble conflict with the insular british imperialist cuts the painter and breaks up the empire    liberty and equality  he who confuses political liberty with freedom and political equality with similarity has never thought for five minutes about either  nothing can be unconditional consequently nothing can be free  liberty means responsibility  that is why most men dread it  the duke inquires contemptuously whether his gamekeeper is the equal of the astronomer royal but he insists that they shall both be hanged equally if they murder him  the notion that the colonel need be a better man than the private is as confused as the notion that the keystone need be stronger than the coping stone  where equality is undisputed so also is subordination  equality is fundamental in every department of social organization  the relation of superior to inferior excludes good manners    education  when a man teaches something he does not know to somebody else who has no aptitude for it and gives him a certificate of proficiency the latter has completed the education of a gentleman  a fools brain digests philosophy into folly science into superstition and art into pedantry  hence university education  the best broughtup children are those who have seen their parents as they are  hypocrisy is not the parents first duty  the vilest abortionist is he who attempts to mould a childs character  at the university every great treatise is postponed until its author attains impartial judgment and perfect knowledge  if a horse could wait as long for its shoes and would pay for them in advance our blacksmiths would all be college dons  he who can does  he who cannot teaches  a learned man is an idler who kills time with study  beware of his false knowledge it is more dangerous than ignorance  activity is the only road to knowledge  every fool believes what his teachers tell him and calls his credulity science or morality as confidently as his father called it divine revelation  no man fully capable of his own language ever masters another  no man can be a pure specialist without being in the strict sense an idiot  do not give your children moral and religious instruction unless you are quite sure they will not take it too seriously  better be the mother of henri quatre and nell gwynne than of robespierre and queen mary tudor    marriage  marriage is popular because it combines the maximum of temptation with the maximum of opportunity  marriage is the only legal contract which abrogates as between the parties all the laws that safeguard the particular relation to which it refers  the essential function of marriage is the continuance of the race as stated in the book of common prayer  the accidental function of marriage is the gratification of the amoristic sentiment of mankind  the artificial sterilization of marriage makes it possible for marriage to fulfill its accidental function whilst neglecting its essential one  the most revolutionary invention of the xix century was the artificial sterilization of marriage  any marriage system which condemns a majority of the population to celibacy will be violently wrecked on the pretext that it outrages morality  polygamy when tried under modern democratic conditions as by the mormons is wrecked by the revolt of the mass of inferior men who are condemned to celibacy by it for the maternal instinct leads a woman to prefer a tenth share in a first rate man to the exclusive possession of a third rate one  polyandry has not been tried under these conditions   the minimum of national celibacy ascertained by dividing the number of males in the community by the number of females and taking the quotient as the number of wives or husbands permitted to each person is secured in england where the quotient is 1 by the institution of monogamy  the modern sentimental term for the national minimum of celibacy is purity  marriage or any other form of promiscuous amoristic monogamy is fatal to large states because it puts its ban on the deliberate breeding of man as a political animal    crime and punishment  all scoundrelism is summed up in the phrase que messieurs les assassins commencent  the man who has graduated from the flogging block at eton to the bench from which he sentences the garotter to be flogged is the same social product as the garotter who has been kicked by his father and cuffed by his mother until he has grown strong enough to throttle and rob the rich citizen whose money he desires  imprisonment is as irrevocable as death  criminals do not die by the hands of the law  they die by the hands of other men  the assassin czolgosz made president mckinley a hero by assassinating him  the united states of america made czolgosz a hero by the same process  assassination on the scaffold is the worst form of assassination because there it is invested with the approval of society  it is the deed that teaches not the name we give it  murder and capital punishment are not opposites that cancel one another but similars that breed their kind  crime is only the retail department of what in wholesale we call penal law  when a man wants to murder a tiger he calls it sport when the tiger wants to murder him he calls it ferocity  the distinction between crime and justice is no greater  whilst we have prisons it matters little which of us occupy the cells  the most anxious man in a prison is the governor  it is not necessary to replace a guillotined criminal it is necessary to replace a guillotined social system    titles  titles distinguish the mediocre embarrass the superior and are disgraced by the inferior  great men refuse titles because they are jealous of them    honor  there are no perfectly honorable men but every true man has one main point of honor and a few minor ones  you cannot believe in honor until you have achieved it  better keep yourself clean and bright you are the window through which you must see the world  your word can never be as good as your bond because your memory can never be as trustworthy as your honor    property  property said proudhon is theft  this is the only perfect truism that has been uttered on the subject    servants  when domestic servants are treated as human beings it is not worth while to keep them  the relation of master and servant is advantageous only to masters who do not scruple to abuse their authority and to servants who do not scruple to abuse their trust  the perfect servant when his master makes humane advances to him feels that his existence is threatened and hastens to change his place  masters and servants are both tyrannical but the masters are the more dependent of the two  a man enjoys what he uses not what his servants use  man is the only animal which esteems itself rich in proportion to the number and voracity of its parasites  ladies and gentlemen are permitted to have friends in the kennel but not in the kitchen  domestic servants by making spoiled children of their masters are forced to intimidate them in order to be able to live with them  in a slave state the slaves rule in mayfair the tradesman rules    how to beat children  if you strike a child take care that you strike it in anger even at the risk of maiming it for life  a blow in cold blood neither can nor should be forgiven  if you beat children for pleasure avow your object frankly and play the game according to the rules as a foxhunter does and you will do comparatively little harm  no foxhunter is such a cad as to pretend that he hunts the fox to teach it not to steal chickens or that he suffers more acutely than the fox at the death  remember that even in childbeating there is the sportsmans way and the cads way    religion  beware of the man whose god is in the skies  what a man believes may be ascertained not from his creed but from the assumptions on which he habitually acts    virtues and vices  no specific virtue or vice in a man implies the existence of any other specific virtue or vice in him however closely the imagination may associate them  virtue consists not in abstaining from vice but in not desiring it  selfdenial is not a virtue it is only the effect of prudence on rascality  obedience simulates subordination as fear of the police simulates honesty  disobedience the rarest and most courageous of the virtues is seldom distinguished from neglect the laziest and commonest of the vices  vice is waste of life  poverty obedience and celibacy are the canonical vices  economy is the art of making the most of life  the love of economy is the root of all virtue    fairplay  the love of fairplay is a spectators virtue not a principals    greatness  greatness is only one of the sensations of littleness  in heaven an angel is nobody in particular  greatness is the secular name for divinity both mean simply what lies beyond us  if a great man could make us understand him we should hang him  we admit that when the divinity we worshipped made itself visible and comprehensible we crucified it  to a mathematician the eleventh means only a single unit to the bushman who cannot count further than his ten fingers it is an incalculable myriad  the difference between the shallowest routineer and the deepest thinker appears to the latter trifling to the former infinite  in a stupid nation the man of genius becomes a god everybody worships him and nobody does his will    beauty and happiness art and riches  happiness and beauty are byproducts  folly is the direct pursuit of happiness and beauty  riches and art are spurious receipts for the production of happiness and beauty  he who desires a lifetime of happiness with a beautiful woman desires to enjoy the taste of wine by keeping his mouth always full of it  the most intolerable pain is produced by prolonging the keenest pleasure  the man with toothache thinks everyone happy whose teeth are sound  the poverty stricken man makes the same mistake about the rich man  the more a man possesses over and above what he uses the more careworn he becomes  the tyranny that forbids you to make the road with pick and shovel is worse than that which prevents you from lolling along it in a carriage and pair  in an ugly and unhappy world the richest man can purchase nothing but ugliness and unhappiness  in his efforts to escape from ugliness and unhappiness the rich man intensifies both  every new yard of west end creates a new acre of east end  the xix century was the age of faith in fine art  the results are before us    the perfect gentleman  the fatal reservation of the gentleman is that he sacrifices everything to his honor except his gentility  a gentleman of our days is one who has money enough to do what every fool would do if he could afford it that is consume without producing  the true diagnostic of modern gentility is parasitism  no elaboration of physical or moral accomplishment can atone for the sin of parasitism  a modern gentleman is necessarily the enemy of his country  even in war he does not fight to defend it but to prevent his power of preying on it from passing to a foreigner  such combatants are patriots in the same sense as two dogs fighting for a bone are lovers of animals  the north american indian was a type of the sportsman warrior gentleman the periclean athenian was a type of the intellectually and artistically cultivated gentleman  both were political failures  the modern gentleman without the hardihood of the one or the culture of the other has the appetite of both put together  he will not succeed where they failed  he who believes in education criminal law and sport needs only property to make him a perfect modern gentleman    moderation  moderation is never applauded for its own sake  a moderately honest man with a moderately faithful wife moderate drinkers both in a moderately healthy house that is the true middle class unit    the unconscious self  the unconscious self is the real genius  your breathing goes wrong the moment your conscious self meddles with it   except during the nine months before he draws his first breath no man manages his affairs as well as a tree does    reason  the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself  therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man  the man who listens to reason is lost reason enslaves all whose minds are not strong enough to master her    decency  decency is indecencys conspiracy of silence    experience  men are wise in proportion not to their experience but to their capacity for experience  if we could learn from mere experience the stones of london would be wiser than its wisest men    times revenges  those whom we called brutes had their revenge when darwin shewed us that they are our cousins  the thieves had their revenge when marx convicted the bourgeoisie of theft    good intentions  hell is paved with good intentions not with bad ones  all men mean well    natural rights  the master of arts by proving that no man has any natural rights compels himself to take his own for granted  the right to live is abused whenever it is not constantly challenged    faute de mieux  in my childhood i demurred to the description of a certain young lady as the pretty miss so and so my aunt rebuked me by saying remember always that the least plain sister is the family beauty  no age or condition is without its heroes  the least incapable general in a nation is its cæsar the least imbecile statesman its solon the least confused thinker its socrates the least commonplace poet its shakespear    charity  charity is the most mischievous sort of pruriency  those who minister to poverty and disease are accomplices in the two worst of all the crimes  he who gives money he has not earned is generous with other peoples labor  every genuinely benevolent person loathes almsgiving and mendicity    fame  life levels all men death reveals the eminent    discipline  mutiny acts are needed only by officers who command without authority divine right needs no whip    women in the home  home is the girls prison and the womans workhouse    civilization  civilization is a disease produced by the practice of building societies with rotten material  those who admire modern civilization usually identify it with the steam engine and the electric telegraph  those who understand the steam engine and the electric telegraph spend their lives in trying to replace them with something better  the imagination cannot conceive a viler criminal than he who should build another london like the present one nor a greater benefactor than he who should destroy it    gambling  the most popular method of distributing wealth is the method of the roulette table  the roulette table pays nobody except him that keeps it  nevertheless a passion for gaming is common though a passion for keeping roulette tables is unknown  gambling promises the poor what property performs for the rich that is why the bishops dare not denounce it fundamentally    the social question  do not waste your time on social questions  what is the matter with the poor is poverty what is the matter with the rich is uselessness    stray sayings  we are told that when jehovah created the world he saw that it was good what would he say now  the conversion of a savage to christianity is the conversion of christianity to savagery  no man dares say so much of what he thinks as to appear to himself an extremist  mens sana in corpore sano is a foolish saying  the sound body is a product of the sound mind  decadence can find agents only when it wears the mask of progress  in moments of progress the noble succeed because things are going their way in moments of decadence the base succeed for the same reason hence the world is never without the exhilaration of contemporary success  the reformer for whom the world is not good enough finds himself shoulder to shoulder with him that is not good enough for the world  every man over forty is a scoundrel  youth which is forgiven everything forgives itself nothing age which forgives itself everything is forgiven nothing  when we learn to sing that britons never will be masters we shall make an end of slavery  do not mistake your objection to defeat for an objection to fighting your objection to being a slave for an objection to slavery your objection to not being as rich as your neighbor for an objection to poverty  the cowardly the insubordinate and the envious share your objections  take care to get what you like or you will be forced to like what you get  where there is no ventilation fresh air is declared unwholesome where there is no religion hypocrisy becomes good taste  where there is no knowledge ignorance calls itself science  if the wicked flourish and the fittest survive nature must be the god of rascals  if history repeats itself and the unexpected always happens how incapable must man be of learning from experience  compassion is the fellowfeeling of the unsound  those who understand evil pardon it those who resent it destroy it  acquired notions of propriety are stronger than natural instincts  it is easier to recruit for monasteries and convents than to induce an arab woman to uncover her mouth in public or a british officer to walk through bond street in a golfing cap on an afternoon in may  it is dangerous to be sincere unless you are also stupid  the chinese tame fowls by clipping their wings and women by deforming their feet  a petticoat round the ankles serves equally well  political economy and social economy are amusing intellectual games but vital economy is the philosopher stone  when a heretic wishes to avoid martyrdom he speaks of orthodoxy true and false and demonstrates that the true is his heresy  beware of the man who does not return your blow he neither forgives you nor allows you to forgive yourself  if you injure your neighbor better not do it by halves  sentimentality is the error of supposing that quarter can be given or taken in moral conflicts  two starving men cannot be twice as hungry as one but two rascals can be ten times as vicious as one  make your cross your crutch but when you see another man do it beware of him    selfsacrifice  selfsacrifice enables us to sacrifice other people without blushing  if you begin by sacrificing yourself to those you love you will end by hating those to whom you have sacrificed yourself     the end
