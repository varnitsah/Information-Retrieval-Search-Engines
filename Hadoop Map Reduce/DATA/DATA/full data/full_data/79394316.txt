79394316	how to tell a story and others  by mark twain    contents       how to tell a story           the wounded soldier           the golden arm      mental telegraphy again      the invalids story     how to tell a story            the humorous story an american developmentits difference           from comic and witty stories  i do not claim that i can tell a story as it ought to be told i only claim to know how a story ought to be told for i have been almost daily in the company of the most expert storytellers for many years  there are several kinds of stories but only one difficult kindthe humorous i will talk mainly about that one the humorous story is american the comic story is english the witty story is french the humorous story depends for its effect upon the manner of the telling the comic story and the witty story upon the matter  the humorous story may be spun out to great length and may wander around as much as it pleases and arrive nowhere in particular but the comic and witty stories must be brief and end with a point the humorous story bubbles gently along the others burst  the humorous story is strictly a work of arthigh and delicate artand only an artist can tell it but no art is necessary in telling the comic and the witty story anybody can do it the art of telling a humorous storyunderstand i mean by word of mouth not printwas created in america and has remained at home  the humorous story is told gravely the teller does his best to conceal the fact that he even dimly suspects that there is anything funny about it but the teller of the comic story tells you beforehand that it is one of the funniest things he has ever heard then tells it with eager delight and is the first person to laugh when he gets through and sometimes if he has had good success he is so glad and happy that he will repeat the nub of it and glance around from face to face collecting applause and then repeat it again it is a pathetic thing to see  very often of course the rambling and disjointed humorous story finishes with a nub point snapper or whatever you like to call it then the listener must be alert for in many cases the teller will divert attention from that nub by dropping it in a carefully casual and indifferent way with the pretence that he does not know it is a nub  artemus ward used that trick a good deal then when the belated audience presently caught the joke he would look up with innocent surprise as if wondering what they had found to laugh at dan setchell used it before him nye and riley and others use it today  but the teller of the comic story does not slur the nub he shouts it at youevery time and when he prints it in england france germany and italy he italicizes it puts some whooping exclamationpoints after it and sometimes explains it in a parenthesis all of which is very depressing and makes one want to renounce joking and lead a better life  let me set down an instance of the comic method using an anecdote which has been popular all over the world for twelve or fifteen hundred years the teller tells it in this way     the wounded soldier  in the course of a certain battle a soldier whose leg had been shot off appealed to another soldier who was hurrying by to carry him to the rear informing him at the same time of the loss which he had sustained whereupon the generous son of mars shouldering the unfortunate proceeded to carry out his desire the bullets and cannonballs were flying in all directions and presently one of the latter took the wounded mans head offwithout however his deliverer being aware of it in nolong time he was hailed by an officer who said  where are you going with that carcass  to the rear sirhes lost his leg  his leg forsooth responded the astonished officer you mean his head you booby  whereupon the soldier dispossessed himself of his burden and stood looking down upon it in great perplexity at length he said  it is true sir just as you have said then after a pause he added but he told me it was his leg   here the narrator bursts into explosion after explosion of thunderous horselaughter repeating that nub from time to time through his gaspings and shriekings and suffocatings  it takes only a minute and a half to tell that in its comicstory form and isnt worth the telling after all put into the humorousstory form it takes ten minutes and is about the funniest thing i have ever listened toas james whitcomb riley tells it  he tells it in the character of a dullwitted old farmer who has just heard it for the first time thinks it is unspeakably funny and is trying to repeat it to a neighbor but he cant remember it so he gets all mixed up and wanders helplessly round and round putting in tedious details that dont belong in the tale and only retard it taking them out conscientiously and putting in others that are just as useless making minor mistakes now and then and stopping to correct them and explain how he came to make them remembering things which he forgot to put in in their proper place and going back to put them in there stopping his narrative a good while in order to try to recall the name of the soldier that was hurt and finally remembering that the soldiers name was not mentioned and remarking placidly that the name is of no real importance anywaybetter of course if one knew it but not essential after alland so on and so on and so on  the teller is innocent and happy and pleased with himself and has to stop every little while to hold himself in and keep from laughing outright and does hold in but his body quakes in a jellylike way with interior chuckles and at the end of the ten minutes the audience have laughed until they are exhausted and the tears are running down their faces  the simplicity and innocence and sincerity and unconsciousness of the old farmer are perfectly simulated and the result is a performance which is thoroughly charming and delicious this is art and fine and beautiful and only a master can compass it but a machine could tell the other story  to string incongruities and absurdities together in a wandering and sometimes purposeless way and seem innocently unaware that they are absurdities is the basis of the american art if my position is correct another feature is the slurring of the point a third is the dropping of a studied remark apparently without knowing it as if one were thinking aloud the fourth and last is the pause  artemus ward dealt in numbers three and four a good deal he would begin to tell with great animation something which he seemed to think was wonderful then lose confidence and after an apparently absentminded pause add an incongruous remark in a soliloquizing way and that was the remark intended to explode the mineand it did  for instance he would say eagerly excitedly i once knew a man in new zealand who hadnt a tooth in his headhere his animation would die out a silent reflective pause would follow then he would say dreamily and as if to himself and yet that man could beat a drum better than any man i ever saw  the pause is an exceedingly important feature in any kind of story and a frequently recurring feature too it is a dainty thing and delicate and also uncertain and treacherous for it must be exactly the right lengthno more and no lessor it fails of its purpose and makes trouble if the pause is too short the impressive point is passed and and if too long the audience have had time to divine that a surprise is intendedand then you cant surprise them of course  on the platform i used to tell a negro ghost story that had a pause in front of the snapper on the end and that pause was the most important thing in the whole story if i got it the right length precisely i could spring the finishing ejaculation with effect enough to make some impressible girl deliver a startled little yelp and jump out of her seatand that was what i was after this story was called the golden arm and was told in this fashion you can practise with it yourselfand mind you look out for the pause and get it right     the golden arm  once pon a time dey wuz a monsus mean man en he live way out in de prairie all

right and you will find it the most troublesome and aggravating and uncertain thing you ever undertook        mental telegraphy again  i have three or four curious incidents to tell about they seem to come under the head of what i named mental telegraphy in a paper written seventeen years ago and published long afterwardsthe paper entitled mental telegraphy which originally appeared in harpers magazine for december 1893 is included in the volume entitled the american claimant and other stories and sketches  several years ago i made a campaign on the platform with mr george w cable in montreal we were honored with a reception it began at two in the afternoon in a long drawingroom in the windsor hotel mr cable and i stood at one end of this room and the ladies and gentlemen entered it at the other end crossed it at that end then came up the long lefthand side shook hands with us said a word or two and passed on in the usual way my sight is of the telescopic sort and i presently recognized a familiar face among the throng of strangers drifting in at the distant door and i said to myself with surprise and high gratification that is mrs r i had forgotten that she was a canadian she had been a great friend of mine in carson city nevada in the early days i had not seen her or heard of her for twenty years i had not been thinking about her there was nothing to suggest her to me nothing to bring her to my mind in fact to me she had long ago ceased to exist and had disappeared from my consciousness but i knew her instantly and i saw her so clearly that i was able to note some of the particulars of her dress and did note them and they remained in my mind i was impatient for her to come in the midst of the handshakings i snatched glimpses of her and noted her progress with the slowmoving file across the end of the room then i saw her start up the side and this gave me a full front view of her face i saw her last when she was within twentyfive feet of me for an hour i kept thinking she must still be in the room somewhere and would come at last but i was disappointed  when i arrived in the lecturehall that evening some one said come into the waitingroom theres a friend of yours there who wants to see you youll not be introducedyou are to do the recognizing without help if you can  i said to myself it is mrs r i shant have any trouble  there were perhaps ten ladies present all seated in the midst of them was mrs r as i had expected she was dressed exactly as she was when i had seen her in the afternoon i went forward and shook hands with her and called her by name and said  i knew you the moment you appeared at the reception this afternoon she looked surprised and said but i was not at the reception i have just arrived from quebec and have not been in town an hour  it was my turn to be surprised now i said i cant help it i give you my word of honor that it is as i say i saw you at the reception and you were dressed precisely as you are now when they told me a moment ago that i should find a friend in this room your image rose before me dress and all just as i had seen you at the reception  those are the facts she was not at the reception at all or anywhere near it but i saw her there nevertheless and most clearly and unmistakably to that i could make oath how is one to explain this i was not thinking of her at the time had not thought of her for years but she had been thinking of me no doubt did her thoughts flit through leagues of air to me and bring with it that clear and pleasant vision of herself i think so that was and remains my sole experience in the matter of apparitionsi mean apparitions that come when one is ostensibly awake i could have been asleep for a moment the apparition could have been the creature of a dream still that is nothing to the point the feature of interest is the happening of the thing just at that time instead of at an earlier or later time which is argument that its origin lay in thoughttransference  my next incident will be set aside by most persons as being merely a coincidence i suppose years ago i used to think sometimes of making a lecturing trip through the antipodes and the borders of the orient but always gave up the idea partly because of the great length of the journey and partly because my wife could not well manage to go with me towards the end of last january that idea after an interval of years came suddenly into my head againforcefully too and without any apparent reason whence came it what suggested it i will touch upon that presently  i was at that time where i am nowin paris i wrote at once to henry m stanley london and asked him some questions about his australian lecture tour and inquired who had conducted him and what were the terms after a day or two his answer came it began            the lecture agent for australia and new zealand is par           excellence mr  r s smythe of melbourne  he added his itinerary terms sea expenses and some other matters and advised me to write mr smythe which i didfebruary 3d i began my letter by saying in substance that while he did not know me personally we had a mutual friend in stanley and that would answer for an introduction then i proposed my trip and asked if he would give me the same terms which he had given stanley  i mailed my letter to mr smythe february 6th and three days later i got a letter from the selfsame smythe dated melbourne december 17th i would as soon have expected to get a letter from the late george washington the letter began somewhat as mine to him had begunwith a selfintroduction            dear mr clemensit is so long since archibald forbes and i           spent that pleasant afternoon in your comfortable house at           hartford that you have probably quite forgotten the occasion  in the course of his letter this occurs            i am willing to give you here he named the terms which he           had given stanley for an antipodean tour to last say three           months  here was the single essential detail of my letter answered three days after i had mailed my inquiry i might have saved myself the trouble and the postageand a few years ago i would have done that very thing for i would have argued that my sudden and strong impulse to write and ask some questions of a stranger on the under side of the globe meant that the impulse came from that stranger and that he would answer my questions of his own motion if i would let him alone  mr smythes letter probably passed under my nose on its way to lose three weeks traveling to america and back and gave me a whiff of its contents as it went along letters often act like that instead of the thought coming to you in an instant from australia the apparently unsentient letter imparts it to you as it glides invisibly past your elbow in the mailbag  next incident in the following monthmarchi was in america i spent a sunday at irvingtononthehudson with mr john brisben walker of the cosmopolitan magazine we came into new york next morning and went to the century club for luncheon he said some praiseful things about the character of the club and the orderly serenity and pleasantness of its quarters and asked if i had never tried to acquire membership in it i said i had not and that new york clubs were a continuous expense to the country members without being of frequent use or benefit to them  and now ive got an idea said i theres the lotosthe first new york club i was ever a member ofmy very earliest love in that line i have been a member of it for considerably more than twenty years yet have seldom had a chance to look in and see the boys they turn gray and grow old while i am not watching and my dues go on i am going to hartford this afternoon for a day or two but as soon as i get back i will go to john elderkin very privately and say remember the veteran and confer distinction upon him for the sake of old times make me an honorary member and abolish the tax if you havent any such thing as honorary membership all the bettercreate it for my honor and glory that would be a great thing i will go to john elderkin as soon as i get back from hartford  i took the last express that afternoon first telegraphing mr f g whitmore to come and see me next day when he came he asked did you get a letter from mr john elderkin secretary of the lotos club before you left new york  then it just missed you if i had known you were coming i would have kept it it is beautiful and will make you proud the board of directors by unanimous vote have made you a life member and squelched those dues and you are to be on hand and receive your distinction on the night of the 30th which is the twentyfifth anniversary of the founding of the club and it will not surprise me if they have some great times there  what put the honorary membership in my head that day in the century club for i had never thought of it before i dont know what brought the thought to me at that particular time instead of earlier but i am well satisfied that it originated with the board of directors and had been on its way to my brain through the air ever since the moment that saw their vote recorded  another incident i was in hartford two or three days as a guest of the rev joseph h twichell i have held the rank of honorary uncle to his children for a quarter of a century and i went out with him in the trolleycar to visit one of my nieces who is at miss porters famous school in farmington the distance is eight or nine miles on the way talking i illustrated something with an anecdote this is the anecdote  two years and a half ago i and the family arrived at milan on our way to rome and stopped at the continental after dinner i went below and took a seat in the stonepaved court where the customary lemontrees stand in the customary tubs and said to myself now this is comfort comfort and repose and nobody to disturb it i do not know anybody in milan  then a young gentleman stepped up and shook hands which damaged my theory he said in substance  you wont remember me mr clemens but i remember you very well i was a cadet at west point when you and rev joseph h twichell came there some years ago and talked to us on a hundredth night i am a lieutenant in the regular army now and my name is h i am in europe all alone for a modest little tour my regiment is in arizona  we became friendly and sociable and in the course of the talk he told me of an adventure which had befallen himabout to this effect  i was at bellagio stopping at the big hotel there and ten days ago i lost my letter of credit i did not know what in the world to do i was a stranger i knew no one in europe i hadnt a penny in my pocket i couldnt even send a telegram to london to get my lost letter replaced my hotel bill was a week old and the presentation of it imminentso imminent that it could happen at any moment now i was so frightened that my wits seemed to leave me i tramped and tramped back and forth like a crazy person if anybody approached me i hurried away for no matter what a person looked like i took him for the head waiter with the bill  i was at last in such a desperate state that i was ready to do any wild thing that promised even the shadow of help and so this is the insane thing that i did i saw a family lunching at a small table on the veranda and recognized their nationalityamericansfather mother and several young daughtersyoung tastefully dressed and prettythe rule with our people i went straight there in my civilian costume named my name said i was a lieutenant in the army and told my story and asked for help  what do you suppose the gentleman did but you would not guess in twenty years he took out a handful of gold coin and told me to help myselffreely that is what he did  the next morning the lieutenant told me his new letter of credit had arrived in the night so we strolled to cooks to draw money to pay back the benefactor with we got it and then went strolling through the great arcade presently he said yonder they are come and be introduced i was introduced to the parents and the young ladies then we separated and i never saw him or them any m  here we are at farmington said twichell interrupting  we left the trolleycar and tramped through the mud a hundred yards or so to the school talking about the time we and warner walked out there years ago and the pleasant time we had  we had a visit with my niece in the parlor then started for the trolley again outside the house we encountered a double rank of twenty or thirty of miss porters young ladies arriving from a walk and we stood aside ostensibly to let them have room to file past but really to look at them presently one of them stepped out of the rank and said  you dont know me mr twichell but i know your daughter and that gives me the privilege of shaking hands with you  then she put out her hand to me and said  and i wish to shake hands with you too mr clemens you dont remember me but you were introduced to me in the arcade in milan two years and a half ago by lieutenant h  what had put that story into my head after all that stretch of time was it just the proximity of that young girl or was it merely an odd accident        the invalids story  i seem sixty and married but these effects are due to my condition and sufferings for i am a bachelor and only fortyone it will be hard for you to believe that i who am now but a shadow was a hale hearty man two short years ago a man of iron a very athleteyet such is the simple truth but stranger still than this fact is the way in which i lost my health i lost it through helping to take care of a box of guns on a twohundredmile railway journey one winters night it is the actual truth and i will tell you about it  i belong in cleveland ohio one winters night two years ago i reached home just after dark in a driving snowstorm and the first thing i heard when i entered the house was that my dearest boyhood friend and schoolmate john b hackett had died the day before and that his last utterance had been a desire that i would take his remains home to his poor old father and mother in wisconsin i was greatly shocked and grieved but there was no time to waste in emotions i must start at once i took the card marked deacon levi hackett bethlehem wisconsin and hurried off through the whistling storm to the railway station arrived there i found the long whitepine box which had been described to me i fastened the card to it with some tacks saw it put safely aboard the express car and then ran into the eatingroom to provide myself with a sandwich and some cigars when i returned presently there was my coffinbox back again apparently and a young fellow examining around it with a card in his hands and some tacks and a hammer i was astonished and puzzled he began to nail on his card and i rushed out to the express car in a good deal of a state of mind to ask for an explanation but nothere was my box all right in the express car it hadnt been disturbed the fact is that without my suspecting it a prodigious mistake had been made i was carrying off a box of guns which that young fellow had come to the station to ship to a rifle company in peoria illinois and he had got my corpse just then the conductor sung out all aboard and i jumped into the express car and got a comfortable seat on a bale of buckets the expressman was there hard at worka plain man of fifty with a simple honest goodnatured face and a breezy practical heartiness in his general style as the train moved off a stranger skipped into the car and set a package of peculiarly mature and capable limburger cheese on one end of my coffinboxi mean my box of guns that is to say i know now that it was limburger cheese but at that time i never had heard of the article in my life and of course was wholly ignorant of its character well we sped through the wild night the bitter storm raged on a cheerless misery stole over me my heart went down down down the old expressman made a brisk remark or two about the tempest and the arctic weather slammed his sliding doors to and bolted them closed his window down tight and then went bustling around here and there and yonder setting things to rights and all the time contentedly humming sweet by and by in a low tone and flatting a good deal presently i began to detect a most evil and searching odor stealing about on the frozen air this depressed my spirits still more because of course i attributed it to my poor departed friend there was something infinitely saddening about his calling himself to my remembrance in this dumb pathetic way so it was hard to keep the tears back moreover it distressed me on account of the old expressman who i was afraid might notice it however he went humming tranquilly on and gave no sign and for this i was grateful grateful yes but still uneasy and soon i began to feel more and more uneasy every minute for every minute that went by that odor thickened up the more and got to be more and more gamey and hard to stand presently having got things arranged to his satisfaction the expressman got some wood and made up a tremendous fire in his stove  this distressed me more than i can tell for i could not but feel that it was a mistake i was sure that the effect would be deleterious upon my poor departed friend thompsonthe expressmans name was thompson as i found out in the course of the nightnow went poking around his car stopping up whatever stray cracks he could find remarking that it didnt make any difference what kind of a night it was outside he calculated to make us comfortable anyway i said nothing but i believed he was not choosing the right way meantime he was humming to himself just as before and meantime too the stove was getting hotter and hotter and the place closer and closer i felt myself growing pale and qualmish but grieved in silence and said nothing  soon i noticed that the sweet by and by was gradually fading out next it ceased altogether and there was an ominous stillness after a few moments thompson said  pfew i reckon it aint no cinnamon t ive loaded up thishyer stove with  he gasped once or twice then moved toward the cofgunbox stood over that limburger cheese part of a moment then came back and sat down near me looking a good deal impressed after a contemplative pause he said indicating the box with a gesture  friend of yourn  yes i said with a sigh  hes pretty ripe aint he  nothing further was said for perhaps a couple of minutes each being busy with his own thoughts then thompson said in a low awed voice  sometimes its uncertain whether theyre really gone or notseem gone you knowbody warm joints limberand so although you think theyre gone you dont really know ive had cases in my car its perfectly awful becuz you dont know what minute theyll rise up and look at you then after a pause and slightly lifting his elbow toward the boxbut he aint in no trance no sir i go bail for him  we sat some time in meditative silence listening to the wind and the roar of the train then thompson said with a good deal of feeling  wellawell weve all got to go they aint no getting around it man that is born of woman is of few days and far between as scriptur says yes you look at it any way you want to its awful solemn and curus they aint nobody can get around it alls got to gojust everybody as you may say one day youre hearty and stronghere he scrambled to his feet and broke a pane and stretched his nose out at it a moment or two then sat down again while i struggled up and thrust my nose out at the same place and this we kept on doing every now and thenand next day hes cut down like the grass and the places which knowed him then knows him no more forever as scriptur says yesndeedy its awful solemn and curus but weve all got to go one time or another they aint no getting around it  there was another long pause then  what did he die of  i said i didnt know  how long has he ben dead  it seemed judicious to enlarge the facts to fit the probabilities so i said  two or three days  but it did no good for thompson received it with an injured look which plainly said two or three years you mean then he went right along placidly ignoring my statement and gave his views at considerable length upon the unwisdom of putting off burials too long then he lounged off toward the box stood a moment then came back on a sharp trot and visited the broken pane observing  twould a ben a dum sight better all around if theyd started him along last summer  thompson sat down and buried his face in his red silk handkerchief and began to slowly sway and rock his body like one who is doing his best to endure the almost unendurable by this time the fragranceif you may call it fragrancewas just about suffocating as near as you can come at it thompsons face was turning gray i knew mine hadnt any color left in it by and by thompson rested his forehead in his left hand with his elbow on his knee and sort of waved his red handkerchief towards the box with his other hand and said  ive carried a many a one of emsome of em considerable overdue toobut lordy he just lays over em alland does it easy cap they was heliotrope to him  this recognition of my poor friend gratified me in spite of the sad circumstances because it had so much the sound of a compliment  pretty soon it was plain that something had got to be done i suggested cigars thompson thought it was a good idea he said  likely itll modify him some  we puffed gingerly along for a while and tried hard to imagine that things were improved but it wasnt any use before very long and without any consultation both cigars were quietly dropped from our nerveless fingers at the same moment thompson said with a sigh  no cap it dont modify him worth a cent fact is it makes him worse becuz it appears to stir up his ambition what do you reckon we better do now  i was not able to suggest anything indeed i had to be swallowing and swallowing all the time and did not like to trust myself to speak thompson fell to maundering in a desultory and lowspirited way about the miserable experiences of this night and he got to referring to my poor friend by various titlessometimes military ones sometimes civil ones and i noticed that as fast as my poor friends effectiveness grew thompson promoted him accordinglygave him a bigger title finally he said  ive got an idea suppos n we buckle down to it and give the colonel a bit of a shove towards tother end of the carabout ten foot say he wouldnt have so much influence then dont you reckon  i said it was a good scheme so we took in a good fresh breath at the broken pane calculating to hold it till we got through then we went there and bent over that deadly cheese and took a grip on the box thompson nodded all ready and then we threw ourselves forward with all our might but thompson slipped and slumped down with his nose on the cheese and his breath got loose he gagged and gasped and floundered up and made a break for the door pawing the air and saying hoarsely dont hender megimme the road im adying gimme the road out on the cold platform i sat down and held his head a while and he revived presently he said  do you reckon we started the genrul any  i said no we hadnt budged him  well then that ideas up the flume we got to think up something else hes suited wher he is i reckon and if thats the way he feels about it and has made up his mind that he dont wish to be disturbed you bet hes agoing to have his own way in the business yes better leave him right wher he is long as he wants it so becuz he holds all the trumps dont you know and so it stands to reason that the man that lays out to alter his plans for him is going to get left  but we couldnt stay out there in that mad storm we should have frozen to death so we went in again and shut the door and began to suffer once more and take turns at the break in the window by and by as we were starting away from a station where we had stopped a moment thompson pranced in cheerily and exclaimed  were all right now i reckon weve got the commodore this time i judge ive got the stuff here thatll take the tuck out of him  it was carbolic acid he had a carboy of it he sprinkled it all around everywhere in fact he drenched everything with it riflebox cheese and all then we sat down feeling pretty hopeful but it wasnt for long you see the two perfumes began to mix and thenwell pretty soon we made a break for the door and out there thompson swabbed his face with his bandanna and said in a kind of disheartened way  it aint no use we cant buck agin him he just utilizes everything we put up to modify him with and gives it his own flavor and plays it back on us why cap dont you know its as much as a hundred times worse in there now than it was when he first got agoing i never did see one of em warm up to his work so and take such a dumnation interest in it no sir i never did as long as ive ben on the road and ive carried a many a one of em as i was telling you  we went in again after we were frozen pretty stiff but my we couldnt stay in now so we just waltzed back and forth freezing and thawing and stifling by turns in about an hour we stopped at another station and as we left it thompson came in with a bag and said  cap im agoing to chance him once morejust this once and if we dont fetch him this time the thing for us to do is to just throw up the sponge and withdraw from the canvass thats the way i put it up he had brought a lot of chicken feathers and dried apples and leaf tobacco and rags and old shoes and sulphur and asafoetida and one thing or another and he piled them on a breadth of sheet iron in the middle of the floor and set fire to them  when they got well started i couldnt see myself how even the corpse could stand it all that went before was just simply poetry to that smellbut mind you the original smell stood up out of it just as sublime as everfact is these other smells just seemed to give it a better hold and my how rich it was i didnt make these reflections therethere wasnt timemade them on the platform and breaking for the platform thompson got suffocated and fell and before i got him dragged out which i did by the collar i was mighty near gone myself when we revived thompson

from the platform an hour later frozen and insensible at the next station and i went straight off into a virulent fever and never knew anything again for three weeks i found out then that i had spent that awful night with a harmless box of rifles and a lot of innocent cheese but the news was too late to save me imagination had done its work and my health was permanently shattered neither bermuda
