51222109	on picket duty and other tales  by l m alcott  boston new york  1864     on picket duty   what air you thinkin of phil  my wife dick  so was i aint it odd how fellers fall to thinkin of thar little women when they get a quiet spell like this  fortunate for us that we do get it and have such gentle bosom guests to keep us brave and honest through the trials and temptations of a life like ours  october moonlight shone clearly on the solitary tree draped with gray moss scarred by lightning and warped by wind looking like a venerable warrior whose long campaign was nearly done and underneath was posted the guard of four behind them twinkled many campfires on a distant plain before them wound a road ploughed by the passage of an army strewn with the relics of a rout on the right a sluggish river glided like a serpent stealthy sinuous and dark into a seemingly impervious jungle on the left a southern swamp filled the air with malarial damps swarms of noisome life and discordant sounds that robbed the hour of its repose the men were friends as well as comrades for though gathered from the four quarters of the union and dissimilar in education character and tastes the same spirit animated all the routine of camp life threw them much together and mutual esteem soon grew into a bond of mutual good fellowship  thorn was a massachusetts volunteer a man who seemed too early old too early embittered by some cross for though grim of countenance rough of speech cold of manner a keen observer would have soon discovered traces of a deeper warmer nature hidden behind the repellent front he turned upon the world a true new englander thoughtful acute reticent and opinionated yet earnest withal intensely patriotic and often humorous despite a touch of puritan austerity  phil the romantic chap as he was called looked his character to the life slender swarthy melancholy eyed and darkly bearded with feminine features mellow voice and alternately languid or vivacious manners a child of the south in nature as in aspect ardent impressible and proud fitfully aspiring and despairing without the native energy which moulds character and ennobles life months of discipline and devotion had done much for him and some deep experience was fast ripening the youth into a man  flint the longlimbed lumberman from the wilds of maine was a conscript who when government demanded his money or his life calculated the cost and decided that the cash would be a dead loss and the claim might be repeated whereas the conscript would get both pay and plunder out of government while taking excellent care that government got precious little out of him a shrewd slowspoken selfreliant specimen was flint yet something of the fresh flavor of the backwoods lingered in him still as if nature were loath to give him up and left the mark of her motherly hand upon him as she leaves it in a dry pale lichen on the bosom of the roughest stone  dick hailed from illinois and was a comely young fellow full of dash and daring rough and rowdy generous and jolly overflowing with spirits and ready for a free fight with all the world  silence followed the last words while the friendly moon climbed up the sky each mans eye followed it and each mans heart was busy with remembrances of other eyes and hearts that might be watching and wishing as theirs watched and wished in the silence each shaped for himself that vision of home that brightens so many campfires haunts so many dreamers under canvas roofs and keeps so many turbulent natures tender by memories which often are both solace and salvation  thorn paced to and fro his rifle on his shoulder vigilant and soldierly however soft his heart might be phil leaned against the tree one hand in the breast of his blue jacket on the painted presentment of the face his fancy was picturing in the golden circle of the moon flint lounged on the sward whistling softly as he whittled at a fallen bough dick was flat on his back heels in air cigar in mouth and some hilarious notion in his mind for suddenly he broke into a laugh  what is it lad asked thorn pausing in his tramp as if willing to be drawn from the disturbing thought that made his black brows lower and his mouth look grim  thinkin of my wife and wishin she was here bless her heart set me rememberin how i see her fust and so i roared as i always do when it comes into my head  how was it come reel off a yarn and lets hear houw yeou hitched teams said flint always glad to get information concerning his neighbors if it could be cheaply done  tellin how we found our wives wouldnt be a bad game would it phil  im agreeable but let us have your romance first  devilish little of that about me or any of my doins i hate sentimental bosh as much as you hate slang and should have been a bachelor to this day if i hadnt seen kitty jest as i did you see id been too busy larkin round to get time for marryin till a couple of years ago when i did up the job doublequick as id like to do this thunderin slow one hang it all  halt a minute till i give a look for this picket isnt going to be driven in or taken while im on guard  down his beat went thorn reconnoitring river road and swamp as thoroughly as one pair of keen eyes could do it and came back satisfied but still growling like a faithful mastiff on the watch performances which he repeated at intervals till his own turn came  i didnt have to go out of my own state for a wife youd better believe began dick with a boast as usual for we raise as fine a crop of girls thar as any state in or out of the union and dont mind raisin cain with any man who denies it i was out on a gunnin tramp with joe partridge a cousin of minepoor old chap he fired his last shot at gettysburg and died game in a way he didnt dream of the day we popped off the birds together it aint right to joke that way i wont if i can help it but a feller gets awfully kind of heathenish these times dont he  settle up them scores bymeby fightin christians scurse raound here fire away dick  well we got as hungry as hounds half a dozen mile from home and when a farmhouse hove in sight joe said hed ask for a bite and leave some of the plunder for pay i was visitin joe didnt know folks round and backed out of the beggin part of the job so he went ahead alone wed come up the woods behind the house and while joe was foragin i took are connoissance the view was fustrate for the main part of it was a girl airin beds on the roof of a stoop now jest about that time havin a leisure spell id begun to think of marryin and took a look at all the girls i met with an eye to business i spose every man has some sort of an idee or pattern of the wife he wants pretty and plucky good and gay was mine but id never found it till i see kitty and as she didnt see me i had the advantage and took an extra long stare  what was her good pints hey  oh well she had a wideawake pair of eyes a bright jolly sort of a face lots of curly hair tumblin out of her net a trig little figger and a pair of the neatest feet and ankles that ever stepped pretty thinks i so far so good the way she whacked the pillers shooked the blankets and pitched into the beds was a caution specially one blunderin old featherbed that wouldnt do nothin but sag round in a pigheaded sort of way that would have made most girls get mad and give up kitty didnt but just wrastled with it like a good one till she got it turned banged and spread to suit her then she plumped down in the middle of it with a sarcy little nod and chuckle to herself that tickled me mightily plucky thinks i better n better jest then an old woman came flyin out the backdoor callin kitty kitty squire partridges sons here long with a friend been gunnin want luncheon and im all in the suds do come down and see to em  where are they says kitty scrambling up her hair and settlin her gown in a jiffy as women have a knack of doin you know  mr joes in the front entry the other mans somewheres round billy says waitin till i send word whether they can stop i darsnt till id seen you for i cant do nothin im in such a mess says the old lady  so am i for i cant get in except by the entry window and hell see me says kitty gigglin at the thoughts of joe  come down the ladder theres a dear ill pull it round and keep it stiddy says her mother  oh ma dont ask me says kitty with a shiver im dreadfully scared of ladders since i broke my arm off this very one its so high it makes me dizzy jest to think of  well then ill do the best i can but i wish them boys was to jericho says the old lady with a groan for she was fat and hot had her gown pinned up and was in a fluster generally she was goin off rather huffy when kitty called out  stop ma ill come down and help you only ketch me if i tumble  she looked scared but stiddy and ill bet it took as much grit for her to do it as for one of us to face a battery it dont seem much to tell of but i wish i may be hit if it wasnt a right down dutiful and clever thing to see done when the old lady took her off at the bottom with a good motherly hug i found myself huggin my rifle like a fool but whether i thought it was the ladder or kitty i aint clear about good thinks i what more do you want  a snug little property wouldnt a ben bad i reckon well she had it old skinflint though i didnt know or care about it then what a jolly row shed make if she knew i was tellin the ladder part of the story she always does when i get to it and makes believe cry with her head in my breastpocket or any such handy place till i take it out and swear ill never do so agin poor little kit i wonder what shes doin now thinkin of me ill bet  dick paused pitched his cap lower over his eyes and smoked a minute with more energy than enjoyment for his cigar was out and he did not perceive it  thats not all is it asked thorn taking a fatherly interest in the younger mans love passages  not quite fore long joe whistled and as i always take short cuts everywhar i put in at the backdoor jest as kitty come trottin out of the pantry with a big berrypie in her hand i startled her she tripped over the sill and down she come the dish flew one way the pie flopped into her lap the juice spatterin my boots and her clean gown i thought shed cry scold have hysterics or some confounded thing or other but she jest sat still a minute then looked up at me with a great blue splosh on her face and went off into the goodnaturedest gale of laughin you ever heard in your life that finished me gay thinks i go in and win so i did made love hand over hand while i stayed with joe pupposed a fortnight after married her in three months and there she is a tiptop little woman with a pair of stunnin boys in her arms  out came a wellworn case and dick proudly displayed the likeness of a stout much bejewelled young woman with two staring infants on her knee in his sight the poor picture was a more perfect work of art than any of sir joshuas babybeauties or raphaels madonnas and the little story needed no better sequel than the young fathers praises of his twins the covert kiss he gave their mother when he turned as if to get a clearer light upon the face ashamed to show the tenderness that filled his honest heart he hummed kingdom coming while relighting his cigar and presently began to talk again  now then flint its your turn to keep guard and thorns to tell his romance come dont try to shirk it does a man good to talk of such things and were all mates here  in some cases it dont do any good to talk of such things better let em alone muttered thorn as he reluctantly sat down while flint as reluctantly departed  with a glance and gesture of real affection phil laid his hand upon his comrades knee saying in his persuasive voice old fellow it will do you good because i know you often long to speak of something that weighs upon you youve kept us steady many a time and done us no end of kindnesses why be too proud to let us give our sympathy in return if nothing more  thorns big hand closed over the slender one upon his knee and the mild expression so rarely seen upon his face passed over it as he replied  i think i could tell you almost anything if you asked me that way my boy it isnt that im too proudand youre right about my sometimes wanting to free my mindbut its because a man of forty dont just like to open out to young fellows if there is any danger of their laughing at him though he may deserve it i guess there isnt now and ill tell you how i found my wife  dick sat up and phil drew nearer for the earnestness that was in the man dignified his plain speech and inspired an interest in his history even before it was begun looking gravely at the river and never at his hearers as if still a little shy of confidants yet grateful for the relief of words thorn began abruptly  i never hear the number eightyfour without clapping my hand to my left breast and missing my badge you know i was on the police in new york before the war and thats about all you do know yet one bitter cold night i was going my rounds for the last time when as i turned a corner i saw there was a trifle of work to be done it was a bad part of the city full of dirt and deviltry one of the streets led to a ferry and at the corner an old woman had an applestall the poor soul had dropped asleep worn out with the cold and there were her goods left with no one to watch em somebody was watching em however a girl with a ragged shawl over her head stood at the mouth of an alley close by waiting for a chance to grab something id seen her there when i went by before and mistrusted she was up to some mischief as i turned the corner she put out her hand and cribbed an apple she saw me the minute she did it but neither dropped it nor ran only stood stocks still with the apple in her hand till came up  this wont do my girl said i i never could be harsh with em poor things she laid it back and looked up at me with a miserable sort of a smile that made me put my hand in my pocket to fish for a ninepence before she spoke  i know it wont she says i didnt want to do it its so mean but im awful hungry sir  better run home and get your supper then  ive got no home  where do you live  in the street  where do you sleep  anywhere last night in the lockup and i thought id get in there again if i did that when you saw me i like to go there its warm and safe  if i dont take you there what will you do  dont know i want to go over there and dance again as i used to but being sick has made me ugly so they wont have me and no one else will take me because i have been there once  i looked where she pointed and thanked the lord that they wouldnt take her it was one of those low theatres that do so much damage to the like of her there was a gambling den one side of it an eating saloon the other and at the door of it lounged a scamp i knew very well looking like a big spider watching for a fly i longed to fling my billy at him but as i couldnt i held on to the girl i was new to the thing then but though id heard about hunger and homelessness often enough id never had this sort of thing nor seen that look on a girls face a white pinched face hers was with frighted tiredlooking eyes but so innocent she wasnt more than sixteen had been pretty once i saw looked sick and starved now and seemed just the most helpless hopeless little thing that ever was  youd better come to the station for tonight and well see to you tomorrow says i  thank you sir says she looking as grateful as if id asked her home i suppose i did speaks kind of fatherly i aint ashamed to say i felt so seeing what a child she was nor to own that when she put her little hand in mine it hurt me to feel how thin and cold it was we passed the eatinghouse where the red lights made her face as rosy as it ought to have been there was meat and pies in the window and the poor thing stopped to look it was too much for her off came her shawl and she said in that coaxing way of hers  i wish youd let me stop at the place close by and sell this theyll give a little for it and ill get some supper ive had nothing since yesterday morning and maybe cold is easier to bear than hunger  have you nothing better than that to sell i says not quite sure that she wasnt all a humbug like so many of em she seemed to see that and looked up at me again with such innocent eyes i couldnt doubt her when she said shivering with something beside the cold  nothing but myself then the tears came and she laid her head down on my arm sobbingkeep me oh do keep me safe somewhere  thorn choked here steadied his voice with a resolute hem but could only add one sentence more  thats how i found my wife  come dont stop thar i told the whole o mine you do the same whar did you take her howd it all come round  please tell us thorn  the gentler request was answered presently very steadily very quietly  i was always a softhearted fellow though you wouldnt think it now and when that little girl asked me to keep her safe i just did it i took her to a good woman whom i knew for i hadnt any women belonging to me nor any place but that to put her in she stayed there till spring working for her keep growing brighter prettier every day and fonder of me i thought if i believed in witchcraft i shouldnt think myself such a cursed fool as i do now but i dont believe in it and to this day i cant understand how i came to do it to be sure i was a lonely man without kith or kin had never had a sweetheart in my life or been much with women since my mother died maybe thats why i was so bewitched with mary for she had little ways with her that took your fancy and made you love her whether you would or no i found her father was an honest fellow enough a fiddler in the some theatre that hed taken good care of mary till he died leaving precious little but advice for her to live on shed tried to get work failed spent all she had got sick and was going to the devil as the poor souls can hardly help doing with so many ready to give them a shove its no use trying to make a bad job better so the long and short of it was i thought she loved me god knows i loved her and i married her before the year was out  show us her picture i know youve got one all the fellows have though half of em wont own up  ive only got part of one i once saved my little girl and her picture once saved me  from an inner pocket thorn produced a womans housewife carefully untied it though all its implements were missing but a little thimble and from one of its compartments took a flattened bullet and the remnants of a picture  i gave her that the first christmas after i found her she wasnt as tidy about her clothes as i liked to see and i thought if i gave her a handy thing like this shed be willing to sew but she only made one shirt for me and then got tired so i keep it like an old fool as i am yes thats the bit of lead that would have done for me if marys likeness hadnt been just where it was  youll like to show her this when you go home wont you said dick as he took up the bullet while phil examined the marred picture and thorn poised the little thimble on his big finger with a sigh  how can i when i dont know where she is and camp is all the home ive got  the words broke from him like a sudden cry when some old wound is rudely touched both of the young men started both laid back the relics they had taken up and turned their eyes from thorns face across which swept a look of shame and sorrow too significant to be misunderstood their silence assured him of their sympathy and as if that touch of friendlessness unlocked his heavy heart he eased it by a full confession when he spoke again it was with the calmness of repressed emotion and calmness more touching to his mates than the most passionate outbreak the most pathetic lamentation for the coarse campphrases seemed to drop from his vocabulary more than once his softened voice grew tremulous and to the words my little girl there went a tenderness that proved how dear a place she still retained in that deep heart of his  boys ive gone so far i may as well finish and youll see im not without some cause for my stern looks and ways youll pity me and from you ill take the comfort of it its only the old storyi married her worked for her lived for her and kept my little girl like a lady i should have known that i was too old too sober for a young thing like that the life she led before the pinch came just suited her she liked to be admired to dress and dance and make herself pretty for all the world to see not to keep house for a quiet man like me idleness wasnt good for her it bred discontent then some of her old friends whod left her in her trouble found her out when better times came round and tried to get her back again i was away all day i didnt know how things were going and she wasnt open with me afraid she said i was so grave and hated theatres so she got courage finally to tell me that she wasnt happy that she wanted to dance again and asked me if she mightnt id rather have had her ask me to put her in a fire for i did hate theatres and was bred to others think theyre no harm i do and knew it was a bad life for a girl like mine it pampers vanity and vanity is the devils help with such so i said no kindly at first sharp and stern when she kept on teasing that roused her spirit i will go she said one day not while youre my wife i answered back and neither said any more but she gave me a look i didnt think she could and i resolved to take her away from temptation before worse came of it  i didnt tell her my plan but i resigned my place spent a week or more finding and fixing a little home for her out in the wholesome country where shed be safe from theatres and disreputable friends and maybe learn to love me better when she saw how much she was to me it was coming summer and i made things look as homelike and as pretty as i could she liked flowers and i fixed a garden for her she was fond of pets and i got her a bird a kitten and a dog to play with her she fancied gay colors and tasty little matters so i filled her rooms with all the handsome things i could afford and when it was done i was as pleased as any boy thinking what happy times wed have together and how pleased shed be boys when i went to tell her and to take her to her little home she was gone  who with  with those cursed friends of hers a party of them left the city just then she was wild to go she had money now and all her good looks back again they teased and tempted her i wasnt there to keep her and she went leaving a line behind to tell me that she loved the old life more than the new that my house was a prison and she hoped id let her go in peace that almost killed me but i managed to bear it for i knew most of the fault was mine but it was awful bitter to think i hadnt saved her after all  oh thorn what did you do  went straight after her found her dancing in philadelphia with paint on her cheeks trinkets on her neck and arms looking prettier than ever but the innocent eyes were gone and i couldnt see my little girl in the bold handsome woman twirling there before the footlights she saw me looked scared at first then smiled and danced on with her eyes upon me as if she said  see im happy now go away and let me be  i couldnt stand that and got out somehow people thought me mad or drunk i didnt care i only wanted to see her once in quiet and try to get her home i couldnt do it then nor afterwards by fair means and i wouldnt try force i wrote to her promised to forgive her begged her to come back or let me keep her honestly somewhere away from me but she never answered never came and i have never tried again  she wasnt worthy of you thorn you jest forgit her  i wish i could i wish i could in his voice quivered an almost passionate regret and a great sob heaved his chest as he turned his face away to hide the love and longing still so tender and so strong  dont say that dick such fidelity should make us charitable for its own sake there is always time for penitence always a certainty of pardon take heart thorn you may not wait in vain and she may yet return to you  i know she will ive dreamed of it ive prayed for it every battle i come out of safe makes me surer that i was kept for that and when ive borne enough to atone for my part of the fault ill be repaid for all my patience all my pain by finding her again she knows how well i love her still and if there comes a time when she is sick and poor and all alone again then shell remember her old john then shell come home and let me take her in  hope shone in thorns melancholy eyes and longsuffering allforgiving love beautified the rough brown face as he folded his arms and bent his gray head on his breast as if the wanderer were already come  the emotion which dick scorned to show on his own account was freely manifested for another as he sniffed audibly and boylike drew his sleeve across his eyes but phil with the delicate perception of a finer nature felt that the truest kindness he could show his friend was to distract his thoughts from himself to spare him any comments and lessen the embarrassment which would surely follow such unwonted confidence  now ill relieve flint and he will give you a laugh come on hiram and tell us about your beulah  the gentleman addressed had performed his duty by sitting on a fence and righting up his pockets to beguile the tedium of his exile before his multitudinous possessions could be restored to their native sphere thorn was himself again and on his feet  stay where you are phil i like to tramp it seems like old times and i know youre tired just forget all this ive been saying and go on as before thank you boys thank you and with a grasp of the two hands extended to him he strode away along the path already worn by his own restless feet  its done him good and im glad of that but id like to see the little baggage that bewitched the poor old boy wouldnt you phil  hush heres flint  whats up naow want me tew address the meetin hey im willin only the laughs ruther aginst me ef i tell that story expect yeull like it all the better fer that flint coiled up his long limbs put his hands in his pockets chewed meditatively for a moment and then

droll expressions of flints face and the satisfied twang of his last words were irresistable dick and phil went off into a shout of laughter and even thorns grave lips relapsed into a smile at the vision of six little flints with their six little moles as if the act were an established ceremony the paternal head produced his pocketbook selected a worn black and white paper which he spread in his broad palm and displayed with the air of a connoisseur  there thets bewlah we call it a cuttin but the proper names a sillyhoot i bleeve ive got a harnsome big degarrytype tew hum but the heft ont

as ef it was all painted up and done off to keell  the sillyhoot was examined with interest and carefully stowed away again in the old brown wallet which was settled in its place with a satisfied slap then flint said briskly  naouw phil yeou close this interestin and instructive meeting and be spry fer times most up  i havent much to tell but must begin with a confession which i have often longed but never dared to make before because i am a coward  sho whos goan to bleeve that o a man who fit like a wild cat wuz offered fer permotion on the field and wuz reported tew headquarters arfter his fust scrimmage try agin phil  physical courage is as plentiful as brass buttons nowadays but moral courage is a rarer virtue and im lacking in it as ill prove you think me a virginian im an alabamian by birth and was a reb three months ago  this confession startled his hearers as he knew it would for he had kept his secret well thorn laid his hand involuntarily upon his rifle dick drew off a little and flint illustrated one of his own expressions for he gawped phil laughed that musical laugh of his and looked up at them with his dark face waking into sudden life as he went on  theres no treason in the camp for im as fierce a federalist as any of you now and you may thank a woman for it when lee made his raid into pennsylvania i was a lieutenant in thewell never mind what regiment it hasnt signalized itself since and id rather not hit my old neighbors when they are down in one of the skirmishes during our retreat i got a wound and was left for dead a kind old quaker found and took me home but though i was too weak to talk i had my senses by that time and knew what went on about me everything was in confusion even in that wellordered place no surgeon could be got at first and a flock of frightened women theed and thoud one another over me but hadnt wit enough to see that i was bleeding to death among the faces that danced before my dizzy eyes was one that seemed familiar probably because no cap surrounded it i was glad to have it bending over me to hear a steady voice say give me a bandage quick and when none was instantly forthcoming to me the young lady stripped up a little white apron she wore and stanched the wound in my shoulder i was not as badly hurt as i supposed but so wornout and faint from loss of blood they believed me to be dying and so did i when the old man took off his hat and said  friend if thee has anything to say thee had better say it for thee probably has not long to live  i thought of my little sister far away in alabama fancied she came to me and muttered amy kiss me goodby the women sobbed at that but the girl bent her sweet compassionate face to mine and kissed me on the forehead that was my wife  so you seceded from secession right away to pay for that lipservice hey  no thorn not right awayto my shame be it spoken ill tell you how it came about margaret was not old bents daughter but a virginia girl on a visit and a long one it proved for she couldnt go till things were quieter while she waited she helped take care of me for the good souls petted me like a baby when they found that a rebel could be a gentleman i held my tongue and behaved my best to prove my gratitude you know of course i loved margaret very soon how could i help it she was the sweetest woman i had ever seen tender frank and spirited all i had ever dreamed of and longed for i did not speak of this nor hope for a return because i knew she was a hearty unionist and thought she only tended me from pity but suddenly she decided to go home and when i ventured to wish she would stay longer she would not listen and said i must not stay i should have gone before  the words were nothing but as she uttered them the color came up beautifully over all her face and her eyes filled as they looked away from mine then i knew that she loved me and my secret broke out half against my will margaret was forced to listen for i would not let her go but she seemed to harden herself against me growing colder stiller statelier as i went on and when i said in my desperate way  you should love me for we are bid to love our enemies she flashed an indignant look at me and said  i will not love what i cannot respect come to me a loyal man and see what answer i shall give you  then she went away it was the wisest thing she could have done for absence did more to change me than an ocean of tears a year of exhortations lying there i missed her every hour of the day recalled every gentle act kind word and fair example she had given me i contrasted my own belief with hers and found a new significance in the words honesty and honor and remembering her fidelity to principle was ashamed of my own treason to god and to herself education prejudice and interest are difficult things to overcome and that was the hottest fight i ever passed through for as i tell you i was a coward but love and loyalty won the day and asking no quarter the rebel surrendered  phil beaufort youre a brick cried dick with a sounding slap on his comrades shoulder  a brand snatched from the burnin hallelujah chanted flint seesawing with excitement  then you went to find your wife how where asked thorn forgetting vigilance in interest  friend bent hated war so heartily that he would have nothing to do with paroles exchanges or any martial process whatever but bade me go when and where i liked remembering to do by others as i had been done by before i was well enough to go however i managed by means of copperhead influence and returned prisoners to send a letter to my father and receive an answer you can imagine what both contained and so i found myself penniless but not poor an outcast but not alone old bent treated me like a prodigal son and put money in my purse his pretty daughters loved me for margarets sake and gave me a patriotic salute all round when i left them the humblest happiest man in pennsylvania margaret once said to me that this was the time for deeds not words that no man should stand idle but serve the good cause with head heart and hand no matter in what rank for in her eyes a private fighting for liberty was nobler than a dozen generals defending slavery i remembered that and not having influential friends to get me a commission enlisted in one of her own virginia regiments knowing that no act of mine would prove my sincerity like that you should have seen her face when i walked in upon her as she sat alone busied with the army work as id so often seen her sitting by my bed it showed me all she had been suffering in silence all i should have lost had i chosen darkness instead of light she hoped and feared so much she could not speak neither could i but dropped my cloak and showed her that through love of her i had become a soldier of the flag how i love the coarse blue uniform for when she saw it she came to me without a word and kept her promise in a month  thunder what a harnsome woman exclaimed flint as phil opening the golden case that held his talisman showed them the beautiful beloved face of which be spoke  yes and a right noble woman too i dont deserve her but i will we parted on our weddingday for orders to be off came suddenly and she would not let me go until i had given her my name to keep we were married in the morning and at noon i had to go other women wept as we marched through the town but my brave margaret kept her tears till we were gone smiling and waving her hand to methe hand that wore the weddingringtill i was out of sight that image of her is before me day and night and day and night her last words are ringing in my ears  i give you freely do your best better a true mans widow than a traitors wife  boys ive only stood on the right side for a month ive only fought one battle earned one honor but i believe these poor achievements are an earnest of the long atonement i desire to make for five and twenty years of blind transgression you say i fight well have i not cause to dare muchfor in owning many slaves i too became a slave in helping to make many freemen i liberate myself you wonder why i refused promotion have i any right to it yet are there not men who never sinned as i have done and beside whose sacrifices mine look pitifully small you tell me i have no ambition i have the highest for i desire to become gods noblest workan honest manliving to make margaret happy in a love that every hour grows worthier of her owndying to make death proud to take me  phil had risen while he spoke as if the enthusiasm of his mood lifted him into the truer manhood he aspired to attain straight and strong he stood up in the moonlight his voice deepened by unwonted energy his eye clear and steadfast his whole face ennobled by the regenerating power of this late loyalty to country wife and self and bright against the dark blue of his jacket shone the pictured face the only medal he was proud to wear  ah brave brief moment cancelling years of wrong ah fair and fatal decoration serving as a mark for a hidden foe the sharp crack of a rifle broke the stillness of the night and with those hopeful words upon his lips the young man sealed his purpose with his life     the king of clubs and the queen of hearts  a story for young america   five and twenty ladies all in a row sat on one side of the hall looking very much as if they felt like the little old woman who fell asleep on the kings highway and awoke with abbreviated drapery for they were all arrayed in gray tunics and turkish continuations profusely adorned with manycolored trimmings five and twenty gentleman all in a row sat on the opposite side of the hall looking somewhat subdued as men are apt to do when they fancy they are in danger of making fools of themselves they also were en costume for all the dark ones had grown piratical in red shirts the light ones nautical in blue and a few boldly appeared in white making up in starch and studs what they lost in color while all were more or less byronic as to collar  on the platform appeared a pile of dumbbells a regiment of clubs and a pyramid of beanbags and stirring nervously among them a foreignlooking gentleman the new leader of a class lately formed by dr thor turner whose mission it was to strengthen the worlds spine and convert it to a belief in air and exercise by setting it to balancing its poles and spinning merrily while enjoying the suncure on a large scale his advent formed an epoch in the history of the town for it was a quiet old village guiltless of bustle fashion or parade where each man stood for what he was and being a sagacious set every ones true value was pretty accurately known it was a neighborly town with gossip enough to stir the social atmosphere with small gusts of interest or wonder yet do no harm a sensible freeandeasy town for the wisest man in it wore the worst boots and no one thought the less of his understanding the belle of the village went shopping with a big sunbonnet and tin pail and no one found her beauty lessened oddities of all sorts ambled peacefully about on their various hobbies and no one suggested the expediency of a trip on the wooden horse upon which the chivalrous south is always eager to mount an irrepressible abolitionist restless people were soothed by the lullaby the river sang in its slow journey to the sea old people found here a pleasant place to make ready to die in young people to survey the world from before taking their first flight and strangers looked back upon it as a quiet nook full of ancient legends and modern lights which would keep its memory green when many a gayer spot was quite forgotten anything based upon common sense found favor with the inhabitants and dr turners theories being eminently so were accepted at once and energetically carried out a sort of heathen revival took place for even the ministers and deacons turned musclemen old ladies tossed beanbags till their caps were awry and winter roses blossomed on their cheeks schoolchildren proved the worth of the old proverb an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure by getting their backs ready before the burdens came pale girls grew blithe and strong swinging their dumb namesakes and jolly lads marched to and fro embracing clubs as if longevity were corked up in those wooden bottles and they all took modest quenchers by the way  august bopp the new leader of the class was a german possessing but a small stock of english though a fine gynmast and being also a bashful man the appointed moment had no sooner arrived than he found his carefully prepared sentences slipping away from his memory as the ice appears to do from under unhappy souls first mounted upon skates an awful silence reigned mr bopp glanced nervously over his shoulder at the staring rows more appalling in their stillness than if they had risen up and hooted at him then piling up the bags for the seventh time he gave himself a mental shake and with a crimson visage was about to launch his first ladees und gentlemen when the door opened and a small merryfaced figure appeared looking quite at ease in the novel dress as with a comprehensive nod it marched straight across the hall to its place among the weaker vessels  a general glance of approbation followed from the gentlemens side a welcoming murmur ran along the ladies and the fifty pairs of eyes changed their focus for a moment taking advantage of which mr bopp righted himself and burst out with a decided  ladees und gentlemen the time have arrived that we shall begin will the gentlemen serve the ladees to a wand each one then spread theirselves about the hall and follow the motions i will make as i shall count  five minutes of chaos then all fell into order and nothing was heard but the leaders voice and the stir of many bodies moving simultaneously an uninitiated observer would have thought himself in bedlam for as the evening wore on the laws of society seemed given to the winds and humanity gone mad bags flew in all directions clubs hurtled through the air and dumbbells played a castinet accompaniment to peals of laughter that made better music than any band old and young gave themselves up to the universal merriment and setting dignity aside played like happyhearted children for an hour stout dr quackenboss gasped twice round the hall on one toe stately mrs primmins ran like a girl of fifteen to get her pins home before her competitor tommy inches four feet three trotted away with deacon stone on his shoulder while mr steepleton and miss maypole hopped together like a pair of lively young ostriches and ned amandine the village beau blew arrows through a popgun like a modern cupid in pegtops instead of pinions  the sprightly young lady whose entrance had been so opportune seemed a universal favorite and was overwhelmed with invitations to bag hop and blow from the gentlemen who hovered about her cheerfully distorting themselves to the verge of dislocation in order to win a glance of approbation from the merry black eyes which were the tapers where all these muscular moths singed their wings mr bopp had never seen such a little piece of earnestness before and began to think the young lady must be training for a boatrace or the ring her dumbbells flew about till a pair of white arms looked like the sails of a windmill she hit out from the shoulder with a vigor that would have done execution had there been anything but empty air to punish and the one two three of the zouave movement went off with a snap while the color deepened from pink to scarlet in her cheeks the black braids tumbled down upon her shoulders and the clasp of her belt flew asunder but her eye seldom left the leaders face and she followed every motion with an agility and precision quite inspiring mr bopps courage rose as he watched her and a burning desire to excel took possession of him till he felt as if his muscles were made of indiarubber and his nerves of iron he went into his work heart and soul shaking a brown mane out of his eyes issuing commands like general at the head of his troops and keeping both interest and fun in full blast till people laughed who had not laughed heartily for years lungs got their fill for once unsuspected muscles were suddenly developed and when the clock struck ten all were bubbling over with that innocent jollity which makes youth worth possessing and its memory the sunshine of old age  the last exercise was drawing to a close and a large ring of respectable members of society were violently sitting down and rising up in a manner which would have scandalized miss wilhelmina carolina amelia s keggs to the last degree when mr bopp was seen to grow very pale and drop in a manner which it was evident his pupils were not expected to follow  at this unexpected performance the gentlemen took advantage of their newlyacquired agility to fly over all obstacles and swarm on to the platform while the ladies successfully lessened their unusual bloom by staring wildly at one another and suggesting awful impossibilities the bustle subsided as suddenly as it arose and mr bopp rather damp about the head and dizzy about the eye but quite composed appeared saying with the broken english and appealing manner which caused all the ladies to pronounce him a dear on the spot  i hope you will excoose me for making this lesson to be more short than it should but i have exercise nine hours this day and being just got well from a illness i have not recover the strength i have lost next week i shall be able to take time by the hair so that i will not have so much engagements in one day i thank you for your kindness and say goodefening  after a round of applause as a last vent for their spirits the class dispersed and mr bopp was wrestling with a vicious pin as he put on his collar a sure sign he has no ma to see to his buttons poor lamb thought mrs fairbairn watching him from afar when the sprightly young lady accompanied by a lad the masculine image of herself appeared upon the platform saying with an aspect as cordial as her words  goodevening professor allow me to introduce my brother and myself dick and dolly ward and ask you in my mothers name to come home with us for the tavern is not a cosy place and after all this exertion you should be made comfortable please come for dr turner always stayed with us and we promised to do the honors of the town to any gentleman he might send to supply his place  of course we did and mother is probably freezing her blessed nose off watching for us so dont disappoint her bopp its all settled the sleighs at the door and heres your coat so come on  dick was a fine sample of young america in its best aspect and would have said how are you to louis napoleon if he had been at hand and have done it so heartily that the great frenchman would have found it hard to resist giving as frank an answer therefore no wonder that mr bopp surrendered at once for the young gentleman took possession of him bodily and shook him into his coat with an amiable impetuosity which developed a sudden rent in the wellworn sleeve thereof and caused an expression of dismay to dawn upon the owners countenance  beg pardon never mind motherll sew you up in two seconds and your overcoat will hide the damage where is it ill get it and then well be off  mr bopp colored distressfully looked up looked down and then straight into the lads face saying simply  thank you i haf no coat but one  dick opened his eyes and was about opening his mouth also for the exit of some blunderingly goodnatured reply when a warning poke from his sister restrained him while dolly with the innocent hypocrisy which is as natural to some women as the art of tying bows said as she led the way out  you see the worth of gymnastics dick in this delightful indifference to cold i sincerely hope we may reach a like enviable state of health and look upon greatcoats as effeminate and mufflers a weakness of the flesh do you think we shall mr bopp  he shook his head with a perceptible shiver as the keen north wind smote him in the face but answered with a look half merry half sad  it is not choice but what you call necessitee with me and i truly hope you may never haf to exercise to keep life in you when you haf sold your coat to pay a doctors bill or teach the art of laughing while your heart is heavy as one stone you would not like that i think yet it is good too for small things make much happiness for me and a kind word is often better than a rix dollar  there was something in the young mans tone and manner which touched and won his hearers at once dolly secretly resolved to put an extra blanket on his bed and shower kind words upon him while dick tucked him up in buffalo robes where he sat helplessly beaming down upon the red hood at his side  a roaring fire shone out hospitably as they came and glorified the pleasant room dancing on ancient furniture and pictured walls till the jolly old portraits seemed to wink a visible welcome a cheeryfaced little woman like an elder dolly in a widows cap stood on the threshold with a friendly greeting for the stranger which warmed him as no fine could have done  if august bopp had been an englishman he would have felt much but said less on that account if he had been an american he would have tried to conceal his poverty and impress the family with his past grandeur present importance or future prospects being a german he showed exactly what he was with the childlike frankness of his race having had no dinner he ate heartily of what was offered him being cold he basked in the generous warmth being homesick and solitary he enjoyed the genial influences that surrounded him and told his story sure of sympathy for even in prosaic yankeedom he had found it as travellers find alpine flowers among the snow  it was a simple story of a laborious boyhood being early left an orphan with a little sister dependent on him till an opening in america tempted him to leave her and come to try and earn a home for her and for himself sickness misfortune and disappointment had been his companions for a year but he still worked still hoped and waited for the happy hour when little ulla should come to him across the sea this was all yet as he told it with the magical accompaniments of gesture look and tone it seemed full of pathos and romance to his listeners whose faces proved their interest more flatteringly than their words  mrs ward mended the torn coat with motherly zeal and gave it many of those timely stitches which thrifty women love to sew the twins devoted themselves to their guest each in a characteristic manner dick as host offered every article of refreshment the house afforded goaded the fire to a perpetual roar and discussed gymnastics with bursts of boyish admiration for the grace and skill of his new leader whom he christened king of clubs on the spot dolly made the stranger one of them at once by talking bad german as an offset to his bad english called him professor in spite of all denials and unconsciously symbolized his future bondage by giving him a tangled skein to hold for the furtherance of her mothers somewhat lengthened job  the cupid of the present day was undoubtedly raised in connecticut for the ingenuity and shrewdness of that small personage could have sprung from no other soil in former times his stratagems were of the romantic order colin bleated forth his passion in rhyme and cast sheeps eyes from among his flock while phyllis coquetted with her crook and stuck posies in his hat royal ferdinand and miranda played at chess ivanhoe upset his fellowmen like ninepins for love of lackadaisical rowena and sweet moll turned the pages while her lover milton sang but in our day the jolly little god though still a heathen in the severe simplicity of his attire has become modernized in his arts and invented huskings applebees sleighrides dropins gymnastics and among his finer snares the putting on of skates drawing of patterns and holding skeinsthe lastnamed having superior advantages over the others as all will testify who have enjoyed one of those handtohand skirmishes  august bopp was three and twenty imaginative grateful and heartwhole therefore when he found himself sitting opposite a blooming little damsel with a head bound by a pretty red snood bent down before him and very close to his own a pair of distracting hands every finger of which had a hit to make and made it it is not to be denied that he felt himself entering upon a new and very agreeable experience where could he look but in the face opposite sometimes so girlishly merry and sometimes so beautifully shy it was a winning face full of smooth curves fresh colors and sunshiny twinklesa face every one liked for it was as changeful as an april day and always pleasant whether mischievous mournful or demure  like one watching a new picture mr bopp inspected every feature of the countenance so near his own and as his admiration grew by what it fed on he fell into a chronic state of stammer and blush for the frank eyes were very kind the smooth cheeks reflected a pretty shade of his own crimson and the smiling lips seemed constantly suggesting with mute eloquence that they were made for kissing while the expressive hands picked at the knots till the professor felt like a very resigned fly in the web of a most enticing young spider  if the king of clubs saw a comely face the queen of hearts saw what observing girls call a good face and with a womanly respect for strength the manliest attribute of man she admired the broad shoulders and six feet one of her new master this face was not handsome for true to his fatherland the professor had an eminent nose a blonde beard and a crop of bonny brown hair long enough to have been gathered into a ribbon as in the days of schiller and jean paul but dolly liked it for its strength was tempered with gentleness patience and courage gave it dignity and the glance that met her own was both keen and kind  the silk was wound at last the coat repaired dick with difficulty concealed the growing stiffness of his shoulders while dolly turned up the lamp which bluntly hinted bedtime and mrs ward successfully devoured six gapes behind her hand but was detected in the seventh by mr bopp who glanced at the clock stopped in the middle of a sentence and with a hurried gootnight made for the door without the least idea whither he was going piloted by dick he was installed in the best chamber where his waking dreams were enlivened by a great fire and his sleeping ones by an endless succession of skeins each rapturously concluded in the style of sam weller when folding carpets with the pretty maid  i tell you dolly it wont do and im not going to have it  oh indeed and how will you help it you absurd boy  why if you dont stop it ill just say to bopplook here my dear fellow this sister of mine is a capital girl but she will flirt and  and its a family failing dick cut in dolly  not a bit of it i shall say take care of your heart bopp for she has a bad habit of playing battledoor and shuttlecock with these articles and though it may be very good fun for a time it makes them ache when they get a last knock and are left to lie in a corner  what eloquence but youd never dare to try it on mr bopp and i shouldnt like to predict what would happen to you if you did  if you say dare ill do it the first minute i see him as for consequences i dont care that for em and dick snapped his fingers with an aspect of much disdain but something in his sisters face suggested the wisdom of moderation and moved him to say less like a lord of creation and more like a brother who privately adored his sister but of course was not going to acknowledge such a weakness  well but soberly now i wish you wouldnt plague bopp for its evident to me that he is hit and from the way youve gone on these two months what else was to be expected now as the head of the familyyou neednt laugh for i ami think i ought to interfere and so i put it to youdo you like him and will you have him or are you merely amusing yourself as you have done ever since you were out of pinafores if you like him all serene id rather have him for a brother than any one i know for hes a regular trump though he is poor but if you dont i wont have the dear old fellow floored just because you like to see it done  it may here be remarked that dolly quite glowed to hear her brother praise mr bopp and that she indorsed every word with mental additions of double warmth but dick had begun all wrong and manlike demanded her confidence before she had made up her mind to own she had any to bestow therefore nothing came of it but vexation of spirit for it is a wellknown fact that on some subjects if boys will tease girls will fib and both maintain that it is right so dolly whetted her feminine weapon and assumed a lofty superiority  dear me what a sudden spasm of virtue and why if it is such a sin has not the head of the house taken his sister to task before instead of indulging in a like degeneracy and causing several interesting persons to tear their hair and bewail his forgetfulness when they ought to have blessed their stars he was out of the way  dick snowballed a dozing crow and looked nettled for he had attained that age when tom brown at oxford was the book of books the twelfth chapter being the favorite and five young ladies having already been endowed with the significant heliotrope flower all of which facts dolly had skilfully brought to mind as a returnshot for his somewhat personal remarks  bah they were only girls and it dont amount to anything among us young folks but bopp is a grown man and you ought to respect him too much to play such pranks with him besides hes a german and more tenderhearted than we rough yankees as any one can see by the way he acts when you snub him he is proud too for all his meekness and waits till hes sure you like him before he says anything and hell need the patience of a family of jobs at the rate youre going ona honeypot one day and a picklejar the next do make up your mind and say yes or no right off dolly  would you have me meet him at the door with a meek courtesy and say oh if you please im ready to say yes thank you if youll be good enough to say will you  dont be a goose child you know i mean nothing of the kind only you girls never will do anything straight ahead if you can dodge and fuss and make a mess of it just tell me one thing do you or dont you like old bopp  what an elegant way to put it of course i like him well enough as a leader he is clever and sort of cunning and i enjoy his funny ways but what in the world should i do with a great yellowhaired laddie who could put me in his pocket and yet is so meek that i should never find the heart to henpeck him you are welcome to him and since you love him so much theres no need of my troubling myself on his account for with you for a friend be can have no earthly wish ungratified  dont try to be cutting dolly because you look homely when you do and its a womans business to be pretty always all ive got to say is you will be in a nice state of mind if you damage bopp for every one likes him and will be down upon you for a heartless little wretch and i shant blame them i promise you  i wish the town wouldnt put its fingers in other peoples pies and you may tell it so with my compliments and all i have to say is that you men have more liberty than you know what to do with and we women havent enough so its perfectly fair that we should show you the worth of the thing by taking it away now and then i shall do exactly as i please dance walk ride and flirt whenever and with whomever i see fit and the whole town with mr dick ward at their head cant stop me if i choose to go on now then what next after which declaration of independence dolly folded her arms wheeled about and faced her brother a spirited statuette of self will in a red hood and mittens  dick sternly asked  is that your firm decision maam  yes  and you will not give up your nonsense  no  you are quite sure you dont care for bopp  i could slap him with all my heart  very good i shall see that you dont get a chance  i wouldnt try a skirmish for youll get beaten dick  well prove that maam  we will sir  and the belligerents loftily paced up the lawn with their purpose so well expressed by outward signs that mrs ward knew by the cock of dicks hat and the decided tap of dollys heels that a storm was brewing before they entered the door  this fraternal conversation took place some two months from the evening of mr bopps advent as the twins were strolling home from school which school must be briefly alluded to in order to explain the foregoing remarks it was an excellent institution in all respects for its presiding genius stood high in the townfolks esteem and might have served as an example to dr watts busy bee in the zeal with which he improved his shining hours and laid up honey against the winter which many hoped would be long in coming all manner of aids were provided for sprouting souls and bodies diversions innumerable and society some members of which might have polished off alcibiades a la socrates or entertained plato with æsthetic tea but sad to relate in spite of all these blessings the students who resorted to this academy possessed an adamandevelike proclivity for exactly what they hadnt got and didnt need and not contented with the pleasures provided must needs play truant with that young scamp eros and turn the ancient town topsyturvy with modern innovations till scandalized spinsters predicted that the very babies would catch the fever refuse their panada in jealous gloom send billetdoux in their rattles elope in wickercarriages and set up housekeeping in dolls houses after the latest fashion  certain inflammable southerners introduced the new game and left such romantic legends of their loves behind them that their successors were fired with an ambition to do the like and excel in all things from cricket to captivation  this state of things is not to be wondered at for america being renowned as a fast nation has become a sort of hotbed and seems to force humanity into early bloom therefore past generations must not groan over the sprightly present but sit in the chimneycorner and see boys and girls play the game which is too apt to end in a checkmate for one of the players to many of the lookerson the new order of things was as good as a puppetshow for with the enthusiasm of youth the actors performed their parts heartily forgetting the audience in their own earnestness bless us what revolutions went on under the round jackets and what lovetokens lay in the pockets thereof what plots and counterplots occupied the heads that wore the innocentlooking snoods and what captives were taken in the manycolored nets that would come off and have to be taken care of what romances blossomed like dandelions along the road to school and what tales the river might have told if any one could have learned its musical speech how certain gates were glorified by daily lingerings thereat and what tender memories hung about dingy desks old pens and books illustrated with all manner of symbolical designs  let those laugh who will older and wiser men and women might have taken lessons of these budding heroes and heroines for here all was honest sincere and fresh the old world had not taught them falsehood selfinterest or mean ambitions when they lost or won they frankly grieved or rejoiced and wore no masks except in play and then got them off as soon as possible if blueeyed lizzie frowned or went home with joe ned with a wisdom older lovers would do well to imitate went in for another game of football gave the rejected apple to little sally and whistled glory hallelujah instead of annie laurie which was better than blowing a rivals brains out or glowering at womankind forever after or when tom put on claras skates three successive days and danced with her three successive evenings leaving kitty to freeze her feet in the one instance and fold her hands in the other she just had a good cry gave her mother an extra kiss and waited till the recreant tom returned to his allegiance finding his little friend a sweetheart in nature as in name  dick and dolly were foremost in the ranks and expert in all the new amusements dick worshipped at many shrines but most faithfully at that of a meek divinity who returned charming answers to the ardent epistles which he left in her fathers garden wall where pyramus and thisbelike they often chatted through a chink and dolly was seldom seen without a staff of aids who would have fought bled and died for her as cheerfully as the little corporals old guard though she paid them only in words for her waterloo had not yet come  with the charming perversity of her sex in such matters no sooner had dolly declared that she didnt like mr bopp than she began to discover that she did and so far from desiring to slap him a tendency to regard him with peculiar goodwill and tenderness developed itself much to her own surprise for with all her coquetry and seeming coldness dolly had a right womanly heart of her own though she had never acknowledged the fact till august bopp looked at her with so much love and longing in his honest eyes then she found a little fear mingling with her regard felt a strong desire to be respected by him discovered a certain something which she called conscience restraining a reckless use of her power and soon after her lofty denial to dick was forced to own that mr bopp had become her master in the finer species of gymnastics that came in with adam and eve and have kept all creation turning somersets ever since of course these discoveries were unconfessed even to that best bosom friend which any of us can have yet her mother suspected them and with much anxiety saw all yet held her peace knowing that her little daughter would sooner or later give her a fuller confidence than could be demanded and remembering the happiest moments of her own happy past when an older dick wooed another dolly she left that flower which never can be forced to open at its own sweet will  meanwhile mr bopp though carrying his heart upon his sleeve believed his secret buried in the deepest gloom and enjoyed all the delightful miseries lovers insist upon making for themselves when dolly was quiet and absent he became pensive the lesson dragged and people fancied they were getting tired of the humbug when dolly was blithe and bland he grew radiant exercised within an inch of his life as a vent for his emotions and people went home declaring gymnastics to be the crowning triumph of the age and when dolly was capricious mr bopp became a bewildered weathercock changing as the wind changed and dire was the confusion occasioned thereby  like the sage fowl in the story dick said nothing but kept up a terrible thinking and not having had experience enough to know that when a woman says no she is very apt to mean yes he took dolly at her word believing it to be his duty to warn old bopp he resolved to do it like a roman brother regardless of his own feelings or his sisters wrath quite unconscious that the motive power in the affair was a boyish love of ruling the young person who ruled every one else  matters stood thus when the town was electrified by a general invitation to the annual jubilee at jollyboys hall which this spring flowered into a masquerade and filled the souls of old and young with visions of splendor frolic and fun being an amiable old town it gave itself up like a kind grandma to the wishes of its children let them put its knitting away disturb its naps keep its hands busy with vanities of the flesh and its mind in a state of chaos for three mortal weeks young ladies were obscured by tarletan fogs behind which they concocted angels wings newspaper gowns minnehahas wampum and cinderellas slippers inspired but incapable boys undertook designs that would have daunted a costumer of the first water fell into sloughs of despond and emerging settled down from peers and paladins into jovial tars friar waterproofs and officers in miscellaneous uniforms fathers laughed or grumbled at the whole thing and advanced pecuniary loans with good or ill grace as the case might be but the mothers whose interest in their childrens pleasure is a sort of evergreen that no snows of time can kill sewed spangles by the bushel made wildernesses of tissuepaper blossom as the rose kept tempers sweet stomachs full and domestic machinery working smoothly through it all by that maternal magic which makes them the human providences of this naughty world  what shall i go as was the universal cry garrets were taken by storm cherished relics were teased out of old ladies lavendered chests happy she who saw them again hats were made into boots gowns into doublets cloaks into hose sunday bonnets despoiled of their plumage silken cauliflowers sown broadcast over the land and cockedup caps erected in every style of architecture while tag rag and bobtail drove a smashing business and everybody knew what everybody else was going to be and solemnly vowed they didntwhich transparent falsehood was the best joke of the whole  dolly allowed her mates to believe she was to be the queen of hearts but privately laid hold of certain brocades worn by a trim grandmother half a century ago and one evening burst upon her brother in a charming little bopeep costume which for the benefit of future distressed damsels may be described as a white silk skirt scarlet overdress neatly bundled up behind as ancient ladies expressed it blue hose with red clocks highheeled shoes with silver buckles a nosegay in the tucker and a flyway hat perched in this case on the top of black curls which gave additional archness to dollys face as she entered singing that famous ditty  dick surveyed her with approval turning her about like a lay figure and expressing his fraternal opinion that she was the sauciest little turnout he ever saw and then wetblanketed the remarks by adding of course you dont call it a disguise do you and dont flatter yourself that you wont be known for dolly ward is as plainly written in every curl bow and gimcrack as if you wore a label on your back  then i shant wear it and off went the hat at one fell blow as dolly threw her crook in one corner her posy in another and sat down an image of despair  now dont be a goose and rip everything to bits just wear a domino over all as fan is going to and then when youve had fun enough take it off and do the pretty it will make two rigs you see and bother the boys to your hearts content  dick i insist upon kissing you for that brilliant suggestion and then you may run and get me eight yards of cambric just the color of fans but if you tell any one ill keep her from dancing with you the whole evening with which bribe and threat dolly embraced her brother and shut the door in his face while he putting himself in good humor by imagining she was somebody else departed on his muddy mission  if the ghosts of the first settlers had taken their walks abroad on the eventful friday night they would have held up their shadowy hands at the scenes going on under their venerable noses for strange figures flitted through the quiet streets and instead of decorous slumber there was decidedlya sound of revelry by night  spurs clanked and swords rattled over the frosty ground as if the british were about to make another flying call hooded monks and nuns paced along on carnal thoughts intent ancient ladies and bewigged gentlemen seemed hurrying to enjoy a social cup of tea and groan over the tax barrels staggered and stuck through narrow ways as if temperance were still among the lost arts while bears apes imps and elves pattered or sparkled by as if a second walpurgis night had come and all were bound for blocksberg  hooray for the rooster shouted young ireland encamped on the sidewalk to see the show as mephistopheles red cocks feather skimmed up the stairs and he left a pink domino at the ladies dressingroom door with the brief warning now cut your own capers and leave me to mine adding as he paused a moment at the great door  by jove isnt it a jolly sight though  and so it was for a mammoth boot stood sentinel at the entrance a bedouin arab leaned on his spear in one corner looking as if ready to say  fly to the desert fly with me  to the pretty jewess on his arm a stately hamlet with irreproachable legs settled his plumage in another still undecided to which ophelia he would first address the honey of his music vows  bluff king hals representative was waltzing in a way that would have filled that stout potentate with respectful admiration while queen katherine flirted with a fire zouave alcipades whisked mother goose about the room till the old ladys conical hat tottered on her head and the union held fast to a very little mac flocks of friars black white and gray pervaded the hall with flocks of ballet girls intended to represent peasants but failing for lack of drapery morning and evening stars rose or set as partners willed lively red demons harassed meek nuns and knights of the leopard the lion or griffin flashed by looking heroically uncomfortable in their gilded cages court ladies promenaded with jack tars and dukes danced with dairymaids while brother jonathan whittled aunt dinah jabbered ingomar flourished his club and every one felt warmly enthusiastic and vigorously jolly  ach himmel das ist wunder schon murmured a tall gray monk looking in and quite unconscious that he spoke aloud  hullo bopp i thought you werent coming cried mephistopheles in an emphatic whisper  ah i guess you yes you are well done i should like to be a faust for you but i haf no time no purse for a dress so i throw this on and run up for a hour or two where iswho is all these people do you know them  the one with the pope fra diavolo the telegraph and two knights asking her to dance is dolly if thats what you want to know go in and keep it up bopp while you can i am off for fan and mephistopheles departed over the banisters with a weird agility that delighted the beholders while the gray friar stole into a corner and watched the pink domino for half an hour at the end of which time his regards were somewhat confused by discovering that there were two pink damsels so like that he could not tell which was the one pointed out by dick and which the newcomer  she thinks i will not know her but i shall go now and find out for myself and starting into sudden activity the gray brother strode up to the nearest pink lady bowed and offered his arm with a haughty little gesture of denial to several others she accepted it and they joined the circle of manycolored promenaders that eddied round the hall as they went mr bopp scrutinized his companion but saw only a slender figure shrouded from head to foot and the tip of a white glove resting on his arm  i will speak then her voice will betray her he thought forgetting that his own was undisguisable  madame permit me that i fan you it is so greatly warm  a fan was surrendered with a bow and the masked face turned fully toward his own while the hood trembled as if its wearer laughed silently  ah it is youi know the eyes the step the laugh miss dolly did you think you could hide from me  i did not wish to was the whispered answer  did you think i would come  i hoped so  then you are not displease with me  no i am very glad i wanted you  the pink head drooped a little nearer and another white glove went to meet its mate upon his arm with a pretty confiding gesture mr bopp instantly fell into a state of blissthe lights music gay surroundings and more than all this unwonted demonstration put the crowning glory to the moment and fired with the hopeful omen he allowed his love to silence his prudence and lead him to do then and there the very thing he had often resolved never to do at all  ah miss dolly if you knew how much how very much you haf enlarged my happiness and made this efening shine for me you would more often be a little friendly for this winter has been all summer to me since i knew you and your kind home and now i haf no sorrow but that after the next lesson i come no more unless you gif me leaf see now i must say this even here when so much people are about us because i cannot stop it and you will forgif me that i cannot wait any longer  mr bopp please dont please stop began the pink domino in a hurried whisper but mr bopp was not to be stopped he had dammed up the stream so long that now it rushed on fast full and uncontrollable for leading her into one of the curtained recesses near by he sat down beside her and still plying the fan went on impetuously  i feel to say that i lofe you and tho i try to kill it my love will not die because it is more strong than my will more dear than my pride for i haf much and i do not ask you to be meine frau till i can gif you more than my heart and my poor name but hear now i will work and save and wait a many years if at the end you will take all i haf and say august i lofe you do not laugh at me because i say this in such poor words you are my hearts dearest and i must tell it or never come again speak to me one kind yes and i will thank gott in himmel for so much joy  the pink domino had listened to this rapid speech with averted head and when it ended started up saying eagerly you are mistaken sir i am not dolly but as she spoke her words were belied for the hasty movement displaced her mask and mr bopp saw dollys eyes a lock of dark hair and a pair of burning cheeks before the screen was readjusted with redoubled earnestness he held her back whispering  do not go mitout the little word yes or no it is not much to say  well then no  you mean it dolly truly mean it  yes let me go at once sir  mr bopp stood up saying slowlyyes go now they told me you had no heart i beliefe it and thank you for that no then bowed and walked straight out of the hall while the pink domino broke into a fit of laughter saying to herself  ive done it ive done it but what a piece of work therell be tomorrow  dick who was that tall creature fan was parading with last night no one knew and he vanished before the masks were taken off asked dolly as she and her brother lounged in opposite corners of the sofa the morning after the masquerade talking it over  that was old bopp mrs peep  gracious me why he said he wasnt coming  people sometimes say what they dont mean as you may have discovered  but why didnt he come and speak to a body dick  better employed i suppose  now dont be cross dear but tell me all about it for i dont understand how you allowed him to monopolize fan so  oh dont bother im sleepy  no youre not you look wicked i know youve been in mischief and i insist upon hearing all about it so come and fess this instant  dolly proceeded to enforce her command by pulling away his pillow and dragging her brother into a sitting posture in spite of his laughing resistance and evident desire to exhaust her patience for dick excelled in teasing and kept his sister in a fidget from morning till night with occasional fits of penitence and petting which lasted till next time therefore though dying to fess he was undecided as to the best method of executing that task in the manner most aggravating to his listener and most agreeable to himself and sat regarding her with twinkling eyes and his curly pate in a high state of rumple trying to appear innocently meek but failing signally  now then up and tell commanded dolly  well if you wont take my head off till im done ill tell you the best joke of the season are you sure the pink domino with bopp wasnt yourselffor she looked and acted very like you  of course i am i didnt even know he was there and think it very rude and ungentlemanly in him not to come and speak to me you know it was fan so do go on  but it wasnt for she changed her mind and wore a black domino i saw her put it on myself her cousin jack came unexpectedly and she thought if she altered her dress and went with him you wouldnt know her  who could it have been dick  thats the mystery for do you know bopp proposed to her  he didnt and dolly flew up with a startled look that to adopt a phrase from his own vocabulary was nuts to her brother  yes he did i heard him  when where and how  in one of these flirtation boxes they dropped the curtain but i heard him do it on my honor i did  persons of honor dont listen at curtains and keyholes what did they say  oh if it wasnt honorable to listen it isnt to hear so i wont tell though i could not help knowing it  mercy dont stop now or i shall die with curiosity i dare say i should have done the same no one minds at such a place you know but i dont see the joke yet said dolly dismally  i do and dick went off into a shout  you idiotic boy take that pillow out of your mouth and tell me the whole thingwhat he said what she said and what they both did it was all fun of course but id like to hear about it  it may have been fun on her part but it was solemn earnest on his for he went it strong i assure you id no idea the old fellow was so sly for he appeared smashed with you you know and there he was finishing up with this unknown lady i wish you could have heard him go on with tears in his eyes  how do you know if you didnt see him  oh well thats only a figure of speech i thought so from his voice he was ever so tender and took to dutch when english was too cool for him it was really touching for i never heard a fellow do it before and upon my word i should think it was rather a tough job to say that sort of thing to a pretty woman mask or no mask  what did she say asked dolly with her hands pressed tight together and a curious little quiver of the lips  she said no as short as piecrust and when he rushed out with his heart broken all to bits apparently she just burst out laughing and went and polked at a twoforty pace for half an hour  dora unclasped her hands took a long breath and cried out  she was a wicked heartless hussy and if i know her ill never speak to her again for if he was really in earnest she ought to be killed for laughing at him  so ought you then for making fun of poor fisher when he went down on his knees behind the huckleberry bushes last summer he was earnest enough for he looked as blackandblue as his berries when he got home your theory is all right maam but your practice is all bosh  hold your tongue about that silly thing boys in college think they know everything can do everything have everything and only need beckon and all womankind will come and adore it made a man of him and hell thank me for taking the sentimental nonsense and conceit out of him you will need just such a lesson at the rate you go on and i hope fan will give it to you  when the lecture is over ill go on with the joke if you want to know it  isnt this enough  oh bless you no the cream of it is to come what would you give to know who the lady was  five dollars down this minute  very good hand em over and ill tell you  truly dick  yes and prove it  dolly produced her purse and bill in hand sat waiting for the disclosure dick rose with a melodramatic bow  lo it was i  thats a great fib for i saw you flying about the whole evening  you saw my dress but i was not in it  oh oh who did i keep going to then and what did i do to make a fool of myself i wonder  purse and bill dropped out of dollys hand and she looked at her brother with a distracted expression of countenance dick rubbed his hands and chuckled  heres a jolly state of things now ill tell you the whole story i never thought of doing it till i saw bopp and told him who you were but on my way for fan i wondered if hed get puzzled between you two and then a grand idea popped into my head to puzzle him myself for i can take you off to the life fan didnt want me to but i made her so she lent me hoops and gown and the pink domino and if ever i thanked my stars i wasnt tall i did then for the things fitted capitally as to length tho i kept splitting something down the back and scattering hooks and eyes in all directions i wish you could have heard jack roar while they rigged me he had no dress so i lent him mine till just before the masks were taken off when we cut home and changed he told me how you kept running to him to tie up your slippers find your fan and tell him funny things thinking it was me i never enjoyed anything so much in my life  go on said dolly in a breathless sort of voice and the deluded boy obeyed  i knew bopp and hovered near till he came to find out who i was i took you off in style and it deceived him for im only an inch or two taller than you and kept my head down in the lackadaisical way you girls do i whispered so my voice didnt betray me and was very clinging and sweet and fluttery and that blessed old goose was sure it was you i thought it was all over once for when he came the heavy in the recess i got a bit flustered he was so serious about it my mask slipped but i caught it so he only saw my eyes and forehead which are just like yours and that finished him for ive no doubt i looked as red and silly as you would have done in a like fix  why did you say no and dolly looked as stern as fate  what else should i say you told me you wouldnt have him and i thought it would save you the bother of saying it and him the pain of asking twice i told him some time ago that you were a born flirt he said he knew it so i was surprised to hear him go on at such a rate but supposed that i was too amiable and that misled him poor old bopp i kept thinking of him all night as he looked when he said they told me you had no heart now i believe it and i thank you for that no it was rather a hard joke for him but its over now and he wont have to do it again you said i wouldnt dare tell him about you didnt i and havent i won the  the rest of the sentence went spinning dizzily through dicks head as a sudden tingling sensation pervaded his left ear followed by a similar smart in the right and for a moment chaos seemed to have come again whatever dolly did was thoroughly done when she danced the soles of her shoes attested the fact when she flirted it was warm work while it lasted and when she was angry it thundered lightened and blew great guns till the shower came and the whole affair ended in a rainbow therefore being outwitted disappointed mortified and hurt her first impulse was to find a vent for these conflicting emotions and possessing skillful hands she left them to avenge the wrong done her heart which they did so faithfully that if ever a young gentlemans ears were vigorously and completely boxed dick was that young individual as the thunderclap ceased the gale began and blew steadily for several minutes  you think it a joke do you i tell you its a wicked cruel thing youve told a lie youve broken augusts heart and made me so angry that ill never forgive you as long as i live what do you know about my feelings and how dare you take it upon yourself to answer for me you think because we are the same age that i am no older than you but youre mistaken for a boy of eighteen is a boy a girl is often a woman with a womans hopes and plans you dont understand this any more than you do augusts love for me which you listened to and laughed at i said i didnt like him and i didnt find out till afterward that i did then i was afraid to tell you lest youd twit me with it but now i care for no one and i say i do like himyes i love him with all my heart and soul and might and id die this minute if i could undo the harm youve done and see him happy i know ive been selfish vain and thoughtless but i am not now i hoped hed love me hoped hed see i cared for him that id done trifling and didnt mind if he was poor for id enough for both that i longed to make his life pleasant after all his troubles that id send for the little sister he loves so well and never let him suffer any more for he is so good so patient so generous and dear to me i cannot do enough for him now its all spoilt now i can never tell him this never comfort him in any way never be happy again all my life and you have done it  as dolly stood before her brother pouring out her words with glittering eyes impetuous voice and face pale with passionate emotion he was scared for as his scattered wits returned to him he felt that he had been playing with edge tools and had cut and slashed in rather a promiscuous manner dazed and dizzy he sat staring at the excited figure before him forgetting the indignity he had received the mistake he had made the damage he had done in simple wonder at the revolutions going on under his astonished eyes when dolly stopped for breath he muttered with a contrite look  im very sorryit was only fun and i thought it would help you both for how the deuce should i know you liked the man when you said you hated him  i never said that and if id wanted advice i should have gone to mother you men go blundering off with half an idea in your heads and never see your stupidity till you have made a mess that cant be mended we women dont work so but save peoples feelings and are called hypocrites for our pains i never meant to tell you but i will now to show you how ive been serving you while youve been harming me every one of those notes from fan which you admire so much answer so carefully and wear out in your pocket though copied by her were written by me  the devil they were up flew dick and clapping his hand on the left breastpocket out came a dozen pink notes tied up with a blue ribbon and much the worse for wear he hastily turned them over as dolly went on  yes i did it for she didnt know how to answer your notes and came to me i didnt laugh at them or make fun of her but helped her silly little wits and made you a happy boy for three months though you teased me day and night for i loved you and hadnt the heart to spoil your pleasure  youve done it now with a vengeance and youre a pair of deceitful minxes ive paid you off ill give fan one more note that will keep her eyes red for a month and ill never love or trust a girl again as long as i livenever never  red with wrath dick flung the treasured packet into the fire punched it well down among the coals flung away the poker and turned about with a look and gesture which would have been comically tragic if they had not been decidedly pathetic for in spite of his years a very tender heart beat under the blue jacket and it was grievously wounded at the perfidy of the gentle little divinity whom he worshipped with daily increasing ardor his eyes filled but he winked resolutely his lips trembled but he bit them hard his hands doubled themselves up but he remembered his adversary was a woman and as a last effort to preserve his masculine dignity he began to whistle  as if the inconsistencies of womankind were to be shown him as rapidly as possible at this moment the shower came on for taking him tenderly about the neck dolly fell to weeping so infectiously that after standing rigidly erect till a great tear dropped off the end of his nose ignominiously announcing that it was no go dick gave in and laying his head on dollys shoulder the twins quenched their anger washed away their malice and soothed their sorrow by one of those natural processes so kindly provided for poor humanity and so often despised as a weakness when it might prove a better strength than any pride  dick cleared up first with no sign of the tempest but a slight mist through which his native sunshine glimmered pensively  dont dear dont cry so it will make you sick and wont do any good for things will come right or ill make em and well be comfortable all round  no we never can be as we were and its all my fault ive betrayed fans confidence ive spoiled your little romance ive been a thoughtless wicked girl ive lost august and oh dear me i wish i was dead with which funereal climax dolly cried so despairingly that like the youngest miss pecksniff she was indeed a gushing creature  oh come now dont be dismal and blame yourself for every trouble under the sun sit down and talk it over and see what can be done poor old girl i forgave you the notes and say i was wrong to meddle with bopp i got you into the scrape and ill get you out if the sky dont fall or bopp blow his brains out like a second werther before tomorrow  dick drew the animated fountain to the wide chair where they had sat together since they were born wiped her eyes laid her wet cheek against his own and patted her back with an idea that it was soothing to babies and why not to girls  i wish mother was at home sighed dolly longing for that port which was always a haven of refuge in domestic squalls like this  write and tell her not to stay till saturday  no it would spoil her visit and you know she deferred it to help us through this dreadful masquerade but i dont know what to do  why bless your heart its simple enough ill tell bopp beg his pardon say dollys willing and there you are all taut and shipshape again  i wouldnt for the world dick it would be very hard for you very awkward for me and do no good in the end for august is so proud hed never forgive you for such a trick would never believe that i had a heart after all youve said and ive done and i should only hear with my own ears that he thanked me for that no oh why cant people know when they are in love and not go heels over head before they are ready  well if that dont suit ill let it alone for that is all i can suggest and if you like your womans way better try it only youll have to fly round because tomorrow is the last night you know  i shant go dick  why not we are going to give him the rosewood set of things have speeches cheers for the king of clubs and no end of fun  i cant help it there would be no fun for me and i couldnt look him in the face after all this  oh pooh yes you could or it will be the first time you dared not do damage with those wicked eyes of yours  it is the first time i ever loved any one dollys voice was so low and her head drooped so much that this brief confession was apparently put away in dicks pocket and being an exceedingly novel one filled that inflammable youth with a desire to deposit a similar one in the other pocket which being emptied of its accustomed contents left a somewhat aching void in itself and the heart underneath after a moments silence he said  well if you wont go you can settle it when he comes here though i think we should all do better to confess coming home in the dark  he wont come here again dick  wont he that shows you dont know bopp as well as i hell come to say goodby to thank mother for her kindness and you and me for the little things weve done for him i wish id left the last undone and go away like a gentleman as he issee if he dont  do you think so then i must see him  im sure he will for we men dont bear malice and sulk and bawl when we come to grief this way but stand up and take it without winking like the young spartan brick when the fox was digging into him you know  then of course youll forgive fan  ill be hanged if i do growled dick  ah ha your theory is very good sir but your practice is bosh quoted dolly with a gleam of the old mischief in her face  dick took a sudden turn through the room burst out laughing and came back saying heartily  ill own up it is mean to feel so and ill think about forgiving you both but she may stop up the hole in the wall for she wont get any more letters just yet and you may devote your epistolary powers to a bopp in future well what is it free your mind and have done with it but dont make your nose red or take the starch out of my collar with any more salt water if you please  no i wont and i only want to say that as you owe the explanation to us both perhaps it would be best for you to tell august your part of the thing as you come home tomorrow and then leave the rest to fate i cant let him go away thinking me such a heartless creature and once gone it will be too late to mend the matter can you do this without getting me into another scrape do you think  i havent a doubt of it and i call that sensible ill fix it capitallygo down on my knees in the mud if it is necessary treat you like eggs for fear of another smashup and bring him home in such a tiptop state youll only have to nod and find yourself mrs b any day you like now lets kiss and be friends and then go pitch into that pie for luncheon  so they did and an hour afterward were rioting in the garret under pretence of putting grandmas things away for at eighteen in spite of love and mischief boys and girls have a spell to exorcise blue devils and a happy faculty of forgetting that the world is hollow and their dolls stuffed with sawdust  dick was right for on the following evening after the lesson mr bopp did go home with him to say goodby like a gentleman as he was dolly got over the first greeting in the dusky hall and as her guest passed on to the parlor she popped her head out to ask anxiously  did you say anything dick  i couldnt something has happened to him hell tell you about it im going to see to the horse so take your time and do what you like with which vague information dick vanished and dolly wished herself anywhere but where she was  mr bopp sat before the fire looking so haggard and worn out that the girls conscience pricked her sorely for her part in the change but plucking up her courage she stirred briskly among the teacups asking  what shall i give you sir  thank you i haf no care to eat  something in his spiritless mien and sorrowful voice made dollys eyes fill but knowing she must depend upon herself now and make the best of her position she said kindly yet nervously  you look tired let me do something for you if i can shall i sing for you a little you once said music rested you  you are kind i could like that i think excoose me if i am dull i hafyes a little air if you please  more and more disturbed by his absent troubled manner dolly began a german song he had taught her but before the first line was sung he stopped her with an imploring  for gott sake not that i cannot hear it this night it was the last i sung her in the vaterland  mr bopp what is it dick says you have a trouble tell me and let us help you if we can are you ill in want or has any one wronged or injured you in any way oh let me help you  tears had been streaming down mr bopps cheeks but as she spoke he checked them and tried to answer steadily  no i am not ill i haf no wants now and no one has hurt me but in kindness yet i haf so great a grief i could not bear it all alone and so i came to ask a little sympathy from your good mutter who has been kind to me as if i was a son she is not here and i thought i would stop back my grief but that moosic was too much you pity me and so i tell you see now when i find things go bright with me and haf a hope of much work i take the little store i saved i send it to my friend carl hoffman who is coming from my home and say bring ulla to me now for i can make life go well to her and i am hungry till i haf her in my arms again i tell no one for i am bold to think that one day i come here with her in my hand to let her thank you in her so sweet way for all you haf done for me well i watch the wind i count the days i haf no rest for joy and when carl comes i fly to him he gifs me back my store he falls upon my neck and does not speak then i know my little kind will never come for she has gone to himmel before i could make a home for her on earth oh my ulla it is hard to bear and with a rain of bitter tears poor mr bopp covered up his face and laid it down on his empty plate as if he never cared to lift it up again  then dolly forgot herself in her great sympathy and going to him she touched the bent head with a soothing hand let her tears flow to comfort his and whispered in her tenderest voice  dear mr bopp i wish i could heal this sorrow but as i cannot let me bear it with you let me tell you how we loved the little child and longed to see her how we should have rejoiced to know you had so dear a friend to make your life happy in this strange land how we shall grieve for your great loss and long to prove our respect and love for you i cannot say this as i ought but oh be comforted for you will see the child again and remembering that she waits for you you will be glad to go when god calls you to meet your ulla in that other fatherland  ah i will go now i haf no wish to stay for all my life is black to me if i had found that other little friend to fill her place i should not grieve so much because she is weller there above than i could make her here but no i wait for that other one i save all my heart for her i send it but it comes back to me then i know my hope is dead and i am all alone in the strange land  there was neither bitterness nor reproach in these broken words only a patient sorrow a regretful pain as if he saw the two lost loves before him and uttered over them an irrepressible lament it was too much for dolly and with sudden resolution she spoke out fast and low  mr bopp that was a mistake it was not i you saw at the masque it was dick he played a cruel trick he insulted you and wronged me by that deceit and i find it very hard to pardon him  what what is that and mr bopp looked up with tears still shining in his beard and intense surprise in every feature of his face  dolly turned scarlet and her heart beat fast as she repeated with an unsteady voice  it was dick not i  a cloud swept over mr bopps face and he knit his brows a moment as if dolly had not been far from right when she said he never would forgive the joke presently he spoke in a tone she had never heard beforecold and quietand in his eye she thought she read contempt for her brother and herself  i see now and i say no more but this it was not kind when i so trusted you yet it is well for you and richart are so one i haf no doubt he spoke your wish  here was a desperate state of things dolly had done her best yet he did not or would not understand and before she could restrain them the words slipped over her tongue  no dick and i never agree  mr bopp started swept three spoons and a teacup off the table as he turned for something in the hasty whisper reassured him the color sprang up to his cheek the old warmth to his eye the old erectness to his figure and the eager accent to his voice he rose drew dolly nearer took her face between his hands and bending fixed on her a look tender yet masterful as he said with an earnestness that stirred her as words had never done before  dollee he said no do you say yes  she could not speak but her heart stood up in her eyes and answered him so eloquently that he was satisfied  thank the lord its all right thought dick as peeping in at the window ten minutes later be saw dolly enthroned upon mr bopps knee both her hands in his and an expression in her april countenance which proved that she found it natural and pleasant to be sitting there with her head on the kind heart that loved her to hear herself called meine leibchen to know that she alone could comfort him for little ullas loss and fill her empty place  they make a very pretty landscape but too much honey isnt good for em so ill go in and well eat drink and be merry in honor of the night  he rattled the latch and tramped on the mat to warn them of his approach and appeared just as dolly was skimming into a chair and mr bopp picking up the spoons which he dropped again to meet dick with a face clear shining after rain and kissing him on both cheeks after the fashion of his country he said pointing to dolly  see it is all fine again i forgif you and leave all blame to that bad spirit mephistopheles who has much pranks like that but never pays one for their pain as you haf me hearts dearest come and say a friendly word to richart then we will haf a little healthlong life and happiness to the king of clubs and the queen of hearts  yes august and as hes to be a farmer well add anotherwiser wits and better manners to the knave of spades     the cross on the old church tower   up the dark stairs that led to his poor home strode a gloomyfaced young man with despair in his heart and these words on his lips  i will struggle and suffer no longer my last hope has failed and life become a burden i will rid myself of at once  as he muttered his stern purpose he flung wide the door and was about to enter but paused upon the threshold for a glance told him that he had unconsciously passed his own apartment and come up higher till he found himself in a room poorer but more cheerful than his own  sunshine streamed in through the one small window where a caged bird was blithely singing and a few flowers blossomed in the light but blither than the birds song sweeter than the flowers was the little voice and wan face of a child who lay upon a bed placed where the warmest sunbeams fell  the face turned smiling on the pillow and the voice said pleasantly  come in sir bess will soon be back if you will wait  i want nothing of bess who is she and who are you asked the intruder pausing as he was about to go  she is my sister sir and im poor jamie as they call me but indeed i am not to be pitied for i am a happy child though it may not seem so  why do you lie there are you sick  no i am not sick though i shall never leave my bed again see this is why and folding back the covering the child showed his little withered limbs  how long have you lain here my poor boy asked the stranger touched and interested in spite of himself  three years sir  and yet you are happy what in heavens name have you to render you contented child  come sit beside me and ill tell you sir that is if you please i should love to talk with you for its lonely here when bess is gone  something in the childs winning voice and the influence of the cheerful room calmed the young mans troubled spirit and seemed to lighten his despair he sat down at the bedside looking gloomily upon the child who lay smiling placidly as with skilful hands he carved small figures from the bits of wood scattered round him on the coverlid  what have you to make you happy jamie tell me your secret for i need the knowledge very much said his new friend earnestly  first of all i have dear bess and the childs voice lingered lovingly upon the name she is so good so very good to me no one can tell how much we love each other all day she sits beside my bed singing to ease my pain or reading while i work she gives me flowers and birds and all the sunshine that comes in to us and sits there in the shadow that i may be warm and glad she waits on me all day but when i wake at night i always see her sewing busily and know it is for memy good kind bess  then i have my work sir to amuse me and it helps a little too for kind children always buy my toys when bess tells them of the little boy who carved them lying here at home while they play out among the grass and flowers where he can never be  what else jamie and the listeners face grew softer as the cheerful voice went on  i have my bird sir and my roses i have books and best of all i have the cross on the old church tower i can see it from my pillow and it shines there all day long so bright and beautiful while the white doves coo upon the roof below i love it dearly  the young man looked out through the narrow window and saw rising high above the housetops like a finger pointing heavenward the old gray tower and the gleaming cross the citys din was far below and through the summer air the faint coo of the doves and the flutter of their wings came down like peaceful country sounds  why do you love it jamie he asked looking at the thoughtful face that lit up eagerly as the boy replied  because it does me so much good sir bess told me long ago about the blessed jesus who bore so much for us and i longed to be as like him as a little child could grow so when my pain was very sharp i looked up there and thinking of the things he suffered tried so hard to bear it that i often could but sometimes when it was too bad instead of fretting bess id cry softly looking up there all the time and asking him to help me be a patient child i think he did and now it seems so like a friend to me i love it better every day i watch the sun climb up along the roofs in the morning creeping higher and higher till it shines upon the cross and turns it into gold then through the day i watch the sunshine fade away till all the red goes from the sky and for a little while i cannot see it through the dark but the moon comes and i love it better then for lying awake through the long nights i see the cross so high and bright with stars all shining round it and i feel still and happy in my heart as when bess sings to me in the twilight  but when there is no moon or clouds hide it from you what then jamie asked the young man wondering if there were no cloud to darken the cheerful childs content  i wait till it is clear again and feel that it is there although i cannot see it sir i hope it never will be taken down for the light upon the cross seems like that i see in dear bessies eyes when she holds me in her arms and calls me her patient jamie she never knows i try to bear my troubles for her sake as she bears hunger and cold for mine so you see sir how many things i have to make me a happy child  i would gladly lie down on your pillow to be half as light of heart as you are little jamie for i have lost my faith in everything and with it all my happiness and the heavy shadow which had lifted for a while fell back darker than before upon the anxious face beside the bed  if i were well and strong like you sir i think i should be so thankful nothing could trouble me and with a sigh the boy glanced at the vigorous frame and energetic countenance of his new friend wondering at the despondent look he wore  if you were poor so poor you had no means wherewith to get a crust of bread nor a shelter for the night if you were wornout with suffering and labor soured by disappointment and haunted by ambitious hopes never to be realized what would you do jamie suddenly asked the young man prompted by the desire that every human heart has felt for sympathy and counsel even from the little creature before him ignorant and inexperienced as he was  but the child wiser in his innocence than many an older counsellor pointed upward saying with a look of perfect trust  i should look up to the cross upon the tower and think of what bess told me about god who feeds the birds and clothes the flowers and i should wait patiently feeling sure he would remember me  the young man leaned his head upon his folded arms and nothing stirred in the room but the wind that stole in through the roses to fan the placid face upon the pillow  are you weary waiting for me jamie dear i could not come before and as her eager voice broke the silence sister bess came hastening in  the stranger looking up saw a young girl regarding him from jamies close embrace with a face whose only beauty was the light her brother spoke of that beamed warm and bright from her mild countenance and made the poor room fairer for its presence  this is bess my bess sir cried the boy and she will thank you for your kindness in sitting here so long with me  i am the person who lodges just below you i mistook this room for my own pardon me and let me come again for jamie has already done me good replied the stranger as he rose to go  bess dear will you bring me a cup of water jamie said and as she hastened away he beckoned his friend nearer saying with a timid wistful look  forgive me if its wrong but i wish you would let me give you this its very little but it may help some and i think youll take it to please poor jamie wont you sir and as he spoke the child offered a bright coin the proceeds of his work  tears sprung into the proud mans eyes he held the little wasted hand fast in his own a moment saying seriously  i will take it jamie as a loan wherewith to begin anew the life i was about to fling away as readily as i do this and with a quick motion he sent a vial whirling down into the street ill try the world once more in a humbler spirit and have faith in you at least my little providence  with an altered purpose in his heart and a brave smile on his lips the young man went away leaving the child with another happy memory to watch the cross upon the old church tower  it was midwinter and in the gloomy house reigned suffering and want sister bess worked steadily to earn the dear daily bread so many pray for and so many need jamie lay upon his bed carving with feeble hands the toys which would have found far readier purchasers could they have told the touching story of the frail boy lying meekly in the shadow of the solemn change which daily drew more near  cheerful and patient always poverty and pain seemed to have no power to darken his bright spirit for gods blessed charity had gifted him with that inward strength and peace it so often brings to those who seem to human eyes most heavily afflicted  secret tears fell sometimes on his pillow and whispered prayers went up but bess never knew it and like a ray of sunshine the boys tranquil presence lit up that poor home and amid the darkest hours of their adversity the little rushlight of his childish faith never wavered nor went out  below them lived the young man no stranger now but a true friend whose generous pity would not let them suffer any want he could supply hunger and cold were hard teachers but he learned their lessons bravely and though his frame grew gaunt and his eye hollow yet at heart he felt a better happier man for the stern discipline that taught him the beauty of selfdenial and the blessedness of loving his neighbor better than himself  the childs influence remained unchanged and when anxiety or disappointment burdened him the young man sat at jamies bedside listening to the boys unconscious teaching and receiving fresh hope and courage from the childish words and the wan face always cheerful and serene  with this example constantly before him he struggled on feeling that if the world were cold and dark he had within himself one true affection to warm and brighten his hard life  give me joy jamie give me joy bess the book sells well and we shall yet be rich and famous cried the young author as he burst into the quiet room one wintry night with snowflakes glittering in his hair and his face aglow with the keen air which had no chill in it to him now  bess looked up to smile a welcome and jamie tried to cry hurrah but the feeble voice faltered and failed and he could only wave his hand and cling fast to his friend whispering brokenly  im glad oh very glad for now you need not rob yourself for us i know you have walter i have seen it in your poor thin face and these old clothes it never would have been so but for bess and me  hush jamie and lie here upon my arm and rest for you are very tired with your worki know by this hot hand and shortened breath are you easy now then listen for ive brave news to tell you and never say again i do too much for youthe cause of my success  i walter cried the boy what do you mean  looking down upon the wondering face uplifted to his own the young man answered with deep feeling  six months ago i came into this room a desperate and despairing man weary of life because i knew not how to use it and eager to quit the struggle because i had not learned to conquer fortune by energy and patience you kept me jamie till the reckless mood was passed and by the beauty of your life showed me what mine should be your courage shamed my cowardice your faith rebuked my fears your lot made my own seem bright again i a man with youth health and the world before me was about to fling away the life which you a helpless little child made useful good and happy by the power of your own brave will i felt how weak how wicked i had been and was not ashamed to learn of you the lesson you so unconsciously were teaching god bless you jamie for the work you did that day  did i do so much asked the boy with innocent wonder i never knew it and always thought you had grown happier and kinder because i had learned to love you more im very glad if i did anything for you who do so much for us but tell me of the book you never would before  with a kindling eye walter replied  i would not tell you till all was sure now listen i wrote a story jamiea story of our lives weaving in few fancies of my own and leaving you unchangedthe little counsellor and good angel of the ambitious mans hard life i painted no fictitious sorrows what i had seen and keenly felt i could truly tellyour cheerful patience besss faithful love my struggles hopes and fears this book unlike the others was not rejected for the simple truth told by an earnest pen touched and interested it was accepted and has been kindly welcomed thanks to you jamie for many buy it to learn more of you to weep and smile over artless words of yours and forget their pity in their reverence and love for the child who taught the man to be not what he is but what with gods help he will yet become  they are very kind and so are you walter and i shall be proud to have you rich and great though i may not be here to see it  you will jamie you must for it will be nothing without you and as he spoke the young man held the thin hand closer in his own and looked more tenderly into the face upon his arm  the boys eyes shone with a feverish light a scarlet flush burned on his hollow cheek and the breath came slowly from his parted lips but over his whole countenance there lay a beautiful serenity which filled his friend with hope and fear  walter bid bess put away that tiresome work she has sat at it all day long never stirring but to wait on me and as he spoke a troubled look flitted across the boys calm face  i shall soon be done jamie and i must not think of rest till then for there is neither food nor fuel for the morrow sleep yourself dear and dream of pleasant things i am not very tired  and bess bent closer to her work trying to sing a little song that they might not guess how near the tears were to her aching eyes  from beneath his pillow jamie drew a bit of bread whispering to his friend as he displayed it  give it to bess i saved it for her till you came for she will not take it from me and she has eaten nothing all this day  and you jamie asked walter struck by the sharpened features of the boy and the hungry look which for a moment glistened in his eye  i dont need much you know for i dont work like bess but yet she gives me all oh how can i bear to see her working so for me and i lying idle here  as he spoke jamie clasped his hands before his face and through his slender fingers streamed such tears as children seldom shed  it was so rare a thing for him to weep that it filled walter with dismay and a keener sense of his own powerlessness ho could bear any privation for himself alone but he could not see them suffer he had nothing to offer them for though there was seeming wealth in store for him he was now miserably poor he stood a moment looking from brother to sister both so dear to him and both so plainly showing how hard a struggle life had been to them  with a bitter exclamation the young man turned away and went out into the night muttering to himself  they shall not suffer i will beg or steal first  and with some vague purpose stirring within him he went swiftly on until he reached a great thoroughfare nearly deserted now but echoing occasionally to a quick step as some one hurried home to his warm fireside  a little money sir for a sick child and a starving woman and with outstretched hand walter arrested an old man but he only wrapped his furs still closer and passed on saying sternly  i have nothing for vagrants go to work young man  a woman poorly clad in widows weeds passed at that moment and as the beggar fell back from the rich mans path she dropped a bit of silver in his hand saying with true womanly compassion  heaven help you it is all i have to give  ill beg no more muttered walter as he turned away burning with shame and indignation ill take from the rich what the poor so freely give god pardon me i see no other way and they must not starve  with a vague sense of guilt already upon him he stole into a more unfrequented street and slunk into the shadow of a doorway to wait for coming steps and nerve himself for his first evil deed  glancing up to chide the moonlight for betraying him he started for there above the snowclad roofs rose the cross upon the tower hastily he averted his eyes as if they had rested on the mild reproachful countenance of a friend  far up in the wintry sky the bright symbol shone and from it seemed to fall a radiance warmer than the moonlight clearer than the starlight showing to that tempted heart the darkness of the yet uncommitted wrong  that familiar sight recalled the past he thought of jamie and seemed to hear again the childish words uttered long ago god will remember us  steps came and went along the lonely street but the dark figure in the shadow never stirred only stood there with bent head accepting the silent rebuke that shone down upon it and murmuring softly  god remember little jamie and forgive me that my love for him led me astray  as walter raised his hand to dash away the drops that rose at the memory of the boy his eye fell on the ring he always wore for his dead mothers sake he had hoped to see it one day on besss hand but now a generous thought banished all others and with the energy of an honest purpose be hastened to sell the ring purchase a little food and fuel and borrowing a warm covering of a kindly neighbor he went back to dispense these comforts with a satisfaction he had little thought to feel  the one lamp burned low a few dying embers lay upon the earth and no sound broke the silence but the steady rustle of besss needle and the echo of jamies hollow cough  wrap it around bess she has given me her cloak and needs it more than ithese coverings do very well and as he spoke jamie put away the blanket walter offered and suppressing a shiver hid his purple hands beneath the old thin cloak  here is bread jamie eat for heavens sake no need to save it now and walter pressed it on the boy but he only took a little saying he had not much need of food and loved to see them eat far better  so in the cheery blaze of the rekindled fire bess and walter broke their long fast and never saw how eagerly jamie gathered up the scattered crumbs nor heard him murmur softly as he watched them with loving eyes  there will be no cold nor hunger up in heaven but enough for allenough for all  walter youll be kind to bess when i am not here he whispered earnestly as his friend came to draw his bed within the ruddy circle of the firelight gleaming on the floor  i will jamie kinder than a brother was the quick reply but why ask me that with such a wistful face  the boy did not answer but turned on his pillow and kissed his sisters shadow as it flitted by  gray dawn was in the sky before they spoke again bess slept the deep dreamless sleep of utter weariness her head pillowed on her arms walter sat beside the bed lost in sweet and bitter musings silent and motionless fancying the boy slept but a low voice broke the silence whispering feebly  walter will you take me in your strong arms and lay me on my little couch beside the window i should love to see the cross again and it is nearly day  so light so very light the burden seemed walter turned his face aside lest the boy should see the sorrowful emotion painted there and with a close embrace he laid him tenderly down to watch the first ray climbing up the old gray tower  the frost lies so thickly on the windowpanes that you cannot see it even when the light comes jamie said his friend vainly trying to gratify the boys wish  the sun will melt it soon and i can waiti can wait walter its but a little while and jamie with a patient smile turned his face to the dim window and lay silent  higher and higher crept the sunshine till it shone through the frostwork on the boys bright head his bird awoke and carolled blithely but he never stirred  asleep at last poor tired little jamie ill not wake him till the day is warmer and walter folding the coverings closer over the quiet figure sat beside it waiting till it should wake  jamie dear look up and see how beautifully your last rose has blossomed in the night when least we looked for it and bess came smiling in with the one white rose so fragrant but so frail  jamie did not turn to greet her for all frost had melted from the boys life now another flower had blossomed in the early dawn and though the patient face upon the pillow was bathed in sunshine little jamie was not there to see it gleaming on the cross god had remembered him  spring showers had made the small mound green and scattered flowers in the churchyard sister bess sat in the silent room alone working still but pausing often to wipe away the tears that fell upon a letter on her knee  steps came springing up the narrow stairs and walter entered with a beaming face to show the first rich earnings of his pen and ask her to rest from her long labor in the shelter of his love  dear bess what troubles you let me share your sorrow and try to lighten it he cried with anxious tenderness sitting beside her on the little couch where jamie fell asleep  in the frank face smiling on her the girls innocent eyes read nothing but the friendly interest of a brother and remembering his care and kindness she forgot her womanly timidity in her great longing for sympathy and freely told him all  told him of the lover she left years ago to cling to jamie and how this lover went across the sea hoping to increase his little fortune that the helpless brother might be sheltered for love of her how misfortune followed him and when she looked to welcome back a prosperous man there came a letter saying that all was lost and he must begin the world anew and win a home to offer her before he claimed the heart so faithful to him all these years  he writes so tenderly and bears his disappointment bravely for my sake but it is very hard to see our happiness deferred again when such a little sum would give us to each other  as she ceased bess looked for comfort into the countenance of her companion never seeing through her tears how pale it was with sudden grief how stern with repressed emotion she only saw the friend whom jamie loved and that tie drew her toward him as to an elder brother to whom she turned for help unconscious then how great his own need was  i never knew of this before bess you kept your secret well he said trying to seem unchanged  the color deepened in her cheek but she answered simply i never spoke of it for words could do no good and jamie grieved silently about it for he thought it a great sacrifice though i looked on it as a sacred duty and he often wearied himself to show in many loving ways how freshly he remembered it my grateful little jamie  and her eyes wandered to the green treetops tossing in the wind whose shadows flickered pleasantly above the child  let me think a little bess before i counsel you keep a good heart and rest assured that i will help you if i can said walter trying to speak hopefully  but you come to tell me something at least i fancied i saw some good tidings in your face just now forgive my selfish grief and see how gladly i will sympathize with any joy of yours  it is nothing bess another time will do as well he answered eager to be gone lest he should betray what must be kept most closely now  it never will be told bessnever in this world he sighed bitterly as he went back to his own room which never in his darkest hours had seemed so dreary for now the bright hope of his life was gone  i have it in my power to make them happy he mused as he sat alone but i cannot do it for in this separation lies my only hope he may die or may grow weary and then to whom will bess turn for comfort but to me i will work on earn riches and a name and if that hour should come then in her desolation i will offer all to bess and surely she will listen and accept yet it were a generous thing to make her happiness at once forgetful of my own how shall i bear to see her waiting patiently while youth and hope are fading slowly and know that i might end her weary trial and join two faithful hearts oh jamie i wish to heaven i were asleep with you freed from the temptations that beset me it is so easy to perceive the right so hard to do it  the sound of that familiar name uttered despairingly aloud fell with a sweet and solemn music upon walters ear a flood of tender memories swept away the present and brought back the past he thought of that short life so full of pain and yet of patience of the sunny nature which no cloud could overshadow and the simple trust which was its strength and guide  he thought of that last night and saw now with clearer eyes the sacrifices and the trials silently borne for love of bess  the beautiful example of the child rebuked the passion of he man and through the magic of affection strengthened generous impulses and banished selfish hopes  i promised to be kind to bess and with gods help i will keep my vow teach me to bear my pain to look for help where you found it little jamie and as he spoke the young man gazed up at the shining cross striving to see in it not merely an object of the dead boys love but a symbol of consolation hope and faith  it is a noble thing to see an honest man cleave his own heart in twain to fling away the baser part of it  these words came to walters mind and fixed the resolution wavering there and as his glance wandered from the gray tower to the churchyard full of summer stillness he said within himself  this is the hardest struggle of my life but i will conquer and come out from the conflict master of myself at least and like jamie try to wait until the sunshine comes again even if it only shine upon me dead like him  it was no light task to leave the airy castles built by love and hope and go back cheerfully to the solitude of a life whose only happiness for a time was in the memory of the past but through the weeks that bore one lover home the other struggled to subdue his passion and be as generous in his sorrow as he would have been in his joy  it was no easy conquest but he won the hardest of all victories that of self and found in the place of banished pride and bitterness a patient strength and the one desire to be indeed more generous than a brother to gentle bess he had truly cleft his heart in twain and flung away the baser part  a few days before the absent lover came walter went to bess and with a countenance whose pale serenity touched her deeply he laid his gift before her saying  i owe this all to jamie and the best use i can make of it is to secure your happiness as i promised him id try to do take it and god bless you sister bess  and you walter what will your future be if i take this and go away to enjoy it as you would have me bess asked with an earnestness that awoke his wonder  i shall work bess and in that find content and consolation for the loss of you and jamie do not think of me this money will do me far more good in your hands than my own believe me it is best to be so therefore do not hesitate  bess took it for she had learned the cause of walters restless wanderings and strange avoidance of herself of late and she judged wisely that the generous nature should be gratified and the hardwon victory rewarded by the full accomplishment of its unselfish end few words expressed her joyful thanks but from that time walter felt that he held as dear a place as jamie in her grateful heart and was content  summer flowers were blooming when bess went from the old home a happy wife leaving her faithful friend alone in the little room where jamie lived and died  years passed and walters pen had won for him an honored name poverty and care were no longer his companions many homes were open to him many hearts would gladly welcome him but he still lingered in the gloomy house a serious solitary man for his heart lay beneath the daisies of a childs grave  but his life was rich in noble aims and charitable deeds and with his strong nature softened by the sharp discipline of sorrow and sweetened by the presence of a generous love he was content to dwell alone with the memory of little jamie in the shadow of the cross upon the tower     the death of john  this is not a tale but a true historyed  from hospital sketches   hardly was i settled again when the inevitable bowl appeared and its bearer delivered a message i had expected yet dreaded to receive  john is going maam and wants to see you if you can come  the moment this boy is asleep tell him so and let me know if i am in danger of being too late  my ganymede departed and while i quieted poor shaw i thought of john he came in a day or two after the others and one evening when i entered my pathetic room i found a lately emptied bed occupied by a large fair man with a fine face and the serenest eyes i ever met one of the earlier comers had often spoken of a friend who had remained behind that those apparently worse wounded than himself might reach a shelter first it seemed a david and jonathan sort of friendship the man fretted for his mate and was never tired of praising johnhis courage sobriety selfdenial and unfailing kindliness of heart always winding up with hes an out an out fine feller maam you see if he aint  i had some curiosity to behold this piece of excellence and when he came watched him for a night or two before i made friends with him for to tell the truth i was a little afraid of the stately looking man whose bed had to be lengthened to accommodate his commanding stature who seldom spoke uttered no complaint asked no sympathy but tranquilly observed what went on about him and as he lay high upon his pillows no picture of dying statesman or warrior was ever fuller of real dignity than this virginia blacksmith a most attractive face he had framed in brown hair and beard comely featured and full of vigor as yet unsubdued by pain thoughtful and often beautifully mild while watching the afflictions of others as if entirely forgetful of his own his mouth was grave and firm with plenty of will and courage in its lines but a smile could make it as sweet as any womans and his eyes were childs eyes looking one fairly in the face with a clear straightforward glance which promised well for such as placed their faith in him he seemed to cling to life as if it were rich in duties and delights and he had learned the secret of content the only time i saw his composure disturbed was when my surgeon brought another to examine john who scrutinized their faces with an anxious look asking of the elderdo you think i shall pull through sir i hope so my man and as the two passed on johns eye still followed them with an intentness which would have won a clearer answer from them had they seen it a momentary shadow flitted over his face then came the usual serenity as if in that brief eclipse he had acknowledged the existence of some hard possibility and asking nothing yet hoping all things left the issue in gods hands with that submission which is true piety  the next night as i went my rounds with dr p i happened to ask which man in the room probably suffered most and to my great surprise he glanced at john  every breath he draws is like a stab for the ball pierced the left lung broke a rib and did no end of damage here and there so the poor lad can find neither forgetfulness nor ease because he must lie on his wounded back or suffocate it will be a hard struggle and a long one for he possesses great vitality but even his temperate life cant save him i wish it could  you dont mean he must die doctor  bless you theres not the slightest hope for him and youd better tell him so before long women have a way of doing such things comfortably so i leave it to you he wont last more than a day or two at furthest  i could have sat down on the spot and cried heartily if i had not learned the wisdom of bottling up ones tears for leisure moments such an end seemed very hard for such a man when half a dozen wornout worthless bodies round him were gathering up the remnants of wasted lives to linger on for years perhaps burdens to others daily reproaches to themselves the army needed men like johnearnest brave and faithful fighting for liberty and justice with both heart and hand true soldiers of the lord i could not give him up so soon or think with any patience of so excellent a nature robbed of its fulfilment and blundered into eternity by the rashness or stupidity of those at whose hands so many lives may be required it was an easy thing for dr p to say tell him he must die but a cruelly hard thing to do and by no means as comfortable as he politely suggested i had not the heart to do it then and privately indulged the hope that some change for the better might take place in spite of gloomy prophecies so rendering my task unnecessary a few minutes later as i came in again with fresh rollers i saw john sitting erect with no one to support him while the surgeon dressed his back i had never hitherto seen it done for having simpler wounds to attend to and knowing the fidelity of the attendant i had left john to him thinking it might be more agreeable and safe for both strength and experience were needed in his case i had forgotten that the strong man might long for the gentler tendance of a womans hands the sympathetic magnetism of a womans presence as well as the feebler souls about him the doctors words caused me to reproach myself with neglect not of any real duty perhaps but of those little cares and kindnesses that solace homesick spirits and make the heavy hours pass easier john looked lonely and forsaken just then as he sat with bent head hands folded on his knee and no outward sign of suffering till looking nearer i saw great tears roll down and drop upon the floor it was a new sight there for though i had seen many suffer some swore some groaned most endured silently but none wept yet it did not seem weak only very touching and straightway my fear vanished my heart opened wide and took him in as gathering the bent head in my arms as freely as if he had been a little child i saidlet me help you bear it john  never on any human countenance have i seen so swift and beautiful a look of gratitude surprise and comfort as that which answered me more eloquently than the whispered  thank you maam this is right good this is what i wanted  then why not ask for it before  i didnt like to be a trouble you seemed so busy and i could manage to get on alone  you shall not want it any more john  nor did he for now i understood the wistful look that sometimes followed me as i went out after a brief pause beside his bed or merely a passing nod while busied with those who seemed to need me more than he because more urgent in their demands now i knew that to him as to so many i was the poor substitute for mother wife or sister and in his eyes no stranger but a friend who hitherto had seemed neglectful for in his modesty he had never guessed the truth this was changed now and through the tedious operation of probing bathing and dressing his wounds he leaned against me holding my hand fast and if pain wrung further tears from him no one saw them fall but me when he was laid down again i hovered about him in a remorseful state of mind that would not let me rest till i had bathed his face brushed his bonny brown hair set all things smooth about him and laid a knot of heath and heliotrope on his clean pillow while doing this he watched me with the satisfied expression i so linked to see and when i offered the little nosegay held it carefully in his great hand smoothed a ruffled leaf or two surveyed and smelt it with an air of genuine delight and lay contentedly regarding the glimmer of the sunshine on the green although the manliest man among my forty he said yes maam like a little boy received suggestions for his comfort with the quick smile that brightened his whole face and now and then as i stood tidying the table by his bed i felt him softly touch my gown as if to assure himself that i was there anything more natural and frank i never saw and found this brave john as bashful as brave yet full of excellences and fine aspirations which having no power to express themselves in words seemed to have bloomed into his character and made him what he was  after that night an hour of each evening that remained to him was devoted to his ease or pleasure he could not talk much for breath was precious and he spoke in whispers but from occasional conversations i gleaned scraps of private history which only added to the affection and respect i felt for him once he asked me to write a letter and as i settled pen and paper i said with an irrepressible glimmer of feminine curiosity shall it be addressed to wife or mother john  neither maam ive got no wife and will write to mother myself when i get better did you think i was married because of this he asked touching a plain ring he wore and often turned thoughtfully on his finger when he lay alone  partly that but more from a settled sort of look you havea look which young men seldom get until they marry  i dont know that but im not so very young maam thirty in may and have been what you might call settled this ten years for mothers a widow im the oldest child she has and it wouldnt do for me to marry until lizzie has a home of her own and lauries learned his trade for were not rich and i must be father to the children and husband to the dear old woman if i can  no doubt but you are both john yet how came you to go to war if you felt so wasnt enlisting as bad as marrying  no maam not as i see it for one is helping my neighbor the other pleasing myself i went because i couldnt help it i didnt want the glory or the pay i wanted the right thing done and people kept saying the men who were in earnest ought to flight i was in earnest the lord knows but i held off as long as i could not knowing which was my duty mother saw the case gave me her ring to keep me steady and said go so i went  a short story and a simple one but the man and the mother were portrayed better than pages of fine writing could have done it  do you ever regret that you came when you lie here suffering so much  never maam i havent helped a great deal but ive shown i was willing to give my life and perhaps ive got to but i dont blame anybody and if it was to do over again id do it im a little sorry i wasnt wounded in front it looks cowardly to be hit in the back but i obeyed orders and it doesnt matter in the end i know  poor john it did not matter now except that a shot in front might have spared the long agony in store for him he seemed to read the thought that troubled me as he spoke so hopefully when there was no hope for he suddenly added  this is my first battle do they think its going to be my last  im afraid they do john  it was the hardest question i had ever been called upon to answer doubly hard with those clear eyes fixed on mine forcing a truthful answer by their own truth he seemed a little startled at first pondered over the fateful fact a moment then shook his head with a glance at the broad chest and muscular limbs stretched out before him  im not afraid but its difficult to believe all at once im so strong it dont seem possible for such a little wound to kill me  merry mercutios dying words glanced through my memory as he spoketis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church door but tis enough and john would have said the same could he have seen the ominous black holes between his shoulders he never had and seeing the ghastly sights about him could not believe his own wound more fatal than these for all the suffering it caused him  shall i write to your mother now i asked thinking that these sudden tidings might change all plans and purposes but they did not for the man received the order of the divine commander to march with the same unquestioning obedience with which the soldier had received that of the human one doubtless remembering that the first led him to life and the last to death  no maam to laurie just the same hell break it to her best and ill add a line to her myself when you get done  so i wrote the letter which he dictated finding it better than any i had sent for though here and there a little ungrammatical or inelegant each sentence came to me briefly worded but most expressive full of excellent counsel to the boy tenderly bequeathing mother and lizzie to his care and bidding him goodby in words the sadder for their simplicity he added a few lines with steady hand and as i sealed it said with a patient sort of sigh i hope the answer will come in time for me to see it then turning away his face laid the flowers against his lips as if to hide some quiver of emotion at the thought of such a sudden sundering of all the dear hometies  these things had happened two days before now john was dying and the letter had not come i had been summoned to many deathbeds in my life but to none that made my heart ache as it did then since my mother called me to watch the departure of a spirit akin to this in its gentleness and patient strength as i went in john stretched out both hands  i knew youd come i guess im moving on maam  he was and so rapidly that even while he spoke over his face i saw the gray veil falling that no human hand can lift i sat down by him wiped the drops from his forehead stirred the air about him with the slow wave of a fan and waited to help him die he stood in sore need of helpand i could do so little for as the doctor had foretold the strong body rebelled against death and fought every inch of the way forcing him to draw each breath with a spasm and clench his hands with an imploring look as if he asked how long must i endure this and be still for hours he suffered dumbly without a moments respite or a moments murmuring his limbs grew cold his face damp his lips white and again and again he tore the covering off his breast as if the lightest weight added to his agony yet through it all his eyes never lost their perfect serenity and the mans soul seemed to sit therein undaunted by the ills that vexed his flesh  one by one the men woke and round the room appeared a circle of pale faces and watchful eyes full of awe and pity for though a stranger john was beloved by all each man there had wondered at his patience respected his piety admired his fortitude and now lamented his hard death for the influence of an upright nature had made itself deeply felt even in one little week presently the jonathan who so loved this comely david came creeping from his bed for a last look and word the kind soul was full of trouble as the choke in his voice the grasp of his hand betrayed but there were no tears and the farewell of the friends was the more touching for its brevity  old boy how are you faltered the one  most through thank heaven whispered the other  can i say or do anything for you anywheres  take my things home and tell them that i did my best  i will i will  goodby ned  goodby john goodby  they kissed each other tenderly as women and so parted for poor ned could not stay to see his comrade die for a little while there was no sound in the room but the drip of water from a stump or two and johns distressful gasps as he slowly breathed his life away i thought him nearly gone and had just laid down the fan believing its help to be no longer needed when suddenly he rose up in his bed and cried out with a bitter cry that broke the silence sharply startling every one with its agonized appeal  for gods sake give me air  it was the only cry pain or death had wrung from him the only boon he had asked and none of us could grant it for all the airs that blew were useless now dan flung up the window the first red streak of dawn was warming the gray east a herald of the coming sun john saw it and with the love of light which lingers in us to the end seemed to read in it a sign of hope of help for over his whole face there broke that mysterious expression brighter than any smile which often comes to eyes that look their last he laid himself gently down and stretching out his strong right arm as if to grasp and bring the blessed air to his lips in a fuller flow lapsed into a merciful unconsciousness which assured us that for him suffering was forever past he died then for though the heavy breaths still tore their way up for a little longer they were but the waves of an ebbing tide that beat unfelt against the wreck which an immortal voyager had deserted with a smile he never spoke again but to the end held my hand close so close that when he was asleep at last i could not draw it away dan helped me warning me as he did so that it was unsafe for dead and living flesh to lie so long together but though my hand was strangely cold and stiff and four white marks remained across its back even when warmth and color had returned elsewhere i could not but be glad that through its touch the presence of human sympathy perhaps had lightened that hard hour  when they had made him ready for the grave john lay in state for half an hour a thing which seldom happened in that busy place but a universal sentiment of reverence and affection seemed to fill the hearts of all who had known or heard of him and when the rumor of his death went through the house always astir many came to see him and i felt a tender sort of pride in my lost patient for he looked a most heroic figure lying there stately and still as the statue of some young knight asleep upon his tomb the lovely expression which so often beautifies dead faces soon replaced the marks of pain and i longed for those who loved him best to see him when half an hours acquaintance with death had made them friends as we stood looking at him the ward master handed me a letter saying it had been forgotten the night before it was johns letter come just an hour too late to gladden the eyes that had longed and looked for it so eagerly yet he had it for after i had cut some brown locks for his mother and taken off the ring to send her telling how well the talisman had done its work i kissed this good son for her sake and laid the letter in his hand still folded as when i drew my own away feeling that its place was there and making myself happy with the thought even in his solitary place in the government lot he would not be without some token of the love which makes life beautiful and outlives death then i left him glad to have known so genuine a man and carrying with me an enduring memory of the brave virginia blacksmith as he lay serenely waiting for the dawn of that long day which knows no night
