   no more twist      christmas 1901  illustration     the tailor of gloucester   in the time of swords and periwigs and fullskirted coats with flowered lappetswhen gentlemen wore ruffles and goldlaced waistcoats of paduasoy and taffetathere lived a tailor in gloucester  he sat in the window of a little shop in westgate street crosslegged on a table from morning till dark  all day long while the light lasted he sewed and snippeted piecing out his satin and pompadour and lutestring stuffs had strange names and were very expensive in the days of the tailor of gloucester  but although he sewed fine silk for his neighbours he himself was very very poora little old man in spectacles with a pinched face old crooked fingers and a suit of threadbare clothes  he cut his coats without waste according to his embroidered cloth they were very small ends and snippets that lay about upon the tabletoo narrow breadths for noughtexcept waistcoats for mice said the tailor  illustration  one bitter cold day near christmastime the tailor began to make a coata coat of cherrycoloured corded silk embroidered with pansies and roses and a cream coloured satin waistcoattrimmed with gauze and green worsted chenillefor the mayor of gloucester  illustration  the tailor worked and worked and he talked to himself he measured the silk and turned it round and round and trimmed it into shape with his shears the table was all littered with cherrycoloured snippets  no breadth at all and cut on the cross it is no breadth at all tippets for mice and ribbons for mobs for mice said the tailor of gloucester  when the snowflakes came down against the small leaded windowpanes and shut out the light the tailor had done his days work all the silk and satin lay cut out upon the table  illustration  there were twelve pieces for the coat and four pieces for the waistcoat and there were pocket flaps and cuffs and buttons all in order for the lining of the coat there was fine yellow taffeta and for the buttonholes of the waistcoat there was cherrycoloured twist and everything was ready to sew together in the morning all measured and sufficientexcept that there was wanting just one single skein of cherrycoloured twisted silk  the tailor came out of his shop at dark for he did not sleep there at nights he fastened the window and locked the door and took away the key no one lived there at night but little brown mice and they run in and out without any keys  illustration  for behind the wooden wainscots of all the old houses in gloucester there are little mouse staircases and secret trapdoors and the mice run from house to house through those long narrow passages they can run all over the town without going into the streets  but the tailor came out of his shop and shuffled home through the snow he lived quite near by in college court next the doorway to college green and although it was not a big house the tailor was so poor he only rented the kitchen  he lived alone with his cat it was called simpkin  illustration  now all day long while the tailor was out at work simpkin kept house by himself and he also was fond of the mice though he gave them no satin for coats  miaw said the cat when the tailor opened the door miaw  the tailor repliedsimpkin we shall make our fortune but i am worn to a ravelling take this groat which is our last fourpence and simpkin take a china pipkin buy a pennorth of bread a pennorth of milk and a pennorth of sausages and oh simpkin with the last penny of our fourpence buy me one pennorth of cherrycoloured silk but do not lose the last penny of the fourpence simpkin or i am undone and worn to a threadpaper for i have no more twist  illustration  then simpkin again said miaw and took the groat and the pipkin and went out into the dark  the tailor was very tired and beginning to be ill he sat down by the hearth and talked to himself about that wonderful coat  i shall make my fortuneto be cut biasthe mayor of gloucester is to be married on christmas day in the morning and he hath ordered a coat and an embroidered waistcoatto be lined with yellow taffetaand the taffeta sufficeth there is no more left over in snippets than will serve to make tippets for mice  then the tailor started for suddenly interrupting him from the dresser at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises  tip tap tip tap tip tap tip  now what can that be said the tailor of gloucester jumping up from his chair the dresser was covered with crockery and pipkins willow pattern plates and teacups and mugs  the tailor crossed the kitchen and stood quite still beside the dresser listening and peering through his spectacles again from under a teacup came those funny little noises  tip tap tip tap tip tap tip  this is very peculiar said the tailor of gloucester and he lifted up the teacup which was upside down  illustration  out stepped a little live lady mouse and made a curtsey to the tailor then she hopped away down off the dresser and under the wainscot  the tailor sat down again by the fire warming his poor cold hands and mumbling to himself  the waistcoat is cut out from peachcoloured satintambour stitch and rosebuds in beautiful floss silk was i wise to entrust my last fourpence to simpkin oneandtwenty buttonholes of cherrycoloured twist  but all at once from the dresser there came other little noises  tip tap tip tap tip tap tip  this is passing extraordinary said the tailor of gloucester and turned over another teacup which was upside down  illustration  out stepped a little gentleman mouse and made a bow to the tailor  and then from all over the dresser came a chorus of little tappings all sounding together and answering one another like watchbeetles in an old wormeaten windowshutter  tip tap tip tap tip tap tip  and out from under teacups and from under bowls and basins stepped other and more little mice who hopped away down off the dresser and under the wainscot  illustration  the tailor sat down close over the fire lamentingoneandtwenty buttonholes of cherrycoloured silk to be finished by noon of saturday and this is tuesday evening was it right to let loose those mice undoubtedly the property of simpkin alack i am undone for i have no more twist  the little mice came out again and listened to the tailor they took notice of the pattern of that wonderful coat they whispered to one another about the taffeta lining and about little mouse tippets  and then all at once they all ran away together down the passage behind the wainscot squeaking and calling to one another as they ran from house to house and not one mouse was left in the tailors kitchen when simpkin came back with the pipkin of milk  illustration  simpkin opened the door and bounced in with an angry grrmiaw like a cat that is vexed for he hated the snow and there was snow in his ears and snow in his collar at the back of his neck he put down the loaf and the sausages upon the dresser and sniffed  simpkin said the tailor where is my twist  but simpkin set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser and looked suspiciously at the teacups he wanted his supper of little fat mouse  simpkin said the tailor where is my twist  illustration  but simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the teapot and spit and growled at the tailor and if simpkin had been able to talk he would have asked where is my mouse  alack i am undone said the tailor of gloucester and went sadly to bed  all that night long simpkin hunted and searched through the kitchen peeping into cupboards and under the wainscot and into the teapot where he had hidden that twist but still he found never a mouse  whenever the tailor muttered and talked in his sleep simpkin said miawgerrwssch and made strange horrid noises as cats do at night  illustration  for the poor old tailor was very ill with a fever tossing and turning in his fourpost bed and still in his dreams he mumbledno more twist no more twist  all that day he was ill and the next day and the next and what should become of the cherrycoloured coat in the tailors shop in westgate street the embroidered silk and satin lay cut out upon the tableoneandtwenty buttonholesand who should come to sew them when the window was barred and the door was fast locked  but that does not hinder the little brown mice they run in and out without any keys through all the old houses in gloucester  illustration  out of doors the market folks went trudging through the snow to buy their geese and turkeys and to bake their christmas pies but there would be no christmas dinner for simpkin and the poor old tailor of gloucester  the tailor lay ill for three days and nights and then it was christmas eve and very late at night the moon climbed up over the roofs and chimneys and looked down over the gateway into college court there were no lights in the windows nor any sound in the houses all the city of gloucester was fast asleep under the snow  and still simpkin wanted his mice and he mewed as he stood beside the fourpost bed  illustration  but it is in the old story that all the beasts can talk in the night between christmas eve and christmas day in the morning though there are very few folk that can hear them or know what it is that they say  when the cathedral clock struck twelve there was an answerlike an echo of the chimesand simpkin heard it and came out of the tailors door and wandered about in the snow  from all the roofs and gables and old wooden houses in gloucester came a thousand merry voices singing the old christmas rhymesall the old songs that ever i heard of and some that i dont know like whittingtons bells  illustration  first and loudest the cocks cried out dame get up and bake your pies  oh dilly dilly dilly sighed simpkin  and now in a garret there were lights and sounds of dancing and cats came from over the way  hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle all the cats in gloucesterexcept me said simpkin  under the wooden eaves the starlings and sparrows sang of christmas pies the jackdaws woke up in the cathedral tower and although it was the middle of the night the throstles and robins sang the air was quite full of little twittering tunes  illustration  but it was all rather provoking to poor hungry simpkin  particularly he was vexed with some little shrill voices from behind a wooden lattice i think that they were bats because they always have very small voicesespecially in a black frost when they talk in their sleep like the tailor of gloucester  they said something mysterious that sounded like      buz quoth the blue fly hum quoth the bee      buz and hum they cry and so do we  and simpkin went away shaking his ears as if he had a bee in his bonnet  illustration  from the tailors shop in westgate came a glow of light and when simpkin crept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles there was a snippeting of scissors and snappeting of thread and little mouse voices sang loudly and gaily              fourandtwenty tailors              went to catch a snail              the best man amongst them              durst not touch her tail              she put out her horns              like a little kyloe cow     run tailors run or shell have you all een now  then without a pause the little mouse voices went on again      sieve my ladys oatmeal      grind my ladys flour      put it in a chestnut      let it stand an hour  illustration  mew mew interrupted simpkin and he scratched at the door but the key was under the tailors pillow he could not get in  the little mice only laughed and tried another tune      three little mice sat down to spin      pussy passed by and she peeped in      what are you at my fine little men      making coats for gentlemen      shall i come in and cut off your threads      oh no miss pussy youd bite off our heads  mew mew cried simpkin hey diddle dinketty answered the little mice      hey diddle dinketty poppetty pet      the merchants of london they wear scarlet      silk in the collar and gold in the hem      so merrily march the merchantmen  illustration  they clicked their thimbles to mark the time but none of the songs pleased simpkin he sniffed and mewed at the door of the shop      and then i bought      a pipkin and a popkin      a slipkin and a slopkin      all for one farthing  and upon the kitchen dresser added the rude little mice  mew scratch scratch scuffled simpkin on the windowsill while the little mice inside sprang to their feet and all began to shout at once in little twittering voices no more twist no more twist and they barred up the window shutters and shut out simpkin  but still through the nicks in the shutters he could hear the click of thimbles and little mouse voices singing  illustration  no more twist no more twist  simpkin came away from the shop and went home considering in his mind he found the poor old tailor without fever sleeping peacefully  then simpkin went on tiptoe and took a little parcel of silk out of the teapot and looked at it in the moonlight and he felt quite ashamed of his badness compared with those good little mice  when the tailor awoke in the morning the first thing which he saw upon the patchwork quilt was a skein of cherrycoloured twisted silk and beside his bed stood the repentant simpkin  illustration  alack i am worn to a ravelling said the tailor of gloucester but i have my twist  the sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed and came out into the street with simpkin running before him  the starlings whistled on the chimney stacks and the throstles and robins sangbut they sang their own little noises not the words they had sung in the night  alack said the tailor i have my twist but no more strengthnor timethan will serve to make me one single buttonhole for this is christmas day in the morning the mayor of gloucester shall be married by noonand where is his cherrycoloured coat  he unlocked the door of the little shop in westgate street and simpkin ran in like a cat that expects something  but there was no one there not even one little brown mouse  the boards were swept clean the little ends of thread and the little silk snippets were all tidied away and gone from off the floor  but upon the tableoh joy the tailor gave a shoutthere where he had left plain cuttings of silkthere lay the most beautifullest coat and embroidered satin waistcoat that ever were worn by a mayor of gloucester  illustration  there were roses and pansies upon the facings of the coat and the waistcoat was worked with poppies and cornflowers  illustration  everything was finished except just one single cherrycoloured buttonhole and where that buttonhole was wanting there was pinned a scrap of paper with these wordsin little teeny weeny writing                no more twist  and from then began the luck of the tailor of gloucester he grew quite stout and he grew quite rich  he made the most wonderful waistcoats for all the rich merchants of gloucester and for all the fine gentlemen of the country round  illustration  never were seen such ruffles or such embroidered cuffs and lappets but his buttonholes were the greatest triumph of it all  the stitches of those buttonholes were so neatso neati wonder how they could be stitched by an old man in spectacles with crooked old fingers and a tailors thimble  the stitches of those buttonholes were so smallso smallthey looked as if they had been made by little mice   the end
