90399212	the courtship of susan bell  by anthony trollope     john munroe bell had been a lawyer in albany state of new york and as such had thriven well  he had thriven well as long as thrift and thriving on this earth had been allowed to him  but the almighty had seen fit to shorten his span  early in life he had married a timid anxious pretty good little wife whose whole heart and mind had been given up to do his bidding and deserve his love  she had not only deserved it but had possessed it and as long as john munroe bell had lived henrietta bellhetta as he called herhad been a woman rich in blessings after twelve years of such blessings he had left her and had left with her two daughters a second hetta and the heroine of our little story susan bell  a lawyer in albany may thrive passing well for eight or ten years and yet not leave behind him any very large sum of money if he dies at the end of that time  some small modicum some few thousand dollars john bell had amassed so that his widow and daughters were not absolutely driven to look for work or bread  in those happy days when cash had begun to flow in plenteously to the young father of the family he had taken it into his head to build for himself or rather for his young female brood a small neat house in the outskirts of saratoga springs  in doing so he was instigated as much by the excellence of the investment for his pocket as by the salubrity of the place for his girls  he furnished the house well and then during some summer weeks his wife lived there and sometimes he let it  how the widow grieved when the lord of her heart and master of her mind was laid in the grave i need not tell  she had already counted ten years of widowhood and her children had grown to be young women beside her at the time of which i am now about to speak since that sad day on which they had left albany they had lived together at the cottage at the springs  in winter their life had been lonely enough but as soon as the hot weather began to drive the fainting citizens out from new york they had always received two or three boardersold ladies generally and occasionally an old gentlemanpersons of very steady habits with whose pockets the widows moderate demands agreed better than the hotel charges  and so the bells lived for ten years  that saratoga is a gay place in july august and september the world knows well enough  to girls who go there with trunks full of muslin and crinoline for whom a carriage and pair of horses is always waiting immediately after dinner whose fathers pockets are bursting with dollars it is a very gay place  dancing and flirtations come as a matter of course and matrimony follows after with only too great rapidity  but the place was not very gay for hetta or susan bell  in the first place the widow was a timid woman and among other fears feared greatly that she should be thought guilty of setting traps for husbands  poor mothers how often are they charged with this sin when their honest desires go no further than that their bairns may be respectit like the lave  and then she feared flirtations flirtations that should be that and nothing more flirtations that are so destructive of the hearts sweetest essence she feared love also though she longed for that as well as feared itfor her girls i mean all such feelings for herself were long laid under groundand then like a timid creature as she was she had other indefinite fears and among them a great fear that those girls of hers would be left husbandlessa phase of life which after her twelve years of bliss she regarded as anything but desirable  but the upshot wasthe upshot of so many fears and such small meansthat hetta and susan bell had but a dull life of it  were it not that i am somewhat closely restricted in the number of my pages i would describe at full the merits and beauties of hetta and susan bell  as it is i can but say a few words  at our period of their lives hetta was nearly oneandtwenty and susan was just nineteen  hetta was a short plump demure young woman with the softest smoothed hair and the brownest brightest eyes  she was very useful in the house good at corn cakes and thought much particularly in these latter months of her religious duties  her sister in the privacy of their own little room would sometimes twit her with the admiring patience with which she would listen to the lengthened eloquence of mr phineas beckard the baptist minister now mr phineas beckard was a bachelor  susan was not so good a girl in the kitchen or about the house as was her sister but she was bright in the parlour and if that motherly heart could have been made to give out its inmost secret which however it could not have been made to give out in any way painful to dear hettaperhaps it might have been found that susan was loved with the closest love  she was taller than her sister and lighter her eyes were blue as were her mothers her hair was brighter than hettas but not always so singularly neat  she had a dimple on her chin whereas hetta had none dimples on her cheeks too when she smiled and oh such a mouth  there my allowance of pages permits no more  one piercing cold winters day there came knocking at the widows doora young man  winter days when the ice of january is refrozen by the wind of february are very cold at saratoga springs  in these days there was not often much to disturb the serenity of mrs bells house but on the day in question there came knocking at the doora young man  mrs bell kept an old domestic who had lived with them in those happy albany days  her name was kate obrien but though picturesque in name she was hardly so in person  she was a thick set noisy goodnatured old irishwoman who had joined her lot to that of mrs bell when the latter first began housekeeping and knowing when she was well off had remained in the same place from that day forth  she had known hetta as a baby and so to say had seen susans birth  and what might you be wanting sir said kate obrien apparently not quite pleased as she opened the door and let in all the cold air  i wish to see mrs bell  is not this mrs bells house said the young man shaking the snow from out of the breast of his coat  he did see mrs bell and we will now tell who he was and why he had come and how it came to pass that his carpetbag was brought down to the widows house and one of the front bedrooms was prepared for him and that he drank tea that night in the widows parlour  his name was aaron dunn and by profession he was an engineer  what peculiar misfortune in those days of frost and snow had befallen the line of rails which runs from schenectady to lake champlain i never quite understood  banks and bridges had in some way come to grief and on aaron dunns shoulders was thrown the burden of seeing that they were duly repaired  saratoga springs was the centre of these mishaps and therefore at saratoga springs it was necessary that he should take up his temporary abode  now there was at that time in new york city a mr bell great in railway mattersan uncle of the once thriving but now departed albany lawyer  he was a rich man but he liked his riches himself or at any rate had not found himself called upon to share them with the widow and daughters of his nephew  but when it chanced to come to pass that he had a hand in despatching aaron dunn to saratoga he took the young man aside and recommended him to lodge with the widow  there said he show her my card  so much the rich uncle thought he might vouchsafe to do for the nephews widow  mrs bell and both her daughters were in the parlour when aaron dunn was shown in snow and all  he told his story in a rough shaky voice for his teeth chattered and he gave the card almost wishing that he had gone to the empty big hotel for the widows welcome was not at first quite warm  the widow listened to him as he gave his message and then she took the card and looked at it  hetta who was sitting on the side of the fireplace facing the door went on demurely with her work susan gave one glance roundher back was to the strangerand then another and then she moved her chair a little nearer to the wall so as to give the young man room to come to the fire if he would he did not come but his eyes glanced upon susan bell and he thought that the old man in new york was right and that the big hotel would be cold and dull  it was a pretty face to look on that cold evening as she turned it up from the stocking she was mending  perhaps you dont wish to take winter boarders maam said aaron dunn  we never have done so yet sir said mrs bell timidly  could she let this young wolf in among her lambfold  he might be a wolf who could tell  mr bell seemed to think it would suit said aaron  had he acquiesced in her timidity and not pressed the point it would have been all up with him  but the widow did not like to go against the big uncle and so she said perhaps it may sir  i guess it will finely said aaron  and then the widow seeing that the matter was so far settled put down her work and came round into the passage  hetta followed her for there would be housework to do  aaron gave himself another shake settled the weekly number of dollarswith very little difficulty on his part for he had caught another glance at susans face and then went after his bag twas thus that aaron dunn obtained an entrance into mrs bells house  but what if he be a wolf she said to herself over and over again that night though not exactly in those words  ay but there is another side to that question  what if he be a stalwart man honestminded with clever eye cunning hand ready brain broad back and warm heart in want of a wife mayhap a man that can earn his own bread and anothershalf a dozen others when the half dozen come  would not that be a good sort of lodger  such a question as that too did flit just flit across the widows sleepless mind  but then she thought so much more of the wolf wolves she had taught herself to think were more common than stalwart honestminded wifedesirous men  i wonder mother consented to take him said hetta when they were in the little room together  and why shouldnt she said susan  it will be a help  yes it will be a little help said hetta  but we have done very well hitherto without winter lodgers  but uncle bell said she was to  what is uncle bell to us said hetta who had a spirit of her own and she began to surmise within herself whether aaron dunn would join the baptist congregation and whether phineas beckard would approve of this new move  he is a very wellbehaved young man at any rate said susan and he draws beautifully  did you see those things he was doing  he draws very well i dare say said hetta who regarded this as but a poor warranty for good behaviour  hetta also had some fear of wolvesnot for herself perhaps but for her sister  aaron dunns workthe commencement of his worklay at some distance from the springs and he left every morning with a lot of workmen by an early trainalmost before daylight  and every morning cold and wintry as the mornings were the widow got him his breakfast with her own hands  she took his dollars and would not leave him altogether to the awkward mercies of kate obrien nor would she trust her girls to attend upon the young man  hetta she might have trusted but then susan would have asked why she was spared her share of such hardship  in the evening leaving his work when it was dark aaron always returned and then the evening was passed together  but they were passed with the most demure propriety  these women would make the tea cut the bread and butter and then sew while aaron dunn when the cups were removed would always go to his plans and drawings  on sundays they were more together but even on this day there was cause of separation for aaron went to the episcopalian church rather to the disgust of hetta  in the afternoon however they were together and then phineas beckard came in to tea on sundays and he and aaron got to talking on religion and though they disagreed pretty much and would not give an inch either one or the other nevertheless the minister told the widow and hetta too probably that the lad had good stuff in him though he was so stiffnecked  but he should be more modest in talking on such matters with a minister said hetta  the rev phineas acknowledged that perhaps he should but he was honest enough to repeat that the lad had stuff in him  perhaps after all he is not a wolf said the widow to herself  things went on in this way for above a month  aaron had declared to himself over and over again that that face was sweet to look upon and had unconsciously promised to himself certain delights in talking and perhaps walking with the owner of it  but the walkings had not been achievednor even the talkings as yet  the truth was that dunn was bashful with young women though he could be so stiff necked with the minister  and then he felt angry with himself inasmuch as he had advanced no further and as he lay in his bedwhich perhaps those pretty hands had helped to makehe resolved that he would be a thought bolder in his bearing  he had no idea of making love to susan bell of course not  but why should he not amuse himself by talking to a pretty girl when she sat so near him evening after evening  what a very quiet young man he is said susan to her sister  he has his bread to earn and sticks to his work said hetta  no doubt he has his amusement when he is in the city added the elder sister not wishing to leave too strong an impression of the young mans virtue  they had all now their settled places in the parlour  hetta sat on one side of the fire close to the table having that side to herself  there she sat always busy  she must have made every dress and bit of linen worn in the house and hemmed every sheet and towel so busy was she always  sometimes once in a week or so phineas beckard would come in and then place was made for him between hettas usual seat and the table  for when there he would read out loud  on the other side close also to the table sat the widow busy but not savagely busy as her elder daughter  between mrs bell and the wall with her feet ever on the fender susan used to sit not absolutely idle but doing work of some slender pretty sort and talking ever and anon to her mother  opposite to them all at the other side of the table far away from the fire would aaron dunn place himself with his plans and drawings before him  are you a judge of bridges maam said aaron the evening after he had made his resolution  twas thus he began his courtship  of bridges said mrs belloh dear no sir  but she put out her hand to take the little drawing which aaron handed to her  because thats one ive planned for our bit of a new branch from moreau up to lake george  i guess miss susan knows something about bridges  i guess i dont said susanonly that they oughtnt to tumble down when the frost comes  ha ha ha no more they ought  ill tell mcevoy that  mcevoy had been a former engineer on the line  well that wont burst with any frost i guess  oh my how pretty said the widow and then susan of course jumped up to look over her mothers shoulder  the artful dodger he had drawn and coloured a beautiful little sketch of a bridge not an engineers plan with sections and measurements vexatious to a womans eye but a graceful little bridge with a string of cars running under it  you could almost hear the bell going  well that is a pretty bridge said susan  isnt it hetta  i dont know anything about bridges said hetta to whose clever eyes the dodge was quite apparent  but in spite of her cleverness mrs bell and susan had soon moved their chairs round to the table and were looking through the contents of aarons portfolio  but yet he may be a wolf thought the poor widow just as she was kneeling down to say her prayers  that evening certainly made a commencement  though hetta went on pertinaciously with the body of a new dress the other two ladies did not put in another stitch that night  from his drawings aaron got to his instruments and before bedtime was teaching susan how to draw parallel lines  susan found that she had quite an aptitude for parallel lines and altogether had a good time of it that evening it is dull to go on week after week and month after month talking only to ones mother and sister  it is dull though one does not oneself recognise it to be so  a little change in such matters is so very pleasant  susan had not the slightest idea of regarding aaron as even a possible lover  but young ladies do like the conversation of young gentlemen  oh my exceedingly proper prim old lady you who are so shocked at this as a general doctrine has it never occurred to you that the creator has so intended it  susan understanding little of the how and why knew that she had had a good time and was rather in spirits as she went to bed  but hetta had been frightened by the dodge  oh hetta you should have looked at those drawings  he is so clever said susan  i dont know that they would have done me much good replied hetta  good  well theyd do me more good than a long sermon i know said susan except on a sunday of course she added apologetically  this was an illtempered attack both on hetta and hettas admirer  but then why had hetta been so snappish  im sure hes a wolf thought hetta as she went to bed  what a very clever young man he is thought susan to herself as she pulled the warm clothes round about her shoulders and ears  well that certainly was an improvement thought aaron as he went through the same operation with a stronger feeling of self approbation than he had enjoyed for some time past  in the course of the next fortnight the family arrangements all altered themselves  unless when beckard was there aaron would sit in the widows place the widow would take susans chair and the two girls would be opposite  and then dunn would read to them not sermons but passages from shakspeare and byron and longfellow he reads much better than mr beckard susan had said one night of course youre a competent judge had been hettas retort  i mean that i like it better said susan  its well that all people dont think alike replied hetta  and then there was a deal of talking  the widow herself as unconscious in this respect as her youngest daughter certainly did find that a little variety was agreeable on those long winter nights and talked herself with unaccustomed freedom  and beckard came there oftener and talked very much  when he was there the two young men did all the talking and they pounded each other immensely  but still there grew up a sort of friendship between them  mr beckard seems quite to take to him said mrs bell to her eldest daughter  it is his great good nature mother replied hetta  it was at the end of the second month when aaron took another step in advancea perilous step  sometimes on evenings he still went on with his drawing for an hour or so but during three or four evenings he never asked any one to look at what he was doing  on one friday he sat over his work till late without any reading or talking at all so late that at last mrs bell said if youre going to sit much longer mr dunn ill get you to put out the candles  thereby showing had he known it or had she that the mothers confidence in the young man was growing fast  hetta knew all about it and dreaded that the growth was too quick  ive finished now said aaron and he looked carefully at the cardboard on which he had been washing in his watercolours  ive finished now  he then hesitated a moment but ultimately he put the card into his portfolio and carried it up to his bedroom  who does not perceive that it was intended as a present to susan bell  the question which aaron asked himself that night and which he hardly knew how to answer was this  should he offer the drawing to susan in the presence of her mother and sister or on some occasion when they two might be alone together  no such occasion had ever yet occurred but aaron thought that it might probably be brought about  but then he wanted to make no fuss about it  his first intention had been to chuck the drawing lightly across the table when it was completed and so make nothing of it  but he had finished it with more care than he had at first intended and then he had hesitated when he had finished it  it was too late now for that plan of chucking it over the table  on the saturday evening when he came down from his room mr beckard was there and there was no opportunity that night  on the sunday in conformity with a previous engagement he went to hear mr beckard preach and walked to and from meeting with the family this pleased mrs bell and they were all very gracious that afternoon  but sunday was no day for the picture  on monday the thing had become of importance to him  things always do when they are kept over  before tea that evening when he came down mrs bell and susan only were in the room  he knew hetta for his foe and therefore determined to use this occasion  miss susan he said stammering somewhat and blushing too poor fool  i have done a little drawing which i want you to accept and he put his portfolio down on the table  oh  i dont know said susan who had seen the blush  mrs bell had seen the blush also and pursed her mouth up and looked grave  had there been no stammering and no blush she might have thought nothing of it  aaron saw at once that his little gift was not to go down smoothly he was however in for it now so he picked it out from among the other papers in the case and brought it over to susan  he endeavoured to hand it to her with an air of indifference but i cannot say that he succeeded  it was a very pretty wellfinished watercoloured drawing representing still the same bridge but with more adjuncts  in susans eyes it was a work of high art  of pictures probably she had seen but little and her liking for the artist no doubt added to her admiration  but the more she admired it and wished for it the stronger was her feeling that she ought not to take it  poor susan she stood for a minute looking at the drawing but she said nothing not even a word of praise  she felt that she was red in the face and uncourteous to their lodger but her mother was looking at her and she did not know how to behave herself  mrs bell put out her hand for the sketch trying to bethink herself as she did so in what least uncivil way she could refuse the present  she took a moment to look at it collecting her thoughts and as she did so her womans wit came to her aid  oh dear mr dunn it is very pretty quite a beautiful picture  i cannot let susan rob you of that  you must keep that for some of your own particular friends  but i did it for her said aaron innocently  susan looked down at the ground half pleased at the declaration the drawing would look very pretty in a small gilt frame put over her dressingtable  but the matter now was altogether in her mothers hands  i am afraid it is too valuable sir for susan to accept  it is not valuable at all said aaron declining to take it back from the widows hand  oh i am quite sure it is  it is worth ten dollars at leastor twenty said poor mrs bell not in the very best taste  but she was perplexed and did not know how to get out of the scrape  the article in question now lay upon the tablecloth appropriated by no one and at this moment hetta came into the room  it is not worth ten cents said aaron with something like a frown on his brow  but as we had been talking about the bridge i thought miss susan would accept it  accept what said hetta  and then her eye fell upon the drawing and she took it up  it is beautifully done said mrs bell wishing much to soften the matter perhaps the more so that hetta the demure was now present i am telling mr dunn that we cant take a present of anything so valuable  oh dear no said hetta  it wouldnt be right  it was a cold frosty evening in march and the fire was burning brightly on the hearth  aaron dunn took up the drawing quietly very quietlyand rolling it up as such drawings are rolled put it between the blazing logs  it was the work of four evenings and his chefdoeuvre in the way of art  susan when she saw what he had done burst out into tears  the widow could very readily have done so also but she was able to refrain herself and merely exclaimedoh mr dunn  if mr dunn chooses to burn his own picture he has certainly a right to do so said hetta  aaron immediately felt ashamed of what he had done and he also could have cried but for his manliness  he walked away to one of the parlourwindows and looked out upon the frosty night  it was dark but the stars were bright and he thought that he should like to be walking fast by himself along the line of rails towards balston  there he stood perhaps for three minutes  he thought it would be proper to give susan time to recover from her tears  will you please to come to your tea sir said the soft voice of mrs bell  he turned round to do so and found that susan was gone  it was not quite in her power to recover from her tears in three minutes  and then the drawing had been so beautiful  it had been done expressly for her too  and there had been something she knew not what in his eye as he had so declared  she had watched him intently over those four evenings work wondering why he did not show it till her feminine curiosity had become rather strong  it was something very particular she was sure and she had learned that all that precious work had been for her  now all that precious work was destroyed  how was it possible that she should not cry for more than three minutes  the others took their meal in perfect silence and when it was over the two women sat down to their work  aaron had a book which he pretended to read but instead of reading he was bethinking himself that he had behaved badly  what right had he to throw them all into such confusion by indulging in his passion  he was ashamed of what he had done and fancied that susan would hate him  fancying that he began to find at the same time that he by no means hated her  at last hetta got up and left the room  she knew that her sister was sitting alone in the cold and hetta was affectionate  susan had not been in fault and therefore hetta went up to console her  mrs bell said aaron as soon as the door was closed i beg your pardon for what i did just now  oh sir im so sorry that the picture is burnt said poor mrs bell  the picture does not matter a straw said aaron  but i see that i have disturbed you alland i am afraid i have made miss susan unhappy  she was grieved because your picture was burnt said mrs bell putting some emphasis on the your intending to show that her daughter had not regarded the drawing as her own  but the emphasis bore another meaning and so the widow perceived as soon as she had spoken  oh i can do twenty more of the same if anybody wanted them said aaron  if i do another like it will you let her take it mrs belljust to show that you have forgiven me and that we are friends as we were before  was he or was he not a wolf  that was the question which mrs bell scarcely knew how to answer  hetta had given her voice saying he was lupine  mr beckards opinion she had not liked to ask directly  mr beckard she thought would probably propose to hetta but as yet he had not done so  and as he was still a stranger in the family she did not like in any way to compromise susans name indirectly she had asked the question and indirectly also mr beckards answer had been favourable  but it mustnt mean anything sir was the widows weak answer when she had paused on the question for a moment  oh no of course not said aaron joyously and his face became radiant and happy  and i do beg your pardon for burning it and the young ladies pardon too  and then he rapidly got out his cardboard and set himself to work about another bridge  the widow meditating many things in her heart commenced the hemming of a handkerchief  in about an hour the two girls came back to the room and silently took their accustomed places  aaron hardly looked up but went on diligently with his drawing  this bridge should be a better bridge than that other  its acceptance was now assured  of course it was to mean nothing  that was a matter of course  so he worked away diligently and said nothing to anybody  when they went off to bed the two girls went into the mothers room oh mother i hope he is not very angry said susan  angry said hetta if anybody should be angry it is mother  he ought to have known that susan could not accept it  he should never have offered it  but hes doing another said mrs bell  not for her said hetta  yes he is said mrs bell and i have promised that she shall take it  susan as she heard this sank gently into the chair behind her and her eyes became full of tears  the intimation was almost too much for her  oh mother said hetta  but i particularly said that it was to mean nothing  oh mother that makes it worse  why should hetta interfere in this way thought susan to herself had she interfered when mr beckard gave hetta a testament bound in morocco had not she smiled and looked gratified and kissed her sister and declared that phineas beckard was a nice dear man and by far the most elegant preacher at the springs  why should hetta be so cruel  i dont see that my dear said the mother  hetta would not explain before her sister so they all went to bed  on the thursday evening the drawing was finished  not a word had been said about it at any rate in his presence and he had gone on working in silence  there said he late on the thursday evening i dont know that it will be any better if i go on daubing for another hour  there miss susan theres another bridge  i hope that will neither burst with the frost nor yet be destroyed by fire and he gave it a light flip with his fingers and sent it skimming over the table  susan blushed and smiled and took it up  oh it is beautiful she said  isnt it beautifully done mother and then all the three got up to look at it and all confessed that it was excellently done  and i am sure we are very much obliged to you said susan after a pause remembering that she had not yet thanked him  oh its nothing said he not quite liking the word we  on the following day he returned from his work to saratoga about noon this he had never done before and therefore no one expected that he would be seen in the house before the evening  on this occasion however he went straight thither and as chance would have it both the widow and her elder daughter were out  susan was there alone in charge of the house  he walked in and opened the parlour door  there she sat with her feet on the fender with her work unheeded on the table behind her and the picture aarons drawing lying on her knees  she was gazing at it intently as he entered thinking in her young heart that it possessed all the beauties which a picture could possess  oh mr dunn she said getting up and holding the telltale sketch behind the skirt of her dress  miss susan i have come here to tell your mother that i must start for new york this afternoon and be there for six weeks or perhaps longer  mother is out said she im so sorry  is she said aaron  and hetta too  dear me  and youll be wanting dinner  ill go and see about it  aaron began to swear that he could not possibly eat any dinner  he had dined once and was going to dine againanything to keep her from going  but you must have something mr dunn and she walked towards the door  but he put his back to it  miss susan said he i guess ive been here nearly two months  yes sir i believe you have she replied shaking in her shoes and not knowing which way to look  and i hope we have been good friends  yes sir said susan almost beside herself as to what she was saying  im going away now and it seems to be such a time before ill be back  will it sir  six weeks miss susan and then he paused looking into her eyes to see what he could read there  she leant against the table pulling to pieces a morsel of halfravelled muslin which she held in her hand but her eyes were turned to the ground and he could hardly see them  miss susan he continued i may as well speak out now as at another time  he too was looking towards the ground and clearly did not know what to do with his hands  the truth is just this ii love you dearly with all my heart  i never saw any one i ever thought so beautiful so nice and so goodand whats more i never shall  im not very good at this sort of thing i know but i couldnt go away from saratoga for six weeks and not tell you  and then he ceased  he did not ask for any love in return  his presumption had not got so far as that yet  he merely declared his passion leaning against the door and there he stood twiddling his thumbs  susan had not the slightest conception of the way in which she ought to receive such a declaration  she had never had a lover before nor had she ever thought of aaron absolutely as a lover though something very like love for him had been crossing over her spirit now at this moment she felt that he was the beauideal of manhood though his boots were covered with the railway mud and though his pantaloons were tucked up in rolls round his ankles  he was a fine wellgrown openfaced fellow whose eye was bold and yet tender whose brow was full and broad and all his bearing manly  love him of course she loved him  why else had her heart melted with pleasure when her mother said that that second picture was to be accepted  but what was she to say  anything but the open truth she well knew that  the open truth would not do at all  what would her mother say and hetta if she were rashly to say that  hetta she knew would be dead against such a lover and of her mothers approbation she had hardly more hope  why they should disapprove of aaron as a lover she had never asked herself  there are many nice things that seem to be wrong only because they are so nice  maybe that susan regarded a lover as one of them  oh mr dunn you shouldnt that in fact was all that she could say  should not i said he  well perhaps not but theres the truth and no harm ever comes of that  perhaps id better not ask you for an answer now but i thought it better you should know it all  and remember thisi only care for one thing now in the world and that is for your love  and then he paused thinking possibly that in spite of what he had said he might perhaps get some sort of an answer some inkling of the state of her hearts disposition towards him  but susan had at once resolved to take him at his word when he suggested that an immediate reply was not necessary  to say that she loved him was of course impossible and to say that she did not was equally so  she determined therefore to close at once with the offer of silence  when he ceased speaking there was a moments pause during which he strove hard to read what might be written on her downturned face but he was not good at such reading  well i guess ill go and get my things ready now he said and then turned round to open the door  mother will be in before you are gone i suppose said susan  i have only got twenty minutes said he looking at his watch but susan tell her what i have said to you  goodbye  and he put out his hand  he knew he should see her again but this had been his plan to get her hand in his  goodbye mr dunn and she gave him her hand  he held it tight for a moment so that she could not draw it away could not if she would  will you tell your mother he asked  yes she answered quite in a whisper  i guess id better tell her  and then she gave a long sigh  he pressed her hand again and got it up to his lips  mr dunn dont she said  but he did kiss it  god bless you my own dearest dearest girl  ill just open the door as i come down  perhaps mrs bell will be here  and then he rushed up stairs  but mrs bell did not come in  she and hetta were at a weekly service at mr beckards meetinghouse and mr beckard it seemed had much to say  susan when left alone sat down and tried to think  but she could not think she could only love  she could use her mind only in recounting to herself the perfections of that demigod whose heavy steps were so audible overhead as he walked to and fro collecting his things and putting them into his bag  and then just when he had finished she bethought herself that he must be hungry  she flew to the kitchen but she was too late before she could even reach at the loaf of bread he descended the stairs with a clattering noise and heard her voice as she spoke quickly to kate obrien  miss susan he said dont get anything for me for im off  oh mr dunn i am so sorry  youll be so hungry on your journey and she came out to him in the passage  i shall want nothing on the journey dearest if youll say one kind word to me  again her eyes went to the ground  what do you want me to say mr dunn  say god bless you aaron  god bless you aaron said she and yet she was sure that she had not declared her love  he however thought otherwise and went up to new york with a happy heart  things happened in the next fortnight rather quickly  susan at once resolved to tell her mother but she resolved also not to tell hetta  that afternoon she got her mother to herself in mrs bells own room and then she made a clean breast of it  and what did you say to him susan  i said nothing mother  nothing dear  no mother not a word  he told me he didnt want it  she forgot how she had used his christian name in bidding god bless him  oh dear said the widow  was it very wrong asked susan  but what do you think yourself my child asked mrs bell after a while  what are your own feelings  mrs bell was sitting on a chair and susan was standing opposite to her against the post of the bed  she made no answer but moving from her place she threw herself into her mothers arms and hid her face on her mothers shoulder  it was easy enough to guess what were her feelings  but my darling said her mother you must not think that it is an engagement  no said susan sorrowfully  young men say those things to amuse themselves  wolves she would have said had she spoken out her mind freely  oh mother he is not like that  the daughter contrived to extract a promise from the mother that hetta should not be told just at present  mrs bell calculated that she had six weeks before her as yet mr beckard had not spoken out but there was reason to suppose that he would do so before those six weeks would be over and then she would be able to seek counsel from him  mr beckard spoke out at the end of six days and hetta frankly accepted him  i hope youll love your brotherinlaw said she to susan  oh i will indeed said susan and in the softness of her heart at the moment she almost made up her mind to tell but hetta was full of her own affairs and thus it passed off  it was then arranged that hetta should go and spend a week with mr beckards parents  old mr beckard was a farmer living near utica and now that the match was declared and approved it was thought well that hetta should know her future husbands family  so she went for a week and mr beckard went with her  he will be back in plenty of time for me to speak to him before aaron dunns six weeks are over said mrs bell to herself  but things did not go exactly as she expected  on the very morning after the departure of the engaged couple there came a letter from aaron saying that he would be at saratoga that very evening  the railway people had ordered him down again for some days special work then he was to go elsewhere and not to return to saratoga till june  but he hoped so said the letter that mrs bell would not turn him into the street even then though the summer might have come and her regular lodgers might be expected  oh dear oh dear said mrs bell to herself reflecting that she had no one of whom she could ask advice and that she must decide that very day  why had she let mr beckard go without telling him then she told susan and susan spent the day trembling  perhaps thought mrs bell he will say nothing about it  in such case however would it not be her duty to say something  poor mother she trembled nearly as much as susan  it was dark when the fatal knock came at the door  the teathings were already laid and the teacake was already baked for it would at any rate be necessary to give mr dunn his tea  susan when she heard the knock rushed from her chair and took refuge up stairs the widow gave a long sigh and settled her dress  kate obrien with willing step opened the door and bade her old friend welcome  how are the ladies asked aaron trying to gather something from the face and voice of the domestic  miss hetta and mr beckard be gone off to utica just manandwife like and so they are more power to them  oh indeed im very glad said aaronand so he was very glad to have hetta the demure out of the way  and then he made his way into the parlour doubting much and hoping much  mrs bell rose from her chair and tried to look grave  aaron glancing round the room saw that susan was not there  he walked straight up to the widow and offered her his hand which she took it might be that susan had not thought fit to tell and in such case it would not be right for him to compromise her so he said never a word  but the subject was too important to the mother to allow of her being silent when the young man stood before her  oh mr dunn said she what is this you have been saying to susan  i have asked her to be my wife said he drawing himself up and looking her full in the face  mrs bells heart was almost as soft as her daughters and it was nearly gone but at the moment she had nothing to say but oh dear oh dear  may i not call you mother said he taking both her hands in his  oh dearoh dear  but will you be good to her  oh aaron dunn if you deceive my child  in another quarter of an hour susan was kneeling at her mothers knee with her face on her mothers lap the mother was wiping tears out of her eyes and aaron was standing by holding one of the widows hands  you are my mother too now said he  what would hetta and mr beckard say when they came back  but then he surely was not a wolf  there were four or five days left for courtship before hetta and mr beckard would return four or five days during which susan might be happy aaron triumphant and mrs bell nervous  days i have said but after all it was only the evenings that were so left  every morning susan got up to give aaron his breakfast but mrs bell got up also  susan boldly declared her right to do so and mrs bell found no objection which she could urge  but after that aaron was always absent till seven or eight in the evening when he would return to his tea  then came the hour or two of lovers intercourse  but they were very tame those hours  the widow still felt an undefined fear that she was wrong and though her heart yearned to know that her daughter was happy in the sweet happiness of accepted love yet she dreaded to be too confident  not a word had been said about money matters not a word of aaron dunns relatives  so she did not leave them by themselves but waited with what patience she could for the return of her wise counsellors  and then susan hardly knew how to behave herself with her accepted suitor  she felt that she was very happy but perhaps she was most happy when she was thinking about him through the long day assisting in fixing little things for his comfort and waiting for his evening return  and as he sat there in the parlour she could be happy then too if she were but allowed to sit still and look at himnot stare at him but raise her eyes every now and again to his face for the shortest possible glance as she had been used to do ever since he came there  but he unconscionable lover wanted to hear her speak was desirous of being talked to and perhaps thought that he should by rights be allowed to sit by her and hold her hand  no such privileges were accorded to him  if they had been alone together walking side by side on the green turf as lovers should walk she would soon have found the use of her tonguehave talked fast enough no doubt under such circumstances when a girls shyness has given way to real intimacy there is in general no end to her power of chatting but though there was much love between aaron and susan there was as yet but little intimacy  and then let a mother be ever so motherlyand no mother could have more of a mothers tenderness than mrs bellstill her presence must be a restraint  aaron was very fond of mrs bell but nevertheless he did sometimes wish that some domestic duty would take her out of the parlour for a few happy minutes  susan went out very often but mrs bell seemed to be a fixture  once for a moment he did find his love alone immediately as he came into the house  my own susan you do love me do say so to me once  and he contrived to slip his arm round her waist  yes she whispered but she slipped like an eel from his hands and left him only preparing himself for a kiss  and then when she got to her room half frightened she clasped her hands together and bethought herself that she did really love him with a strength and depth of love which filled her whole existence  why could she not have told him something of all this  and so the few days of his second sojourn at saratoga passed away not altogether satisfactorily  it was settled that he should return to new york on saturday night leaving saratoga on that evening and as the beckardshetta was already regarded quite as a beckardwere to be back to dinner on that day mrs bell would have an opportunity of telling her wondrous tale  it might be well that mr beckard should see aaron before his departure  on that saturday the beckards did arrive just in time for dinner it may be imagined that susans appetite was not very keen nor her manner very collected  but all this passed by unobserved in the importance attached to the various beckard arrangements which came under discussion  ladies and gentlemen circumstanced as were hetta and mr beckard are perhaps a little too apt to think that their own affairs are paramount  but after dinner susan vanished at once and when hetta prepared to follow her desirous of further talk about matrimonial arrangements her mother stopped her and the disclosure was made  proposed to her said hetta who perhaps thought that one marriage in a family was enough at a time  yes my loveand he did it i must say in a very honourable way telling her not to make any answer till she had spoken to menow that was very nice was it not phineas  mrs bell had become very anxious that aaron should not be voted a wolf  and what has been said to him since asked the discreet phineas  whynothing absolutely decisive  oh mrs bell  you see i know nothing as to his means  nothing at all said hetta  he is a man that will always earn his bread said mr beckard and mrs bell blessed him in her heart for saying it  but has he been encouraged asked hetta  well yes he has said the widow  then susan i suppose likes him asked phineas  well yes she does said the widow  and the conference ended in a resolution that phineas beckard should have a conversation with aaron dunn as to his worldly means and position and that he phineas should decide whether aaron might or might not be at once accepted as a lover according to the tenor of that conversation poor susan was not told anything of all this  better not said hetta the demure  it will only flurry her the more  how would she have liked it if without consulting her they had left it to aaron to decide whether or no she might marry phineas  they knew where on the works aaron was to be found and thither mr beckard rode after dinner  we need not narrate at length the conference between the young men  aaron at once declared that he had nothing but what he made as an engineer and explained that he held no permanent situation on the line  he was well paid at that present moment but at the end of summer he would have to look for employment  then you can hardly marry quite at present said the discreet minister  perhaps not quite immediately  and long engagements are never wise said the other  three or four months suggested aaron  but mr beckard shook his head  the afternoon at mrs bells house was melancholy  the final decision of the three judges was as follows  there was to be no engagement of course no correspondence  aaron was to be told that it would be better that he should get lodgings elsewhere when he returned but that he would be allowed to visit at mrs bells houseand at mrs beckards which was very considerate  if he should succeed in getting a permanent appointment and if he and susan still held the same mind why thenc c  such was susans fate as communicated to her by mrs bell and hetta  she sat still and wept when she heard it but she did not complain  she had always felt that hetta would be against her  maynt i see him then she said through her tears  hetta thought she had better not  mrs bell thought she might phineas decided that they might shake hands but only in full conclave  there was to be no lovers farewell  aaron was to leave the house at halfpast five but before he went susan should be called down  poor susan  she sat down and bemoaned herself uncomplaining but very sad  susan was soft feminine and manageable  but aaron dunn was not very soft was especially masculine and in some matters not easily manageable  when mr beckard in the widows presencehetta had retired in obedience to her loverinformed him of the courts decision there came over his face the look which he had worn when he burned the picture  mrs bell he said had encouraged his engagement and he did not understand why other people should now come and disturb it  not an engagement aaron said mrs bell piteously  he was able and willing to work he said and knew his profession  what young man of his age had done better than he had and he glanced round at them with perhaps more pride than was quite becoming  then mr beckard spoke out very wisely no doubt but perhaps a little too much at length  sons and daughters as well as fathers and mothers will know very well what he said so i need not repeat his words  i cannot say that aaron listened with much attention but he understood perfectly what the upshot of it was  many a man understands the purport of many a sermon without listening to one word in ten  mr beckard meant to be kind in his manner indeed was so only that aaron could not accept as kindness any interference on his part  ill tell you what mrs bell said he  i look upon myself as engaged to her  and i look on her as engaged to me  i tell you so fairly and i believe thats her mind as well as mine  but aaron you wont try to see heror to write to hernot in secret will you  when i try to see her ill come and knock at this door and if i write to her ill write to her full address by the post  i never did and never will do anything in secret  i know youre good and honest said the widow with her handkerchief to her eyes  then why do you separate us asked he almost roughly  i suppose i may see her at any rate before i go  my times nearly up now i guess  and then susan was called for and she and hetta came down together susan crept in behind her sister  her eyes were red with weeping and her appearance was altogether disconsolate  she had had a lover for a week and now she was to be robbed of him  goodbye susan said aaron and he walked up to her without bashfulness or embarrassment  had they all been compliant and gracious to him he would have been as bashful as his love but now his temper was hot  goodbye susan and she took his hand and he held hers till he had finished  and remember this i look upon you as my promised wife and i dont fear that youll deceive me at any rate i shant deceive you  goodbye aaron she sobbed  goodbye and god bless you my own darling  and then without saying a word to any one else he turned his back upon them and went his way  there had been something very consolatory very sweet to the poor girl in her lovers last words  and yet they had almost made her tremble  he had been so bold and stern and confident  he had seemed so utterly to defy the impregnable discretion of mr beckard so to despise the demure propriety of hetta  but of this she felt sure when she came to question her heart that she could never never never cease to love him better than all the world beside she would waitpatiently if she could find patienceand then if he deserted her she would die  in another month hetta became mrs beckard  susan brisked up a little for the occasion and looked very pretty as bridesmaid  she was serviceable too in arranging household matters hemming linen and sewing tablecloths though of course in these matters she did not do a tenth of what hetta did  then the summer came the saratoga summer of july august and september during which the widows house was full and susans hands saved the pain of her heart for she was forced into occupation  now that hetta was gone to her own duties it was necessary that susans part in the household should be more prominent  aaron did not come back to his work at saratoga  why he did not they could not then learn  during the whole long summer they heard not a word of him nor from him and then when the cold winter months came and their boarders had left them mrs beckard congratulated her sister in that she had given no further encouragement to a lover who cared so little for her  this was very hard to bear  but susan did bear it  that winter was very sad  they learned nothing of aaron dunn till about january and then they heard that he was doing very well  he was engaged on the erie trunk line was paid highly and was much esteemed  and yet he neither came nor sent  he has an excellent situation their informant told them  and a permanent one asked the widow  oh yes no doubt said the gentleman for i happen to know that they count greatly on him  and yet he sent no word of love  after that the winter became very sad indeed  mrs bell thought it to be her duty now to teach her daughter that in all probability she would see aaron dunn no more  it was open to him to leave her without being absolutely a wolf  he had been driven from the house when he was poor and they had no right to expect that he would return now that he had made some rise in the world  men do amuse themselves in that way the widow tried to teach her  he is not like that mother she said again  but they do not think so much of these things as we do urged the mother  dont they said susan oh so sorrowfully and so through the whole long winter months she became paler and paler and thinner and thinner  and then hetta tried to console her with religion and that perhaps did not make things any better  religious consolation is the best cure for all griefs but it must not be looked for specially with regard to any individual sorrow  a religious man should he become bankrupt through the misfortunes of the world will find true consolation in his religion even for that sorrow  but a bankrupt who has not thought much of such things will hardly find solace by taking up religion for that special occasion  and hetta perhaps was hardly prudent in her attempts  she thought that it was wicked in susan to grow thin and pale for love of aaron dunn and she hardly hid her thoughts  susan was not sure but that it might be wicked but this doubt in no way tended to make her plump or rosy  so that in those days she found no comfort in her sister  but her mothers pity and soft love did ease her sufferings though it could not make them cease  her mother did not tell her that she was wicked or bid her read long sermons or force her to go oftener to the meetinghouse  he will never come again i think she said one day as with a shawl wrapped around her shoulders she leant with her head upon her mothers bosom  my own darling said the mother pressing her child closely to her side  you think he never will eh mother  what could mrs bell say in her heart of hearts she did not think he ever would come again  no my child  i do not think he will  and then the hot tears ran down and the sobs came thick and frequent  my darling my darling exclaimed the mother and they wept together  was i wicked to love him at the first she asked that night  no my child you were not wicked at all  at least i think not  then why  why was he sent away  it was on her tongue to ask that question but she paused and spared her mother  this was as they were going to bed  the next morning susan did not get up  she was not ill she said but weak and weary  would her mother let her lie that day  and then mrs bell went down alone to her room and sorrowed with all her heart for the sorrow of her child  why oh why had she driven away from her doorsill the love of an honest man  on the next morning susan again did not get upnor did she hear or if she heard she did not recognise the step of the postman who brought a letter to the door  early before the widows breakfast the postman came and the letter which he brought was as follows   my dear mrs bell  i have now got a permanent situation on the erie line and the salary is enough for myself and a wife  at least i think so and i hope you will too  i shall be down at saratoga tomorrow evening and i hope neither susan nor you will refuse to receive me  yours affectionately  aaron dunn   that was all  it was very short and did not contain one word of love but it made the widows heart leap for joy  she was rather afraid that aaron was angry he wrote so curtly and with such a brusque businesslike attention to mere facts but surely he could have but one object in coming there  and then he alluded specially to a wife  so the widows heart leapt with joy  but how was she to tell susan  she ran up stairs almost breathless with haste to the bedroom door but then she stopped too much joy she had heard was as dangerous as too much sorrow she must think it over for a while and so she crept back again  but after breakfastthat is when she had sat for a while over her teacupshe returned to the room and this time she entered it  the letter was in her hand but held so as to be hiddenin her left hand as she sat down with her right arm towards the invalid  susan dear she said and smiled at her child youll be able to get up this morning eh dear  yes mother said susan thinking that her mother objected to this idleness of her lying in bed  and so she began to bestir herself  i dont mean this very moment love  indeed i want to sit with you for a little while and she put her right arm affectionately round her daughters waist  dearest mother said susan  ah theres one dearer than me i guess and mrs bell smiled sweetly as she made the maternal charge against her daughter  susan raised herself quickly in the bed and looked straight into her mothers face  mother mother she said what is it  youve something to tell  oh mother  and stretching herself over she struck her hand against the corner of aarons letter  mother youve a letter  is he coming mother and with eager eyes and open lips she sat up holding tight to her mothers arm  yes love  i have got a letter  is heis he coming  how the mother answered i can hardly tell but she did answer and they were soon lying in each others arms warm with each others tears  it was almost hard to say which was the happier  aaron was to be there that eveningthat very evening  oh mother let me get up said susan  but mrs bell said no not yet her darling was pale and thin and she almost wished that aaron was not coming for another week  what if he should come and look at her and finding her beauty gone vanish again and seek a wife elsewhere  so susan lay in bed thinking of her happiness dozing now and again and fearing as she waked that it was a dream looking constantly at that drawing of his which she kept outside upon the bed nursing her love and thinking of it and endeavouring vainly endeavouring to arrange what she would say to him  mother she said when mrs bell once went up to her you wont tell hetta and phineas will you  not today i mean  mrs bell agreed that it would be better not to tell them  perhaps she thought that she had already depended too much on hetta and phineas in the matter  susans finery in the way of dress had never been extensive and now lately in these last sad winter days she had thought but little of the fashion of her clothes  but when she began to dress herself for the evening she did ask her mother with some anxiety what she had better wear  if he loves you he will hardly see what you have on said the mother  but not the less was she careful to smooth her daughters hair and make the most that might be made of those faded roses  how susans heart beathow both their hearts beat as the hands of the clock came round to seven  and then sharp at seven came the knock that same short bold ringing knock which susan had so soon learned to know as belonging to aaron dunn  oh mother i had better go up stairs she cried starting from her chair  no dear you would only be more nervous  i will mother  no no dear you have not time and then aaron dunn was in the room  she had thought much what she would say to him but had not yet quite made up her mind  it mattered however but very little  on whatever she might have resolved her resolution would have vanished to the wind  aaron dunn came into the room and in one second she found herself in the centre of a whirlwind and his arms were the storms that enveloped her on every side  my own own darling girl he said over and over again as he pressed her to his heart quite regardless of mrs bell who stood by sobbing with joy  my own susan  aaron dear aaron she whispered  but she had already recognised the fact that for the present meeting a passive part would become her well and save her a deal of trouble  she had her lover there quite safe safe beyond anything that mr or mrs beckard might have to say to the contrary  she was quite happy only that there were symptoms now and again that the whirlwind was about to engulf her yet once more  dear aaron i am so glad you are come said the innocentminded widow as she went up stairs with him to show him his room and then he embraced her also  dear dear mother he said  on the next day there was as a matter of course a family conclave hetta and phineas came down and discussed the whole subject of the coming marriage with mrs bell  hetta at first was not quite certainought they not to inquire whether the situation was permanent  i wont inquire at all said mrs bell with an energy that startled both the daughter and soninlaw  i would not part them now no not if and the widow shuddered as she thought of her daughters sunken eyes and pale cheeks  he is a good lad said phineas and i trust she will make him a sober steady wife and so the matter was settled  during this time susan and aaron were walking along the balston road and they also had settled the matterquite as satisfactorily  such was the courtship of susan dunn
