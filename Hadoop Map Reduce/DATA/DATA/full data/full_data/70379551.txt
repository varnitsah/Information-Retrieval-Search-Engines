broad walk you meet all the people who are worth knowing    illustration headpiece to the grand tour of the gardens     i  the grand tour of the gardens  you must see for yourselves that it will be difficult to follow peter pans adventures unless you are familiar with the kensington gardens they are in london where the king lives and i used to take david there nearly every day unless he was looking decidedly flushed  no child has ever been in the whole of the gardens because it is so soon time to turn back  the reason it is soon time to turn back is that if you are as small as david you sleep from twelve to one  if your mother was not so sure that you sleep from twelve to one you could most likely see the whole of them  the gardens are bounded on one side by a neverending line of omnibuses over which your nurse has such authority that if she holds up her finger to any one of them it stops immediately  she then crosses with you in safety to the other side  there are more gates to the gardens than one gate but that is the one you go in at and before you go in you speak to the lady with the balloons who sits just outside  this is as near to being inside as she may venture because if she were to let go her hold of the railings for one moment the balloons would lift her up and she would be flown away  she sits very squat for the balloons are always tugging at her and the strain has given her quite a red face  once she was a new one because the old one had let go and david was very sorry for the old one but as she did let go he wished he had been there to see  illustration the hump which is the part of the broad walk where all the big races are run  the gardens are a tremendous big place with millions and hundreds of trees and first you come to the figs but you scorn to loiter there for the figs is the resort of superior little persons who are forbidden to mix with the commonalty and is so named according to legend because they dress in full fig  these dainty ones are themselves contemptuously called figs by david and other heroes and you have a key to the manners and customs of this dandiacal section of the gardens when i tell you that cricket is called crickets here occasionally a rebel fig climbs over the fence into the world and such a one was miss mabel grey of whom i shall tell you when we come to miss mabel greys gate  she was the only really celebrated fig  we are now in the broad walk and it is as much bigger than the other walks as your father is bigger than you  david wondered if it began little and grew and grew until it was quite grown up and whether the other walks are its babies and he drew a picture which diverted him very much of the broad walk giving a tiny walk an airing in a perambulator  in the broad walk you meet all the people who are worth knowing and there is usually a grownup with them to prevent them going on the damp grass and to make them stand disgraced at the corner of a seat if they have been maddog or maryannish  to be maryannish is to behave like a girl whimpering because nurse wont carry you or simpering with your thumb in your mouth and it is a hateful quality but to be maddog is to kick out at everything and there is some satisfaction in that  if i were to point out all the notable places as we pass up the broad walk it would be time to turn back before we reach them and i simply wave my stick at cecco hewletts tree that memorable spot where a boy called cecco lost his penny and looking for it found twopence there has been a good deal of excavation going on there ever since farther up the walk is the little wooden house in which marmaduke perry hid  there is no more awful story of the gardens than this of marmaduke perry who had been maryannish three days in succession and was sentenced to appear in the broad walk dressed in his sisters clothes  he hid in the little wooden house and refused to emerge until they brought him knickerbockers with pockets  you now try to go to the round pond but nurses hate it because they are not really manly and they make you look the other way at the big penny and the babys palace  she was the most celebrated baby of the gardens and lived in the palace all alone with ever so many dolls so people rang the bell and up she got out of her bed though it was past six oclock and she lighted a candle and opened the door in her nighty and then they all cried with great rejoicings hail queen of england  what puzzled david most was how she knew where the matches were kept  the big penny is a statue about her  next we come to the hump which is the part of the broad walk where all the big races are run and even though you had no intention of running you do run when you come to the hump it is such a fascinating slidedown kind of place  often you stop when you have run about halfway down it and then you are lost but there is another little wooden house near here called the lost house and so you tell the man that you are lost and then he finds you  it is glorious fun racing down the hump but you cant do it on windy days because then you are not there but the fallen leaves do it instead of you  there is almost nothing that has such a keen sense of fun as a fallen leaf  from the hump we can see the gate that is called after miss mabel grey the fig i promised to tell you about  there were always two nurses with her or else one mother and one nurse and for a long time she was a patternchild who always coughed off the table and said how do you do to the other figs and the only game she played at was flinging a ball gracefully and letting the nurse bring it back to her  then one day she tired of it all and went maddog and first to show that she really was maddog she unloosened both her bootlaces and put out her tongue east west north and south  she then flung her sash into a puddle and danced on it till dirty water was squirted over her frock after which she climbed the fence and had a series of incredible adventures one of the least of which was that she kicked off both her boots  at last she came to the gate that is now called after her out of which she ran into streets david and i have never been in though we have heard them roaring and still she ran on and would never again have been heard of had not her mother jumped into a bus and thus overtaken her  it all happened i should say long ago and this is not the mabel grey whom david knows  illustration there is almost nothing that has such a keen sense of fun as a fallen leaf missing from book  returning up the broad walk we have on our right the baby walk which is so full of perambulators that you could cross from side to side stepping on babies but the nurses wont let you do it  from this walk a passage called buntings thumb because it is that length leads into picnic street where there are real kettles and chestnutblossom falls into your mug as you are drinking  quite common children picnic here also and the blossom falls into their mugs just the same  next comes st govors well which was full of water when malcolm the bold fell into it  he was his mothers favourite and he let her put her arm round his neck in public because she was a widow but he was also partial to adventures and liked to play with a chimneysweep who had killed a good many bears  the sweeps name was sooty and one day when they were playing near the well malcolm fell in and would have been drowned had not sooty dived in and rescued him and the water had washed sooty clean and he now stood revealed as malcolms longlost father  so malcolm would not let his mother put her arm round his neck any more  between the well and the round pond are the cricket pitches and frequently the choosing of sides exhausts so much time that there is scarcely any cricket  everybody wants to bat first and as soon as he is out he bowls unless you are the better wrestler and while you are wrestling with him the fielders have scattered to play at something else  the gardens are noted for two kinds of cricket boy cricket which is real cricket with a bat and girl cricket which is with a racquet and the governess  girls cant really play cricket and when you are watching their futile efforts you make funny sounds at them nevertheless there was a very disagreeable incident one day when some forward girls challenged davids team and a disturbing creature called angela clare sent down so many yorkers thathowever instead of telling you the result of that regrettable match i shall pass on hurriedly to the round pond which is the wheel that keeps all the gardens going  illustration the serpentine is a lovely lake and there is a drowned forest at the bottom of it  if you peer over the edge you can see the trees all growing upside down and they say that at night there are also drowned stars in it  it is round because it is in the very middle of the gardens and when you are come to it you never want to go any farther  you cant be good all the time at the round pond however much you try  you can be good in the broad walk all the time but not at the round pond and the reason is that you forget and when you remember you are so wet that you may as well be wetter  there are men who sail boats on the round pond such big boats that they bring them in barrows and sometimes in perambulators and then the baby has to walk  the bowlegged children in the gardens are those who had to walk too soon because their father needed the perambulator  you always want to have a yacht to sail on the round pond and in the end your uncle gives you one and to carry it to the pond the first day is splendid also to talk about it to boys who have no uncle is splendid but soon you like to leave it at home  for the sweetest craft that slips her moorings in the round pond is what is called a stickboat because she is rather like a stick until she is in the water and you are holding the string  then as you walk round pulling her you see little men running about her deck and sails rise magically and catch the breeze and you put in on dirty nights at snug harbours which are unknown to the lordly yachts  night passes in a twink and again your rakish craft noses for the wind whales spout you glide over buried cities and have brushes with pirates and cast anchor on coral isles  you are a solitary boy while all this is taking place for two boys together cannot adventure far upon the round pond and though you may talk to yourself throughout the voyage giving orders and executing them with despatch you know not when it is time to go home where you have been or what swelled your sails your treasuretrove is all locked away in your hold so to speak which will be opened perhaps by another little boy many years afterwards  but those yachts have nothing in their hold  does any one return to this haunt of his youth because of the yachts that used to sail it  oh no  it is the stickboat that is freighted with memories  the yachts are toys their owner a freshwater mariner they can cross and recross a pond only while the stickboat goes to sea  you yachtsmen with your wands who think we are all there to gaze on you your ships are only accidents of this place and were they all to be boarded and sunk by the ducks the real business of the round pond would be carried on as usual  illustration the island on which all the birds are born that become baby boys and girls missing from book  paths from everywhere crowd like children to the pond  some of them are ordinary paths which have a rail on each side and are made by men with their coats off but others are vagrants wide at one spot and at another so narrow that you can stand astride them  they are called paths that have made themselves and david did wish he could see them doing it  but like all the most wonderful things that happen in the gardens it is done we concluded at night after the gates are closed we have also decided that the paths make themselves because it is their only chance of getting to the round pond  one of these gypsy paths comes from the place where the sheep get their hair cut  when david shed his curls at the hairdressers i am told he said goodbye to them without a tremor though his mother has never been quite the same bright creature since so he despises the sheep as they run from their shearer and calls out tauntingly cowardly cowardly custard  but when the man grips them between his legs david shakes a fist at him for using such big scissors  another startling moment is when the man turns back the grimy wool from the sheeps shoulders and they look suddenly like ladies in the stalls of a theatre  the sheep are so frightened by the shearing that it makes them quite white and thin and as soon as they are set free they begin to nibble the grass at once quite anxiously as if they feared that they would never be worth eating  david wonders whether they know each other now that they are so different and if it makes them fight with the wrong ones  they are great fighters and thus so unlike country sheep that every year they give my st bernard dog porthos a shock he can make a field of country sheep fly by merely announcing his approach but these town sheep come toward him with no promise of gentle entertainment and then a light from last year breaks upon porthos  he cannot with dignity retreat but he stops and looks about him as if lost in admiration of the scenery and presently he strolls away with a fine indifference and a glint at me from the corner of his eye  illustration porthos  the serpentine begins near here  it is a lovely lake and there is a drowned forest at the bottom of it  if you peer over the edge you can see the trees all growing upside down and they say that at night there are also drowned stars in it  if so peter pan sees them when he is sailing across the lake in the thrushs nest  a small part only of the serpentine is in the gardens for soon it passes beneath a bridge to far away where the island is on which all the birds are born that become baby boys and girls  no one who is human except peter pan and he is only half human can land on the island but you may write what you want boy or girl dark or fair on a piece of paper and then twist it into the shape of a boat and slip it into the water and it reaches peter pans island after dark  illustration one of the paths that have made themselves  we are on the way home now though of course it is all pretence that we can go to so many of the places in one day  i should have had to be carrying david long ago and resting on every seat like old mr salford  that was what we called him because he always talked to us of a lovely place called salford where he had been born  he was a crabapple of an old gentleman who wandered all day in the gardens from seat to seat trying to fall in with somebody who was acquainted with the town of salford and when we had known him for a year or more we actually did meet another aged solitary who had once spent saturday to monday in salford  he was meek and timid and carried his address inside his hat and whatever part of london he was in search of he always went to westminster abbey first as a startingpoint  him we carried in triumph to our other friend with the story of that saturday to monday and never shall i forget the gloating joy with which mr salford leapt at him  they have been cronies ever since and i notice that mr salford who naturally does most of the talking keeps tight grip of the other old mans coat  illustration old mr salford was a crabapple of an old gentleman who wandered all day in the gardens  illustration away he flew right over the houses to the gardens  the two last places before you come to our gate are the dogs cemetery and the chaffinchs nest but we pretend not to know what the dogs cemetery is as porthos is always with us  the nest is very sad  it is quite white and the way we found it was wonderful  we were having another look among the bushes for davids lost worsted ball and instead of the ball we found a lovely nest made of the worsted and containing four eggs with scratches on them very like davids handwriting so we think they must have been the mothers loveletters to the little ones inside  every day we were in the gardens we paid a call at the nest taking care that no cruel boy should see us and we dropped crumbs and soon the bird knew us as friends and sat in the nest looking at us kindly with her shoulders hunched up  but one day when we went there were only two eggs in the nest and the next time there were none  the saddest part of it was that the poor little chaffinch fluttered about the bushes looking so reproachfully at us that we knew she thought we had done it and though david tried to explain to her it was so long since he had spoken the bird language that i fear she did not understand  he and i left the gardens that day with our knuckles in our eyes  illustration tailpiece to the grand tour of the gardens    illustration headpiece to peter pan     ii  peter pan  if you ask your mother whether she knew about peter pan when she was a little girl she will say why of course i did child and if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days she will say what a foolish question to ask certainly he did  then if you ask your grandmother whether she knew about peter pan when she was a girl she also says why of course i did child but if you ask her whether he rode on a goat in those days she says she never heard of his having a goat  perhaps she has forgotten just as she sometimes forgets your name and calls you mildred which is your mothers name  still she could hardly forget such an important thing as the goat  therefore there was no goat when your grandmother was a little girl  this shows that in telling the story of peter pan to begin with the goat as most people do is as silly as to put on your jacket before your vest  of course it also shows that peter is ever so old but he is really always the same age so that does not matter in the least  his age is one week and though he was born so long ago he has never had a birthday nor is there the slightest chance of his ever having one the reason is that he escaped from being a human when he was seven days old he escaped by the window and flew back to the kensington gardens  if you think he was the only baby who ever wanted to escape it shows how completely you have forgotten your own young days  when david heard this story first he was quite certain that he had never tried to escape but i told him to think back hard pressing his hands to his temples and when he had done this hard and even harder he distinctly remembered a youthful desire to return to the treetops and with that memory came others as that he had lain in bed planning to escape as soon as his mother was asleep and how she had once caught him halfway up the chimney  all children could have such recollections if they would press their hands hard to their temples for having been birds before they were human they are naturally a little wild during the first few weeks and very itchy at the shoulders where their wings used to be  so david tells me  illustration the fairies have their tiffs with the birds  i ought to mention here that the following is our way with a story first i tell it to him and then he tells it to me the understanding being that it is quite a different story and then i retell it with his additions and so we go on until no one could say whether it is more his story or mine  in this story of peter pan for instance the bald narrative and most of the moral reflections are mine though not all for this boy can be a stern moralist but the interesting bits about the ways and customs of babies in the birdstage are mostly reminiscences of davids recalled by pressing his hands to his temples and thinking hard  well peter pan got out by the window which had no bars  standing on the ledge he could see trees far away which were doubtless the kensington gardens and the moment he saw them he entirely forgot that he was now a little boy in a nightgown and away he flew right over the houses to the gardens  it is wonderful that he could fly without wings but the place itched tremendously andandperhaps we could all fly if we were as deadconfidentsure of our capacity to do it as was bold peter pan that evening  he alighted gaily on the open sward between the babys palace and the serpentine and the first thing he did was to lie on his back and kick he was quite unaware already that he had ever been human and thought he was a bird even in appearance just the same as in his early days and when he tried to catch a fly he did not understand that the reason he missed it was because he had attempted to seize it with his hand which of course a bird never does  he saw however that it must be past lockout time for there were a good many fairies about all too busy to notice him they were getting breakfast ready milking their cows drawing water and so on and the sight of the waterpails made him thirsty so he flew over to the round pond to have a drink  he stooped and dipped his beak in the pond he thought it was his beak but of course it was only his nose and therefore very little water came up and that not so refreshing as usual so next he tried a puddle and he fell flop into it  when a real bird falls in flop he spreads out his feathers and pecks them dry but peter could not remember what was the thing to do and he decided rather sulkily to go to sleep on the weepingbeech in the baby walk  at first he found some difficulty in balancing himself on a branch but presently he remembered the way and fell asleep  he awoke long before morning shivering and saying to himself i never was out on such a cold night he had really been out on colder nights when he was a bird but of course as everybody knows what seems a warm night to a bird is a cold night to a boy in a nightgown  peter also felt strangely uncomfortable as if his head was stuffy he heard loud noises that made him look round sharply though they were really himself sneezing  there was something he wanted very much but though he knew he wanted it he could not think what it was  what he wanted so much was his mother to blow his nose but that never struck him so he decided to appeal to the fairies for enlightenment  they are reputed to know a good deal  illustration when he heard peters voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip  there were two of them strolling along the baby walk with their arms round each others waists and he hopped down to address them  the fairies have their tiffs with the birds but they usually give a civil answer to a civil question and he was quite angry when these two ran away the moment they saw him  another was lolling on a garden chair reading a postagestamp which some human had let fall and when he heard peters voice he popped in alarm behind a tulip  to peters bewilderment he discovered that every fairy he met fled from him  a band of workmen who were sawing down a toadstool rushed away leaving their tools behind them  a milkmaid turned her pail upside down and hid in it  soon the gardens were in an uproar  crowds of fairies were running this way and that asking each other stoutly who was afraid lights were extinguished doors barricaded and from the grounds of queen mabs palace came the rubadub of drums showing that the royal guard had been called out  a regiment of lancers came charging down the broad walk armed with hollyleaves with which they jag the enemy horribly in passing  peter heard the little people crying everywhere that there was a human in the gardens after lockout time but he never thought for a moment that he was the human  he was feeling stuffier and stuffier and more and more wistful to learn what he wanted done to his nose but he pursued them with the vital question in vain the timid creatures ran from him and even the lancers when he approached them up the hump turned swiftly into a sidewalk on the pretence that they saw him there  illustration a band of workmen who were sawing down a toadstool rushed away leaving their tools behind them  despairing of the fairies he resolved to consult the birds but now he remembered as an odd thing that all the birds on the weepingbeech had flown away when he alighted on it and though this had not troubled him at the time he saw its meaning now  every living thing was shunning him  poor little peter pan he sat down and cried and even then he did not know that for a bird he was sitting on his wrong part  it is a blessing that he did not know for otherwise he would have lost faith in his power to fly and the moment you doubt whether you can fly you cease for ever to be able to do it  the reason birds can fly and we cant is simply that they have perfect faith for to have faith is to have wings  now except by flying no one can reach the island in the serpentine for the boats of humans are forbidden to land there and there are stakes round it standing up in the water on each of which a birdsentinel sits by day and night  it was to the island that peter now flew to put his strange case before old solomon caw and he alighted on it with relief much heartened to find himself at last at home as the birds call the island  all of them were asleep including the sentinels except solomon who was wide awake on one side and he listened quietly to peters adventures and then told him their true meaning  look at your nightgown if you dont believe me solomon said and with staring eyes peter looked at his nightgown and then at the sleeping birds  not one of them wore anything  how many of your toes are thumbs said solomon a little cruelly and peter saw to his consternation that all his toes were fingers  the shock was so great that it drove away his cold  ruffle your feathers said that grim old solomon and peter tried most desperately hard to ruffle his feathers but he had none  then he rose up quaking and for the first time since he stood on the window ledge he remembered a lady who had been very fond of him  illustration put his strange case before old solomon caw missing from book  i think i shall go back to mother he said timidly  goodbye replied solomon caw with a queer look  but peter hesitated  why dont you go the old one asked politely  i suppose said peter huskily i suppose i can still fly  you see he had lost faith  poor little halfandhalf said solomon who was not really hardhearted you will never be able to fly again not even on windy days  you must live here on the island always  and never even go to the kensington gardens peter asked tragically  how could you get across said solomon  he promised very kindly however to teach peter as many of the bird ways as could be learned by one of such an awkward shape  then i shant be exactly a human peter asked  no  nor exactly a bird  no  what shall i be  you will be a betwixtandbetween solomon said and certainly he was a wise old fellow for that is exactly how it turned out  the birds on the island never got used to him  his oddities tickled them every day as if they were quite new though it was really the birds that were new  they came out of the eggs daily and laughed at him at once then off they soon flew to be humans and other birds came out of other eggs and so it went on for ever  the crafty motherbirds when they tired of sitting on their eggs used to get the young ones to break their shells a day before the right time by whispering to them that now was their chance to see peter washing or drinking or eating  thousands gathered round him daily to watch him do these things just as you watch the peacocks and they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead of in the usual way with the mouth  all his food was brought to him from the gardens at solomons orders by the birds  he would not eat worms or insects which they thought very silly of him so they brought him bread in their beaks  thus when you cry out greedy greedy to the bird that flies away with the big crust you know now that you ought not to do this for he is very likely taking it to peter pan  illustration the birds on the island never got used to him  his oddities tickled them every day  peter wore no nightgown now  you see the birds were always begging him for bits of it to line their nests with and being very goodnatured he could not refuse so by solomons advice he had hidden what was left of it  but though he was now quite naked you must not think that he was cold or unhappy  he was usually very happy and gay and the reason was that solomon had kept his promise and taught him many of the bird ways  to be easily pleased for instance and always to be really doing something and to think that whatever he was doing was a thing of vast importance  peter became very clever at helping the birds to build their nests soon he could build better than a woodpigeon and nearly as well as a blackbird though never did he satisfy the finches and he made nice little watertroughs near the nests and dug up worms for the young ones with his fingers  he also became very learned in birdlore and knew an east wind from a west wind by its smell and he could see the grass growing and hear the insects walking about inside the treetrunks  but the best thing solomon had done was to teach him to have a glad heart  all birds have glad hearts unless you rob their nests and so as they were the only kind of heart solomon knew about it was easy to him to teach peter how to have one  illustration peter screamed out do it again and with great goodnature they did it several times  peters heart was so glad that he felt he must sing all day long just as the birds sing for joy but being partly human he needed an instrument so he made a pipe of reeds and he used to sit by the shore of the island of an evening practising the sough of the wind and the ripple of the water and catching handfuls of the shine of the moon and he put them all in his pipe and played them so beautifully that even the birds were deceived and they would say to each other was that a fish leaping in the water or was it peter playing leaping fish on his pipe  and sometimes he played the birth of birds and then the mothers would turn round in their nests to see whether they had laid an egg  if you are a child of the gardens you must know the chestnuttree near the bridge which comes out in flower first of all the chestnuts but perhaps you have not heard why this tree leads the way  it is because peter wearies for summer and plays that it has come and the chestnut being so near hears him and is cheated  illustration a hundred flew off with the string and peter clung to the tail  but as peter sat by the shore tootling divinely on his pipe he sometimes fell into sad thoughts and then the music became sad also and the reason of all this sadness was that he could not reach the gardens though he could see them through the arch of the bridge  he knew he could never be a real human again and scarcely wanted to be one but oh how he longed to play as other children play and of course there is no such lovely place to play in as the gardens  the birds brought him news of how boys and girls play and wistful tears started in peters eyes  perhaps you wonder why he did not swim across  the reason was that he could not swim  he wanted to know how to swim but no one on the island knew the way except the ducks and they are so stupid  they were quite willing to teach him but all they could say about it was you sit down on the top of the water in this way and then you kick out like that  peter tried it often but always before he could kick out he sank  what he really needed to know was how you sit on the water without sinking and they said it was quite impossible to explain such an easy thing as that  occasionally swans touched on the island and he would give them all his days food and then ask them how they sat on the water but as soon as he had no more to give them the hateful things hissed at him and sailed away  once he really thought he had discovered a way of reaching the gardens a wonderful white thing like a runaway newspaper floated high over the island and then tumbled rolling over and over after the manner of a bird that has broken its wing  peter was so frightened that he hid but the birds told him it was only a kite and what a kite is and that it must have tugged its string out of a boys hand and soared away after that they laughed at peter for being so fond of the kite he loved it so much that he even slept with one hand on it and i think this was pathetic and pretty for the reason he loved it was because it had belonged to a real boy  illustration after this the birds said that they would help him no more in his mad enterprise  to the birds this was a very poor reason but the older ones felt grateful to him at this time because he had nursed a number of fledglings through the german measles and they offered to show him how birds fly a kite  so six of them took the end of the string in their beaks and flew away with it and to his amazement it flew after them and went even higher than they  peter screamed out do it again and with great goodnature they did it several times and always instead of thanking them he cried do it again which shows that even now he had not quite forgotten what it was to be a boy  at last with a grand design burning within his brave heart he begged them to do it once more with him clinging to the tail and now a hundred flew off with the string and peter clung to the tail meaning to drop off when he was over the gardens  but the kite broke to pieces in the air and he would have been drowned in the serpentine had he not caught hold of two indignant swans and made them carry him to the island  after this the birds said that they would help him no more in his mad enterprise  nevertheless peter did reach the gardens at last by the help of shelleys boat as i am now to tell you  illustration tailpiece to peter pan     illustration headpiece to the thrushs nest     iii  the thrushs nest  shelley was a young gentleman and as grownup as he need ever expect to be  he was a poet and they are never exactly grownup  they are people who despise money except what you need for today and he had all that and five pounds over  so when he was walking in the kensington gardens he made a paper boat of his banknote and sent it sailing on the serpentine  it reached the island at night and the lookout brought it to solomon caw who thought at first that it was the usual thing a message from a lady saying she would be obliged if he could let her have a good one they always ask for the best one he has and if he likes the letter he sends one from class a but if it ruffles him he sends very funny ones indeed  sometimes he sends none at all and at another time he sends a nestful it all depends on the mood you catch him in  he likes you to leave it all to him and if you mention particularly that you hope he will see his way to making it a boy this time he is almost sure to send another girl  and whether you are a lady or only a little boy who wants a babysister always take pains to write your address clearly you cant think what a lot of babies solomon has sent to the wrong house  shelleys boat when opened completely puzzled solomon and he took counsel of his assistants who having walked over it twice first with their toes pointed out and then with their toes pointed in decided that it came from some greedy person who wanted five  they thought this because there was a large five printed on it  preposterous cried solomon in a rage and he presented it to peter anything useless which drifted upon the island was usually given to peter as a plaything  but he did not play with his precious banknote for he knew what it was at once having been very observant during the week when he was an ordinary boy  with so much money he reflected he could surely at last contrive to reach the gardens and he considered all the possible ways and decided wisely i think to choose the best way  but first he had to tell the birds of the value of shelleys boat and though they were too honest to demand it back he saw that they were galled and they cast such black looks at solomon who was rather vain of his cleverness that he flew away to the end of the island and sat there very depressed with his head buried in his wings  now peter knew that unless solomon was on your side you never got anything done for you in the island so he followed him and tried to hearten him  illustration preposterous cried solomon in a rage  nor was this all that peter did to gain the powerful old fellows goodwill  you must know that solomon had no intention of remaining in office all his life  he looked forward to retiring by and by and devoting his green old age to a life of pleasure on a certain yewstump in the figs which had taken his fancy and for years he had been quietly filling his stocking  it was a stocking belonging to some bathing person which had been cast upon the island and at the time i speak of it contained a hundred and eighty crumbs thirtyfour nuts sixteen crusts a penwiper and a bootlace  when his stocking was full solomon calculated that he would be able to retire on a competency  peter now gave him a pound  he cut it off his banknote with a sharp stick  this made solomon his friend for ever and after the two had consulted together they called a meeting of the thrushes  you will see presently why thrushes only were invited  the scheme to be put before them was really peters but solomon did most of the talking because he soon became irritable if other people talked  he began by saying that he had been much impressed by the superior ingenuity shown by the thrushes in nestbuilding and this put them into goodhumour at once as it was meant to do for all the quarrels between birds are about the best way of building nests  other birds said solomon omitted to line their nests with mud and as a result they did not hold water  here he cocked his head as if he had used an unanswerable argument but unfortunately a mrs finch had come to the meeting uninvited and she squeaked out we dont build nests to hold water but to hold eggs and then the thrushes stopped cheering and solomon was so perplexed that he took several sips of water  consider he said at last how warm the mud makes the nest  consider cried mrs finch that when water gets into the nest it remains there and your little ones are drowned  the thrushes begged solomon with a look to say something crushing in reply to this but again he was perplexed  try another drink suggested mrs finch pertly  kate was her name and all kates are saucy  illustration for years he had been quietly filling his stocking  solomon did try another drink and it inspired him  if said he a finchs nest is placed on the serpentine it fills and breaks to pieces but a thrushs nest is still as dry as the cup of a swans back  how the thrushes applauded  now they knew why they lined their nests with mud and when mrs finch called out we dont place our nests on the serpentine they did what they should have done at firstchased her from the meeting  after this it was most orderly  what they had been brought together to hear said solomon was this their young friend peter pan as they well knew wanted very much to be able to cross to the gardens and he now proposed with their help to build a boat  at this the thrushes began to fidget which made peter tremble for his scheme  solomon explained hastily that what he meant was not one of the cumbrous boats that humans use the proposed boat was to be simply a thrushs nest large enough to hold peter  but still to peters agony the thrushes were sulky  we are very busy people they grumbled and this would be a big job  quite so said solomon and of course peter would not allow you to work for nothing  you must remember that he is now in comfortable circumstances and he will pay you such wages as you have never been paid before  peter pan authorises me to say that you shall all be paid sixpence a day  then all the thrushes hopped for joy and that very day was begun the celebrated building of the boat  all their ordinary business fell into arrears  it was the time of the year when they should have been pairing but not a thrushs nest was built except this big one and so solomon soon ran short of thrushes with which to supply the demand from the mainland  the stout rather greedy children who look so well in perambulators but get puffed easily when they walk were all young thrushes once and ladies often ask specially for them  what do you think solomon did  he sent over to the housetops for a lot of sparrows and ordered them to lay their eggs in old thrushes nests and sent their young to the ladies and swore they were all thrushes  it was known afterwards on the island as the sparrows year and so when you meet grownup people in the gardens who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are very likely they belong to that year  you ask them  illustration when you meet grownup people in the gardens who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are  peter was a just master and paid his workpeople every evening  they stood in rows on the branches waiting politely while he cut the paper sixpences out of his banknote and presently he called the roll and then each bird as the names were mentioned flew down and got sixpence  it must have been a fine sight  and at last after months of labour the boat was finished  o the glory of peter as he saw it growing more and more like a great thrushs nest  from the very beginning of the building of it he slept by its side and often woke up to say sweet things to it and after it was lined with mud and the mud had dried he always slept in it  he sleeps in his nest still and has a fascinating way of curling round in it for it is just large enough to hold him comfortably when he curls round like a kitten  it is brown inside of course but outside it is mostly green being woven of grass and twigs and when these wither or snap the walls are thatched afresh  there are also a few feathers here and there which came off the thrushes while they were building  the other birds were extremely jealous and said that the boat would not balance on the water but it lay most beautifully steady they said the water would come into it but no water came into it  next they said that peter had no oars and this caused the thrushes to look at each other in dismay but peter replied that he had no need of oars for he had a sail and with such a proud happy face he produced a sail which he had fashioned out of his nightgown and though it was still rather like a nightgown it made a lovely sail  and that night the moon being full and all the birds asleep he did enter his coracle as master francis pretty would have said and depart out of the island and first he knew not why he looked upward with his hands clasped and from that moment his eyes were pinned to the west  he had promised the thrushes to begin by making short voyages with them as his guides but far away he saw the kensington gardens beckoning to him beneath the bridge and he could not wait  his face was flushed but he never looked back there was an exultation in his little breast that drove out fear  was peter the least gallant of the english mariners who have sailed westward to meet the unknown  at first his boat turned round and round and he was driven back to the place of his starting whereupon he shortened sail by removing one of the sleeves and was forthwith carried backwards by a contrary breeze to his no small peril  he now let go the sail with the result that he was drifted towards the far shore where are black shadows he knew not the dangers of but suspected them and so once more hoisted his nightgown and went roomer of the shadows until he caught a favouring wind which bore him westward but at so great a speed that he was like to be broke against the bridge  which having avoided he passed under the bridge and came to his great rejoicing within full sight of the delectable gardens  but having tried to cast anchor which was a stone at the end of a piece of the kitestring he found no bottom and was fain to hold off seeking for moorage and feeling his way he buffeted against a sunken reef that cast him overboard by the greatness of the shock and he was near to being drowned but clambered back into the vessel  there now arose a mighty storm accompanied by roaring of waters such as he had never heard the like and he was tossed this way and that and his hands so numbed with the cold that he could not close them  having escaped the danger of which he was mercifully carried into a small bay where his boat rode at peace  nevertheless he was not yet in safety for on pretending to disembark he found a multitude of small people drawn up on the shore to contest his landing and shouting shrilly to him to be off for it was long past lockout time  this with much brandishing of their hollyleaves and also a company of them carried an arrow which some boy had left in the gardens and this they were prepared to use as a batteringram  then peter who knew them for the fairies called out that he was not an ordinary human and had no desire to do them displeasure but to be their friend nevertheless having found a jolly harbour he was in no temper to draw off therefrom and he warned them if they sought to mischief him to stand to their harms  so saying he boldly leapt ashore and they gathered around him with intent to slay him but there then arose a great cry among the women and it was because they had now observed that his sail was a babys nightgown  whereupon they straightway loved him and grieved that their laps were too small the which i cannot explain except by saying that such is the way of women  the menfairies now sheathed their weapons on observing the behaviour of their women on whose intelligence they set great store and they led him civilly to their queen who conferred upon him the courtesy of the gardens after lockout time and henceforth peter could go whither he chose and the fairies had orders to put him in comfort  illustration he passed under the bridge and came within full sight of the delectable gardens  such was his first voyage to the gardens and you may gather from the antiquity of the language that it took place a long time ago  but peter never grows any older and if we could be watching for him under the bridge tonight but of course we cant i dare say we should see him hoisting his nightgown and sailing or paddling towards us in the thrushs nest  when he sails he sits down but he stands up to paddle  i shall tell you presently how he got his paddle  long before the time for the opening of the gates comes he steals back to the island for people must not see him he is not so human as all that but this gives him hours for play and he plays exactly as real children play  at least he thinks so and it is one of the pathetic things about him that he often plays quite wrongly  you see he had no one to tell him how children really play for the fairies are all more or less in hiding until dusk and so know nothing and though the birds pretended that they could tell him a great deal when the time for telling came it was wonderful how little they really knew  they told him the truth about hideandseek and he often plays it by himself but even the ducks on the round pond could not explain to him what it is that makes the pond so fascinating to boys  every night the ducks have forgotten all the events of the day except the number of pieces of cake thrown to them  they are gloomy creatures and say that cake is not what it was in their young days  so peter had to find out many things for himself  he often played ships at the round pond but his ship was only a hoop which he had found on the grass  of course he had never seen a hoop and he wondered what you play at with them and decided that you play at pretending they are boats  this hoop always sank at once but he waded in for it and sometimes he dragged it gleefully round the rim of the pond and he was quite proud to think that he had discovered what boys do with hoops  illustration there now arose a mighty storm and he was tossed this way and that missing from book  another time when he found a childs pail he thought it was for sitting in and he sat so hard in it that he could scarcely get out of it  also he found a balloon  it was bobbing about on the hump quite as if it was having a game by itself and he caught it after an exciting chase  but he thought it was a ball and jenny wren had told him that boys kick balls so he kicked it and after that he could not find it anywhere  perhaps the most surprising thing he found was a perambulator  it was under a limetree near the entrance to the fairy queens winter palace which is within the circle of the seven spanish chestnuts and peter approached it warily for the birds had never mentioned such things to him  lest it was alive he addressed it politely and then as it gave no answer he went nearer and felt it cautiously  he gave it a little push and it ran from him which made him think it must be alive after all but as it had run from him he was not afraid  so he stretched out his hand to pull it to him but this time it ran at him and he was so alarmed that he leapt the railing and scudded away to his boat  you must not think however that he was a coward for he came back next night with a crust in one hand and a stick in the other but the perambulator had gone and he never saw any other one  i have promised to tell you also about his paddle  it was a childs spade which he had found near st govors well and he thought it was a paddle  do you pity peter pan for making these mistakes  if so i think it rather silly of you  what i mean is that of course one must pity him now and then but to pity him all the time would be impertinence  he thought he had the most splendid time in the gardens and to think you have it is almost quite as good as really to have it  he played without ceasing while you often waste time by being maddog or maryannish  he could be neither of these things for he had never heard of them but do you think he is to be pitied for that  oh he was merry  he was as much merrier than you for instance as you are merrier than your father  sometimes he fell like a spinningtop from sheer merriment  have you seen a greyhound leaping the fences of the gardens  that is how peter leaps them  illustration fairies are all more or less in hiding until dusk  and think of the music of his pipe  gentlemen who walk home at night write to the papers to say they heard a nightingale in the gardens but it is really peters pipe they hear  of course he had no motherat least what use was she to him  you can be sorry for him for that but dont be too sorry for the next thing i mean to tell you is how he revisited her  it was the fairies who gave him the chance  illustration tailpiece to the thrushs nest     illustration headpiece to lockout time     iv  lockout time  it is frightfully difficult to know much about the fairies and almost the only thing known for certain is that there are fairies wherever there are children  long ago children were forbidden the gardens and at that time there was not a fairy in the place then the children were admitted and the fairies came trooping in that very evening  they cant resist following the children but you seldom see them partly because they live in the daytime behind the railings where you are not allowed to go and also partly because they are so cunning  they are not a bit cunning after lockout but until lockout my word  illustration they are so cunning  illustration when they think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively missing from book  when you were a bird you knew the fairies pretty well and you remember a good deal about them in your babyhood which it is a great pity you cant write down for gradually you forget and i have heard of children who declared that they had never once seen a fairy  very likely if they said this in the kensington gardens they were standing looking at a fairy all the time  the reason they were cheated was that she pretended to be something else  this is one of their best tricks they usually pretend to be flowers because the court sits in the fairies basin and there are so many flowers there and all along the baby walk that a flower is the thing least likely to attract attention  they dress exactly like flowers and change with the seasons putting on white when lilies are in and blue for bluebells and so on  they like crocus and hyacinth time best of all as they are partial to a bit of colour but tulips except white ones which are the fairy cradles they consider garish and they sometimes put off dressing like tulips for days so that the beginning of the tulip weeks is almost the best time to catch them  when they think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively but if you look and they fear there is no time to hide they stand quite still pretending to be flowers  then after you have passed without knowing that they were fairies they rush home and tell their mothers they have had such an adventure  the fairy basin you remember is all covered with groundivy from which they make their castoroil with flowers growing in it here and there  most of them really are flowers but some of them are fairies  you never can be sure of them but a good plan is to walk by looking the other way and then turn round sharply  another good plan which david and i sometimes follow is to stare them down  after a long time they cant help winking and then you know for certain that they are fairies  illustration but if you look and they fear there is no time to hide they stand quite still pretending to be flowers missing from book  there are also numbers of them along the baby walk which is a famous gentle place as spots frequented by fairies are called  once twentyfour of them had an extraordinary adventure  they were a girls school out for a walk with the governess and all wearing hyacinth gowns when she suddenly put her finger to her mouth and then they all stood still on an empty bed and pretended to be hyacinths unfortunately what the governess had heard was two gardeners coming to plant new flowers in that very bed  they were wheeling a handcart with the flowers in it and were quite surprised to find the bed occupied  pity to lift them hyacinths said the one man  dukes orders replied the other and having emptied the cart they dug up the boardingschool and put the poor terrified things in it in five rows  of course neither the governess nor the girls dare let on that they were fairies so they were carted far away to a pottingshed out of which they escaped in the night without their shoes but there was a great row about it among the parents and the school was ruined  as for their houses it is no use looking for them because they are the exact opposite of our houses  you can see our houses by day but you cant see them by dark  well you can see their houses by dark but you cant see them by day for they are the colour of night and i never heard of any one yet who could see night in the daytime  this does not mean that they are black for night has its colours just as day has but ever so much brighter  their blues and reds and greens are like ours with a light behind them  the palace is entirely built of manycoloured glasses and it is quite the loveliest of all royal residences but the queen sometimes complains because the common people will peep in to see what she is doing  they are very inquisitive folk and press quite hard against the glass and that is why their noses are mostly snubby  the streets are miles long and very twisty and have paths on each side made of bright worsted  the birds used to steal the worsted for their nests but a policeman has been appointed to hold on at the other end  illustration the fairies are exquisite dancers  one of the great differences between the fairies and us is that they never do anything useful  when the first baby laughed for the first time his laugh broke into a million pieces and they all went skipping about  that was the beginning of fairies  they look tremendously busy you know as if they had not a moment to spare but if you were to ask them what they are doing they could not tell you in the least they are frightfully ignorant and everything they do is makebelieve they have a postman but he never calls except at christmas with his little box and though they have beautiful schools nothing is taught in them the youngest child being chief person is always elected mistress and when she has called the roll they all go out for a walk and never come back  it is a very noticeable thing that in fairy families the youngest is always chief person and usually becomes a prince or princess and children remember this and think it must be so among humans also and that is why they are often made uneasy when they come upon their mother furtively putting new frills on the basinette  you have probably observed that your babysister wants to do all sorts of things that your mother and her nurse want her not to doto stand up at sittingdown time and to sit down at standup time for instance or to wake up when she should fall asleep or to crawl on the floor when she is wearing her best frock and so on and perhaps you put this down to naughtiness  but it is not it simply means that she is doing as she has seen the fairies do she begins by following their ways and it takes about two years to get her into the human ways  her fits of passion which are awful to behold and are usually called teething are no such thing they are her natural exasperation because we dont understand her though she is talking an intelligible language  she is talking fairy  the reason mothers and nurses know what her remarks mean before other people know as that guch means give it to me at once while wa is why do you wear such a funny hat is because mixing so much with babies they have picked up a little of the fairy language  illustration a fairy ring  of late david has been thinking back hard about the fairy tongue with his hands clutching his temples and he has remembered a number of their phrases which i shall tell you some day if i dont forget  he had heard them in the days when he was a thrush and though i suggested to him that perhaps it is really bird language he is remembering he says not for these phrases are about fun and adventures and the birds talked of nothing but nestbuilding  he distinctly remembers that the birds used to go from spot to spot like ladies at shop windows looking at the different nests and saying not my colour my dear and how would that do with a soft lining and but will it wear and what hideous trimming and so on  illustration these tricky fairies sometimes slyly change the board on a ball night  the fairies are exquisite dancers and that is why one of the first things the baby does is to sign to you to dance to him and then to cry when you do it  they hold their great balls in the open air in what is called a fairy ring  for weeks afterwards you can see the ring on the grass  it is not there when they begin but they make it by waltzing round and round  sometimes you will find mushrooms inside the ring and these are fairy chairs that the servants have forgotten to clear away  the chairs and the rings are the only telltale marks these little people leave behind them and they would remove even these were they not so fond of dancing that they toe it till the very moment of the opening of the gates  david and i once found a fairy ring quite warm  but there is also a way of finding out about the ball before it takes place  you know the boards which tell at what time the gardens are to close today  well these tricky fairies sometimes slyly change the board on a ball night so that it says the gardens are to close at sixthirty for instance instead of at seven  this enables them to get begun half an hour earlier  if on such a night we could remain behind in the gardens as the famous maimie mannering did we might see delicious sights hundreds of lovely fairies hastening to the ball the married ones wearing their wedding rings round their waists the gentlemen all in uniform holding up the ladies trains and linkmen running in front carrying winter cherries which are the fairylanterns the cloakroom where they put on their silver slippers and get a ticket for their wraps the flowers streaming up from the baby walk to look on and always welcome because they can lend a pin the suppertable with queen mab at the head of it and behind her chair the lord chamberlain who carries a dandelion on which he blows when her majesty wants to know the time  illustration linkmen running in front carrying winter cherries  the tablecloth varies according to the seasons and in may it is made of chestnut blossom  the way the fairy servants do is this the men scores of them climb up the trees and shake the branches and the blossom falls like snow  then the lady servants sweep it together by whisking their skirts until it is exactly like a tablecloth and that is how they get their tablecloth  they have real glasses and real wine of three kinds namely blackthorn wine berberris wine and cowslip wine and the queen pours out but the bottles are so heavy that she just pretends to pour out  there is breadandbutter to begin with of the size of a threepenny bit and cakes to end with and they are so small that they have no crumbs  the fairies sit round on mushrooms and at first they are wellbehaved and always cough off the table and so on but after a bit they are not so wellbehaved and stick their fingers into the butter which is got from the roots of old trees and the really horrid ones crawl over the tablecloth chasing sugar or other delicacies with their tongues  when the queen sees them doing this she signs to the servants to wash up and put away and then everybody adjourns to the dance the queen walking in front while the lord chamberlain walks behind her carrying two little pots one of which contains the juice of wallflower and the other the juice of solomons seal  wallflower juice is good for reviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit and solomons seal juice is for bruises  they bruise very easily and when peter plays faster and faster they foot it till they fall down in fits  for as you know without my telling you peter pan is the fairies orchestra he sits in the middle of the ring and they would never dream of having a smart dance nowadays without him  p p is written on the corner of the invitationcards sent out by all really good families  they are grateful little people too and at the princesss comingofage ball they come of age on their second birthday and have a birthday every month they gave him the wish of his heart  illustration when her majesty wants to know the time  the way it was done was this  the queen ordered him to kneel and then said that for playing so beautifully she would give him the wish of his heart  then they all gathered round peter to hear what was the wish of his heart but for a long time he hesitated not being certain what it was himself  if i chose to go back to mother he asked at last could you give me that wish  now this question vexed them for were he to return to his mother they should lose his music so the queen tilted her nose contemptuously and said pooh ask for a much bigger wish than that  is that quite a little wish he inquired  as little as this the queen answered putting her hands near each other  what size is a big wish he asked  she measured it off on her skirt and it was a very handsome length  then peter reflected and said well then i think i shall have two little wishes instead of one big one  of course the fairies had to agree though his cleverness rather shocked them and he said that his first wish was to go to his mother but with the right to return to the gardens if he found her disappointing  his second wish he would hold in reserve  they tried to dissuade him and even put obstacles in the way  i can give you the power to fly to her house the queen said but i cant open the door for you  the window i flew out at will be open peter said confidently mother always keeps it open in the hope that i may fly back  how do you know they asked quite surprised and really peter could not explain how he knew  i just do know he said  so as he persisted in his wish they had to grant it  the way they gave him power to fly was this they all tickled him on the shoulder and soon he felt a funny itching in that part and then up he rose higher and higher and flew away out of the gardens and over the housetops  it was so delicious that instead of flying straight to his own home he skimmed away over st pauls to the crystal palace and back by the river and regents park and by the time he reached his mothers window he had quite made up his mind that his second wish should be to become a bird  the window was wide open just as he knew it would be and in he fluttered and there was his mother lying asleep  peter alighted softly on the wooden rail at the foot of the bed and had a good look at her  she lay with her head on her hand and the hollow in the pillow was like a nest lined with her brown wavy hair  he remembered though he had long forgotten it that she always gave her hair a holiday at night  how sweet the frills of her nightgown were  he was very glad she was such a pretty mother  but she looked sad and he knew why she looked sad  one of her arms moved as if it wanted to go round something and he knew what it wanted to go round  o mother said peter to himself if you just knew who is sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed  very gently he patted the little mound that her feet made and he could see by her face that she liked it  he knew he had but to say mother ever so softly and she would wake up  they always wake up at once if it is you that says their name  then she would give such a joyous cry and squeeze him tight  how nice that would be to him but oh how exquisitely delicious it would be to her  that i am afraid is how peter regarded it  in returning to his mother he never doubted that he was giving her the greatest treat a woman can have  nothing can be more splendid he thought than to have a little boy of your own  how proud of him they are and very right and proper too  illustration the fairies sit round on mushrooms and at first they are well behaved  but why does peter sit so long on the rail why does he not tell his mother that he has come back  i quite shrink from the truth which is that he sat there in two minds sometimes he looked longingly at his mother and sometimes he looked longingly at the window  certainly it would be pleasant to be her boy again but on the other hand what times those had been in the gardens was he so sure that he should enjoy wearing clothes again  he popped off the bed and opened some drawers to have a look at his old garments they were still there but he could not remember how you put them on the socks for instance were they worn on the hands or on the feet he was about to try one of them on his hand when he had a great adventure  perhaps the drawer had creaked at any rate his mother woke up for he heard her say peter as if it was the most lovely word in the language  he remained sitting on the floor and held his breath wondering how she knew that he had come back  if she said peter again he meant to cry mother and run to her  but she spoke no more she made little moans only and when he next peeped at her she was once more asleep with tears on her face  it made peter very miserable and what do you think was the first thing he did  sitting on the rail at the foot of the bed he played a beautiful lullaby to his mother on his pipe  he had made it up himself out of the way she said peter and he never stopped playing until she looked happy  he thought this so clever of him that he could scarcely resist wakening her to hear her say o peter how exquisitely you play  however as she now seemed comfortable he again cast looks at the window  you must not think that he meditated flying away and never coming back  he had quite decided to be his mothers boy but hesitated about beginning tonight  it was the second wish which troubled him  he no longer meant to make it a wish to be a bird but not to ask for a second wish seemed wasteful and of course he could not ask for it without returning to the fairies  also if he put off asking for his wish too long it might go bad  he asked himself if he had not been hardhearted to fly away without saying goodbye to solomon  i should like awfully to sail in my boat just once more he said wistfully to his sleeping mother  he quite argued with her as if she could hear him  it would be so splendid to tell the birds of this adventure he said coaxingly i promise to come back he said solemnly and meant it too  illustration  butter is got from the roots of old trees missing from book  and in the end you know he flew away  twice he came back from the window wanting to kiss his mother but he feared the delight of it might waken her so at last he played her a lovely kiss on his pipe and then he flew back to the gardens  many nights and even months passed before he asked the fairies for his second wish and i am not sure that i quite know why he delayed so long  one reason was that he had so many goodbyes to say not only to his particular friends but to a hundred favourite spots  then he had his last sail and his very last sail and his last sail of all and so on  again a number of farewell feasts were given in his honour and another comfortable reason was that after all there was no hurry for his mother would never weary of waiting for him  this last reason displeased old solomon for it was an encouragement to the birds to procrastinate  solomon had several excellent mottoes for keeping them at their work such as never put off laying today because you can lay tomorrow and in this world there are no second chances and yet here was peter gaily putting off and none the worse for it  the birds pointed this out to each other and fell into lazy habits  but mind you though peter was so slow in going back to his mother he was quite decided to go back  the best proof of this was his caution with the fairies  they were most anxious that he should remain in the gardens to play to them and to bring this to pass they tried to trick him into making such a remark as i wish the grass was not so wet and some of them danced out of time in the hope that he might cry i do wish you would keep time  then they would have said that this was his second wish  but he smoked their design and though on occasions he began i wish he always stopped in time  so when at last he said to them bravely i wish now to go back to mother for ever and always they had to tickle his shoulders and let him go  he went in a hurry in the end because he had dreamt that his mother was crying and he knew what was the great thing she cried for and that a hug from her splendid peter would quickly make her to smile oh he felt sure of it and so eager was he to be nestling in her arms that this time he flew straight to the window which was always to be open for him  illustration wallflower juice is good for reviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit  but the window was closed and there were iron bars on it and peering inside he saw his mother sleeping peacefully with her arm round another little boy  peter called mother mother but she heard him not in vain he beat his little limbs against the iron bars  he had to fly back sobbing to the gardens and he never saw his dear again  what a glorious boy he had meant to be to her  ah peter we who have made the great mistake how differently we should all act at the second chance  but solomon was rightthere is no second chance not for most of us  when we reach the window it is lockout time  the iron bars are up for life  illustration tailpiece to lockout time     illustration headpiece to the little house     v  the little house  everybody has heard of the little house in the kensington gardens which is the only house in the whole world that the fairies have built for humans  but no one has really seen it except just three or four and they have not only seen it but slept in it and unless you sleep in it you never see it  this is because it is not there when you lie down but it is there when you wake up and step outside  in a kind of way every one may see it but what you see is not really it but only the light in the windows  you see the light after lockout time  david for instance saw it quite distinctly far away among the trees as we were going home from the pantomime and oliver bailey saw it the night he stayed so late at the temple which is the name of his fathers office  angela clare who loves to have a tooth extracted because then she is treated to tea in a shop saw more than one light she saw hundreds of them all together and this must have been the fairies building the house for they build it every night and always in a different part of the gardens  she thought one of the lights was bigger than the others though she was not quite sure for they jumped about so and it might have been another one that was bigger  but if it was the same one it was peter pans light  heaps of children have seen the light so that is nothing  but maimie mannering was the famous one for whom the house was first built  maimie was always rather a strange girl and it was at night that she was strange  she was four years of age and in the daytime she was the ordinary kind  she was pleased when her brother tony who was a magnificent fellow of six took notice of her and she looked up to him in the right way and tried in vain to imitate him and was flattered rather than annoyed when he shoved her about  also when she was batting she would pause though the ball was in the air to point out to you that she was wearing new shoes  she was quite the ordinary kind in the daytime  illustration peter pan is the fairies orchestra  but as the shades of night fell tony the swaggerer lost his contempt for maimie and eyed her fearfully and no wonder for with dark there came into her face a look that i can describe only as a leary look  it was also a serene look that contrasted grandly with tonys uneasy glances  then he would make her presents of his favourite toys which he always took away from her next morning and she accepted them with a disturbing smile  the reason he was now become so wheedling and she so mysterious was in brief that they knew they were about to be sent to bed  it was then that maimie was terrible  tony entreated her not to do it tonight and the mother and their coloured nurse threatened her but maimie merely smiled her agitating smile  and by and by when they were alone with their nightlight she would start up in bed crying hsh what was that  tony beseeches her it was nothingdont maimie dont and pulls the sheet over his head  it is coming nearer she cries  oh look at it tony  it is feeling your bed with its hornsit is boring for you o tony oh and she desists not until he rushes downstairs in his combinations screeching  when they came up to whip maimie they usually found her sleeping tranquillynot shamming you know but really sleeping and looking like the sweetest little angel which seems to me to make it almost worse  but of course it was daytime when they were in the gardens and then tony did most of the talking  you could gather from his talk that he was a very brave boy and no one was so proud of it as maimie  she would have loved to have a ticket on her saying that she was his sister  and at no time did she admire him more than when he told her as he often did with splendid firmness that one day he meant to remain behind in the gardens after the gates were closed  o tony she would say with awful respect but the fairies will be so angry  i dare say replied tony carelessly  perhaps she said thrilling peter pan will give you a sail in his boat  i shall make him replied tony no wonder she was proud of him  illustration they all tickled him on the shoulder missing from book  but they should not have talked so loudly for one day they were overheard by a fairy who had been gathering skeleton leaves from which the little people weave their summer curtains and after that tony was a marked boy  they loosened the rails before he sat on them so that down he came on the back of his head they tripped him up by catching his bootlace and bribed the ducks to sink his boat  nearly all the nasty accidents you meet with in the gardens occur because the fairies have taken an illwill to you and so it behoves you to be careful what you say about them  maimie was one of the kind who like to fix a day for doing things but tony was not that kind and when she asked him which day he was to remain behind in the gardens after lockout he merely replied just some day he was quite vague about which day except when she asked will it be today and then he could always say for certain that it would not be today  so she saw that he was waiting for a real good chance  this brings us to an afternoon when the gardens were white with snow and there was ice on the round pond not thick enough to skate on but at least you could spoil it for tomorrow by flinging stones and many bright little boys and girls were doing that  when tony and his sister arrived they wanted to go straight to the pond but their ayah said they must take a sharp walk first and as she said this she glanced at the timeboard to see when the gardens closed that night  it read halfpast five  poor ayah she is the one who laughs continuously because there are so many white children in the world but she was not to laugh much more that day  well they went up the baby walk and back and when they returned to the timeboard she was surprised to see that it now read five oclock for closingtime  but she was unacquainted with the tricky ways of the fairies and so did not see as maimie and tony saw at once that they had changed the hour because there was to be a ball tonight  she said there was only time now to walk to the top of the hump and back and as they trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their little breasts  you see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball never tony felt could he hope for a better chance  illustration one day they were overheard by a fairy  he had to feel this for maimie so plainly felt it for him  her eager eyes asked the question is it today and he gasped and then nodded maimie slipped her hand into tonys and hers was hot but his was cold  she did a very kind thing she took off her scarf and gave it to him  in case you should feel cold she whispered  her face was aglow but tonys was very gloomy  as they turned on the top of the hump he whispered to her im afraid nurse would see me so i shant be able to do it  maimie admired him more than ever for being afraid of nothing but their ayah when there were so many unknown terrors to fear and she said aloud tony i shall race you to the gate and in a whisper then you can hide and off they ran  tony could always outdistance her easily but never had she known him speed away so quickly as now and she was sure he hurried that he might have more time to hide  brave brave her doting eyes were crying when she got a dreadful shock instead of hiding her hero had run out at the gate  at this bitter sight maimie stopped blankly as if all her lapful of darling treasures were suddenly spilled and then for very disdain she could not sob in a swell of protest against all puling cowards she ran to st govors well and hid in tonys stead  when the ayah reached the gate and saw tony far in front she thought her other charge was with him and passed out  twilight crept over the gardens and hundreds of people passed out including the last one who always has to run for it but maimie saw them not  she had shut her eyes tight and glued them with passionate tears  when she opened them something very cold ran up her legs and up her arms and dropped into her heart  it was the stillness of the gardens  then she heard clang then from another part clang then clang clang far away it was the closing of the gates  immediately the last clang had died away maimie distinctly heard a voice say so thats all right  it had a wooden sound and seemed to come from above and she looked up in time to see an elmtree stretching out its arms and yawning  illustration the little people weave their summer curtains from skeleton leaves  she was about to say i never knew you could speak when a metallic voice that seemed to come from the ladle at the well remarked to the elm i suppose it is a bit coldish up there and the elm replied not particularly but you do get numb standing so long on one leg and he flapped his arms vigorously just as the cabmen do before they drive off  maimie was quite surprised to see that a number of other tall trees were doing the same sort of thing and she stole away to the baby walk and crouched observantly under a minorca holly which shrugged its shoulders but did not seem to mind her  she was not in the least cold  she was wearing a russetcoloured pelisse and had the hood over her head so that nothing of her showed except her dear little face and her curls  the rest of her real self was hidden far away inside so many warm garments that in shape she seemed rather like a ball  she was about forty round the waist  there was a good deal going on in the baby walk where maimie arrived in time to see a magnolia and a persian lilac step over the railing and set off for a smart walk  they moved in a jerky sort of way certainly but that was because they used crutches  an elderberry hobbled across the walk and stood chatting with some young quinces and they all had crutches  the crutches were the sticks that are tied to young trees and shrubs  they were quite familiar objects to maimie but she had never known what they were for until tonight  illustration there was a good deal going on in the baby walk  she peeped up the walk and saw her first fairy  he was a street boy fairy who was running up the walk closing the weeping trees  the way he did it was this he pressed a spring in the trunks and they shut like umbrellas deluging the little plants beneath with snow  o you naughty naughty child maimie cried indignantly for she knew what it was to have a dripping umbrella about your ears  fortunately the mischievous fellow was out of earshot but a chrysanthemum heard her and said so pointedly hoitytoity what is this that she had to come out and show herself  then the whole vegetable kingdom was rather puzzled what to do  illustration an afternoon when the gardens were white with snow  of course it is no affair of ours a spindletree said after they had whispered together but you know quite well you ought not to be here and perhaps our duty is to report you to the fairies what do you think yourself  i think you should not maimie replied which so perplexed them that they said petulantly there was no arguing with her  i wouldnt ask it of you she assured them if i thought it was wrong and of course after this they could not well carry tales  they then said welladay and such is life for they can be frightfully sarcastic but she felt sorry for those of them who had no crutches and she said goodnaturedly before i go to the fairies ball i should like to take you for a walk one at a time you can lean on me you know  at this they clapped their hands and she escorted them up the baby walk and back again one at a time putting an arm or a finger round the very frail setting their leg right when it got too ridiculous and treating the foreign ones quite as courteously as the english though she could not understand a word they said  they behaved well on the whole though some whimpered that she had not taken them as far as she took nancy or grace or dorothy and others jagged her but it was quite unintentional and she was too much of a lady to cry out  so much walking tired her and she was anxious to be off to the ball but she no longer felt afraid  the reason she felt no more fear was that it was now nighttime and in the dark you remember maimie was always rather strange  they were now loth to let her go for if the fairies see you they warned her they will mischief youstab you to death or compel you to nurse their children or turn you into something tedious like an evergreen oak  as they said this they looked with affected pity at an evergreen oak for in winter they are very envious of the evergreens  oh la replied the oak bitingly how deliciously cosy it is to stand here buttoned to the neck and watch you poor naked creatures shivering  this made them sulky though they had really brought it on themselves and they drew for maimie a very gloomy picture of the perils that would face her if she insisted on going to the ball  illustration she ran to st govors well and hid  she learned from a purple filbert that the court was not in its usual good temper at present the cause being the tantalising heart of the duke of christmas daisies  he was an oriental fairy very poorly of a dreadful complaint namely inability to love and though he had tried many ladies in many lands he could not fall in love with one of them queen mab who rules in the gardens had been confident that her girls would bewitch him but alas his heart the doctor said remained cold this rather irritating doctor who was his private physician felt the dukes heart immediately after any lady was presented and then always shook his bald head and murmured cold quite cold  naturally queen mab felt disgraced and first she tried the effect of ordering the court into tears for nine minutes and then she blamed the cupids and decreed that they should wear fools caps until they thawed the dukes frozen heart  how i should love to see the cupids in their dear little fools caps maimie cried and away she ran to look for them very recklessly for the cupids hate to be laughed at  it is always easy to discover where a fairies ball is being held as ribbons are stretched between it and all the populous parts of the gardens on which those invited may walk to the dance without wetting their pumps  this night the ribbons were red and looked very pretty on the snow  illustration she escorted them up the baby walk and back again  maimie walked alongside one of them for some distance without meeting anybody but at last she saw a fairy cavalcade approaching  to her surprise they seemed to be returning from the ball and she had just time to hide from them by bending her knees and holding out her arms and pretending to be a garden chair  there were six horsemen in front and six behind in the middle walked a prim lady wearing a long train held up by two pages and on the train as if it were a couch reclined a lovely girl for in this way do aristocratic fairies travel about she was dressed in golden rain but the most enviable part of her was her neck which was blue in colour and of a velvet texture and of course showed off her diamond necklace as no white throat could have glorified it  the highborn fairies obtain this admired effect by pricking their skin which lets the blue blood come through and dye them and you cannot imagine anything so dazzling unless you have seen the ladies busts in the jewellers windows  maimie also noticed that the whole cavalcade seemed to be in a passion tilting their noses higher than it can be safe for even fairies to tilt them and she concluded that this must be another case in which the doctor had said cold quite cold  illustration an elderberry hobbled across the walk and stood chatting with some young quinces  well she followed the ribbon to a place where it became a bridge over a dry puddle into which another fairy had fallen and been unable to climb out  at first this little damsel was afraid of maimie who most kindly went to her aid but soon she sat in her hand chatting gaily and explaining that her name was brownie and that though only a poor street singer she was on her way to the ball to see if the duke would have her  of course she said i am rather plain and this made maimie uncomfortable for indeed the simple little creature was almost quite plain for a fairy  it was difficult to know what to reply  i see you think i have no chance brownie said falteringly  i dont say that maimie answered politely of course your face is just a tiny bit homely but  really it was quite awkward for her  fortunately she remembered about her father and the bazaar  he had gone to a fashionable bazaar where all the most beautiful ladies in london were on view for half a crown the second day but on his return home instead of being dissatisfied with maimies mother he had said you cant think my dear what a relief it is to see a homely face again  maimie repeated this story and it fortified brownie tremendously indeed she had no longer the slightest doubt that the duke would choose her  so she scudded away up the ribbon calling out to maimie not to follow lest the queen should mischief her  but maimies curiosity tugged her forward and presently at the seven spanish chestnuts she saw a wonderful light  she crept forward until she was quite near it and then she peeped from behind a tree  illustration a chrysanthemum heard her and said pointedly hoitytoity what is this  the light which was as high as your head above the ground was composed of myriads of glowworms all holding on to each other and so forming a dazzling canopy over the fairy ring  there were thousands of little people looking on but they were in shadow and drab in colour compared to the glorious creatures within that luminous circle who were so bewilderingly bright that maimie had to wink hard all the time she looked at them  it was amazing and even irritating to her that the duke of christmas daisies should be able to keep out of love for a moment yet out of love his dusky grace still was you could see it by the shamed looks of the queen and court though they pretended not to care by the way darling ladies brought forward for his approval burst into tears as they were told to pass on and by his own most dreary face  maimie could also see the pompous doctor feeling the dukes heart and hear him give utterance to his parrot cry and she was particularly sorry for the cupids who stood in their fools caps in obscure places and every time they heard that cold quite cold bowed their disgraced little heads  she was disappointed not to see peter pan and i may as well tell you now why he was so late that night  it was because his boat had got wedged on the serpentine between fields of floating ice through which he had to break a perilous passage with his trusty paddle  the fairies had as yet scarcely missed him for they could not dance so heavy were their hearts  they forget all the steps when they are sad and remember them again when they are merry  david tells me that fairies never say we feel happy what they say is we feel dancey  well they were looking very undancey indeed when sudden laughter broke out among the onlookers caused by brownie who had just arrived and was insisting on her right to be presented to the duke  maimie craned forward eagerly to see how her friend fared though she had really no hope no one seemed to have the least hope except brownie herself who however was absolutely confident  she was led before his grace and the doctor putting a finger carelessly on the ducal heart which for convenience sake was reached by a little trapdoor in his diamond shirt had begun to say mechanically cold qui when he stopped abruptly  whats this he cried and first he shook the heart like a watch and then he put his ear to it  bless my soul cried the doctor and by this time of course the excitement among the spectators was tremendous fairies fainting right and left  illustration they warned her  everybody stared breathlessly at the duke who was very much startled and looked as if he would like to run away  good gracious me the doctor was heard muttering and now the heart was evidently on fire for he had to jerk his fingers away from it and put them in his mouth  the suspense was awful  then in a loud voice and bowing low my lord duke said the physician elatedly i have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love  you cant conceive the effect of it  brownie held out her arms to the duke and he flung himself into them the queen leapt into the arms of the lord chamberlain and the ladies of the court leapt into the arms of her gentlemen for it is etiquette to follow her example in everything  thus in a single moment about fifty marriages took place for if you leap into each others arms it is a fairy wedding  of course a clergyman has to be present  how the crowd cheered and leapt  trumpets brayed the moon came out and immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they were ribbons in a may dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy ring  most gladsome sight of all the cupids plucked the hated fools caps from their heads and cast them high in the air  and then maimie went and spoiled everything  she couldnt help it  she was crazy with delight over her little friends good fortune so she took several steps forward and cried in an ecstasy o brownie how splendid  everybody stood still the music ceased the lights went out and all in the time you may take to say oh dear  an awful sense of her peril came upon maimie too late she remembered that she was a lost child in a place where no human must be between the locking and the opening of the gates she heard the murmur of an angry multitude she saw a thousand swords flashing for her blood and she uttered a cry of terror and fled  how she ran and all the time her eyes were starting out of her head many times she lay down and then quickly jumped up and ran on again her little mind was so entangled in terrors that she no longer knew she was in the gardens  the one thing she was sure of was that she must never cease to run and she thought she was still running long after she had dropped in the figs and gone to sleep  she thought the snowflakes falling on her face were her mother kissing her goodnight she thought her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket and tried to pull it over her head  and when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept  but it was the fairies  i am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to mischief her  when she rushed away they had rent the air with such cries as slay her turn her into something extremely unpleasant and so on but the pursuit was delayed while they discussed who should march in front and this gave duchess brownie time to cast herself before the queen and demand a boon  every bride has a right to a boon and what she asked for was maimies life  anything except that replied queen mab sternly and all the fairies echoed anything except that  but when they learned how maimie had befriended brownie and so enabled her to attend the ball to their great glory and renown they gave three huzzas for the little human and set off like an army to thank her the court advancing in front and the canopy keeping step with it  they traced maimie easily by her footprints in the snow  but though they found her deep in snow in the figs it seemed impossible to thank maimie for they could not waken her  they went through the form of thanking herthat is to say the new king stood on her body and read her a long address of welcome but she heard not a word of it  they also cleared the snow off her but soon she was covered again and they saw she was in danger of perishing of cold  turn her into something that does not mind the cold seemed a good suggestion of the doctors but the only thing they could think of that does not mind cold was a snowflake  and it might melt the queen pointed out so that idea had to be given up  a magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot but though there were so many of them she was too heavy  by this time all the ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs but presently the cupids had a lovely idea  build a house round her they cried and at once everybody perceived that this was the thing to do in a moment a hundred fairy sawyers were among the branches architects were running round maimie measuring her a bricklayers yard sprang up at her feet seventyfive masons rushed up with the foundationstone and the queen laid it overseers were appointed to keep the boys off scaffoldings were run up the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and turninglathes and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were putting in the windows  illustration queen mab who rules in the gardens  the house was exactly the size of maimie and perfectly lovely  one of her arms was extended and this had bothered them for a second but they built a verandah round it leading to the front door  the windows were the size of a coloured picturebook and the door rather smaller but it would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof  the fairies as is their custom clapped their hands with delight over their cleverness and they were so madly in love with the little house that they could not bear to think they had finished it  so they gave it ever so many little extra touches and even then they added more extra touches  for instance two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney  now we fear it is quite finished they sighed  but no for another two ran up the ladder and tied some smoke to the chimney  that certainly finishes it they said reluctantly  not at all cried a glowworm if she were to wake without seeing a nightlight she might be frightened so i shall be her nightlight  wait one moment said a china merchant and i shall make you a saucer  now alas it was absolutely finished  oh dear no  gracious me cried a brass manufacturer theres no handle on the door and he put one on  an ironmonger added a scraper and an old lady ran up with a doormat carpenters arrived with a waterbutt and the painters insisted on painting it  finished at last  finished how can it be finished the plumber demanded scornfully before hot and cold are put in and he put in hot and cold  then an army of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and spades and seeds and bulbs and forcinghouses and soon they had a flowergarden to the right of the verandah and a vegetable garden to the left and roses and clematis on the walls of the house and in less time than five minutes all these dear things were in full bloom  illustration shook his bald head and murmured cold quite cold  oh how beautiful the little house was now  but it was at last finished true as true and they had to leave it and return to the dance  they all kissed their hands to it as they went away and the last to go was brownie  she stayed a moment behind the others to drop a pleasant dream down the chimney  all through the night the exquisite little house stood there in the figs taking care of maimie and she never knew  she slept until the dream was quite finished and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as morning was breaking from its egg and then she almost fell asleep again and then she called out tony for she thought she was at home in the nursery  as tony made no answer she sat up whereupon her head hit the roof and it opened like the lid of a box and to her bewilderment she saw all around her the kensington gardens lying deep in snow  as she was not in the nursery she wondered whether this was really herself so she pinched her cheeks and then she knew it was herself and this reminded her that she was in the middle of a great adventure  she remembered now everything that had happened to her from the closing of the gates up to her running away from the fairies but how ever she asked herself had she got into this funny place  she stepped out by the roof right over the garden and then she saw the dear house in which she had passed the night  it so entranced her that she could think of nothing else  o you darling  o you sweet  o you love she cried  perhaps a human voice frightened the little house or maybe it now knew that its work was done for no sooner had maimie spoken than it began to grow smaller it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it was shrinking yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now  it always remained as complete as ever but it became smaller and smaller and the garden dwindled at the same time and the snow crept closer lapping house and garden up  now the house was the size of a little dogs kennel and now of a noahs ark but still you could see the smoke and the doorhandle and the roses on the wall every one complete  the glowworm light was waning too but it was still there darling loveliest dont go maimie cried falling on her knees for the little house was now the size of a reel of thread but still quite complete  but as she stretched out her arms imploringly the snow crept up on all sides until it met itself and where the little house had been was now one unbroken expanse of snow  illustration fairies never say we feel happy what they say is we feel dancey  maimie stamped her foot naughtily and was putting her fingers to her eyes when she heard a kind voice say dont cry pretty human dont cry and then she turned round and saw a beautiful little naked boy regarding her wistfully  she knew at once that he must be peter pan  illustration tailpiece to the little house     illustration headpiece to peters goat     vi  peters goat  maimie felt quite shy but peter knew not what shy was  i hope you have had a good night he said earnestly  thank you she replied i was so cosy and warm  but youand she looked at his nakedness awkwardlydont you feel the least bit cold  now cold was another word peter had forgotten so he answered i think not but i may be wrong you see i am rather ignorant  i am not exactly a boy solomon says i am a betwixtandbetween  so that is what it is called said maimie thoughtfully  thats not my name he explained my name is peter pan  yes of course she said i know everybody knows  you cant think how pleased peter was to learn that all the people outside the gates knew about him  he begged maimie to tell him what they knew and what they said and she did so  they were sitting by this time on a fallen tree peter had cleared off the snow for maimie but he sat on a snowy bit himself  squeeze closer maimie said  what is that he asked and she showed him and then he did it  they talked together and he found that people knew a great deal about him but not everything not that he had gone back to his mother and been barred out for instance and he said nothing of this to maimie for it still humiliated him  do they know that i play games exactly like real boys he asked very proudly  o maimie please tell them  but when he revealed how he played by sailing his hoop on the round pond and so on she was simply horrified  all your ways of playing she said with her big eyes on him are quite quite wrong and not in the least like how boys play  poor peter uttered a little moan at this and he cried for the first time for i know not how long  maimie was extremely sorry for him and lent him her handkerchief but he didnt know in the least what to do with it so she showed him that is to say she wiped her eyes and then gave it back to him saying now you do it but instead of wiping his own eyes he wiped hers and she thought it best to pretend that this was what she had meant  illustration looking very undancey indeed  she said out of pity for him i shall give you a kiss if you like but though he once knew he had long forgotten what kisses are and he replied thank you and held out his hand thinking she had offered to put something into it  this was a great shock to her but she felt she could not explain without shaming him so with charming delicacy she gave peter a thimble which happened to be in her pocket and pretended that it was a kiss  poor little boy he quite believed her and to this day he wears it on his finger though there can be scarcely any one who needs a thimble so little  you see though still a tiny child it was really years and years since he had seen his mother and i dare say the baby who had supplanted him was now a man with whiskers  but you must not think that peter pan was a boy to pity rather than to admire if maimie began by thinking this she soon found she was very much mistaken  her eyes glistened with admiration when he told her of his adventures especially of how he went to and fro between the island and the gardens in the thrushs nest  how romantic maimie exclaimed but this was another unknown word and he hung his head thinking she was despising him  i suppose tony would not have done that he said very humbly  never never she answered with conviction he would have been afraid  what is afraid asked peter longingly  he thought it must be some splendid thing  i do wish you would teach me how to be afraid maimie he said  i believe no one could teach that to you she answered adoringly but peter thought she meant that he was stupid  she had told him about tony and of the wicked thing she did in the dark to frighten him she knew quite well that it was wicked but peter misunderstood her meaning and said oh how i wish i was as brave as tony  it quite irritated her  you are twenty thousand times braver than tony she said you are ever so much the bravest boy i ever knew  he could scarcely believe she meant it but when he did believe he screamed with joy  and if you want very much to give me a kiss maimie said you can do it  very reluctantly peter began to take the thimble off his finger  he thought she wanted it back  i dont mean a kiss she said hurriedly i mean a thimble  whats that peter asked  its like this she said and kissed him  i should love to give you a thimble peter said gravely so he gave her one  he gave her quite a number of thimbles and then a delightful idea came into his head  maimie he said will you marry me  illustration my lord duke said the physician elatedly i have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love  now strange to tell the same idea had come at exactly the same time into maimies head  i should like to she answered but will there be room in your boat for two  if you squeeze close he said eagerly  perhaps the birds would be angry  he assured her that the birds would love to have her though i am not so certain of it myself  also that there were very few birds in winter  of course they might want your clothes he had to admit rather falteringly  she was somewhat indignant at this  they are always thinking of their nests he said apologetically and there are some bits of youhe stroked the fur on her pelissethat would excite them very much  they shant have my fur she said sharply  no he said still fondling it however no  o maimie he said rapturously do you know why i love you  it is because you are like a beautiful nest  somehow this made her uneasy  i think you are speaking more like a bird than a boy now she said holding back and indeed he was even looking rather like a bird  after all she said you are only a betwixtandbetween  but it hurt him so much that she immediately added it must be a delicious thing to be  come and be one then dear maimie he implored her and they set off for the boat for it was now very near opengate time  and you are not a bit like a nest he whispered to please her  but i think it is rather nice to be like one she said in a womans contradictory way  and peter dear though i cant give them my fur i wouldnt mind their building in it  fancy a nest in my neck with little spotty eggs in it  o peter how perfectly lovely  illustration building the house for maimie  but as they drew near the serpentine she shivered a little and said of course i shall go and see mother often quite often  it is not as if i was saying goodbye for ever to mother it is not in the least like that  oh no answered peter but in his heart he knew it was very like that and he would have told her so had he not been in a quaking fear of losing her  he was so fond of her he felt he could not live without her  she will forget her mother in time and be happy with me he kept saying to himself and he hurried her on giving her thimbles by the way  but even when she had seen the boat and exclaimed ecstatically over its loveliness she still talked tremblingly about her mother  you know quite well peter dont you she said that i wouldnt come unless i knew for certain i could go back to mother whenever i want to  peter say it  he said it but he could no longer look her in the face  if you are sure your mother will always want you he added rather sourly  the idea of mothers not always wanting me maimie cried and her face glistened  if she doesnt bar you out said peter huskily  the door replied maimie will always always be open and mother will always be waiting at it for me  then said peter not without grimness step in if you feel so sure of her and he helped maimie into the thrushs nest  but why dont you look at me she asked taking him by the arm  peter tried hard not to look he tried to push off then he gave a great gulp and jumped ashore and sat down miserably in the snow  she went to him  what is it dear dear peter she said wondering  o maimie he cried it isnt fair to take you with me if you think you can go back  your motherhe gulped againyou dont know them as well as i do  and then he told her the woeful story of how he had been barred out and she gasped all the time  but my mother she said my mother  yes she would said peter they are all the same  i dare say she is looking for another one already  maimie said aghast i cant believe it  you see when you went away your mother had none but my mother has tony and surely they are satisfied when they have one  peter replied bitterly you should see the letters solomon gets from ladies who have six  just then they heard a grating creak followed by creak creak all round the gardens  it was the opening of the gates and peter jumped nervously into his boat  he knew maimie would not come with him now and he was trying bravely not to cry  but maimie was sobbing painfully  if i should be too late she said in agony o peter if she has got another one already  again he sprang ashore as if she had called him back  i shall come and look for you tonight he said squeezing close but if you hurry away i think you will be in time  then he pressed a last thimble on her sweet little mouth and covered his face with his hands so that he might not see her go  dear peter she cried  dear maimie cried the tragic boy  she leapt into his arms so that it was a sort of fairy wedding and then she hurried away  oh how she hastened to the gates  peter you may be sure was back in the gardens that night as soon as lockout sounded but he found no maimie and so he knew she had been in time for long he hoped that some night she would come back to him often he thought he saw her waiting for him by the shore of the serpentine as his bark drew to land but maimie never went back  she wanted to but she was afraid that if she saw her dear betwixtandbetween again she would linger with him too long and besides the ayah now kept a sharp eye on her  but she often talked lovingly of peter and she knitted a kettleholder for him and one day when she was wondering what easter present he would like her mother made a suggestion  illustration if the bad ones among the fairies happen to be out missing from book  nothing she said thoughtfully would be so useful to him as a goat  he could ride on it cried maimie and play on his pipe at the same time  then her mother asked wont you give him your goat the one you frighten tony with at night  but it isnt a real goat maimie said  it seems very real to tony replied her mother  it seems frightfully real to me too maimie admitted but how could i give it to peter  her mother knew a way and next day accompanied by tony who was really quite a nice boy though of course he could not compare they went to the gardens and maimie stood alone within a fairy ring and then her mother who was a rather gifted lady said    my daughter tell me if you can   what have you got for peter pan  to which maimie replied    i have a goat for him to ride   observe me cast it far and wide  she then flung her arms about as if she were sowing seed and turned round three times  next tony said    if p doth find it waiting here   wilt neer again make me to fear  and maimie answered    by dark or light i fondly swear   never to see goats anywhere   she also left a letter to peter in a likely place explaining what she had done and begging him to ask the fairies to turn the goat into one convenient for riding on  well it all happened just as she hoped for peter found the letter and of course nothing could be easier for the fairies than to turn the goat into a real one and so that is how peter got the goat on which he now rides round the gardens every night playing sublimely on his pipe  and maimie kept her promise and never frightened tony with a goat again though i have heard that she created another animal  until she was quite a big girl she continued to leave presents for peter in the gardens with letters explaining how humans play with them and she is not the only one who has done this  david does it for instance and he and i know the likeliest place for leaving them in and we shall tell you if you like but for mercys sake dont ask us before porthos for he is so fond of toys that were he to find out the place he would take every one of them  illustration they will certainly mischief you missing from book  though peter still remembers maimie he is become as gay as ever and often in sheer happiness he jumps off his goat and lies kicking merrily on the grass  oh he has a joyful time  but he has still a vague memory that he was a human once and it makes him especially kind to the houseswallows when they visit the island for houseswallows are the spirits of little children who have died  they always build in the eaves of the houses where they lived when they were humans and sometimes they try to fly in at a nursery window and perhaps that is why peter loves them best of all the birds  and the little house  every lawful night that is to say every night except ball nights the fairies now build the little house lest there should be a human child lost in the gardens and peter rides the marches looking for lost ones and if he finds them he carries them on his goat to the little house and when they wake up they are in it and when they step out they see it  the fairies build the house merely because it is so pretty but peter rides round in memory of maimie and because he still loves to do just as he believes real boys would do  but you must not think that because somewhere among the trees the little house is twinkling it is a safe thing to remain in the gardens after lockout time  if the bad ones among the fairies happen to be out that night they will certainly mischief you and even though they are not you may perish of cold and dark before peter pan comes round he has been too late several times and when he sees he is too late he runs back to the thrushs nest for his paddle of which maimie had told him the true use and he digs a grave for the child and erects a little tombstone and carves the poor things initials on it  he does this at once because he thinks it is what real boys would do and you must have noticed the little stones and that there are always two together  he puts them in twos because they seem less lonely  i think that quite the most touching sight in the gardens is the two tombstones of walter stephen matthews and phoebe phelps  they stand together at the spot where the parish of westminster st marys is said to meet the parish of paddington  here peter found the two babes who had fallen unnoticed from their perambulators phoebe aged thirteen months and walter probably still younger for peter seems to have felt a delicacy about putting any age on his stone  they lie side by side and the simple inscriptions read                     w              13a         st m    and    p p                         1841                 david sometimes places white flowers on these two innocent graves  illustration i think that quite the most touching sight in the gardens is the two tombstones of walter stephen matthews and phoebe phelps  but how strange for parents when they hurry into the gardens at the opening of the gates looking for their lost one to find the sweetest little tombstone instead  i do hope that peter is not too ready with his spade  it is all rather sad    illustration tailpiece to peters goat
